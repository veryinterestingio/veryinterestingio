			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is that in theory we could already build something like a generation ship capable of leaving the solar system. As a last option for survival, we already have that. Even if we never find any other tech option, the technology for that type of interstellar travel is already conceivable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what we as a species always seem to forget when considering colonization of another planet is that it's going to be EXTREMELY difficult to find another &quot;Earth&quot;. We are specifically adapted to this environment...billions of years spent modifying ourselves to exist HERE.</p>
<p>The chances of finding another environment so close to our current one so that we could live there as we do here is ridiculously remote, never mind finding one close enough for us to even get to in the first place.</p>
<p>Obviously, with the size and variety of the Universe to consider it's not impossible to find an exact copy of Earth, but the infinite variations available and the indescribably vast distances between them present us with a tall order.</p>
<p>It'd be more feasible to simply become a spacefaring race and take our environment with us instead of trying to find a suitable substitute to our home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given that 1960s America made it to the moon, I really have a hard time believing that 2500s humans won’t be arbitrarily good at spaceflight — and that’s just a 500 year difference. 5 billion is thousands of species-lifetimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But spaceflight might have a hard line. </p>
<p>The same way that people have broken the four minute mile, but won't ever break the 1 minute mile. At least not people as we know them. There's no amount of genetics or training that will get you over that hump.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe we will never invent FTL or near-light-speed travel, but if we're talking about billions of years even sending conventionally propelled spaceships with colonists on a multi-century trip to nearby stars is more than feasible. Hell we could probably do it today if we were willing to commit the insane resources it would require.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bear in mind that science paradigm might change and definitely will in 5 billion years. New discoveries will be made, new theories will be born, etc. By that time, if a scientist could travel from the past (let's say our era) I bet he/she would not understand the futuristic science.</p>
<p>Math helps to understand our universe as it is currently, but it's also not perfect and it has flaws. A principle of the scientific method is to understand paradigms change. So it's feasible to say that what we may take for granted now, could be totally different in such a timespan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>first it's not 6 billiion, in about 600-700 million years the suns output will increase by 10% making photosontesis imposible so basically the end of all plant life(save a few bacteria).</p>
<p>Still 600 million years is still A LONG time and if we haven't expanded beyond the solar system at that point we might aswell bite the dust cause we deserve it.</p></div>		</li>
