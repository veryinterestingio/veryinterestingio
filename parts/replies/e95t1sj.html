			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, so you are handling the voter's ballots? Doesn't that open up an avenue for abuse? In CA, the absentee ballots are sealed in an envelope and they can't be opened at the polling place.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious as to how this works in a state such as Virginia. If you vote in person there you receive no physical ballots. You have machines with the candidates names appearing on a screen, you touch the name of the candidate you are voting for and then press a separate button to confirm your votes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm, Michigan here. I was told you’re not allowed to look at the ballots today so how exactly are you able to feed them?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Here’s the process from the state Secretary of State site. The process is designed to help maintain secrecy so nobody is actually looking at ballots. When I did this a few years ago I remember being able to pile the ballots so you barely could see anything, and there isn’t enough time to look at anything because of the sheer amount of work to do on Election Day. If we were able to see anything, we had no way to connect a ballot to a person to know who voted what because the blank inside envelopes get separated from the name on the outside envelope. </p></div>		</li>
