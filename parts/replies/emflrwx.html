			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes they will literally use an artificial ant farm to film. Look at the AntsCanada channel on Youtube to see how sophisticated these can be, with almost any species of ant. I don't personally think there is anything wrong with doing that. </p>
<p>As a documentary producer, if I needed to film, say, bullet ants then I'd maximize my time and budget by hiring one crew to film them on the ground in the forest in their natural habitat, and pay the AntsCanada guy for a day in his ant room to get the shots of the interior of the nest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes the BBC often use reconstructed scenes, essentially artificial sets. They were especially used during the BBC life of insects documentary and Life in the Undergrowth.</p>
<p>There was a bit of a hoo-ha actually a few years ago in the UK when it was found out the BBC had used a polar bear enclosure at a zoo to film extra scenes of the inside of a den with cubs in. The public were under the illusion it was all filmed in the wild, even though it would be practically impossible to do that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel this too. A lot of their magic was lost when I discovered this. Itâ€™s still great but now every time I have doubts. Itâ€™s not the same to me to see a footage from wildlife and from a zoo or a reconstructed scenery. I can build it myself and reproduce exactly what they shoot if Iâ€™d like, the essence of wildlife photographers/documentary though is being able to capture unique live scenes that if another one tries to shoot at theyâ€™ll come out different. I donâ€™t know if you understand what Iâ€™m saying, itâ€™s pretty subtle and nonsense when I think about it from the outside but I feel it this way no matter what.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny you should mention AntsCanada, a video of his popped up on my YouTube recommendations and I've spent the last 3 hours or so trawling through his profiles. The Amazon Rain forest habitat with a miniature flowing river was was incredible!</p></div>		</li>
