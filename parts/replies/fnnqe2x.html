			<div class="markdown"><p>Its because the predominant use for the research is in military applications and with hypersonic missiles nearing usable states the countries controlling these scientists are locking down their research and findings on national security concerns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to the other responses, hypersonic flight will only really be useful to the military for a LONG time. Not only does it not make any economic sense for private companies to explore it yet (besides today's standard uses of rockets), but to get anywhere near the point where a private company could profit off of hypersonic flight (especially air-breathing) we have to get the simpler things down first. </p>
<p>Which means it's only inevitable that the military will be the first to push hypersonics with weapons because they are missiles that are unmanned and just (mostly) go straight. Then it will be vehicles that try to evade/deal with these hypersonic weapons, then other military functions. Only then can hypersonics even begin to be feasible for private use/commercialization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that a lot of military research occurs in academic laboratories, just funded by military money. The line between the two is often more blurred than it seems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At hypersonic speeds, thereâ€™s no defense for an incoming ICBM. Response time is also drastically reduced. The US and other countries like Russia are trying to keep the tech as quiet as possible (except for when Putin showed a 3D simulation of one hitting Florida right where Mar-a-Lago is).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that ICBMs are already hypersonic and much faster than any hypersonic glider in development. So military advantages are somewhat overhyped, as when you start considering attacking Florida or carrier battle groups, things go nuclear really fast, and for that good old ICBMs are much more versatile.</p></div>		</li>
