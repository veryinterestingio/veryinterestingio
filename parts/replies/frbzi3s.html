			<div class="markdown"><p>Me too! I’ve given lab tours to high school science students and the doughnut analogy is my go-to. </p>
<p>I use plain sugar-glazed as O, chocolate frosting as A, caramel frosting as B, chocolate/caramel swirl as AB, chopped nuts for Rh+, and rainbow sprinkles for the subgroups like Lutheran, Duffy, Kell, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Think of red cells as doughnuts. Sometimes they have rainbow sprinkles (A), sometimes they have chocolate sprinkles (B), sometimes they have both (AB), and sometimes they're just plain glazed (O). Sometimes they're jelly filled (+), sometimes they're not (-).</p>
<p>Doughnuts like to hang out together in the doughnut box, but they're very particular about what type of doughnuts they hang out with.</p>
<p>Plain glazed no filling doughnuts (O-), they're the really flexible ones. You can put one of these doughnuts in any box you want. You have a box full of sprinkle jelly doughnuts? Toss a plain one in there, it'll mix in just fine.</p>
<p>Double sprinkle jelly doughnuts (AB+), they're the busiest ones. If you toss one of those in a box of plain (O-), you're gonna get a mess everywhere.</p>
<p>Who knew doughnuts were so picky!</p></div>		</li>
