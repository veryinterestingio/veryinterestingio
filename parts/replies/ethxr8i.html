<p>If green isn't related to the blue eye mutation, why is it (afaik) largely limited to Europeans or people with European admixture?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any eye color other than brown isn’t produced by pigments of those colors. Neither blue nor green pigments exist in the human iris or ocular fluid. Colored eyes happen due a process similar to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering" target="_blank">Rayleigh Scattering </a> in which most of the light that enters the iris is absorbed by a layer of brown pigments behind the iris, what is reflected back is scattered and only the blue light makes it back out.
Green, gray, and other variants are a result of different melanin concentrations in this layer, different patterns in the fibrous tissues of the iris, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it is not impossible that the exact same mutation will occur twice it is highly unlikely especially given the brief amount of time humans have been around for (At least in the scales of evolutionary time). So because blue eyed people all share the exact same OCA2 mutation it is <em>highly likely</em> they all share a single common ancestor who developed blue eyes!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats crazy to think about because in Northern/western Europe almost everyone (even if they have brown eyes themselves) has a grandparent or great grandparent who had blue eyes, making them a descendent of the original blue eyed dude too, so we're all related.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had my mind blown a while back when someone showed me the pretty basic maths which shows that we have far too many ancestors for them to all be different people - and that everyone alive 1000 years ago in Europe is overwhelmingly likely to be one of my ancestors if they have any surviving descendents at all.</p>
<p>Try reading  <a href="https://www.math.arizona.edu/~bhallmark/TMRCA/chang.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.math.arizona.edu/\~bhallmark/TMRCA/chang.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.math.arizona.edu/\~bhallmark/TMRCA/chang.pdf</a></a>  if you have  a head for maths.</p>
<p>It is one of those things which should have been obvious to me but I never thought about it. However having realised how the numbers work the question is only of the barriers to movement and pairing up which might prevent us from having such recent common ancestors. Given that we know that human populations have moved around Europe a lot in the past couple of thousand years it seems rather predictable that we would all share some common genes.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>So their grand kids I presume had blue eyes? Or some down the road kids, because it is a recessive trait, I assume (unless there was encouraged inbreeding) that blue eyes just started popping up in the population generations after the mutation. Or am I missing something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While we know the blue eye genotype arose ~10,000 years ago the time at which the phenotype (actually having blue eyes) arose is another kettle of fish entirely!  It likely spread as a product of inbreeding or duplication of the gene on one chromosome with the duplicate then moving to the other chromosome during crossing over.</p>
<p>The blue eye gene itself is actually a mutation to the switch which turns on melanin production in the eye - which normally makes them brown. The mutation just stops the switch working so if it replaces the switch on another chromosome the mutation can spread faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first person to develop this mutation wouldn't have been the first to have blue eyes since they would need two copies of the mutant allele. Then it would either take a lot of generations for the mutant allele to distribute through the population (or some inbreeding) to end up with the first actual blue eyed person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Each person receives one allele from each of their parents. Because if this fact, if one parent gives you a blue allele and one a brown you will have brown eyes but can pass the blue allele on.</p>
<p>Only in people with two blue alleles will their eyes be blue.</p>
<p>So if it is from a single ancestor them it probably took a few generations before enough blue alleles were around for another blue eyed child.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When we determine where things have evolved we normally use either maximum parsimony (find the solution which requires the least changes) or maximum likelihood (find the solution which is the most likely given a dataset). The latter of these two takes in to account that over longer periods of time change becomes more likely.</p>
<p>With regards to numerically measuring confidence it depends on the method used. With parsimony you can produce numerous solutions and select for the parts of each which occur in more than 95% of them but that doesn’t strictly demonstrate confidence and solutions can be wrong. Maximum likelihood on the other hand revolves around hardcore statistical analyses. There’s numerous tests which can be used to determine maximum likelihood including those which revolve around Bayes’ formula or the Markov chain (hardcore maths) each of these methods outputs a probability and confidence interval but unfortunately I just use the tests I don’t make them so I can’t answer your question fully! </p>
<p>TLDR; yes there is but you’ll need to ask an evolutionary biologist with a history in mathematics or a statistician to find out how it’s calculated!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question.</p>
<p>Did that person - Blue Eyed Patient Zero - have blue eyes?</p>
<p>Or was it recessive and took a few generations until it expressed itself perhaps through inbreeding?</p>
<p>I'm wondering if one single person suddenly had blue eyes and then his or her kids, or if blue eyes just started appearing in the region among someone's descendants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blue eyes is a recessive gene so the first person with the gene wouldn't have blue eyes, and neither would any of their children. The first person with blue eyes would have to be someone whose both parents was descendents of the person having the mutation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>very unlikely because in order to have blue eyes you need two blue alleles. The Patient Zero most likely had brown eyes, because the mutation only affected one allele. Following that logic their children also had brown eyes (either 2 brown alleles - so pure brown, or 1 blue 1 brown allele - mixed brown), however the Patient Zero's 'mixed brown' grandchildren (only if they procreated with their 'mixed brown' siblings and half-siblings) would be the first generation where blue eyes had a chance to manifest - the chance being 25%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder which is more likely, that the grandchildren (or subsequent generation) would have knowingly mated with their own relatives to cause the trait to become visible, or that the recessive trait survived long enough to come out many generations later when the two who carried the trait were very distant &quot;cousins&quot; (and likely would not have even known they were related)?</p></div>		</li>
