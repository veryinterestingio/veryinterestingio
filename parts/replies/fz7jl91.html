<p>Now, I’m not recommending just taking Vitamin D or C for a cancer that’s been identified/diagnosed in hopes that it just goes away; get your options discussed.</p>
<p>This, among other reasons.. often financial.. is why we don’t do “full body scans” on healthy people. There’s a lot of evidence of minor tumors or growths that’d be more hassle to medically address than just see if they go away on their own.  But if you <em>know</em> they exist it creates a lot of medical/financial controversy for doctors and patients.</p></div>		</li>
