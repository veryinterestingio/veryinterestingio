			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s the generation of network infrastructure , it takes about 10 years to r&amp;d and standardize then rollout a new generation, ie 3g is 2000, 4g is 2010, now 5g is 2020.  Operators stop spending money on old infrustructure and start winding down its capacity, to move those frequencies over to the new g that has better more efficient ways to use that frequency spectrum</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're just architecture and technology. 3G, 4G, and 5G are just names for them, much like how game consoles go from PS1, PS2, PS3, etc. Each new version comes with better tech, infrastructure, and programming.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm so happy Microsoft isn't naming our broadband cellular network technology. Instead of 3G, 4G, 5G, we'd have 3G, 360G, G1 etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice observation This is interesting the PlayStation also has same life time (10 year cycle) ps5 came out last year and network infrastructure is  we on 5g... this a great analogy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually does stand for a specific spec.  This is so that you don't have one company just calling their stuff 5g because marketing.</p>
<p>1g: Analog signals</p>
<p>2g: Digital signals with SMS/MMS and Data up to 64kbps</p>
<p>3g: Bandwidth of at least 144kbps.</p>
<p>4g: Bandwidth of at least 2mbps (more generically: speeds that enable the use of multimedia, video, etc)</p>
<p>5g: More focused on latency in order to make mobile a primary internet source.  Increases the peak speeds available up to 10gbs.  But 5g and 4g overlap greatly on usable speed range.</p>
<p>There are more to the standards, but these are the basics of what a customer cares about.</p></div>		</li>
