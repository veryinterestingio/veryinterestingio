			<div class="markdown"><p>I started using lanolin after having so many issues with different brands (Eos actually caused me a huge delayed allergic reaction after about a month). The lanolin is made for breastfeeding chapping and I can’t even tell you how much better it works as it heals the lips and you can start using less and less after they progress. I have had the same small tube for 5 years</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find I need chap stick more when I’m eating, drinking, and talking a lot (probably because I wipe my mouth or rub my lips together). So put on a nice thick layer before the exam and avoid opening your mouth during the exam. Hopefully it stays in place! Good luck with the exam 👍🏻</p></div>		</li>
