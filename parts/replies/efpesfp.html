			<div class="markdown"><p>Radiation is a different thing. Most <em>bombs</em> do produce some radioactivity, but most of the material is used in creating the explosion. [edit: it's not a full conversion, some stuff does get left]. The sites of the detonations are usually safe to walk around on within months to years, though for a few decades some radioactive material may be found at dangerous levels in some plants, water, and animals that eat affected plants. Bikini Atoll was apparently found 'clean' in the 1980s, clean enough to walk around and live on. This was only 40 years after the two-dozen tests done there; though some wells, trees, and crabs had enough radioactivity to require the residents to be dependent on food and water being supplied from outside. Needless to say, they opted to re-evacuate rather than become entirely dependent on the essentials being shipped in. Hiroshima and Nagasaki experienced a much smaller bomb, and have been more or less continuously inhabited.</p>
<p>Nuclear power plants don't explode, but they also don't use up the material completely-- it only gets used as long as the radioactivity can produce high levels of heat, then the fuel has to be disposed of even though it is still highly radioactive for centuries or millenia. This is why fuel disposal is such a hot topic. Chernobyl is STILL uninhabitable, for example. Today you can only visit the town for a few days, much less live there; and the power plant itself is still &quot;hot&quot; enough to make extended on-site work dangerous.</p>
<p>If you were to go to the test sites outside Vegas you should be fine, provided you didn't cook your dinner from locally foraged plants and rabbits, over a fire fueled with locally foraged wood.</p>
<p>Following a nuclear war, the survivors from the major cities [the main targets] would wander to smaller, outlying cities and make friends with the small town locals. They would forage and hunt what they could, grow what they could [though with limited success], and try to wait out the disaster until the atmosphere cleared enough for normal life to resume. Today, there is a fair amount of artificial light available [thank the war on drugs for that], and if light bulb factories survived the war their grow lights would be in high demand! We would see warehouse upon warehouse sprout up to produce food, and chances are more people would survive a nuclear war in 2020 than would have a nuclear war in 1956. It would still qualify as THE single largest preventable disaster ever, though, and not by a close margin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The one thing I would correct in this: your writeup makes it sound like the <em>fuel</em> of the bomb is the radioactive parts of significance. It's the <em>byproducts</em> that are. </p>
<p>When you split uranium or plutonium, you get two lumpy half-atoms known as fission products. These are the really problematic part about fallout because their radiation can vary a lot, and they are often similar to other chemicals that living organisms like to use as parts of their bodies. So strontium-90 has a half-life of ~30 years, which is relatively long from a human lifetime point of view, but short from a &quot;how radioactive is this?&quot; point of view (it is pretty radioactive). Chemically it behaves similar to calcium, which your body <em>loves</em> and uses for making bones. So strontium-90 in grass turns into strontium-90 in cows turn into strontium-90 in milk turns into strontium-90 in the bones of children hundreds of miles away. A little bit won't do anything, but after awhile if you start dusting large groups of people with increasing doses of fallout, you start to see an up-tick in bone cancers. </p>
<p>It is true that plutonium in particular is a toxic and radioactive fuel, and is a contaminant as well, but the real fallout fears are not un-used fuel but the remnants of the used fuel. </p>
<p>Separately I might note that while cities would be a target in many nuclear war scenarios, rural areas would be likely hit as well with contamination, if we are assuming a US-Russia exchange. Why? Because we keep our ICBMs in rural areas near the centers of the countries. That means a heavy dusting of your cropland with fallout.</p>
<p>The reason Hiroshima and Nagasaki did not suffer contamination is not just because of the size of the bomb but because of the height of burst. If you detonate a bomb high enough, the radioactive contamination on the ground becomes negligible (at least compared to the other effects). If they had been ground-bursts there would have been a major contamination problem. (Similarly those ICBMs aimed at our ICBM silos would be ground-bursts, to crack the silos — lots of fallout from that.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn't be safe for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The guards there would probably shoot you if you attempted to enter. Unsurprisingly, it's quite a restricted area.</li>
<li>Some areas are still quite contaminated. Not everywhere, of course, but some more than others. I have several colleagues who've been there for various research purposes and they were crawling around in the dirt in some areas and that's fine while in other places they'd stir up a bunch of plutonium dust or other fission products (which is considerably less fine).</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re fine. </p>
<p>The 1/2 life of a nuke (cesium is produced...forgot which one) is 6 days or so. There’s a lot of misconceptions of radiation, all radiation is bad being #1. </p>
<p>Radiation is all around you. In the walls of buildings, the air you breathe, the TV you watch, and (sometimes) the plate your food is on. </p>
<p>Don’t worry about it. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The key point is no. 2.</p>
<p>It is the ash from burning cities carried high into our atmosphere.</p>
<p>The bomb itself doesn't do much to change the climate. But, comparable to volcanic eruptions, fine particulate matter is carried into the stratosphere to stay there for months or years. This has a drastic effect on the amount of sunlight reaching the ground.</p>
<p>As nuclear bomb tests, even in the fifties where above ground tests were the standard, were carried out in remote areas without any material to burn, they produced very little of such dust. </p></div>		</li>
