			<div class="markdown"><p>That visualisation part is what I don't understand. How can you know what it is without &quot;seeing&quot; it? I can think of something and know I'm thinking of it, but is there something more than just knowing what you're thinking about?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve never thought about this. It really is difficult to pinpoint where the “location is”. If you have an inner voice when you read it’s kinda like that. It would be hard to explain how you “hear it” without your ears picking up signal. </p>
<p>As far as knowing what it is, I usually don’t visualize something unless I do it intentionally. Like hearing my voice in my head or thinking of what someone sounds like. It’s sorta like that. </p>
<p>It’s not as vivid as real life but right now I’m thinking of an apple I can “see” every part of it. Make it appear sliced, etc. but it’s not like a hologram in real life. Like I can imagine in my head what a new couch would look like in my living room. But if I went to my living room I wouldn’t be able to actually see a couch there if that makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know because I can see the objects in my mind and picture them there, I just can't physically see them (which I assume is normal). </p>
<p>Until someone asks a question like OP and it opens up a public discussion I guess most people don't really think about this stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this has proper shaken me up because I have a kind of backlog of images in my head that are just kind of somewhere at the back of my head. And if I think of someone in particular, it's almost like I can faintly see them in this back part of my head, but it's very different to actually seeing anything like in-real-life. is this normal, or is this aphantasia??</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you ever have intense flashes of light or sound? Intense to the point you know it happened, but don't believe it did.</p></div>		</li>
