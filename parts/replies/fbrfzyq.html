			<div class="markdown"><p>Here’s a slightly different explanation though, just for clarity in case you need some keywords to google if you’d like to learn more. </p>
<p>There is an enzyme in your body called cyclooxygenase or (Cox for short). This enzyme is responsible for converting a specific fatty acid (arachidonic acid) into a few of the molecules that <em>cause</em> inflammation. They’re called prostaglandins, and they cause fluid to leak from your blood vessel by tightening venules and loosening arterioles, and that’s what causes actual swelling, and a few specific prostaglandins serve to sensitize nerves to detect pain. </p>
<p>Ibuprofen stops Cox from converting fatty acids into prostaglandins. This is a simpler picture than all of inflammation, but it highlights ibuprofens role. </p>
<p>There are other molecules like histamine and bradykinin that are responsible for this reaction, but ibuprofen does not have a significant effect on their production or target.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In your opinion, is Mac (ibuprofen) better than Dennis (Paracetamol) to deal with a hang over? I've been told Mac is the better option as it is processed by the kidneys or something, where as Dennis is processed by the Liver, which is already very taxed after last nights game of CharDeeMacDennis.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Dennis, meanwhile, is fine with Charlie hanging out with Frank.  Instead, he finds Joey, who works in the Pain Processing Center and knocks him out, thus preventing you from feeling the pain from the inflammation that Charlie and Frank are causing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>NSAIDs and alcohol can increase the risk of GI bleed. They are also eliminated by the kidneys not broken down by then. The liver also metabolizes ibuprofen.
Acetaminophen is broken down by the liver. One of the “pieces” called NAPQI needs to be deactivated by an enzyme called glutathione. Ethanol reduces this enzyme and lowers the threshold for overdose. However, a one time dose will not be enough to OD. Plus the ethanol has to be in the system to compete for glutathione.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need to deplete your glutathione stores with chronic alcohol use for acetaminophen toxicity to be a serious concern. It's not an enzyme fyi, but an antioxidant used in the reaction to detoxify acetaminophen metabolism byproducts. It is also used to detoxify ethanol and you only have so much. Chronic heavy drinkers are the main group with this risk, your stores are usually fine after just a night or two of drinking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neither are ideal</p>
<p>Ibuprofen is considerably less toxic to the liver than paracetamol, but it is much more irritating the stomach and can cause bleeding</p>
<p>The best solution is to avoid taking more substances when hungover</p></div>		</li>
