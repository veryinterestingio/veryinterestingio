			<div class="markdown"><p>And the crew of the American navy ship the &quot;Pueblo&quot;, while being held captive by North Korea gave the middle finger in their group photo, convincing their captors that it was &quot;an American good luck sign&quot;.  When the truth was learned they were severely beaten for their act of defiance.</p>
<p>Their commander, Lloyd Bucher, when forced to write an apology praising North Korea wrote that they had so much admiration for their captors that &quot;we would like to paean the North Korean people and their leader.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;paean&quot; means to praise highly but it's pronounced &quot;pee on&quot;.  Bucher received another severe beating for that one.</p></div>		</li>
