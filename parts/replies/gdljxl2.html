			<div class="markdown"><p>Professional cook here, I can attest to the fact that restaurants do not do that. If your risotto needs 1 litre of broth/stock then you pour in half of it all at once, stir constantly until it's absorbed and then put it aside. When it's time to serve you just add what's necessary for the quantity you need to serve and that's that. The result is perfect every time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple of the places I worked at; we would cook it all the way, smooth it out on a sheet tray and put it in the walk in to be portioned out. Then bring it back to life in a saute pan. But we would absolutely sit there for 30 minutes when making it. We alternated stock and white wine though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean. You can't just add white wine with the stock. It has to be cooked first. That's why we deglaze with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what happens if I add all the liquid at once and just leave it as regular rice? I love risotto but the process makes me not do it too often...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have the answer for you! I love risotto and use a recipe that calls for only a couple of minutes of stirring right at the end, and is a very hands-off method. I love the recipe and use it heaps. <a href="https://cookieandkate.com/easy-brown-rice-risotto-with-mushrooms-and-fresh-oregano/" target="_blank">https://cookieandkate.com/easy-brown-rice-risotto-with-mushrooms-and-fresh-oregano/</a></p>
<p>The same site has recipes for roasted cauliflower risotto and roasted butternut squash risotto. All three are excellent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stirring it causes the grains to rub against each other and release bits of starch causing the creaminess. You might be able to add the liquid all at once but you shouldn’t skip the stirring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lately I've been adding the whole amout of stock, cooking for a little bit then chucking it in the oven at 200°C for 20 minutes and it come out perfect. Was shocked the first time I did it after slaving away at it using the traditional method.</p></div>		</li>
