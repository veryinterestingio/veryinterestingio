<p>There are multiple answers to this question depending on your level of education, however in the end it comes down to things we must accept, otherwise it's philosophy territory (we start asking why do they exist at all instead of how they work).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no known relationship between electric and gravitational forces. You might however want to look into Thomas Townsend Brown. He's an inventor from the 20th century that thought he discovered the relation between electric and gravitational forces. It has been disproved but it's interesting to read about nonetheless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The easy answer is that they simply have it as a fundamental property like they have a mass. It's just there like the speed of light or the Planck constant are just there.</p>
<p>If you go deeper then there is the Quantum Field Theory (QFT) that tries to see the world as a few fields whose excitations in the form of waves packets are particles. Then these fields interacts with each other through some laws and for example the electron field (the one responsible for electron) interacts with the electromagnetic field causing the other field to perceive an electromagnetic force if there is an electron. </p>
<p>But at that point you are far beyond high school level physics. It's like how gravitation is &quot;just there&quot; when you explain it with Newton and something much more complex when you go with Einstein.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Full disclosure: I actually have a degree in physics, and I still find it all frustrating. If we don't know why electric fields exist, then we really can't explain anything. It feels like we're saying that Thor causes the lightning, but in a lot more fine details.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>You can always ask &quot;Why?&quot; until we can't come up with an answer. That's true for every single scientific theory ever. And unless we can somehow reduce all theory ever to some kind of single primal axiom whose negation is automatically a contradiction, that's how it always will be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I myself was intrigued with such questions when studying high school physics in middle school, so I researched on the net and read popular science books. I finally understood Quantum Physics and related topics like General and Special Relativity, but lately in my second year in high school I've realized that they <strong><em>don't really solve anything</em></strong></p>
<p>The previous 'unquestionable laws' that govern the universe and are just there, like intrinsic properties, is just <em>replaced</em> by other, new laws of things like Quantum Mechanics. It's the same.
Previously, we're told that there is an electric field. There <em>just is</em>.
Now, we learn there are electromagnetic force fields and laws that govern these fields. They <em>just are.</em></p>
<p>Quantum Mechanics is great, but it can't give us an intuitive understanding of what a force really is. The math could be beautiful and precise, but the theory itself isn't very elegant, unlike General Relativity, which you can actually understand and have a visual representation for what a force (in this case, gravity) is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electrons are sources of electric fields, just like magnetic dipoles are sources of magnetic fields. The electomagnetic force is one of the 4 fundamental forces. Electric and magnetic fields are inherently coupled together because the photon acts as a carrier of information about the strength and direction of the field, telling other charges or dipoles nearby how to act. Electric charges come in positive and negative, that's just what we observe. The strong force however is another fundamental force that comes in 3 different flavors, which are typically called color charge (things start to get way weirder there haha), so it's not like the only thing we see is this dichotomy of 2 charges, it depends on which fundamental field it interacts with.</p>
<p>More in depth expanations rely on what we call field theories in which all the particles are viewed as excited states of these particular fields. That Higg's Boson that they discovered at CERN is the fundamental force carrying particle of the Higg's field as another example. The Higg's field defines what we call mass, which up until then was just some constant that couples force to acceleration. We actually know what mass is now which is really cool, it's been an open question in physics since Newton's time. There may be other Higg's bosons as well, some hypotheses are still being tested as we figure all of this stuff out. </p>
<p>A lot of physicists think that at some point there will be some fundamental coupling between all these fields and that eventually we can describe them all as aspects of one a single unified field, or theory of everything. The closest we've come is unifying the electromagnetic field to the weak force field that mitigates nuclear decay. The other fields are the strong field, the gravitational field, and now the Higg's field. The ultimate goal is trying to figure out how a these things relate and trying to find out exactly &quot;just how the universe is&quot; honestly. We're a long way off from that, but we may some day figure out some underlying math that describes all of these things in a &quot;simpler&quot; or at least more unified way.</p></div>		</li>
