			<div class="markdown"><p>No its the cillia in your inner ear transmitting pain :/ its not good. The middle ear (ear drum/bones etc) is not what processes the sound, its the inner ear and that's whats telling you its hurting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The muscles in your ear are responsible for “tensing up” in response to loud sounds in order to dampen the sound. Ever notice the difference in pain between a SUDDEN loud boom and a GRADUALLY increasing loud sound? When it’s sudden, the muscles don’t have a chance to tense up - so it hits your ear drum too hard and it hurts. When it’s a gradual increase in sound, the muscles have time to react and it doesn’t quite hurt</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're talking about tinnitus, the ringing that you get from those types of prolonged exposure to loud sounds, that's a result of damage to the hair cells in your ear. Your ear does have a response to loud sounds, called the acoustic reflex. Two of your muscles, the stapedius and tensor tympani, will contract and reduce the amount of noise being transmitted through your middle ear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is how audio compression works; if a sound is near a frequency of a higher amplitude, you can't hear it, so the algorithm throws out the quieter sound, saving bandwidth. Obviously, it's a lot more complicated than that.</p></div>		</li>
