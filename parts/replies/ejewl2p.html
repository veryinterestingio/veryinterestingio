			<div class="markdown"><p>In 1677, Sir Francis North published <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A42318.0001.001/1:4?rgn=div1;view=fulltext" target="_blank">A Philosophical Essay on Musick</a>, where he hypothesized that sound is transmitted by vibration or force, and that a whipcrack was caused by air molecules rushing in to refill a vacuum. </p>
<p>By this time, a rudimentary form of atomic theory was spreading in acceptance, and the first microscopes had proven much of the world existed beyond the immediate comprehension of our senses. North begins from the assumption the &quot;air we breath in to be a mixture of divers minute bodies which are of different sorts and sizes, though all of them are so small as to escape our senses.&quot; He notes the elasticity of air, and posits that sound moves through air as a cascade of these small colliding bodies. In short, he has a working theory of sound moving through air as an oscillation, and deal specifically with whips when speaking about a sudden pulse of sound </p>
<blockquote>
<p>when the Air is divided with any sudden force, as by the end of a Whip having all the motion of the Whip contract∣ed in it, and by a sudden turn throwing off the Air; by ascension, as in Thunder and Guns; or by any impression of force carrying it where other Air cannot so forcibly follow, as upon compressing of Air in a bladder till it breaks...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes further to state </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Tone is the repetition of Cracks or Pulses in equal spaces of time so quick that the interstices or intervals are not perceptible to sense. The more quick the Pulses are, the more acute the <em>Tone</em> is. Where the intervals are not equal, nor in musical proportion, the sound is not in <em>tone</em> but an irregular noise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1687, North's contemporary Isaac Newton measured the speed of sound (although he was short by about 15 percent), but the first recorded attempt was made in 1630 by Marin Mersenne (who himself was about 15 percent high). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When did people know there was a sound barrier? It's pretty obvious sound travels at a speed we can discern through echos and such, but it's more of a mental stretch to figure out that exceeding this speed would cause something like a shock wave. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We had detected sonic booms earlier in whips and rockets, but it became an actual problem when dive bombers shortly before and during WWII got fast enough for their props to break the sound barrier during steep dives.</p>
<p>Since the propeller tips are only briefly above the sound barrier, this creates a serious vibration problem where each tip creates a sonic boom as it reaches the &quot;fast&quot; side.  At high RPMs, you're generating multiple shocks per second and the propellers were shattering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of propellers go past the sound barrier, that is not the root cause of the problem. (correction, idk about this part really.. but shouldn't matter, as i've never heard accounts from ww2 pilots saying the limiting factor in dives were the propellers breaking)</p>
<p>Either way, no. Aircraft typically don't need any engine power to reach their vne. Structural Integrity is usually the limiting factor. Aircraft such as those in ww2 would encounter compressibility effects during dives at high speed and as such lock up control surfaces. Thus the aircraft continues its dive, uncontrollably, until it starts ripping itself apart by aerodynamic flutter etc..much scarier than a propeller shattering, and you would know you are dead for a decent amount of time just accelerating and loosing all your surfaces eventually making a decent dent in the dirt. If you're not knocked out once your aircraft is peeling apart that is.</p>
<p>This remained a problem for a good amount of time.. F-86 could go supersonic largely because of all flying tail and hydraulics, but it was still a very violent process.. MiG-15's aileron controls would would however reverse at high speed (higher end of transonic range), and as far as we know, partly due to it's elevator design it could not go supersonic controllably. For a long time aircraft would struggle with characteristics during the transonic range (even mig-25's had problems with this in the early variants I believe). La-15 had its canopy smash into it's test pilot during a high speed test (or maybe it was the 176 I don't remember anymore).</p>
<p>Lots, if not every fast moving aircraft during ww2 had these problems, on all sides. P-38 had dive brakes specifically added for this reason iirc. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>How is there a &quot;fast side&quot; on props? I know helicopter rotors have a &quot;fast side&quot; but I'm having trouble visualizing how something that rotates perpendicular to direction of travel can have a fast or slow side. I know the tangential velocity of the prop tip combined with the forward velocity of the aircraft can cause the prop to exceed mach 1, but that has nothing to do with a fast/slow side.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm not saying they don't, just asking how/why they do, if they do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So actually the sound &quot;barrier&quot; isn't a real thing. When we talk about the sound barrier we usually refer to an object reaching the same velocity as the speed of sound at that location. We refer to it as a barrier because in the process of designing transonic and supersonic planes, engineers found that the natural phenomena that occur at these speeds complicated airplane design significantly.</p>
<p>The shock waves for example can cause separation of airflow on wings and cause significant vibrations. This made it so that for a long time the velocity limit or &quot;barrier&quot; for a long time was around the speed of sound, as we simply didn't know how to design for supersonic flight. Today superosnic flight is still a whole different realm of engineering compared to regular avionic engineering as the aerodynamics involved are a lot more complicated. </p></div>		</li>
