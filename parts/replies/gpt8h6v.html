			<div class="markdown"><p>Helicopter pilot here as well: flying with failed hydraulics will leave you sore the next day when you’re fighting the winds as well. I’ve landed one on failed hydraulics and it took several go-arounds since that damn aircraft did <em>not</em> want to land. Was super fun since it failed on a steep left bank at about 25 feet above the trees (combat aircraft). </p>
<p>You practice for it and it’s a “land as soon as practicable” condition but it’s still an emergency procedure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun times!  Not saying it isn't an emergency, just that it's not something so unsafe as to not practice in smaller aircraft for real.  We won't be turning them both off in a 212 anytime but it can be a non event in a 206.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re right about that. It is a lot safer but can become a real emergency if not reacted to properly. </p>
<p>We did ok, but my arms and legs were a smidge sore for a few days after (probably lending to the fact that it took those go-arounds because of shifting winds that were just barely within the limits).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the 61 (one of your “larger” helicopters), IIRC there was some 750 lbs control force in one lateral direction and 650 lbs force in the other lateral direction, at the cyclic. You’d basically go into a roll if you lost both hydraulics and there wouldn’t be a thing you could do about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard one story that sounds like a myth in the making of a 61 with some hydraulic failure where the FO stood on the collective to get it down to land but never got a source for it.  Can't find the numbers in a quick look at the 212 but training is basically don't let the collective drop cause you won't be able to pull it back up, that and good luck!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Jesus. No thanks lol. </p>
<p>Yeah that 61 story wouldn’t surprise me. They’ve had stuck swashplate uniballs before... one story I heard was that they oil-canned the entire trans’s top half as the crew tried moving the collective and eventually got it to budge to land.  They knew this because the top gear started wearing a groove into the top case half. Might be what you’re talking about.</p></div>		</li>
