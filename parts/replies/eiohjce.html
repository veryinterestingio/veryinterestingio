			<div class="markdown"><p>Cheetahs are a pretty extraordinary example. All living cheetahs today are more closely related than even siblings would be in other animals. Its actually possible for them to get skin grafts from each other almost no risk of rejection. They appear to have somehow survived multiple genetic bottlenecks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you explain how that works genetically? How can they be more closely related than siblings even if they all came from two siblings? (Not that they came from such low numbers but that should be the most extreme possible scenario.)</p>
<p>I want to be clear, I'm not saying you're wrong, I just don't know enough about genetics to understand. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How is cheetah inbreeding different than human inbreeding? I mean if humans inbreed for X generations they come out &quot;abnormal&quot; in some way. </p>
<p>Do humans just have more &quot;bad&quot; recessive genes that result in abnormalities? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a theory that this happened to humans as well. Humans are not very genetically diverse, statistically speaking.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps the most widely cited statistic about <strong>human genetic diversity</strong> is that any two <strong>humans</strong> differ, on average, at about 1 in 1,000 DNA base pairs (0.1%). <strong>Human genetic diversity</strong> is substantially lower than that of many other species, including our nearest evolutionary relative, the chimpanzee&quot;</p>
<p>There are various theories about how this happened, the most logical being that the population was greatly reduced by a near-extinction event. Makes you wonder what humans would be today if that had not happened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That appears to be from founder effects though, not extinctions.</p>
<p>Each of the genetic bottlenecks humans have gone through appears to be tied spatially and temporally to times and locations when we moved into new areas and expanded our population rapidly.</p>
<p>It has a similar genetic footprint to extinctions, which is why the extinction hypothesis has remained popular.</p>
<p>When I’m back at my computer I can give you links to articles if you’re interested.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Link to an older comment of mine <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Anthropology/comments/a3nizh/book_review_when_humans_nearly_vanished_the/eb7tovl/" target="_blank">on the subject of human extinctions</a>.  The first three references are about bottlenecks in humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>they're actually having severe problems with a fungus (&quot;Panama disease,&quot; <em>fusarium oxysporum</em>) that kills the shit out of banana trees.</p>
<p>back in the day, Cavendish bananas weren't a thing; everyone ate the <em>Gros Michel</em> banana. which is also what they based the artificial flavor for bananas on.</p>
<p>then the <em>Gros Michel</em> died out from this fungus, and they started using the Cavendish instead because it was immune to Panama disease. </p>
<p>which is why banana flavored things never taste like bananas; they do, but the banana they taste like is extinct and Cavendish bananas taste like irony and despair thanks to the fungus mutating to make Cavendish bananas new dinner.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the U.S., the black-footed ferret got down to a couple dozen individuals in the late 1980s and was considered extinct in the wild, in part due to a massive campaign to eliminate its almost exclusive food source, prairie dogs. A captive breeding program was able to restore the population, and now about a thousand exist in the wild.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it has a virtually identical relative in Asia, the steppe polecat, that is not at all endangered. I wonder if it would be possible to interbreed the two to establish more genetic diversity in the black-footed ferret population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There can be other issues with hybrid species. Sometimes they end up being too fit and squeezing out other animals. You could get more genetic diversity but less species diversity because the ferrets competitors die out or they wipe out a prey organism</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and this program,also known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_Survival_Plan" target="_blank">&quot;Species Survival Plan&quot;</a> is heavily implemented in zoos and aquariums that are accredited by the AZA. Some zoos are better at conservation than others, but reputable ones will be active participants in SSPs for a variety of species that they hold. This serves multiple purposes; maintaining genetic diversity throughout the captive population across all institutions being one of them. Some of these programs can also serve as reintroduction efforts as well, which I believe the black-footed ferret was a part of.</p>
<p>Participants in SSPs tend to meet every year or so to discuss breeding schemes and the state of the population. When I had taken part in one while working at a zoo as a keeper, they had aimed for maintaining a minimum of 200 years of genetic diversity for the particular species. In a way, these populations serve as a &quot;safety&quot; in the hopes that issues affecting wild populations can be fixed in time.</p></div>		</li>
