			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very important point as it relates to the depletion of ocean fisheries. People assume, well oceans are massive so fish stocks are massive as well. But if you went hunting for game as a protein source you wouldn't assume it lives at the top of every mountain and bottom of every valley. You know it has a range that confines its distribution and therefore its  abundance. You dont go hunting across the vast, empty desert.</p>
<p>Commercial fisheries know this and are squeezing the last bits they can out of the pelagic fish we all expect on the dinner table (tuna, mahi, etc), but as you aptly point out, the majority of fisheries biomass is near the coast. Fish we eat do not come from habitat that covers 70% of the planet, its much closer to &lt; 10 %.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moreover, many pelagic fish have very long lifespans and mature very slowly. There have been several examples of species demographics falling dramatically within years of large scale industrial fishing beginning to target them because they needed a decade or more to reach sexual maturity. The fact that we catch species before having a complete understanding of their lifecycle is just insane. You wouldn’t expect to be able to sustainably « harvest » 30% of elephant populations every year. It’s very much the same for a number of fish species.<br />
Edit for example: <a href="https://www.int-res.com/articles/ab2013/18/b018p161.pdf" target="_blank">example</a>.                </p>
<p>Edit 2: damn, I was not expecting this comment to be that popular but thanks for the gold guys! I’m glad I could help spread this knowledge around.<br />
Edit 3: someone rightfully pointed out that this issue is not limited to pelagic species but may be even more pronounced in many non-pelagic ones. I only spoke specifically about the former because I had an example in mind and large scale industrial fishing does tend to happen offshore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering that tuna is also pretty high up the trophic (?) ladder, because they eat other fish, an even better comparison would be harvesting lions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One result is these fish are reaching maturity earlier and their average size is decreasing. What we have done to the oceans is unforgivable and will come back to bite us. We plunder the ecosystems and use it as a dumping ground.  As a species we should hang our heads in shame. The ocean also has a critical role in our climate, as our coastal cities will discover as climate change raises sea levels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In general you don't find fish in large, empty swathes of water unless they're migrating or chasing prey.  </p>
<p>Life likes edges, whether it's the surface of the water where photosynthesis occurs, the edge of a current, or the edge of an interesting bit of structure like a tree, a whale fall, an oil rig, a continental shelf, deep structure (as was the case with the Orange Roughy debacle), or a coral reef.   </p>
<p>Edges mean heterogenity, and that means energy transfer between organisms, which means things can happen and change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>and to your point here, edge in the ocean means vertical transfer. When lateral transport of fluids meet an edge, it forces the water up or down, which in turns allows exchange of the otherwise stratified unmixed layers in the ocean containing what the other is missing. For coastal regions, this is the upwelling of deeper, nutrient rich waters to supply primary productivity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The creators actually did a great job with that game. Lots of the animals have believable behaviors (I LOVE that the shark things collected metal scraps) and the composition of the ecosystems is well thought out too! The later parts of the game less so, but that's where the story takes over.</p></div>		</li>
