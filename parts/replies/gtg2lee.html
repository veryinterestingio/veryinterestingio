			<div class="markdown"><p>Refraction for a 5 year old: put a pencil in a glass of water. the line doesn't go straight down and the pencil looks bigger when you look at it inside the glass and through the water. this is because of refraction. You know how a magnifying glass makes things look different, too? Refraction.</p>
<p>For a 10 year old: When you look at the pencil, you see light reflecting off the pencil and through the air. When the light has to go through glass and water before it reaches air, the differences of how these materials refract light on their own (if you have tried going underwater and taking your goggles off? Aside from the image being blurry, your hands and friends in front of you look the same.) When light has to go through multiple different materials, the path the light travels to your eye is distorted i.e. making it look bigger. Your magnifying glass works because there are differing thicknesses of the glass - we control this distortion by changing the shapes and thicknesses of the glass to make the image larger. Refraction.</p></div>		</li>
