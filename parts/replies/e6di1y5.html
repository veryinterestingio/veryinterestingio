			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey now. I have a Harley and I'm quite happy with my penis. I also prefer smaller cars and trucks. I drive an S10 and regret selling my Miata on a weekly basis. I'm 6'8&quot; by the way, so people generally get a kick out of that. </p>
<p>Anyway, stereotypes are - are bad, mmkay? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>two things:</p>
<p>some bikes are loud because idiot motorists don't look out for bikes. if you hear one, you'll notice it. it's a safety thing, kinda</p>
<p>and </p>
<p>some people really like to bump the bass. can't do that at home, it'll piss off the neighbors.</p>
<p>using either as a sign of dominance is lame, i agree. but there are legit reasons for both. what is not cool is being loud after x hour at night. dunno if you have &quot;ricers&quot; in your area - modded import cars that are soooooo loud. there's a bunch in my area, and they do burnouts and needless reving at stoplights at 3am. like, sure buddy, your honda sounds like a racecar. sorry about your tiny penis. </p></div>		</li>
