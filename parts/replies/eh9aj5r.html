			<div class="markdown"><p>Would these still be lattices? I mean intuitively I get that lattice suggests 2D connectivity while a chain is 1D connectivity, but I'm kinda curious as to whether polymer chains would still be considered lattice solids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A material that has a lattice is a crystalline material, they are synonymous in this context. Polymers can be amorphous or crystalline, it depends on the monomers used (large, bulky monomers are harder to pack while smaller monomers can often pack) and on other conditions (speed of the polymerization, presence of impurities, etc.). </p>
<p>There are crystalline polymers that are 1D chains and there are amorphous ones too, it just depends on a lot of things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is an analog for polymers and amorphous materials, but a crystal lattice is by definition a symmetrical structure of long range order. You can reduce the structure down to a simple building block that repeats. I.e. simple, face centered, body centered, hexagonal ect. There are many different “unit cells” from which crystal lattices are built. </p>
<p>In polymers, there is a “degree of  crystallinity” that can be calculated, but the two terms are absolutely different. From what I remember the highest crystallinity in polymers is typically around 80%.  </p>
<p>I spent many hours doing problems just like these back when I took material science classes :( </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically when a polymer crystalizes, it forms non-covalent bonds between different parts of the chain. Many polymers together form a crystal lattice of these. <a href="http://pediaa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Difference-Between-Amorphous-and-Crystalline-Polymers-1.jpg" target="_blank">Crude drawing</a></p>
<p>There are other ways for polymers to aggregate, but they might not be classified as a solid. A lot of materials like this are in between solid and liquid, and typically these are dense solutions of polymer still in a solvent. If they form a lot of entanglements with one-another they form a gel, which can act like solid under the right circumstances. A system consisting of a bunch of polymer loops all connected to each other is called an Olympic gel, and if regular would be a &quot;crystal&quot; of non-covalent bonds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it helps, consider a dress shirt and its cotton lattice when visualizing how polymer chains relate to structure. Consider a freshly starched dress shirt from the dry cleaner's to be in a more ordered state (and stiffer!) than one you've worn throughout the day. Also, perhaps note that the worn shirt sort of <em>flows</em> easier as well. </p>
<p>You might find liquid crystals, rheology, and the Kelvin-Voigt model to be pretty interesting, too!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the science texts I have read, polymers are not classified as a separate category from crystals and glasses. Instead, polymers can crystallize as solids or glasses (or a mixture of both).</p>
<p>Crystals refer to any solid with a regular lattice. Some polymers have this. Glasses refer to any solid that are locally amorphous. Some polymers are glassy. Some can be both, depending on temperature and history. Fancy recent research has investigated block copolymers, which have molecular bonds between crystalline and glassy polymers, creating closely linked glassy and crystalline regions.</p>
<p>Finally, the concepts of crystals and glasses is actually quite general. It can be used to describe lattices of any object, including molecules, buckminster fullerene complexes, magnetic moments, and cloth fibers. The idea that a substance isn’t a “crystal” just because it is made of molecules, not atoms, is a misunderstanding of what a “crystal” is (at least, as the term is used in contemporary science literature).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's lots of strange misinformation on crystallinity in polymers here. </p>
<p>>99% of polymers are either semi-crystalline or amorphous. Semi-crystalline polymers are polymers where either intermolecular bonding is favourable or where alignment is favourable (ie very rigid polymers). With these conditions in mind, as molten polymer cools it can crystallise. However, at the border of two crystalline regions (look up spherulites) the polymers cannot align to both directions of crystalline growth and be trapped in an amorphous (disorganised) state.</p>
<p>Crystalline polymers can be synthesised through slow, controlled reactions. Each monomer aligns at the surface of one crystalline region during polymerisation.</p></div>		</li>
