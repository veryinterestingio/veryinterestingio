<p>*Edit Thanks for the awards and stuff guys. I meant that producing any usable electricity is better than none, but y'all brought up some good points. I'm leaving a reply below with some stuff I found while researching this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Will a panel produce more energy during its lifetime than it took to create it if it is mounted on west facing roof in sweeden?<br />
I mean, maybe but it definitely will not generate enough money to be viable economical investment.<br />
Even more so if it would compete with eg. thermal well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, the efficiency of the panel is based on light flux in and electrical energy out. Although position, weather conditions, etc do affect the energy output of the panel, they do so by limiting your light flux in factor and thus are unrelated to the efficiency rating. Commentor is wrong, the true reasons for inefficiency are just limitations of the photovoltaic effect; most energy is either reflected or absorbed as heat instead of jostling electrons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are describing the fundamental thermodynamic limitations on the efficiency, independent of the solar cell design.  These limits restrict any imagined solar cell to only 67.8% efficiency of converting the sun's light to electricity.</p>
<p>Real-world solar cells are further limited by the choices of absorber materials.  This gives the &quot;detailed balance&quot; limit of around 33% for a single junction due to energy from photons above the material bandgap being lost as heat, and energy below the bandgap not being absorbed.</p>
<p>There is a wiki page that also describes the thermodynamic limits.  OP is correct.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're absolutely correct. It sucks when incorrect answers get hivemind upvoted. It comes down for the ability for the light to energize atoms to knock electrons into higher energy states.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this for anyone who wants the real answer: any single material can only harvest a certain amount of energy from each photon (light particle). Since photons from the sun have a wide distribution of energies, most of them either can’t be harvested because their energy is too low or they have so much energy that only a fraction gets harvested. </p>
<p>You can make things more efficient by stacking multiple materials on top of each other (so that you can harvest more energy from high-energy photons while still being able to capture low-energy photons), but that’s like 10-20x as expensive as normal silicon cells :(</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>But that assumes that the incoming light comes from every direction at once. In practice, the sun only covers a small part of the sky, bringing it even further down to 68.7%.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By “the sun only covers a small part of the sky,” he’s not talking about clouds. He means the amount of sky the sun takes up, the angular size of the sun. If you put a big lens over a solar cell so that it gets light from more directions, its efficiency goes up. I don’t mean that it just generates more electricity due to the increased number of photons hitting it. I mean that if you take a 1 square meter cell that’s getting 1 kW of incident light straight from the sun, and compare it with a 1 square cm cell that’s getting 1 kW of incident light from a 1 square meter lens located 1 meter away, the second cell will generate more electricity (assuming all else is kept equal - notably the temperature of the cell).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get what you’re saying, but to me that has nothing to do with the efficiency of the solar cell itself. It’s an issue with the earth. It’s not an inefficiency if the energy was never there to begin with.</p></div>		</li>
