			<div class="markdown"><p>I loved posing this to physics students:
“What temperature does water boil?”
“212” (in US and these were first years)
“I put a few drops of water on the table and come back a while later and the drops are gone, what happened”
“It evaporated”
“Did it ever get that hot?”
.....
So we need another explanation, another mechanism.....let’s do some science!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no need for the quotation marks around boils as that's exactly what it's doing. The &quot;normal&quot; boiling point of 100°C is only that at 1 atmosphere. As the air pressure drops, so does the boiling point. That's why you can't make a decent cup of tea on a plane or at the top of Mount Everest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So forgive me because I’m an old engineering graduate and it’s been a while. Please see my, possibly badly reasoned and badly explained argument below. Which might very well be wrong. </p>
<p>But the water molecules that evaporated still had enough kinetic energy to leave the liquid and become a gas. I.e. now the amount of energy required will depend on the pressure and other factors. </p>
<p>Now while it would not be correct to call the energy of this molecule template, there is a Link between temperature and molecule energy. </p>
<p>So in theory boiling temperature is when statistically molecules have a certain % of leaving the liquid? For defined pressures of course.  </p>
<p>Hmm. Very interesting the exact nature as always slightly alluded me. Beyond the “lies told to children” stage. </p>
<p>Thanks for making me think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, individual molecules have enough kinetic energy to leave the liquid, but as pointed out below temperature doesn’t make much sense for single molecules; think “does the class average on a test make sense for a class size of one?”</p>
<p>There are theories that essentially give you the probability of a molecule leaving (statistical mechanics) and the over arching concept is that of vapor pressure. Running this experiment in a desert or a swamp will likely produce different results (different rates) this is due to the variables you mentioned and also “absolute humidity” (the amount of water air can hold is affected by a lot of variables so I am just trying to simplify things here). If the air is full then it it will stick around for longer.</p>
<p>Another fun one: if you caught us ISS and held it still how much would the astronauts weigh? Ie what would be the force of gravity on them on the ISS compared to on the surface</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Boiling is essentially when the vapour pressure of the liquid exceeds the hydrostatic pressure. This means that the expanding vapour can overcome the weight of the liquid above it and the atmospheric pressure pressing down on the liquid, and form a bubble.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if the partial pressure becomes greater than the vapour pressure it will start to condense? I assume this has something to do with &quot;as pressure is reduced, boiling point decreses. &quot;</p>
<p>But eventhough the partial pressure is less, isn't the actual pressure exerted over the water vapour still equal to atmospheric pressure? Or am I getting the physics wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right that in most cases, a vapor will start to condense as the partial pressure starts to exceed the vapor pressure. Molecules are constantly moving between the liquid and vapor, and the vapor pressure is the partial pressure where the molecules are moving from liquid to vapor at the same rate they're moving from vapor to liquid (vapor-liquid equilibrium). </p>
<p>Partial pressure of a component is the concentration of that component times the total pressure (Raoult's Law), and so total air pressure is the sum of all the partial pressures. Funky things can happen at extreme temperatures and pressures, but in an &quot;ideal&quot; mixture the vapor pressure doesn't depend on the total pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Re: your first paragraph, yes, absolutely. This is why water condenses on a cold surface, or why steam exiting a kettle of boiling water condenses to form a mist.</p>
<p>Re: your second paragraph, think of the equilibrium between a gas and a liquid in the following way. At a certain temperature, a collection of a large number of molecules will have a distribution of energies. Some will be very energetic, some will have very little energy, but most will have an intermediate amount of energy. Liquid molecules near the surface that have enough energy can jostle free of the molecules surrounding it and join the gas phase. On the other hand, gas molecules with too little energy hitting the surface of the liquid will get captured and join the liquid phase. An equilibrium is reached when the number of molecules going from liquid to gas per unit time is equal to the number going from gas to liquid (i.e. the rates are equal).</p>
<p>The key thing to note here is that the rate of gas molecules joining the liquid phase is directly proportional to the <em>concentration</em> of gas molecules; in other words, rate = k[gas]. The constant k is the proportion of gas molecules hitting the liquid surface that are low enough in energy to be captured, which we discussed earlier. So, at equilibrium, the space above a liquid will have a certain concentration of gas molecules. But how does this relate to the vapour pressure? For this we turn to the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. We can rearrange this to P = nRT/V. Since R is a constant and T is fixed, we can see that P is proportional to n/V, which is the definition of concentration! In other words, the concentration of gas molecules at equilibrium is directly proportional to the vapour pressure of the liquid.</p>
<p>What this all means is that the vapour pressure of a liquid is purely a result of the equilibrium concentration of its gas molecules. The total concentration of gas molecules (in other words the total pressure) does not matter here, since gas molecules are far apart and the only time they interact is when they bounce off each other; this is the basis of the ideal gas law after all!</p>
<p>There is one point where the total pressure matters. Say a bubble of gas happens to form in the liquid. The pressure in this bubble is equal to the vapour pressure of the liquid. However, if this pressure is less than the external pressure, the bubble will simply collapse! This bubble can only survive if the vapour pressure is equal to or higher than the external pressure. The temperature at which this happens is known as the boiling point.</p>
<p>Postscript: there is one thing I didn’t mention that astute readers may have noticed. I didn’t say anything about the rate of liquid molecules leaving to join the gas phase. This is of course proportional to the surface area of the liquid. But the rate of gas molecules joining the liquid is <em>also</em> proportional to the surface area, so they both cancel out!</p></div>		</li>
