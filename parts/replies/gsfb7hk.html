			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, anything with mass will never be able to reach the speed of light (c). To see how mind blowing this is, imagine you're on a train moving at 0.8c relative to the Earth, and fire a bullet going at 0.8c. The speed of the bullet relative to the Earth isn't 0.8c + 0.8c = 1.6c as we would expect, it's actually 0.98c. No <em>matter</em> how hard you try, the speed will always be less than c.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm absolutely loving the discussions below, special relativity isn't talked about nearly as much for how mind-bendingly amazing it is! Some questions keep coming up so I'll incrementally post the answers below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is c? What does 0.8c mean?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>c is a constant that's used to represent the speed that light travels at in a vacuum, which is about 186,000 miles <em>per second</em>. 0.8c is a speed that's 80% of the speed of light, or about 149,000 miles per second.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Where did the 0.98c number come from?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If there's a train that's moving at speed v according to the train station, and you fire a bullet at speed u' while aboard the train (where u' is according to the train), then intuitively we would expect the speed of the bullet according to the station to be u=v+u'. But it turns out that just adding the speeds isn't completely accurate to get the true speed, and the <em>error grows</em> as the speeds v and u' become closer and closer to the speed of light. </p>
<p>The actual formula to get u comes from special relativity and is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity-addition_formula#Special_relativity" target="_blank">velocity addition formula</a>. The formula has v+u' in the numerator, but there is now something in the denominator that we must divide by to get the true speed. This is a <a href="https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/velocity-addition" target="_blank">nice calculator</a> if you want to plug in numbers and see what the resulting speed (which we called u) will be.</p>
<p>Note that if v and u' are both much smaller than c, then the denominator of that formula will be essentially 1, and we'll get back u being approximately v+u'. This means that for adding &quot;low&quot; speeds, we don't need to worry about the complicated addition formula.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instead of a bullet, what if you fired a laser or flashlight from a moving train. Would the speed of the laser beam be greater than c according to the train station?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The extraordinary thing about light is that it <strong>always</strong> travels exactly at c (when moving in a vacuum), no matter who's doing the measurement and what speed they are moving at. Both you on the train and Alice standing at the train station will measure the laser beam as moving at c!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Is mass relative?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Back in the day there used to be the concept of “relativistic mass,” but this isn't used anymore. In modern times, the mass of an object is defined as the measurement you make in the object’s own reference frame (in which the object is still). So mass of an object is just a number in kilograms that everyone agrees on regardless of what relative speed they're travelling at. You can measure the mass of something by using a balance or some other instrument while the object is still.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Does light have mass?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>According to the definition of mass above, light does <strong>not</strong> have mass. This means that photons (which can very roughly be thought of as &quot;light particles&quot;) also do not have mass.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Imagine you're on train A moving at 0.8c relative to the train station, and train B passes you by that's moving in the opposite direction, also at speed 0.8c relative to the train station. What speed do you measure train B moving away from you at relative to you?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>According to you on train A, the station is moving away from you at 0.8c. And according to the train station, train B is moving away from you at 0.8c. Notice that this is exactly the same situation we had before in the original comment with the train/bullet, where object 1 is moving at 0.8c, and object 2 is moving at 0.8c relative to object 1. In this case, object 1 is the train station itself! Then, the speed you measure train B moving away from you at will again be 0.98c.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Imagine once again that you're on a train moving towards a train station at 0.8c (relative to the station). Bob, who's standing at the station, fires a bullet at your train at 0.8c (relative to the station). What speed do you measure the bullet coming towards you at?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In your reference frame on the train, Bob is moving towards you at 0.8c. Bob fires a bullet towards you that's moving at 0.8c in his frame. This is again the same situation as the original comment (see the last question), where object 1 is moving at 0.8c, and object 2 is moving at 0.8c relative to object 1. Object 1 is now Bob! You measure the bullet as coming towards you at 0.98c.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If E=mc^2 and light has no mass, wouldn't that mean light has no energy?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>(I'll attempt to give a rough explanation, but I encourage you to do more research online to get a more thorough answer!)</p>
<p>It turns out that the famous E=mc^2 formula is only a special case of a general formula called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy%E2%80%93momentum_relation" target="_blank">Energy–momentum relation</a>. The general formula lets us calculate the energy of an object that's moving at some speed relative to us. This means that energy itself is relative! If a bullet is fired from a moving train, a person on the train and a person at the train station will measure different values for how much energy the bullet has.</p>
<p>You get back E=mc^2 from the general formula if you assume the object isn't moving relative to you, in which case the momentum (called p) of the object will be zero relative to you. So E=mc^2 is the energy of an object that is measured in a reference frame in which the object is still.</p>
<p>But light is always moving at c relative to us, so we need to use the general formula. Plugging in m=0 into the general formula (since light has no mass), we get E=pc. This is the formula for energy of light! We know that light must have energy, so this means p can't be zero. So light has momentum, but it has no mass! (The formula that's taught in high school of momentum p=mv turns out to be a non-relativistic approximation that doesn't work for light, since light is completely relativistic.)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you're traveling at very high speed (like speed close to c), do you measure time to be moving slower?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Answer coming soon! In the meantime, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/mbe0nj/visualizing_time_dilation_intuitively/" target="_blank">this video about Time dilation</a> was posted last week and might be helpful (though I haven't watched it yet so can't comment).</p>
<p>Edit 2: Once again, I'm ecstatic seeing the discussions that this comment and also this whole post has lead to. I'll try to throw a couple more Q&amp;As on here. For now, <strong>sincere thanks to everyone for all the awards, questions, and kind comments!</strong> </p>
<p>There are a lot of excellent questions here that I think are really hard to answer in text only without a drawing, so maybe I'll try to set up a Twitch stream AMA at some point. It's clear that a lot of us are very interested in learning more about this topic (special relativity), and other topics in physics that are equally breathtaking!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also if you are moving on a train going at a speed of 0.99c and point a laser in the same direction the speed of laser particles would be c. It still won't increase the speed of photons being released from the laser.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you could use a laser to measure how fast you're going?</p>
<p>I.e. on said train, have a laser pointed forwards. If you're going 0.9999c (I know not possible but for sake of illustration...) ... and shine a laser in direction of travel ... laser is travelling at 1.0c ... so the difference is 0.0001c ... you'd see the laser traveling forwards at 0.0001c and thus you'd know you're traveling at .9999c ...</p>
<p>And ... if you were to speed up to 1.0c it would appear that the laser you're holding stops.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>(I know .. useless mental exercise .. but my flabby brain needs exercise).</p>

<p>From the Earth bias, most people learn that if you were traveling .99999999% the speed of light it would take a little over a year to go 1 light year, but to the people on the space ship it would only take a little over an hour.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What's really cool is that while the Andromeda galaxy is 2.54 million light years away from us, we can reach it in a human lifetime. With a constant 1G acceleration for half the trip and another constant 1G deceleration for the second half of the trip, it would take 28 years of ship time for the crew to reach their destination.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think you need to actually explain spacetime to show how space and time are related to &quot;c&quot;. While c is often referred to as the speed of light, it's a bit unhelpful to just think of c as speed in our everyday experience – &quot;How fast does something move through space?&quot;. c doesn't just describe how fast something moves through space but also how fast something moves through time. Since it's a constant, if an object moves very fast through space, it moves slower through time and if an object moves very fast trough time, it moves slower through space.</p>
<p>One of the best visual explanations I've seen regarding c is <a href="https://youtu.be/au0QJYISe4c" target="_blank">this video by ScienceClic</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to dive a bit deeper into general relativity and spacetime curvature, he also made <a href="https://youtu.be/wrwgIjBUYVc" target="_blank">this video</a> which is much better at visualizing it than anything I've ever seen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is true. I learned about in regards to 'c' before I heard the explanation that you are always traveling at a fixed rate through spacetime because my modern physics class didn't want to show four-vectors. I think the fixation on the speed of light does distract from what's going on, because it isn't really about light.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is a universal speed limit, let's call it c. Nothing can ever travel faster than this, it's physically impossible.</p>
<p>Light basically travels as fast as anything possibly can, which just so happens to be c, but it's not the only thing to do so. Gravity also propagates with a speed of c.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is something that happens! It's another classical &quot;paradox&quot;. </p>
<p>We know that a particle called a muon, which we can detect very often in cosmic rays, has a half-life of 1.56 microseconds, and based on the speed it travels, we shouldn't be able to observe many of them at all - because it takes much longer than that to travel to Earth through the atmosphere (about 22 half-lives, so only about 1 in 4 million would make it through). However, that's because the 1.56 microseconds is actually in the reference frame <em>of the muon</em>. From our perspective, that half life is actually 5 times longer. So we observe about 4.3 half lives, or 1 in 20. So the difference is a factor of about 200,000 times in the amount we observe. <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Relativ/muon.html" target="_blank">This link</a> has some demonstrations of this effect. </p>
<p>In fact, it's possible to build a DIY muon detector for pretty cheap.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If I throw a ball East at 10 miles per hour, to us the ball appears to be moving east at 10 miles per hour, but to the ball, it looks like the entire world is moving west at 10 miles per hour.</p>
<p>If I throw <em>two</em> balls east at 10 miles per hour, to ball one, it looks like the world is moving west at 10 miles per hour, and ball two appears to be standing still.</p>
<p>If I throw a third ball east, at the same time, but going at 15 miles per hour, then the world seems to move west at 10 miles per hour, ball three seems to move east at 5 miles per hour, and ball two seems to be standing still. How fast each ball appears to be going is dependent on how fast the observer is going.</p>
<p>If at the same time I shot a photon east at C, to all three balls and to us, standing where everything started, the photon appears to be moving the same speed, independent of how fast we are going.</p>
<p>coming out of the &quot;ELI7&quot; context:</p>
<p>As far as I'm aware, we don't know why this is, but once we learned that, it obviously broke all of our models of what motion and time means in the universe. Einstein and his team did a lot of speculation about what the consequences of this new information would have, and used math to prove or disprove parts of their speculation, creating a new model. This new model was still full of holes, so they repeated this process a few times until they came up with the model of general relativity. General relativity was a useful model for general descriptions of the universe, but it has holes in some cases, so they got back to it and came up with special relativity. I think there might be a third iteration, I'm not sure. Also I'm not an expert in any of this, so skepticism is encouraged.</p></div>		</li>
