			<div class="markdown"><p>As the flow stops from the pipe, wouldn't the remaining gas and oxygen mix to eventually hit the right ratio and explode? Sort of like the 5 gallon jug whoosh canisters, at the end the fire reaches the bottom and the remaining vapor mixes into the entire volume and the entire bottle combusts a couple times</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a terrible insurance fraud scam that went wrong near where I live that really helped me understand that too.</p>
<p>These people filled their house with gas and set some sort of auto-ignite function to set the house on fire when they weren't home. He went to the bar or to eat and someone asked how his day was. He said &quot;well my house blew up so that sucked&quot;. Except it didn't. His first attempt failed and it was just too much gas. They tried it again the next day and got the ratio correct, ended up killing <del>like 6</del> 2 people and damaging hundreds of houses. </p>
<p>Too much and it'll explode, too little and it will just burn till it's done. You need a very specific combination of oxygen and gas that mixes throughout so it goes up all at once. Otherwise it just is a continual burn since it never reaches that specific level again, with too much of either gas</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There wouldn't be enough stored energy to result in an explosion, just a small deflagration. And by the time the mixture in the pipe reaches the right ratio its probably going to be too cool to deflagrate</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a way it's analogous to a gas lighter. The flame doesn't chase down into the lighter, and oxygen can't make its way in there because the gas (butane) is pushing out due to pressure.</p></div>		</li>
