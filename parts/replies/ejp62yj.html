			<div class="markdown"><p>Things that wash into the ocean from wind and rain, then floats out to sea.  That grocery sack that gets loose, cigarette butts, floaty toys, broken “stuff”.  It’s worse in poor areas, and where disaster flooding happens.  Plastic films are the worst, because they are everywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In third world countries with massive coastlines, waste disposal consists of just leaving it on the side of the road. This waste only has to travel a few hundred meters in many cases (since the majority of the population lives near the coastline) to pollute the ocean. These areas also tend to suffer from overpopulation so its a nasty combination.</p>
<p>By and large I think the developed world does a pretty good job of managing their plastic waste, it's the areas of poor infrastructure that are the worst offenders, understandably. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Head on down to your local drainage basin after a good rain and you Will see plastic products in abundance at the high water lines. That's the stuff that stuck around the vast majority made its way downriver to the sea. The textbook example is probably the LA river system.</p></div>		</li>
