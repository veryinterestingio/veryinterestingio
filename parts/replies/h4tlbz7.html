			<div class="markdown"><p>Bit of a follow up, in case you know the answer.  I know mercury thermometers have been around and accurate for quite some time, but what system did they have in place for recording highs and lows back in the day other than hopefully looking at it at the right time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dunno about 1913, but we have basic mercury thermometers at home that have a &quot;float&quot; so you can see how high or low the mercury got since you last reset it. I imagine they had the same thing.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, this type of thermometer has been around since the 18th century. </p>
<p>Another way to determine a maximal temperature are the appropriately named maximum thermometers were the mercury can expand unhindered, but cannot simply flow back due to a choke point at the reservoir. The old medical thermometers used to measure your body temperature work like this. I don't think this type of thermometers has seen much use in meteorological studies, though, as you have to manually &quot;reset&quot; them (by shaking), which isn't very convenient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What could they do then to measure more extreme temperatures?  Could they do that with equipment available in Eastern Europe?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, sure. First of all, Eastern Europe isn't some undeveloped backwater hellhole anymore. Secondly, the necessary technology has been around for literal centuries (see above).</p></div>		</li>
