<p>What will happen if they ever decide to discontinue the project?</p>
<p>(I assume they'll make it crash on earth? If so, I'm guessing it's much larger than anything that's done this before? Will it be significant impacts?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not aware of any concrete retirement plans for the ISS, but NASA has definitely considered their options. A brief search indicates that it would most likely be crashed in the middle of a wide ocean to minimize risk of hitting anything. A modified cargo spacecraft would perform the deorbit burn—essentially a reboost, but in the opposite direction. The reentry angle would be as steep as possible to ensure all debris de-orbits at once, and splashes down in a concentrated area far from the coast. The specifics of the plan vary depending on the capabilities of the cargo spacecraft.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My gut instinct says no. Overcoming the drag we're talking about requires only <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmHamp0IIyE" target="_blank">a very gentle reboost</a> every month or so. </p>
<p>Quick example off the top of my head: the ISS gets electric power from its gigantic solar arrays. For weight and space savings, these arrays are made of thin material that is folded up during launch, then stretched out on a scaffold once in orbit. If there were enough drag for you to feel on your skin, those arrays would be blowing about like a sail in a breeze. But in all video footage, the solar arrays appear perfectly still.</p>

<back_of_envelope_math>

Drag force is proportional to the square of your velocity. The ISS orbits the Earth at ~27,600 km/h; if you were driving that fast at sea level, the drag force would be 76,000 times greater than driving at 100 km/h ( 27600^2 / 100^2 = 76,176 ).

However, drag force is also proportional to the density of the atmosphere. Pressure at the ISS's altitude is in the ballpark of 100 nano-Pascals, which is roughly one-billionth of sea-level pressure. Clearly this far outweighs the influence of the ISS's speed; 76,000 / 1,000,000,000 = 0.000076, meaning 100 km/h at sea level experiences ~13,000 times more drag than 27,600 km/h at 400km up.
