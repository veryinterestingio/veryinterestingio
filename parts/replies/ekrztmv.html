			<div class="markdown"><p>My natural caution had me watch wait and research when I was interested in psychoactives in the late 90s when gottleib and I had done as much as we could I returned to my suppliers list only to find out that all the good stuff had been banned or spun up into such convolutedly messy law that nobody would ship I.
Where does somebody even get khat seeds/a plant cutting to begin with?!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here in the USA there’s only one place I can find them. They are pricey and come in smaller packets, being not fresh and dried. From seeds khat is a lot harder to grow which is why cuttings are often used. Never had any success growingseeds  but hadn’t the money for more than a handful of packets(being in a tougher climate for them didn’t make it easy). When I said doesn’t seed, I shoulda said, is very hard to grow from seeds</p></div>		</li>
