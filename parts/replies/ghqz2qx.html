			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, they are available, but they are insanely exppensive. Some are full page and some have only one line that you have to pan left and right to read. Obviously, a full page one is better, but they are so expensive that only some people can access them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just had a google, and the first one I came across said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Packed with usability features and at an affordable price point of just $2,500 (which includes shipping), the Canute is changing the game for readers of electronic braille.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh my Lord that's pricey. $2,500 is affordable? That's awful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad has a special laptop for the blind. I forget exactly how it works, but it was stupid expensive. I would think that with all the available technology that hp or another manufacturer could work with Microsoft to make something that is affordable and super functional.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Given that so many descriptions in novels are visual, are there any authors that are known to be better reads for blind people?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thats what I would like to know and how do you use the internet. The writing I can figure out, is it like for me, learn where the keys are?</p>
<p>I would guess that some program that changes text to speach helps a bit with some things.</p>
<p>I ask just out of curiousness and like to learn new things.</p></div>		</li>
