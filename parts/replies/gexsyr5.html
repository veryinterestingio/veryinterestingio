			<div class="markdown"><p>I think in this case it's that a large part of the flavour is from water (and hence saliva) soluble compounds, so they leach out of the gum as soon as you start chewing it. Conversely, menthol, which gives a distinct minty flavour, is not very soluble at all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've never tried fruit stripe gum, to my knowledge it's not sold where I live, but I would assume that the flavouring added to the gum is not particularly well incorporated into the delivery mechanism.</p>

<p>Yup... a pack of gum has 17 pieces divided into 5 flavors. They aren’t making 5 flavors of gum, they make one gum base, and then coat the gum base with the different flavors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worked where it is produced, gum is flavored in the gum mixer (about 800kg per lot) then it is printed and cut to size, single wrapped, WIP for each flavor is needed to pack all together in secondary package which mixes the flavors.</p>
<p>As for the rapid lose of flavor it’s caused because ingredients are not the best, we could design it to last but it won’t cost the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there anything in &quot;getting used&quot; to the flavour as well?  Your brain stops responding to the signals because it is just used to it.  Like a bad smell fading even though it's still there or pain etc?</p></div>		</li>
