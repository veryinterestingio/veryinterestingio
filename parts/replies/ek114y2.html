			<div class="markdown"><p>Dolphins are thought to commit suicide by not coming up for air.  This happened to Kathy, one of the dolphins who played Flipper in the '60s movie, because she was kept alone in a tank with no other dolphins.  It is thought that she became depressed in isolation and chose to kill herself.  There was also a case of a dolphin named Peter who was separated from his longtime handler and became depressed, then stopped coming up for air.</p>
<p>Although of course we can't know what an animal's motivations are, it seems plausible that a highly social and intelligent animal like a dolphin could choose intentionally to not come up for air.  In Kathy's case, it seemed very deliberate.  She swam into a trainer's lap, looked the trainer in the eye, and then dove to the bottom of the tank and laid on the bottom until she suffocated. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a sad tale. We don't necessarily know motivations, but I didn't know if perhaps marine biologists had managed to find whale carcasses that had died of asphyxiation and done autopsies on their brains to see if there was physical signs of plaque build up like in human brains suffering dementia.  Being they're the top of the local food chain generally I'd think that death from old age would be a common way for them to die (that isn't from whaling)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something to definitely note however is that by the time Peter died he had also been receiving regular doses of LSD from the head researcher of the project he was working on, doses which had been stopped when he was separated from his handler. Who‚Äôs to say what impact this had on his observed depression, but I mean you imagine receiving acid every day while getting jerked off by a human(<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Howe_Lovatt" target="_blank">read please</a>), and then one day, all that stops. I‚Äôd be pretty sad man.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have seen a .. movie? I don‚Äôt remember. But I was a kid that loved whales and it broke my heart - in the Arctic, if a whale is exhausted from a journey and can not find a hole in the ice with access to air, they can drown/suffocate. There was a team of people trying to break through ice to save the whale but didn‚Äôt make it in time. The whale was too far into the ice and couldn‚Äôt make it to open water without suffocating. Crushed me </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whales and dolphins don't sweat, and need much less water than humans.  Mostly, they don't drink, and get the water they need from their food especially as a byproduct of breaking down carbohydrates.. It is believed that marine mammal kidneys are adapted to making more concentrated urine than land mammals (their urine is very salty--much more than sea water) but this is not fully proven. (Blood plasma goes through the kidneys, and the water is absorbed out, leaving urine containing waste salt, in humans and dolphins.)  Sea mammals have pretty similar salt levels in their blood as land mammals, unlike ocean fish, which are saltier than fresh water fish.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Beyond the &quot;not sweating&quot; is there an osmosis component, too?  Like their skin/blubber/whatever is able to filter out the salt before it really gets into their circulatory systems?</p>

<p>Sorry, you gave a great answer, but now I'm picturing someone waiting around trying to catch whale urine in water.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason is that human kidneys (and most animal kidneys) can't produce urine that is saltier than seawater, only few animals can, generally the ones that live in seawater or very dry areas. If you drink seawater and pee urine that is less salty, the result is you are left with more salt than before. </p>
<p>For some animals, it's the other way around: they can drink seawater, then eliminate urine that is saltier, the result is they intake water.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Could we live off sea water with some genetic alterations? :D </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Technically, yes, but you could also be a blue whale with <em>some</em> genetic alterations. The difference is deep and resides in kidneys microscopic structure: the kidney is basically made of lot of nephrons, which have different traits. The one able to make urine saltier is Henle's loop, which is short in humans, but long in some animals.</p>
<p>It's short in humans cause we are adapted to use lot of water, sudoration for example isn't widespread and it can consume plenty of water.</p>
