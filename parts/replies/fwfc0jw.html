			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha in practical sense, yea! But since all the cells in our body are recycled every 7 years or so, the specific molecules were probably swapped out long ago :)</p>
<p>Edit: woops turns out the exact value of 7 years is a bit arbitrary</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Side note (still learning) but medium chain triglycerides go directly into the blood stream after digestion and can be used right away (portal venus system). But long chain triglycerides and bits of dietary fats (fatty acids &amp; monoglycerides) get picked up by the cilia in the gut lining, in the short intestine, turn into chylomicrons (protein shell) and actually go into the <em>lymphatic system</em> (blew my mind at first), not blood vessel system initially. BUT, then get dumped into the left subclavian vein which goes to the liver, where they are then processed/metabolized/etc. Kinda amazing that there's such a specific vein it has to get dumped to go to the liver. </p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Nutrient_absorbtion_to_blood_and_lymph.png/1280px-Nutrient_absorbtion_to_blood_and_lymph.png" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Nutrient_absorbtion_to_blood_and_lymph.png/1280px-Nutrient_absorbtion_to_blood_and_lymph.png</a></p>
<p>So, what I'm trying to say is, medium chain fatty acids are first in, first used because it's getting used directly, but the rest is probably not first in first used because it goes through it's own thing that needs the liver to do it's job.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that it's a specific vein, it's a large vessel to receive it because the particles are too large for the capillaries. Gradually all blood passes through the liver, much like it all passes to the kidneys eventually.</p>
<p>The Subclavian vein leads to the Superior Vena Cava which dumps into the left atrium of the heart, eventually distributing back out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know if they get used first or immediately like in a line per say but they should be easier to utilize because they can skip some steps in metabolism. Require less enzymes from what I remember but it’s been awhile. Everything is happening all at once though, it’s a spectrum. It’s not like for 3 minutes only medium chain triglycerides are being metabolized, then after that long chain etc. One doesn’t turn off and then another begins etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As you exercise, immediate energy stores that get depleted first are located directly in your muscles. That’s enough for about 1-2 min of mild to moderate effort. As it is being expended, blood continues to deliver supplies, but most of the time unless it’s a very light activity or specially adapted high efficiency postural muscle that’s being used, the supply will run dry. It doesn’t happen though because your liver then starts to break down intermediate complexity lipids which are stored there and can be quickly transported from it to the muscle tissue. That storage is good for about 20-30 min of continuous moderate effort. As it’s being depleted, the body starts to hustle sending messengers to the lipid storage of your subcutaneous fat tissues (under the skin not the kind lining vital organs) to begin the resupply chain back to the liver. </p>
<p>This is why in order to burn fat effectively one needs to perform mild to moderate intensity activity continuously for at least 20-30 minutes, instead of knocking out 30 crunches at mad speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve not heard that before. I would argue most short term weight loss is from dehydrating and long term is from the cardiovascular consistent exercise which rebalances for lean muscles and less body fat. Every organic molecule contains carbon IIRC, but to say we lose weight by just exhaling CO2 that sounds wild me and that’s me being politely conservative</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: Had to repost as comment was removed from top-level for violating Rule 3 (I didn't check rules beforehand). Thank you to all who've posted with various explanations of the wonderful workings of the human body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a process you can feel happening too. Sometimes during exercise you'll burp, generally during a long distance run or a large amount of aerobic moves. This is the fat breaking down and the CO2 needing to escape. It's rare and feels different than other gaseous burps.</p>
<p>This is some totally achievable if it motivates you to exercise!</p></div>		</li>
