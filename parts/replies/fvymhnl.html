<p>i was always under the belief that they were suspended by buoys or something because how do you find the line if something damages it otherwise</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a little more info than the gif.  All fiber, above and below the ocean, should be mapped.  With fiber, you can send a light-pulse from one end, which will generate small reflections every time it hits a connector or a splice, and a big one whenever it hits a break.  A device called an optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR) sends various light pulses down and watches for their reflection, including the time delay.  This will basically say, &quot;you have a break in the fiber 5000 km from this point&quot;.  With map-in-hand, a boat can go out to that general area where the cut is, and can use some other tools to basically go back-and-forth to find the fiber.  They hook it with a dredge that may cut off the remaining part between where they hook it and where it is actually cut, bring it up, anchor it to a buoy, repeat the same for the other side, splice in to one side, then drive over to the other buoy, splice in there, and drop it back down.  The resulting cable is always longer than the original since they now need to bring it to the surface to repair it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More or less.  The ships have large tanks that are round with a cone in the middle.  So the cable is stored in the tanks like if you coiled up a hose laying on the floor.  The end comes up out of the tank and passes through two conveyor belts sandwiched together (think two army tanks facing bottom to bottom so the cable passes between the belts). The belts control the cable feeding out off the stern of the ship so it keeps the correct tension and doesn’t just all fly out uncontrollably.  At the same time or sometime later they will lower down a tethered submersible (ROV-remote operated vehicle) with a plow and water jets to trench/bury/cover the cable for further protection.
(I worked on a subsea cable repair ship once)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw this vid where the cable-laying ships had their own thrusters (in additional to normal GPS navigation) to get location to a few centimeters. Because then they have to go back later they want to know exactly where the cables are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So most have what is called Dynamic Positioning (DP) systems. They use a computer system to compile highly accurate GPS signals from multiple GPS units (sometimes also sonar acoustic signals for other applications too) as well wind, sea state and current info.  It then uses this to control the propulsion system which on older DP vessels includes propellers and rudders as well as multiple thrusters at the bow and multiple thrusters at the stern.  On newer DP vessels they can have azimuthing thrusters and with the push of a button the DP computer will keep a ship with in a few inches of a point on a chart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Working at a telco. Also interested in the topic of nautical fibers. For a non-technical function I understand the transmission of data a bit. What I really cannot comprehend is the physical aspect of the cables. How on earth can a ship carry a cable that covers the length of e.g. hawai to San Fransisco. Realize they already did it during British colonial era more than 150 years ago. </p>
<p>I still cant comprehend. What would be the size and weight of this size of a cable. Or do they have multiple cables on multiple ships and connectors?</p></div>		</li>
