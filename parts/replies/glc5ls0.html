			<div class="markdown"><p>Mount Saint Helens is crazy, not sure how it looks now, but when I went there in the early 2000â€™s you could still see the blast radius 20 years after the eruption. Miles away the wildlife and trees just disappear as you approach the mountain it was quite jarring. Very Smaug hobbit lonely mountain vibes. Seeing that and living near Mount Rainier on land that is lava sediment from previous eruptions I moved further north away from the mountain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's night and day if you look at St. Helens now vs. back then. Tons of wildlife and plant growth now. It's actually pretty beautiful. The reason for this is that all that ash makes a REALLY good fertilizer. After the eruption ends, under such favorable conditions, it doesn't take very long at all for the ecosystem to return to normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went there about 5 years ago and it's still similar. There's an area on the slope that's just covered in a dead forest with no other vegetation. No idea how it looks now though, it could've finally started regrowing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>St Helen's really hit me when I first saw it. I didn't expect it to.</p>
<p>OP's question also kind of answers itself. We have 1 example of this event, which means it's pretty rare, so while it's a risk, it's not a daily one. Geology and man work on different time scales.</p></div>		</li>
