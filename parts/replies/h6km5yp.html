<p>Is it sharper, so sharp that it can so details from really far away?</p>

<p>This is probably the most correct way to put it. Imagine trying to read a sign from far away, you can't tell what's written on it, you only see a black line. An eagle would be able to tell the letters apart, but it's not like it's zoomed in: if they read the sign, they don't sacrifice the rest of their field of view to zooming, they perceive their whole view as zoomed in, all at once.</p>

<p>It's the difference between a 240p video and 4K, even when both are displayed full screen on the same size display. Added visual clarity makes things easier to distinguish.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is this like depth of field in a camera?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, let's say that you are looking at a HD image on a 15&quot; PC screen. You now zoom in so that you can view only one quarter of the screen: you now see that quarter better, but you can't see the other three quarters of the screen anymore.</p>
<p>An eagle view is like seeing that same image, but on four 15&quot; screens in a rectangle (like a 30&quot; TV). They can see all 4 quarters of the screen in a better way at the same time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have young, healthy vision, chances are <em>you</em> can see below the 20/20 line on the letter chart. I can't, alas. My vision isn't good enough. All just looks like small dots/lines.. I can make out the letters when I put my glasses on though. An eagle could go down even further on the chart.</p>
<p>I imagine there is indeed some &quot;too small&quot; point, but that would only be at some subatomic scale when the physics of lightwaves starts to break down. I don't think even letter chars for eagles typically go that far..</p></div>		</li>
