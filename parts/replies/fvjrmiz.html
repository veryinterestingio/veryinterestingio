			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not, at least with the current state of gene therapy technology. You would need to infect nearly every cell in the organ with your vector, which is quite difficult with our current vectors. They are best suited to small, enclosed tissues such as the retina, and even then I think the infection rate is relatively low.</p>
<p>However, it could be feasible to have some sort of 'universal' stem cell line that can be engineered with the recipient's MHC genes and then have an organ grown from them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And how much would that cost compared to using a vector to swap out DNA? We are early in the game when it comes to gene therapy yet the field is progressing rapidly. It is just as plausible an extremely virulent vector will be (accidentally?)found as it is for stem cells to be uniquely engineered from a &quot;universal&quot; stem cell line. </p>
<p>BTW all stem cells are in and of themselves universal when we are talking about early stages in human development.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically yes. Because you would be able to replace the alleles with extensive processes. However it is not technologically possible currently. Plus the donor organs have a very limited “shelf life” and it would be very difficult to change them fast enough</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unlikely, as it would need to make the change in every cell in the organ. Whoever can come up with a method of doing that will be the world's first Trillionaire as that will allow for so many other therapies (including anti-aging).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Given how early this work likely is, in terms of applicable use, is it more likely to be a neat little study or potentially something we can use to revolutionize transplants and the following care?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While cool, sounds like a recipe for giving the patient cancer.</p>
<p>The immune system kills countless rogue cells in your body every day. Having an entire organ that is not subject to the immune systems control.... that's bound to lead to trouble sooner or later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the question is whether or not it can lead to longer transplant lifespans. Transplanted organs are borrowed time and don’t last your whole life. Only about half of lung transplant recipients are still alive 5 years later, for example. </p>
<p>The technique harnesses a trick that tumors use but it isn’t injecting tumor cells. It essentially calls T-cells to the location to “normalize” the tissue as though it were your own. The body wouldn’t attack cancers that developed there, no, but it wouldn’t anyway. The protein generated by the treatment is how cancer gets away with hiding. </p>
<p>So, on the one hand, you’re creating potential discrepancies in the body. Cell interactions that might be problematic. However there’s a flip side to that too, how likely are transplant recipients to develop cancer? Cancer develops regardless of the immune system, not typically because of it. Hiding an organ from the immune system using protein markers, instead of just shutting off the immune system with drugs like we do now, lets the rest of your body protect itself and essentially changes nothing about how we handle donated organs. </p>
<h1>TLDR</h1>
<p>The long and short being that we already let donated organs go under the immune radar. We just do it with drugs by shutting down the entire immune system; otherwise you’d attack and kill the organ. This treatment isn’t novel in that it hides the organ, it’s novel in that it lets the immune system keep going elsewhere.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I thought the tumor &quot;hide&quot; from immune system simply because it contains the same MHC marker. Same like any other cell in the body.</p>
<p>That's why I've assumed tumor can't be transmitted from one person to another</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tumors hide a lot of ways, but one of the ways they hide is by lying to the immune system. They release a protein that, in essence, tells the immune system to treat them like normal tissue. This is the purview of the study I linked; using that same protein to hide transplant organs so they don't throw up signals. </p>
<p>Tumors can't be transmitted because they're not infectious from person to person. A tumor cell is just a cell, but it's not infectious like the flu. It doesn't spread just because it's there, it needs to be able to split and make more damaged cells. </p>
<p>Cancer cells use a unique protein to basically tell your body that there's nothing wrong. &quot;No problem here move on.&quot; So it slips under the radar. This technique uses the same marker to hide something we <em>do</em> want; transplants.</p></div>		</li>
