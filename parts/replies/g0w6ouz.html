			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! Same concept. It's an area that is still being studied but basically leftover energy from the original mountain building event can sometimes be released along faults (hence the appalachians getting these crazy random earthquakes. They're VERY old relative to the Rockies). Plus, depending on where in the rockies, the rio grande rift could be contributing to compression on nearby faults as it is definitely still active. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same in France. When you buy a house, you check the chances of natural disasters in your area. While looking at our house I noticed that The Pyrenees are highlighted as high risk. In the Pyrenees there is a fault line that developed “due to techtonic activity”, but it’s not the edge of an actual techtonic plate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't kept up with the research on the Mineral quake. Last I heard, isostatic rebound was thought to be the culprit. Have they determined that it was instead compressional stress from the spreading of the Atlantic basin, as the Wikipedia page you linked to implies?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't seen anything on the Mineral earthquake specifically in terms of clear causation, but in general, determining exact drivers for intraplate earthquakes is tricky. Postglacial rebound has definitely been argued to be important for seismic zones in the NE US, e.g. <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/lithosphere/article/2/2/76/145546/State-of-stress-in-central-and-eastern-North" target="_blank">Mazzotti &amp; Townsend, 2010</a>, but it was kind of equivocal for the Central Virginia Seismic zone (of which the Mineral event is a part), though not explicitly ruled out. There have been a wide array of mechanisms beyond postglacial rebound that may influence stress accumulation / release on these structures. The Mazzotti &amp; Townsend paper explores local loading from sedimentary basins, etc, and more recent work (though not specifically on the Central Virginia belt) has suggested an erosional/lithologic control, e.g. <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018GL079157" target="_blank">Gallen &amp; Thigpen, 2018</a>. In short, determining conclusively that a single event (or even an entire intraplate seismic zone) is driven by any one influence is hard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing on the east coast is built with any consideration for earthquakes. They're extremely rare and not very strong, so it's not worth protecting against. However this does mean that the rare modest earthquakes can do much more damage than the same earthquake would do in an active earthquake zone.</p></div>		</li>
