			<div class="markdown"><p>Using the anthropic principle always feels like such a cop out to me, though.  It doesn't really answer anything, just shifts the question.  </p>
<p>You could use it, for instance, to answer the question &quot;why does the sun shine&quot;?  &quot;Well, some objects emit energy and others don't and if our sun didn't shine then we wouldn't be here&quot;.  Which is technically true but misses all the details on gravitational attraction and nuclear fusion, etc.</p>
<p>So even if there are multiple universes with different inflation rates we'd still want to know how universes are created and what mechanism controls the values of their constants (there's probably not a line of code somewhere....unless we're in a simulation, of course).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tend to agree with you that it is unsatisfying. But the problem with asking about the values of fundamental constants of the universe is that you may actually just run into a dead end like this. </p>
<p>I think the best hope for an 'explanation' along these lines is we get some other evidence that inflation is correct and we can study its properties in detail. Then we can calculate that we would expected other universes to form and the theory describes how that would have happened. At that point, even if we couldn't test it directly, we might have to accept this as the explanation. The problem is that inflation and the string landscape are themselves very hard to test so who knows when we will get experimental access to them. </p>
<p>For what its worth, people can describe how these bubble universe can form in inflation (though there are some arguments about it): <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_vacuum#Vacuum_decay" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_vacuum#Vacuum_decay</a>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that's not what the OP asked. They asked, why does the predicted value of the cosmological constant is so different from the measured value. They didn't ask why the cosmological value is what it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats not really a good example of the anthropic principle at all.</p>
<p>The answer about the cosmological constant is a full answer, unlike your sun answer</p>
<p>- Multiverse theory is true. (unfalsifiable prediction)</p>
<p>- Cosmological constants are distributed randomly among different universes OR are distributed according to some unknown mechanism. The exact distribution is unknown but the important fact is that it's value cannot be derived from other laws or facts about our universe. (falsifiable prediction)</p>
<p>- The reason we are experiencing a cosmoslogical constant conducive to life is we would not be able to witness any other type of constant (not a prediction, just a logical application of the anthropic principle based on the above two predictions.</p>
<p>Just because an answer is unsatisfactory doesn't mean it isn't true. Noone likes quantum randomness, but its true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It <em>is</em> a cop out.  Invoking some intermediate mechanism (e.g., multiverse explanation) without also describing everything about it, just shifts the question toward understanding the multiverse, as u/Deto pointed out.  Since there's no direct evidence for multiverses (to my knowledge), then it's not correct to shift the problem toward explaining the multiverse picture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that can't be true, just that it feels incomplete.  It's based off too many convenient assumptions (that there are multiple universes, that physical constants vary between them) for me to consider it the likely explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was, but it got resurrected later. </p>
<p>In very short, Einstein noticed that his equations implied an expanding universe. He didn't like that at all so he introduced a term (mathematically correct) to make the universe static. A couple years later, observations by e.g. Edwin Hubble (the astronomer, not the telescope named after him) proved that the universe was in fact expanding, in a way much compatible with the original equations without the cosmological constant. So the constant was scrapped and Einstein called it one of his worst mistakes.</p>
<p>Then, decades later, observations point out that the universe is not only expanding, but the expansion is accelerating. Why? We don't know. But to describe this effect we introduced back the cosmological constant in the equations, simply with an opposite sign.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Einstein original introduced it for a bad reason, to get his model for the universe to be static in time (not expand) because he thought that was the only way the universe could be. But in full generality there is no reason it shouldn't be included in the equations of General Relativity. This video is a pretty <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RApKeMGDnE" target="_blank">good summary</a>.</p></div>		</li>
