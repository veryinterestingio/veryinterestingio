			<div class="markdown"><p>CDC gets a D- because there's been no ramp up of tests available to the population.  Not just the CDC's fault.  It's also the fault of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and above all it's the fault of the leadership in the White House.  The President and his advisors could have and should have taken this pandemic seriously much earlier and could have pushed the bureaucracy to get the tests available.  White House was too busy slagging the media and the opposition party to actually think about the well being of you and me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You see the press conference when somone asked him about the team being disolved? He said i didnt do that, its a big organization, maybe someone did. Then he turned around to people behind him as if to ask did you do that? Then followed it up with we are doing a great job. Classic.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good question.  Don't know that I have a clear answer.  Yes, the CDC budget has been cut year after year.  Yes, like so many incredibly fine civil servants, the CDC's staff probably feels ignored, pushed to the side, and perhaps fearful of stepping out of line and getting somebody at the WH mad at them. We won't know the full story of the test shortage mess for a while.</p></div>		</li>
