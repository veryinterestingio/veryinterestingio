			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s funny, I do the opposite. Sometimes when falling asleep I try to “dive into” the darker spots because it feels like I’m falling into some kind of deeper relaxation mode.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes you can see those lights pulse and move, perhaps along the blood vessels as blood flows through? I found it astounding the first time I learned that they sit &quot;on top&quot; of the receptors, made me wonder if we can &quot;see&quot; the pulse at times of strain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have something similar (without the lights). Sometimes I can see a line (pretty sure it’s a blood vessel) pulse inside my eye. I wonder why the area of that pulsing line gets blurry whenever it pulses. Does someone know the answer?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if this is true, but I’ve also heard that the “stars” you see when you get a head rush are from the movement of the blood in your vessels. If this is correct, then I suppose you can see the blood / pulses at times!
Someone with more background information on this, let me know if this is an actual thing!
And if so, where would we be seeing the blood from? From my understanding, the cornea, lens, and the fluid within the eye do not have blood vessels: would this phenomena then be caused by the vessels on the retina / back of the eye?</p></div>		</li>
