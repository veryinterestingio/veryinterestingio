<p>Related: the pain point in dealing with the above in the journal is the fact that anyone who 'steals' a dataset will have to include a misattribution of where it comes from. They will have a great deal of difficulty producing lab notes, receipts, etc. accompanying the data, because they don't have any. It is possible to take this on and win. It is just not very easy. Most people don't bother, and having been involved in processes like these A LOT, I can understand why.</p>
<p>This form of behaviour is still reasonably common, and itmakes me coldly furious most days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My fianc√© and I worked for three years on our research. We lived off and on in a different country, helped students get started in their own careers on our site, and overall worked our tails off to become established and respected. We broke financially even at the end of our project, even though we were technically paid. But it was worth it to us since our research was so successful. </p>
<p>Wrote a book (with a third author and established  tenured professor just for credibility). Went through the publishing process where three top-tier researchers reviewed the book. One rejected our data set, used their means to find the site we discovered and analyzed, and &quot;conducted their own research&quot; in under three months to come to the same conclusions we did (impossible, honestly). They took my fiance's book introduction almost word-for-word. The publishing company refused to support us as the reviewer is well-known in our field.</p>
<p>We are no longer archaeologists. This was not our first vile interaction with academia (and because we cannot learn our lesson, it wasn't the last either). I even taught at a university after this and witnessed so many ethical violations that I thought I would become chronically ill. </p>
<p>But yeah, we're thirty, starting over in new careers, and realized there's no room for people who are legitimately good at what they do. Lackeys, people with independent wealth, and those who have no ethical qualms about how they get ahead? Those people fare infinitely better. </p>
<p>I'm bitter, of course, but also so happy to be out of the game that I don't even care anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, that's a truly disgusting story. Your publishing company weaseling out it my least favorite part. You have the records on that! They have all the information they'd ever need to prove that your work was appropriated!</p>
<p>But do they? They do not.</p>
<p>So often I see a congenital lack of boldness from such people. It's infuriating.</p>
<p>I had the presence of mind to write my position on this down a few years ago. You might enjoy it. Also might go some way to proving we're not all monsters. <a href="https://medium.com/@jamesheathers/why-we-find-and-expose-bad-science-e47387a0e333" target="_blank">https://medium.com/@jamesheathers/why-we-find-and-expose-bad-science-e47387a0e333</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like you should get some legal advice. This sounds like a slam dunk case and these people should be stopped from doing this to others. I think lots of lawyers would be happy to litigate without you needing to pay out of pocket. I think people want to see justice!</p></div>		</li>
