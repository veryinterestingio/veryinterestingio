			<div class="markdown"><p>Couple questions. How long is your hair currently? Whats the texture like, thick or thin, coarse or fine? Do you have any scalp issues? Is it slow growing? My absolute favourite brand is Pureology Hydrate (redken salons). Sulphate free and hydrating. If you want it to grow thicker and faster get onto a brand called Serioxyl (Loreal), or something else that has 'stemoxidine' in it and use the entire range. Scalp health would be the first step to making it grow faster, and I quite like the conditioner in that. Revlon has a range called Eksperience which I quite like. If you go to any salon and they have a salon exclusive range its usually quality and the hairdresser trusts it. Just aim for a pricier more concentrate shampoo and dont pay for cheeper supermarket brands. They end up being more expensive in the long run and they are full of water and salt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally the salon exclusive ones are more specialised for individual needs, more concentrated then the cheeper ones, and the hairdresser uses them and will have favorites for each hair type. The cheeper ones are generally watered down, thickened with bare minimum ingredients, sulphate for suds and are just meant for anyone that picks them up. Sulphate isnt particularly bad or good in some cases its just the volumes, and hair just doesn't need that much cleaning. It can be the other sulphectants or sudsing and cleansing agents. We use cheep shampoos when we want to strip colours out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are lots of relatively inexpensive sulfate- and silicone-free shampoos and conditioners out there.  Burt's Bees, Maui Moisture, Shea Moisture, and Live Clean are all brands available, at least in North America, that fall into this category.</p>
<p>When looking at the ingredients, you're looking to avoid anything that says sulfate/sulphate (except methosulfate.  That's gentler) and anything that ends in -cone, -conol, or -xane.</p></div>		</li>
