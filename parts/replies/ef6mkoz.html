			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no single known cause of pica. There are many hypotheses however. Anemia may be the cause of pica in some patients and therefore iron and B12 deficiency could be the root problem. Zinc deficiency might also play a roll. Pica also occurs with a much higher frequency in autistic and otherwise mentally handicapped populations.</p></div>		</li>
