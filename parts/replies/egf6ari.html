			<div class="markdown"><p>It took me 7 years to win my battle. In the end I killed my entire lawn with roundup but I chose the time and temperature precisely so that it didn't kill the grass seed but took out the JG rhizomes. I had a yellow yard for about 3 months, and then the softest, greenest, lushest grass I've ever had came in. It was glorious. No problems since, other than periodic incursions from my neighbors lawns. </p>
<p>Depending on how widespread it is, a strategy that can work pretty well is to use cloth strips, twine, or string that's soaked in herbicide and drag it over the lawn. Since it grows so much faster than lawn grass, the fabric will coat it, but not touch the grass. In small clusters I apply it with a sponge brush. </p></div>		</li>
