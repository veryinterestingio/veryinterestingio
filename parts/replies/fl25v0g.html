			<div class="markdown"><p>Only at resting heart rate. Diastole makes up a smaller and smaller proportion of the cardiac cycle during increased heart rate. That's why there's a maximum point (generally theoretical for most people) where the heart actually starts pumping less effectively as it is rate limited by the time available to fill during diastole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But considering our balance of venous input and cardiac output, and the fact that increase in HR is almost always coupled with an increase in contraction (of course talking in a healthy person here), isn’t it all going to be relative?
Not saying you’re wrong in the slightest, I’m just looking to talk it through in order to have a best understanding</p></div>		</li>
