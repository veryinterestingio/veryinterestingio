			<div class="markdown"><p>Since this is a science-related sub, a way to test the source of the noise would be to have an AM signal with adjustable transmit power, then slowly lower it until it becomes swamped by noise in the radio output. Then use some kind of instrument to measure the actual noise level in that portion of the radio spectrum and see whether your signal is really being swamped by radio noise, or the noise floor of the amplifier is higher (I'd guess that it's like you say, the radio isn't up to picking up the background radio noise and it's simply internal amplifier noise).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best way to measure the noise/distortion through the receiver's circuitry would be to actually inject a fairly high level of signal into the receiver. Commonly this would be via a pure sine 1,000 Hz tone modulated by a signal generator on the test frequency. Compare the reproduced audio from the output (this can be at both the line input to the audio circuitry and the amplified audio output) to figure the distortion. </p>
<p>Now, you can also perform a receiver sensitivity test (such as 12 dB SINAD or 20 dB quieting) with the receiver on a dummy load via an ISO-T, record the value and then re-perform the test with the radio on an antenna. The dB value should be noted as that will show you your effective receiver sensitivity. You can then break that all apart, perform a bench test of sensitivity and then a figure the radio's noise floor and then apply the site noise difference to find the site noise floor. Very common testing for two-way radio systems today.</p></div>		</li>
