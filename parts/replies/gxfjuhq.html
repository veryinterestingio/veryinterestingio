			<div class="markdown"><p>All very subjective bit there are other factors at play. Cans allow for less light to get to the beer which could alter taste depending on storage location and length. </p>
<p>Plus as you are probs aware, lots of our perception of taste is actually smell. Newer style cans where the whole can top comes off can (argued, remember subjective) produce a better taste as there is more room for aromatics to hit the nose and mouth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah like the lip is still there but the entire top part comes off just like the old tabs. Maybe it is an Aussie thing... Only seen them on craft beers, def not common. Imo a much better experience then normal cans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All cans used to be like this. They stopped because the ring that comes off is sharp as fuck and people threw them eveywhere so they were a safety/littering hazard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might be surprised, try doing a blind taste test and you might find your actual preference to be different. </p>
<p>I recently did this at a party where everyone went in saying &quot;soda from a glass bottle tastes the best&quot; and to almost everyone's surprise, can was the overwhelming favorite. A couple people preferred the plastic bottle, not a single person preferred the glass bottled soda. </p>
<p>Even a blind taste taste has some forms of bias as well though. People weren't consistently just looking for what tasted best, rather they were looking for which sample they expected came from the glass bottle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For cans and glass bottles, I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the difference comes down to the taste and shape of the opening. By doing a blind taste test you are eliminating both of these factors</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's more fair to say glass is always more faithful to the original flavor. One may prefer a can, but glass is always going to be the most accurate representation of the product since it is nonporous and inert.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah i prefer canned soda 100% of the time. Beer i dont really care though, i think beer is pretty bad either way so i just try to get it down fast lol</p>
<p>And before people ask, I've tried at least 70 different types of beers, they aren't all bad for the same reasons but i dont like any of them lmao. Ciders are alright but i can only drink a couple before they start to make me feel like shit</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m really not the biggest fan of bottled beer. But like you said, subjective. My personal preference is Draught &gt; can &gt; bottle. I know plenty of people that hate canned beer and plenty that hate bottled. I think for me, the beer just tastes milder out of a bottle. Cans are nice and crisp when they’re cold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s not an opinion that’s a fact. Green bottles let more light through accelerating the breakdown of the beer causing it to “skunk” quicker than a brown bottle would which is why 90% of beers come in brown bottles</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My boss worked at a brewery at one point and said that it makes a big difference. UV can pass through the glass bottles and it affects the taste. </p>
<p>Specifically I've had multiple different people tell me how they find Heineken almost undrinkable in bottles, but it's great in cans. </p>
<p>I don't drink though so I don't actually know personally.</p></div>		</li>
