			<div class="markdown"><p>As an adjunct to help with imagining it, a neutron star is the next densest object. If you got just a teaspoon of the stuff it's made up of... It would explode, <em>violently</em>, like nuclear bomb violent, potentially even small supernova. But just before it blew, it would weigh several <em>hundred million tonnes</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to add something to what others have already explained.  When you're on the outside of a black hole, the singularity inside of it is a point in space - it's at the center of the black hole.  However, on the inside of a black hole (after you've passed through the event horizon), the singularity is no longer a point in space.  It is a point in time.  That is, it is inevitable that everything that enters a black hole will reach it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve heard people say “math stops making sense” but what does that actually mean or look like?</p>
<p>Is there a large formula that physicists keeps simplifying and then when it gets close to the end, you can’t divide by 0 or something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no physicist, just a nerd. I think your intuition is right. At some point, having a width of zero makes no sense because the math needs us to divide by the width.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I recall a math teacher or prof saying if you find yourself dividing by 0, you need to go back a nd find the mistake</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm that makes me wonder, our &quot;sense&quot; is based what we know is &quot;right&quot;, such as Math. What if we build our sense with things that can't be solved in the way we normally do? How much different would things be?</p>
<p>Physics never cease to amaze me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, is there a way that zero doesn't actually exist? Numbers just get infinitly smaller until they just become negative, but in the physical world, zero doesn't exist, only in theory?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It stops making sense if you try to relate math to the physical world.</p>
<p>For this example, pure mathematically for a black hole, there are 2 solutions to Einstein's field equations (complex stuff): the Schwartzschild radius which is the boundary where light can not escape the black hole, and something with radius of 0.</p>
<p>But what is an object with radius 0? The math makes sense but relating the math to our world is the problem, and there are many more examples where math and physical interpretation gets really weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not a physicist (yet), but if I had to guess it would probably be similar to trying to differentiate a noncontinuous function. If there’s a jump in a graph or diverging infinities at any point and you try to take the limit at that point, you will get an answer that’s DNE (does not exist). Math doesn’t like discontinuities and seems like blackholes are just holes in the graph of spacetime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, everything starts diverging towards infinity the closer you get to center. Density -&gt; infinity, length contraction -&gt; infinity, time dilation -&gt; infinity. If we approximate what that means for the singularity then time stands still, everything is infinitely far away and everything is infinitely dense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you’re saying the numbers are too big and too small to track which direction they’re going graphically?</p>
<p>I guess this would be a perfect use of quantum computation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, some equations of state would be just flat <em>wrong</em>, as they are based upon assumptions of the physical word, which are normally fine, but don't hold inside the event horizon. Also the relativistic effects would be insane, as you'd be subjected to accelerations that on paper could put above light speed, which is nonsense, at least outside a black hole.</p></div>		</li>
