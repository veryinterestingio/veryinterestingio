			<div class="markdown"><p>i have this too! if i close my eyes and see my vision get inward like you said with moving shapes i know i can fall asleep. my visions are colorless though. without the shadows i might as well stay up for a while.</p>
<p>reminds me of phenomenon called prisoner's cinema, where a visually sensory deprivied person can start hallucinating in a dim space. i get that too, but the sleep shapes are sharper and deeper in color.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have mild hallucinations in the dark as a kid!!  I would stare into my pitch black room at one point and watch the room get darker and darker until I’d start seeing things move, it was so vivid too. I can’t do it as much anymore but I should try hahah</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it feels meditative to just stare at the ceiling and watch the visual area of the brain do its thing..
there's a whole chapter for these hallucinations born from monotomy in neuroscientist Oliver Sack's book Hallucinations. they also mention people with visually monotonous jobs, like pilots and truck drivers, might be prone to prisoner's cinema and that might cause accidents. i enjoyed the book, maybe someone else in this thread will too</p></div>		</li>
