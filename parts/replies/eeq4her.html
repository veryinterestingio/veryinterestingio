			<div class="markdown"><p>It is ideal to do it after at least 3 sleep cycles but with practice, you can do it anytime you choose. Also, there are a group of people who have very low REM latency, me being one of them, who can dream immediately upon falling asleep. It is considered a pathology normally co-morbid with sleep apnea or narcolepsy even thought I suffer from neither. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes when I'm really tired as I'm falling asleep my mind starts to go wild like a dream like I'm hearing and seeing things as if it was a dream however I'm still awake and I'm aware I'm awake though that doesn't last long as I then fall asleep soon after. Is that anything like what you're talking about?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding on to this, it's not easy to do this. And also what one sees during lucid dreaming changes from person to person. These experiences have a lot to do with general state of mind as well. In order to have better sleep, it's very important to cultivate mindfulness. (I studied a lot of human brains)</p></div>		</li>
