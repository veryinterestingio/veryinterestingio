			<div class="markdown"><p>Also it's not really checking the path, electricity isn't smart. It's literally burning the air because the concentration of energy is so high. As it burns the air and creates an arc, it actually lowers the resistance in the path that it's literally burning. The first one to make it to ground takes the effective resistance down from megaohms to nearly nothing, so it all rushes through that path.</p>
<p>For an analogy, imagine a dam that's about to bust. The water is trying to get out at every single point of the dam. Somewhere it finds a little hole and some water starts leaking out. It slowly erods that hole bigger and bigger, allowing more and more water which increases the rate of erosion. Let's say multiple holes like that are forming because this dam is about to go. Eventually a hole so big forms that the structural integrity of the damn is compromised and it suddenly collapsed and all the water is free to flow now. The lighting finding that path to ground is that dam suddenly collapsing.</p>
<p>This is also kind of why water makes you easier to shock/electrocute. From fingertip to fingertip you are a pretty bitchin resistor. But with water the electricity can arc across the top of your skin if it's wet, destroying the skin from the sheer amount of energy passing over it. Now that your skin is gone, you're a terrible resistor because you have exposed blood/flesh/muscle that electricity can much more easily travel through.</p>
<p>Hope this helps! If anyone wants a source, I'm an EE.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm also an EE, though not a lightning expert. I like your explanation and I'm just spitballing here....</p>
<p>The path of the lightning is likely following the local electric field gradient, which is probably changing wildly as the air molecules are turning to plasma. I imagine there's a lot of randomness created here due to variations in impurities in the air, wind, oxygen and water concentration, and just randomness of the momentum of electrons as they ionize from the atoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you'd like another visual, rivers look the same for similar reasons. The water always takes the steepest path from where it is <strong>right now</strong> without finding an optimal route. This is why rivers will shift their course after a flood since the water found a better path to take.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be precise this isn't the lightning checking multple paths but rather multiple paths being created by the voltage difference between the ground and the clouds ionizing the air, the lightning doesn't follow the other paths because they are never closed as the voltage is equalized once the first path is closed.</p>
<p>Opposed to what people typically say in this sub electricity doesn't only follow the path of least resistance, electricity is following multiple paths all the time in accordance with Ohm's law, the lightning would follow multiple paths if they were already there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In accordance to Ohm's law, following multiple routes simultaneously is indeed the path of least resistance as the sum of the infinite amount of routes plugged into the parallel circuit equation gives you the actual resistance of any given circuit. It's analogous to the path integral.</p>
<p>So it's conceptually incorrect to think that a path is something akin to a line. Electricity in fact follows every possible line, and the integral of those lines forms a path.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems similar to how djikstras pathfinding works. It doesn't know the shortest path to the end, but it knows that this path is so far shorter than another one so it continues it until they're equalized and then continues using whichever one has the lowest overall weight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven’t done EM in quite a while, but when I was a young undergrad I used to think of Ohm’s Law (in general form) as physically describing a distribution of current in a spherical neighborhood of a point. Is that a reasonable interpretation of the actual physics? Don’t worry about dumbing down the equations, I’m a grad student in math.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it's not a circuit, it's an arc. Wouldn't it have equal resistance starting a new path (from any point along its current path) compared to pushing an existing path a bit farther? Assuming all else was equal, though in practice I would expect that it isn't equal and the arc pushes farther in any location where there are micro fluctuations in resistance, wether that be along the path or at its end.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Considering the horizon is typically about 5-15 miles away (depending how high up you are), you'd have between about 7 and 30 seconds of watching it assuming a completely clear horizon</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another fun fact, the tendrils of current heat the air, altering its electrical resistance. Enough current has flowed to the eventual &quot;greedy solution&quot; by the time it connects, that it causes that path to become the global optimum. This feeds back on itself, resulting in a runaway discharge, which is why the lightning bolt has such an impressively short duration.</p></div>		</li>
