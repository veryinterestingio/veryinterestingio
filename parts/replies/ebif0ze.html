			<div class="markdown"><p>If you wanna get really blown away, look up what happens on enormously dense objects like neutron stars.  When their material shifts around, on an interstellar body where a tablespoon weighs the same as an entire city, spinning thousands of times a minute, those events are called &quot;star quakes&quot;.  It's seriously cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was talking to a friend about InSight recently and trying to explain how &quot;measuring earthquakes will help us determine the makeup/state of its core... etc..&quot; and I didnt realize the mistake I'd made until later. It's strange how engrained the word earthquakes is in my mind in relation to seismic activity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind, mining those iceballs for water and other chemicals could be big business in the future as well.  Not metal deposits like OP was asking but still valuable resources.  </p></div>		</li>
