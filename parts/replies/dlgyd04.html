			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the mother sound is typically the soft consonant (m) and the father sound is a hard consonant.  I presume this is because the soft sound is easier to make and the mother is historically the closest bond.  The second sound learned belongs to the next closest.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, our first daughter said a variation of the dog's name before a name for my wife.  The dog was constantly in her face, and we were always correcting him.  So she heard that more than anything!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My daughter &quot;said&quot; mama and dada first, but interchangeably for both her father and I, her first word with real intent was our cats name. She sees him and yells &quot;DASH!&quot; And I'm like &quot;oh come on now, you can make the &quot;sh&quot; sound but can't say things like &quot;up&quot; and &quot;more?!&quot; 😂</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom works with babies and moms and told me she's actually pretty sure the d sound is easier than the m sound, and that a lot of moms end up disappointed when the baby says dada first. Apparently it's super common. </p>
<p>I think every baby kind of develops sounds in various order though, one of my nephews said nothing but &quot;takka takka&quot; for like 6 months and the other made this long &quot;babagabagaba!!!&quot; that seemed to just stretch on until he was out of breath. There must be a lot of randomness to what sounds each baby makes first. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: when babies first start babbling, they make any random sound that comes to mind. But starting at about three months old (I think...linguists, correct me if my time frame is wrong) babies will babble ONLY in the sounds found in their language (or the language they hear people speaking around them, rather). It's one of the first steps to language acquisition!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are scientific studies of many languages that demonstrate the babies learn the consonant sounds in a loosely structured manner. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/femRxDr.jpg" target="_blank">Here's a chart for English</a>. /m/ generally comes before /d/ but they are both early developing. Here's a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/LuyuhKG.png" target="_blank">comparison of English and Latin American Spanish</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it depends on the baby. My almost 10 month old daughters are fraternal twins. At 8 months one baby could say &quot;mama&quot; and the other &quot;dada.&quot; The daughter that could pronounce mama first, I believe, first learned to do it as an unexpected outcome of crying. Whereas the other daughter just started babbling dadada out of the blue one day. I don't believe they're using those sounds/syllables as signifiers, yet. But I'm guessing parental response to those syllables plays a large role in assigning the &quot;mama&quot; and &quot;dada&quot; titles. </p></div>		</li>
