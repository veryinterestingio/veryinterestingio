			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the original commenter, but mindfulness helps by letting you realize that the main problem is your interpretation of your body's reactions, not the reactions themselves. You can take a step back and look at what's happening without letting it affect your fear response. Often times, a panic attack is just a domino effect because you feel your heartbeat accelerating or cold hands etc. and get scared of a potential panic attack, involuntarily creating it in the process. Also, when you are able to pause this spiral, you get the time to distract yourself by concentrating on your surroundings and getting out of your head for a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me, a panic attack felt like my body was overriding all of my thought processes with the physical message that my body was experiencing some kind of catastrophic failure. Attacks filled me with adrenaline and narrowed my awareness to a few key sensations and conclusions (can’t feel, can’t breathe, must be dying, etc) upon which I would fixate to the exclusion of all other facts and ideas.</p>
<p>Over time, mindfulness training allowed me to refocus and be aware of my surroundings even under extreme circumstances. It took practice. To make the therapy work faster, I started writing things down during panic attacks. I’m not sure if that particular approach would work for everyone but I do feel it helped me. </p>
<p>I used to go to the ER during attacks because I’m chronically ill and it would sometimes trigger an actual attack of physical sickness, which would cause hives, wheezing, blood pressure drops and sores to form in my mouth. I was prescribed benzodiazepines to stop the attacks, but I got rebound attacks from the drug wearing off, so I got stuck in kind of a cycle.</p>
<p>With the mindfulness, I was able to mentally interrupt the attacks without drugs. It was kind of like walking my thoughts slowly backward out of a place that would feed the panic feeling. After a while, the cycle was broken, and I just stopped having attacks.</p>
<p>I can’t really explain how to do it because my therapist would talk to me about my specific thinking patterns as they arose. I’d just recommend to anyone who wants to try it, find a therapist who teaches mindfulness. Mine was a cognitive-behavioral therapist (CBT), but I think other kinds of therapists do it too, because my therapist said she took a separate course to learn how to teach mindfulness.</p></div>		</li>
