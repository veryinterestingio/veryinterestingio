<p>&quot;there is not less O2 at high altitudes...&quot; !
&quot; the weight of all the air above you allows the permeable membranes in your lungs to absorb the O2...&quot;
&quot;Putting on an oxygen mask... works well [ONLY] until 20-30,000 feet...&quot;</p>

<p>This last nugget explains to me why military planes that go above 70k feet all need <em>pressurized</em> suits, not just oxygen masks. </p>
<p>Thanks again, this was brilliant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add some detail.  What really matters is what's known as the  partial pressure of the oxygen.  At sea level, air is roughly 21% oxygen.  Air pressure at sea level is 14.7 PSI.  So we're used to roughly 3psi of oxygen.  At 10k feet, the pressure is about 10.1 PSI, with a partial pressure of 2.1psi of oxygen.  Most people need about 2psi to function.  So we need to figure out how to keep that psi above this number.  Raising the air pressure has failed (that's why it's a depressurization), so we need to give you a higher percent of oxygen.  50/50 air/oxygen (lets say a cheaply fitted emergency mask) would give you about 6 psi of oxygen (if you do the math, the air contains some oxygen as well).  More then enough to keep you conscious.</p>
<p>So let's keep climbing.  20k feet:  6.75 psi.  50/50 air would give you \~4psi.   30k feet:  4.36 psi.  50/50 would give you 2.6 psi. 35k feet: 3.46 psi, gives you 2psi, and you start passing out, even with so-so fitted mask.  You now start needing a good mask, feeding you 100% oxygen.  On pure oxygen, you're now getting 3.5psi again.  40k feet has about  2.71 psi of outside pressure.  So you can work just fine if you're getting pure oxygen.  At 45k feet the pressure is  2.10 psi, right on our edge of functioning.</p>
<p>Now the problem starts changing.  The outside air pressure is dropping under 2psi, but you need at least 2psi to remain functional.  So let's go up to 50k feet.  Outside air pressure is 1.61, but you need 2 psi.  If you put 2 PSI into a normal mask, it'll just escape around the sides.  So you need a special mask that hugs onto your face.  Cue the military style ones you see.  Those strap around the back of your head in some way, and hold on, that prevents the mask from being blown off by the pressurized air.  Now you can get 2 PSI even if you're above 50k feet.</p>
<p>As you keep climbing, things get even stranger.  As you cross some heights, your skin starts really disliking the low pressure, which is why you have to wear pressurized suits in some cases.</p>
<p>Also, the 2psi number I used is just to do okay.  People's reactions vary, but they won't be performing at their best.  You might feel drunk, dizzy, disoriented, and not even realize it.  You want a pilot of a plane operating at peak performance, so you want to make sure they are getting the full 3psi.  So that's why the pilot's have really specialized masks, and we get the cheap ones.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are a couple of things that you have to understand in order to answer this question. First, there is not less O2 at hight altitudes as long as you are still in the troposphere/tropopause (layer of atmosphere closest to earth, and where all passenger planes fly, up to about 65,000 feet).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is simplified to the point of being wrong. While the percentage of oxygen in the air is the same at high altitude, due to the overall much lower pressure the partial pressure of oxygen (which is what's actually relevant) is dramatically lower. Or put differently, at hight there are less oxygen atoms in a given volume of air because that air is less dense. So there <em>is</em> less oxygen at high altitudes.</p>
<p>I don't know why you linked a site that just explains what the troposphere is to cite that section of your post.
This site has a nice short explainantion of what's happening:
<a href="https://www.wildsafe.org/resources/outdoor-safety-101/altitude-safety-101/high-altitude-oxygen-levels/" target="_blank">https://www.wildsafe.org/resources/outdoor-safety-101/altitude-safety-101/high-altitude-oxygen-levels/</a></p>
<p>And the part about the pressure &quot;pushing&quot; O2 into your lungs is a really convoluted way of saying what actually happens: At lower altitude the air is more compressed, so the pressure is higher. And because the makeup of the air is the same, the partial pressure of O2 is higher. Or again put more simple: Denser air at lower altitude-&gt;more molecules of O2 in a given volume of air. Your body can absorb the O2 just fine, at high altitudes there just isn't enough oxygen in the volume of air you can realistically breathe in and out. </p>
<p>And like you said, the oxygen mask does nothing but simply introduce more O2 molecules into the air you breathe, which raises the partial pressure of O2. And like you also correctly point out, there is a limit to this, because if the overall pressure is low enough, even pure O2 you breathe in won't result in a high enough O2 pressure to stay conscious unless you pressurize the O2 you breathe in.</p>
<p>Or again put more simple: Your lungs work via diffusion. When there are few oxygen atoms in the air, there are few oxygen atoms in your blood and vice versa. At hight, there are few oxygen atoms in the air because the air is at a lower pressure. And if the pressure is low enough, then even in a 100% oxygen environment there are too few oxygen atoms getting into your lung to keep you conscious.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The point being conveyed is correct, but what an odd and misleading way of getting there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This alone is not correct. From your own link: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Air pressure and the density of the air also decrease with altitude.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yes, there is less oxygen per unit volume, in addition to the pressure being lower, which are related. This means there is a lower partial pressure of O2 the higher you go.</p></div>		</li>
