<p>I know densely packed organic matter can get very warm from anaerobic bacteria. I wonder if any of these decaying thatched roofs ever warmed the place up on a rainy day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anaerobic decay (lack of oxygen) still requires moisture and only the top layer of the thatch on a functioning roof will see any moisture. So, anaerobic decay is highly unlikely. The top most layer of reeds will weather, mold, and slowly decay but even if you put a straw bail half buried in the ground with constant moisture contact it would take up to 6 months or more to decay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2 out of 3 houses I've owned were going on 25 and 20 years for builder grade 3-tab shingles. The first one never failed before I replaced it except a few lifted nails here and there and this second one is just about 20 years on the dot and holding up just fine. </p>
<p>For reference, 3-tab shingles were only really rated to 15-20 years. It's all about the quality of installation and your climate (to include attic ventilation).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, if you put the same mass (let alone thickness) of shingle as you would thatch, it would probably last a lot longer.  </p>
<p>(Shingle normally weighs \~3lbs/sq ft, Thatch tips the scale at \~7lbs/sq ft: <a href="https://roofonline.com/weight-of-roofing-materials" target="_blank">https://roofonline.com/weight-of-roofing-materials</a>)</p></div>		</li>
