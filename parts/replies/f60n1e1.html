			<div class="markdown"><p>It's unconsciously done and happens slowly over a period of time. It's kind of like us at night, we start to slow down as we get tired, until we fall asleep, and it's a natural process that our body just does.

<p>If you're curious, there's been related, but isolated, incidents of humans going into limited hibernation in severely cold temperatures.</p></div>		</li>
