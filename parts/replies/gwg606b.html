			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually when this notation is used it's to keep consistent with the chord being played. For example, the E major triad has the notes E - G# - B. In an E major triad with an augmented 5th, the 5th note in the scale (B) is raised a half step. While it's technically the same as playing a C note, for music theory reasons it's written as E - G# - B# so it isn't confused with something else, like some weird inversion of an augmented C chord (C - E - G#).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's the what no one is mentioning. Western sheet music has spacing for 7 tones and they are always ABCDEFG. If your key is F# major, your seventh note would be F. There is no way to notate 2 Fs on the same sheet. So your E is sharp in this case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had to scroll pretty far to see the correct answer. Notation is as fluid and arbitrary as anything else in music theory. It makes sence in a practical way, but not always in a scientific or mathematical way. People in this thread talking about frequencies are clueless; did you all know that the tone colour of instruments has actually shifted over time, as much as a whole tone in some European regions? What did musicians do before the high tech equipment we have today; that's right they played out of tune. This makes sense if you think about what musical notation does for the musician, it represents the relationship between notes, and has not been standardized throughout the world. Western music theory is the tip of the iceberg, but westerners think of it as if it were science, it's not. The standards people use for music shift over time, depending on the group of musicians, the style of music, and the musical inclinations of the specific musician.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You also have double sharps and flats thanks to how some Modes (the fancy name for Keys) would treat scales starting at certain roots, as each key is just a pattern of which keys you skip and the note you start at, plus the name of the pattern (mode) is the name. They just go an additional half step (key) further than they would have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modes are generally distinct from keys in that &quot;key&quot; refers either to pitch collection or to tonal scales, whereas modes refer to specific usages of pitches within a collection, following a theory separate from tonal theory (i.e. modal theory). There are also different modal theories throughout history.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh, modes. Those get really interesting when you start playing in strange keys. Things can sound really wrong to our Western ears. </p>
<p>Try listening to F Lydian. That tritone just grates. Lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thought that depends on your tuning. I’m not an expert here but I believe there can actually be a difference in frequency between a B# and a C in like pythagorian tuning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is right but for beginners it can be ignored. Also instruments like the keyboard are tuned in a way where those notes are the same. For fun read about just intonation vs. equal tempered. Every note has a slightly different frequency depending on which key it is in with just intonation.</p></div>		</li>
