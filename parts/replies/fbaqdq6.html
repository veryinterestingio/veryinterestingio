			<div class="markdown"><p>Most professional observations require multiple exposures anyway. Acquisition of a target takes tens of minutes, so you're not going to just take one shot once you're there. IR in particular requires dithering around the object to reject sky background.</p>
<p>Here's an example of what a modern astronomical image looks like:

<p>Note the gaps between chips, saturation, noise, and chip flaws. All of these need to be processed out, and having multiple exposures is one of the ways they do that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two streaks. One from the top middle to the middle right and the other from the middle left to bottom right.</p>
<p>The satellites travelled the entire frame during the exposure. This is mostly due to the long exposure time of probably single digit seconds.</p></div>		</li>
