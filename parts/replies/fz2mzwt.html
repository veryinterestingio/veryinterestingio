			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s mostly this. It’s less a continuous evolution than you might see in architecture, because—in that field—new materials make new things possible in a way that is less true of physical art media.</p>
<p>Throughout historical and geographic regions, artistic styles have continually morphed. It has always been possible to draw / paint / sculpt an exactly realistic form, given sufficient time, but it is not always fashionable or desirable to do so in a given cultural context.</p>
<p>You can add greater religious dominance into the mix as well, because many religious doctrines demand that art either avoids realistic depictions entirely, includes symbolism, or exaggerates certain features.</p>
<p>For example, in the Classical Greek world, sculpted bodies were given longer limbs and more defined musculature than occurs in reality to emphasise athleticism, which was a highly desirable trait in the dominant culture. Conversely, male genitalia were presented as smaller than the population’s likely average because it was believed that male genitalia were the home of a man’s base instincts, and the culture valued logic and emotionally devoid reasoning over such animalistic instincts. Depictions of men on the drinking cups used for parties, however, often have massively oversized penises because the environment in which the cups were to be used was one in which logic and reasoning were to be let go.</p>
<p>It’s all down to culture, fashion and values. Any art form is always a product of the culture from which it derives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nefertiti's sculptured head appeared in the middle of thousands of years of a very static artistic style.  It clearly shows that artists could paint/sculpt far more realistically then they did.  They just weren't operating under the same aesthetic and culture interpretation as we are now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, people also forget that artists explore styles. Picasso’s early work was realistic and even reminiscent of the masters.</p></div>		</li>
