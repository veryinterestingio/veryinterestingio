			<div class="markdown"><p>This, but evolution of the eye has also erred this way; the “I see something!” signal to the brain is always trying to fire, but is blocked by chemicals. When light does hit the eye, it changes the blocking chemicals, letting the signal go to the brain. It takes a little while for those chemicals to recover from being disabled, which is why looking at a bright light leaves a bright splotch for a bit. These chemicals aren’t always able to fully block the signal that really really wants to go (especially when warm, like at body temperature, which is why research imagers are cryo cooled), causing the sparkles you see. This also gives us exceptional night vision</p></div>		</li>
