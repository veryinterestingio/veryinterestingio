			<div class="markdown"><p>Hate to break it to you: very few if any cable stations have 1080p signals. The US uses 2 standards in television signal delivery: 1080i and 720p. </p>
<p>1080p is mostly only used for streaming, but it’s heavily compressed. 1080p is a large signal. </p></div>		</li>

<p>3840x2160 is almost universally supported in games today.</p>
<p>There’s also a big and growing amount of 4K content on Netflix, Amazon, and the like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the one thing i never understood. We always referred to the resolution using the height, and come 4k, we suddenly went with the width. Was that just a marketing ploy to make 4k seem so much better than 1080?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How is 1080p more bandwidth heavy than 1080i? Shouldn't it be the same? The difference is just the nature of what order the lines on the screen are rendered in. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went to write it up but this just explains it so much better. </p>
<p>1080i video is &quot;interlaced.&quot; 1080i video plays back at 60 frames per second, but that's a bit deceptive, because it's actually broadcast at 30 frames per second. The TV then displays those frames twice, in a way—the first pass is 1,920-by-540 for the even scan line field, and the second pass is 1,920-by-540 for the odd scan line field. The process by which this occurs is called interlacing. It contributes to a sense of motion and reduces perceived flicker.</p>
<p>1080p video is called &quot;progressive scan.&quot; In this format, 1,920-by-1,080-pixel high-definition movies are progressively drawn line after line, so they're not interlaced. On paper, that may not seem like a huge deal. But in the real world, what you end up seeing looks sharper and more defined than 1080i, particularly during scenes with a lot of fast motion.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes it much clearer, but I guess what I'm wondering is why we're still in a state where cable TV can't keep up to output higher quality signals. </p>
<p>Why is the compression necessary? What would need to happen to improve this? Do they need to lay down new wires? I'm guessing this isn't going to happen because they don't have an incentive to do it. </p>
<p>Also, my Comcast box differentiates between 1080i and 1080p (60hz) for the signal but the results are the same. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cable Systems are built to carry a certain range of frequencies. There is a forward path and a return path. Many cable systems now days have a forward path from 85MHz to 750 MHz, 860MHz or 1GHz. In America each channel channel is 6 MHz wide. So you have a limited number of channels to work with (130ish channels on 860 system). We commonly use 256QAM Modulation, giving you 38.8 Mbps of bandwidth for  each channel. If you want to deliver Gigabit Internet, you need at least 32 channels. That is a big chunk of the space. Now on to video. The idea is to utilize the space you have as much as possible. You can cram 12 digital SD channels in that 6MHz space, or 3 HD channels. That means 3 HD streams share 38 Mbps. So it is a simple math problem (system bandwidth gives you X number of channels, some are HSD, some are video, some are other services). The average user doesn't notice the fact it is over compressed. Just like how radio stations play songs faster. To answer your questions...The compression is necessary to get the maximum number of channels they can in the bandwidth they have available. Improve this... Compress less (2:1 HD instead of 3:1), this would mean you have to carry less channels, or expand your bandwidth. Lay down new wires... No. Extending the frequency range if the system is how cable companies can offer more. If they are a 750MHz system, they can upgrade to 860 MHz, 1GHz, or 1.2 GHz. However this is expensive, and requires physically moving and adding hardware in field. Another way to increase your bandwidth is to increase your Modulation from 256 QAM to something higher like 4096. This brings a whole new set of challenges and consideration, but it is happening.
With so many people streaming video, many cable companies choose to invest in the HSD part of their system, and are not going to invest in video, as profit margins are low.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would not be technically hard for a DSS satellite company to content-merge with a cable company and have the &quot;cable box&quot; accept an RF-in from a DirectTV or Dish bird or set of them.  This would free up cable's RF space used for nationwide networks.*  Then the cable video frequencies could be used for local OTA TV and sports.</p>
<p>It would be a political folly, have potential anti-trust issues, and backtrack on cable's marketing of &quot;OMG look at that ugly high-maintenance dish on that guy's house.&quot;</p>
<p>*But cable would lose the local ad inserts without add'l trickery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Networks are only sending out a compressed 720p or 1080i stream. If you set your cable box to 1080p, it's upscaling the 720p content and deinterlacing the 1080i content.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is true, it ignores something very important; the vast majority of programming is shot at 24fps, and when a 24p signal is broadcast over 1080i, it does so using a method that allows your television or cable box to  convert it back to the original 24p signal.  This won't apply to live TV like sports casts etc that are shot at 60p and then broadcast 60i, but even in that case, newer TV's can interpolate the missing field lines well enough that compression is generally much more noticable than any deinterlacing/interpolation artifacting.</p>
<p>IE if you're watching a movie or normal TV show shot at 24fps like the vast majority are, a 1080i60 signal <em>will</em> result in a true 1080p24 picture. </p></div>		</li>
