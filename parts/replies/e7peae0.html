<p>Oh that's interest...wait, did he say &quot;test engineers&quot;?</p>
<p>Edit: hypergolic means it's prone to spontaneously combust.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those of you who volunteered to be injected with praying mantis DNA, I've got some good news and some bad news. Bad news is we're postponing those tests indefinitely. Good news is we've got a much better test for you: fighting an army of mantis men. Pick up a rifle and follow the yellow line. You'll know when the test starts.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This passage from that is great:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is, of course, extremely toxic, but that's the least of the problem. It is hypergolic with every known fuel, and so rapidly hypergolic that no ignition delay has ever been measured. It is also hypergolic with such things as cloth, wood, and test engineers, not to mention asbestos, sand, and water—with which it reacts explosively. It can be kept in some of the ordinary structural metals—steel, copper, aluminum, etc.—because of the formation of a thin film of insoluble metal fluoride that protects the bulk of the metal, just as the invisible coat of oxide on aluminum keeps it from burning up in the atmosphere. If, however, this coat is melted or scrubbed off, and has no chance to reform, the operator is confronted with the problem of coping with a metal-fluorine fire. For dealing with this situation, I have always recommended a good pair of running shoes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It breaks down to hydrofluoric and hydrochloric acid as it reacts, so even if you get around the fact that you're 🔥, you've got a likely fatal case of fluorine poisoning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hydrofluoric acid is corrosive to human tissue, is absorbed through skin, selectively attacks bone, interferes with nerve function, and causes often-fatal fluorine poisoning. Although hydrochloric is much less toxic to humans, it is often more corrosive than hydrofluoric acid.</p>
