<p>I had the horrible experience of hearing my cat scream as she was bitten by a dog.   It was a high-pitched, blood-curdling <em>scream</em> like I’ve never heard before or since.   I managed to get to her and detach the dog, but she looked perfectly fine.  Kitty stoicism kicked in after that, so it was almost a week before the vet and I could figure out that the dog had ripped open her abdominal muscles and caused a hernia.  She has since recovered and is totally fine.  </p>
<p>I’ve also known cats to squeal if their tails are stepped on, for a less extreme example.</p></div>		</li>
