			<div class="markdown"><p>Are the trajectories truly parallel if the objects are further and further apart over time? How is the expansion of the universe different than, say, two parallel trajectories that enter the schwarzschild radius of a black hole?</p>
<p>Even though the trajectories might be such that they will travel for an infinite time before actually colliding (the moment when they finally enter the singularity), isn't the fact that they are getting closer together sufficient to demonstrate that they aren't traveling in parallel? Either way, we are talking about the expansion/compression of space-time. But it seems more intuitive to me that they are not parallel when considering black holes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>so their previous paths will also be further apart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If measured again, yes.  But if their past distances apart were measured only once per location, and then these distances graphed, they would appear to be diverging, correct?  So the path would only be considered parallel if we disregard the past <em>actual</em> distances and instead only measure the distance all points along their path simultaneously and instantaneously?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would assume their direction remains the same at any instance in time, but if you consider path over time, then they appear to not be parallel comparing some old ball of space to some new ball of space, but you can't really stand outside of space and view one over the other.  So if they are both headed toward some distant galaxy, both will still head for the same distant galaxy regardless of how large the expansion.</p>
<p>Edit to add...</p>
<p>If each packet of light left a trail of breadcrumbs, both lines of crumbs would remain straight and parallel while the distance between lines of breadcrumbs would increase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe this is not a good comparison, but couldn't we imagine drawing parallel lines on an inflated balloon, then inflating it further.</p>
<p>Now imagine we were ants on the surface of that balloon, looking at a short segment of these lines. We're too small to see the curvature of the balloon. We just see two lines that we can project to their slightly separated &quot;sources&quot;. Unbeknownst to us, the balloon was less inflated at the outset. So we consider the lines to be parallel.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong> Thinking about it, maybe I should have said that the lines are being drawn <em>as</em> the balloon inflates, but at our ant scale for space and time, the distortion is infinitesimal <del>and our own optical equipment is stretching at the same time</del>. As a non-physicist, I'd better not try to take this further!</p>
<p>(I had a doubt and crossed out the behavior of the optical equipment).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with a balloon analogy is that it's an example of a Universe with positive geometry, not flat geometry like we believe our Universe to be. Still a great way of demonstrating inflation in an intuitive way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We could, but I think that would require an at least slightly non-intuitive understanding of what it means for a flight path to be parallel to another. Generally, I understand it as something along the following lines: if I draw a line that follows the path an object took, it is only parallel to another trajectory if and only if the distances between the two objects are the same throughout that trajectory.</p>
<p>That being said, I think I understand what you mean. If the balloon is growing in a way that does not affect the actual trajectories of either particle, you can always calculate them in reverse (calculate what the past trajectory might have looked like if the balloon had been in the current state from the beginning). Since both particles are influenced in the same way by the expansion of the universe (balloon), their trajectories are parallel, even if their distances aren't equal over time?</p>
<p>This is all speculation. Wondering how far off I am...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you drew the paths based measured distance over time they may appear divergent. But if you took a snapshot of their velocity vector at any point in time the two would always be parallel. Also if you referenced the points in space over time the lines would remain parallel because the space expanded between points equally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The expansion of &quot; the universe&quot; is not only of space but rather of spacetime.  So the past has also expanded ... And to will the future .. in three dimensional space  The photons remain parallel..   there is no escaping the point of reference...   Pls correct me if I'm wrong but we would have to be in a higher dimension to be able to measure any dirvergance ...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you were to map their path using some sort of marker, as they're moving, the path will always be parallel.</p>
<p>Or even if you had a map (but one made up of many free-floating dots rather than a single sheet) and you would mark their path on the map, the paths on the map will always be parallel (because the dots making up your map will move further apart by the exact right amount).</p></div>		</li>

Then move the pieces of paper apart from each other perpendicular to the split. Observe how the lines stay parallel while moving away from each other.</p>
