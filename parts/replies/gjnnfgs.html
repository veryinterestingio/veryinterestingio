			<div class="markdown"><p>Extra weight can be a feature. I have a small, light camera that I use on a weighted shoulder rig that makes it much more stable and comfortable to use, as it balances and puts all the weight on my shoulder, instead of having to hold it out in front of me which can be very tiring and shaky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A phone camera will never get the same quality in sub optimal conditions simply because of the amount of light that is able to enter the lenses. Middle of day you won't see much difference but middle of the night where your only light is streetlamps you will. The difference will be, well, night and day. You are also right about a tripod being better for static shots. The shoulder mount is superior for &quot;live on the scene&quot; shooting and things such as impromptu interviews. They each have pros and cons are are both used for their respective strengths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iphone and android cameras are nice, but they're &quot;consumer grade&quot; nice. They do what they do with a lot of tricks via the software. Problem is those tricks are only stopgap measures for their shortcomings. Yes, that's easily enough for capturing some HD pics of the family get together, but it's nowhere near enough for the wide array of things an actual professional grade camera can do.</p>
<p>First is the lens. The lens on your phone is garbage. Its so limited that the software has to make up for it to make you THINK it can zoom. Notice how your camera phone, at full zoom is grainy as hell? It didn't actually zoom. It just enlarged a small section of the sensor. Also, becuase it's only focusing on a small portion of the sensor, it can't use as much light so its grainy, too. The professional camera gear has an actual precision set of lenses that mount to the camera body. Those lenses magnify the thing that the camera is focused on and allows the sensor to continue to capture full HD. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMxjFTtTquc" target="_blank">This car chase in houston is a good example of a good lens.</a> The car in the vid was going faster than the news chopper could fly and they relied on the lens to keep tracking. They could see the car from 20+ miles away. TWENTY MILES. No way on earth your iphone does that.</p>
<p>Second is the body. I'm not an expert, I have only tangential experience and knowledge, but I know enough to know that these machines are built super robust and that's expensive. Things happen all the time and the operator needs the camera to operate at ANY cost. If the operator is shot (it's happened) and drops the camera, that thing has to keep rolling and clearly because that feed may be vital for the public and law enforcement. The sensor records actual HD, not compressed or scaled down, but the real deal and it has to broadcast that signal in real time to the station. Phones just can't do that. The amount of power required to broadcast that big of a data stream that quickly is enough to kill a phone battery in a few minutes. It's so much that the battery may overheat and damage the phone. Also, the camera has specialty settings that allow it to operate in super adverse conditions such as super bright light or super dark places. </p>
<p>Third, the sound. I'm a bit of an audiophile, I enjoy me some quality sound. I can hear the difference between sound recorded on a headphone/phone mic and a good mic. When your phone is on its radio receiver and not data or wifi, it cuts a LOT of frequencies out. That's why old phones have such a metalic and muted quality. That's why &quot;HD&quot; calls sound nicer. It's using more bandwidth for more of the audio spectrum. Newspeople use high end mics that require external power sources and capture a MASSIVE amount of the sound spectrum. Why? Because not only is what we see in the news important, so it what we hear. Also, it's good production practice to match audio quality from multiple sources. You don't want your studio sounding nice and your field anchor sound like they're screaming through a tin can on the other side of a field.</p>
<p>Finally, that stability thing. Cameras on phones have &quot;auto steady&quot;, but if you watch carefully it causes a slight delay in the image on the screen. This is another trick. The camera records video and edits out images that deviate too far from what it determines is a &quot;neutral&quot; position. The result is less shake, but an uneven number of frames as it tries to compensate. The other problem there is that it's so light that wind will knock it over. Doing a weather report on a storm? The wind will make it hard for you to set up a tripod. Also, since the phone is aerodynamic it can also be pulled form your hand. A heavy camera takes more &quot;power&quot; to knock over if on a tripod but will still shake the image. A person <em>holding</em> the big camera can compensate for the changed in the wind and keep things more steady and the camera's weight can be absorbed into the body which acts as a shock absorber.</p>
<p>These machines can do a LOT that even high end consumer cameras (like the canon T series) can't do and they're hardy machines capable of operating as a partial production studio all on their own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The quality coming out of modern smart phones is beyond shocking.... But I can tell you that when you start printing larger images with non standard setups (ie, not 50mm effective 35mm focal length and good light with a the aperture stopped down) you really start to like the heavy setups. I was once shooting a football game in high school with some mediocre gear. a pro swapped with me for a quarter. When I got my gear back I could see my heartbeat in the view finder. That's what sealed it in for me how important heavy gear is (not to mention the quality was better because it was all high end shit....for the time. Canon 1d mk ii bitches! Fuck I'm old. It was mated to a 70 200 2.8, or was it a 300 2.8. can't remember)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cameras with a single sensor for three colors require the pixels to be arranged in a special way, because you simply can't make a grid of equal amounts of red, green, and blue. So they typically use a Bayer filter, which has double the number of green sensors than red and blue. This is good enough in normal cases, except it reduces the sensor resolution because you need more than one photosensor for each pixel.</p>
<p>3-sensor (that's the technical term) cameras don't have this problem, so they have better resolution and equal detail generation from all three colors</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are there any modern three sensor cameras? I've never heard of one.</p>
<p>Edit: I guess there are as I just found some... but like why? Bayer works for extremely good cameras.</p>
<p>Edit: There isn't much info but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkqoWimLlO8" target="_blank">this video claims a number of benefits</a>, seems like more trouble than it's worth though</p></div>		</li>
