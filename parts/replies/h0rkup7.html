			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was an undergrad, I worked in an ER at a regional trauma center. My first day there, a GSW comes in, and he was declared very quickly. </p>
<p>I was talking with the ER attending earlier in the shift, so he knew I was interested in going to medical school. After the patient was declared, the Attending had me come over and put on a pair of gloves. </p>
<p>He then directed me to put my hand in the entry wound. I did so, and I asked what I was feeling. He told me I was feeling the inside of the guy’s left ventricle. He then told me the guy was a good shot, obliterated the apex of his heart, and pretty much died instantly. (He didn’t say the guy died instantly)</p>
<p>I ended up going to an Allied Health school to become a Respiratory Therapist, and this was one of the most amazing experiences.</p></div>		</li>
