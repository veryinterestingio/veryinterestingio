			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it was good to get the big picture from Menalaas, and I was definitely interested in things on a molecular/cellular scale. It's interesting to hear about the very specific mechanisms at this tiny scale.</p>
<p>So from your answer, I understand that low oxygen = pVHL can't work like it usually does, so HIF-1a doesn't get degraded and causes a sort of chain reaction of other proteins.</p>
<p>I guess my question now is, the little blood vessels start growing away, but do we know how they decide to connect to each other once they bump into each other? Do we know, really specifically, how capillaries connect to each other instead of just growing alongside each other? (not sure if that question makes sense).</p></div>		</li>
