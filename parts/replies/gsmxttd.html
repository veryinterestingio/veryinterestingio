			<div class="markdown"><p>We had a small chicken operation when I was a kid (1980s) and I would candle eggs with a halogen flashlight in a darkened coup. The easist solution to u/alexl14 question is, you check the boxes twice or three times a day.  </p>
<p>Everyone morning and evening M-F, and add Noon on Sat/Sun... that was my job as the primary cost center for my parents. ;P I helped give back by managing the day to day care, feeding, butchering, and egg harvesting of our livestock. And since I was checking laying repeatedly every day, it didnt matter. Those eggs were washed and in the fridge sometimes just a few minutes after laying. The cold not only preserves the egg, but takes care of any fertilization.  </p>
<p>If we WANTED eggs to get fertilized, we upped the food slightly as well as table scrapes and fresh veggies from our garden patch that went to look (or underdeveloped). So, basically we decreased stress and increased the quality and quantity of the food supply. I was also consistant in cleaning the coup, that didnt change... so the patterns would hold in their little chicken universe. :)  </p>
<p>Overall it was mostly an enjoyable experience. Never cared much for the spring culling of young roosters though. I am not completly OK with choosing who &quot;gets to stay&quot;, ususally its pretty ovbious. Biggest, healthiest, etc.. &quot;winner winner, the rest are chicken dinner.&quot; But the fried chicken helped to asuage my sorrows. lol My issue wasnt the &quot;ewww gross&quot; part, but the whole who lives and dies thing. But I also learned that wether I wanted it to happen or not, it was GOING TO, so I might as well do it myself and choose wisely and make the rest of the process a quick, clean, and not too scary one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s probably a great thing. I’ve hunted and fished my whole life pretty much. I love it, I can shoot a deer or catch a fish, butcher it, cook it, and eat it no problem, but if I cracked an egg open and a fetus came rolling out, I’d lose my shit. Dry heaving and crap. </p>
<p>I have a decent amount of Native American blood in me (like 25%ish). So growing up my grandma thought it was important I learn to do that stuff. If you’ve hunted with Native Americans very little is wasted. That would be disrespectful for the animal who you shot. I’m pretty sure even grandma woulda been like eww throw it out and let’s start fresh with a chicken fetus.</p></div>		</li>

They passed over extremely bright lights on a section of a conveyor, and I would remove double yolk/thin shelled eggs. No embryos were ever present, because you'd notice someone sneaking a rooster into the sheds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You only check eggs for development if you're running a hatchery. Freshly laid fertilized eggs will have no visible indication of growth of the embryo.</p>
<p>At 7-8 days of incubation, you'll be able to tell (with a bit of learning or a good eye) if you have a fertilized egg.</p>
<p>From the day a chicken egg is laid until it hatches is an average of 21 days for most laying breeds. </p>
<p>If there's no rooster, the eggs won't be fertilized.
If there's a rooster and a small number of hens (3-15) there's a pretty good chance most are fertilized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You seem to know a lot about this. I have a rooster and two hens and assume all the eggs are fertilized. But for some reason, no brooding is happening. The hens won't sit on their eggs. Theyre almost 1 year old. Would you know why this is?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they're under a year old, they're just barely old enough to start laying, and certainly weren't old enough for brooding during the right season last year (assuming Northern hemisphere). They'll likely start getting broody around late spring /early summer, if you let them collect a clutch of eggs. Do note that some breeds have very minimal brooding instinct and may never get broody, usually the ones breed as commercial laying hens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I <em>do</em> know a bit about this; I've raised chickens for 22-ish years.</p>
<p>If you're collecting the eggs, they won't go broody. There needs to be a 'clutch' of eggs where the hen lays, (about 10-15 eggs, last time mine went broody was 17) and it needs to be safe, dark, and comfortable for them. </p>
<p>I designed my nest boxes with a lip on the inside to keep the nest material in and I even considered adding little curtains, but decided against it.</p>
<p>If you want chicks, leave the eggs. They're about old enough to go broody; a little over a year is about when they can start. You can stop collecting now and give them awhile. It'd be a few weeks before one or both went broody.</p>
<p>(2 hens is also not really enough for a rooster, either. I bet they have missing back feathers).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Until about some years ago, I thought a rooster had to screw a hen in order for it to lay eggs. It was only until I visited a farm when I realized that chickens laid eggs without getting screwed.</p>
<p>So, I'm not going to assume. In order for an egg to get fertilized, a rooster has to screw a chicken, right? I wasn't sure if fertilization meant that a rooster had to sit on the eggs and do what cocks would do. This seemed like a silly scenario to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To some extent it works the same as for humans, if you imagine than instead of having a period, women laid an egg every month (which is also technically what they do, kind of). If sex was involved at the right time then the egg will be fertile and remain in the womb for hatching, otherwise it gets discarded (no period / period).</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>only fish and frogs do that weird stuff where the female lays the eggs then the male comes around and blows his load over them, but interesting you thought of this nonetheless.</p>
<p>edit:: apparently the human egg doesn't make it out with the period discharge, it gets absorbed back into the body along the way. Now my biologically mediocre educated brain wonders whether the uterine wall/future placenta shedding can be looooosely compared to the eggshell. Not from body functions perspective, but as an abstract concept of embryo wrapper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, rooster needs to screw the chicken to fertilise the egg. Sitting on an unfertilised egg (for a long time) ain’t gonna do diddly but give you food poisoning no matter what is sitting on it. Except for a large thing sitting on it: that just crushes the egg.</p></div>		</li>

So the rooster still needs to fertilize the hen if you want rhe ovum (egg) to be fertilized</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And to add to this i want to say: a fertilized egg may not sound tasty, but in reality it doesn’t matter If you take the egg away from the roosting hen day one or two. There’s nothing in the egg yet, other than egg and rooster semen. </p>
<p>If you’ve had eggs on a regular farm (not commercialized egg production) you likely had this kind of egg, as many farmers use a rooster or two to keep the hens in order. And to get new chickens.</p></div>		</li>
