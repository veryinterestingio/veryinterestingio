			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a group effort, and it's often case-specific, but I'll try to keep my answer minimally ramble-y. Sometimes we luck out, and we quite literally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyuba_(mammoth)" target="_blank">find the whole thing</a>. Those are ridiculously rare and tend to be restricted to fairly recent groups. Sometimes we find fossils with amazing soft tissue preservation, and with the application of some high tech methods like high resolution microscopy and chemical analyses of biomolecules, we can still get a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/78xw3a/what-colors-were-dinosaur-feathers" target="_blank">fairly complete picture</a> of what the organism looked like. Maybe we don't get soft tissue preserved, but the skeleton is still articulated. Then we look to things like osteological correlates (bony features associated with soft tissues, think muscle scars on bones) and <a href="https://phys.org/news/2020-08-power-deinosuchus-teeth-size-bananas.html" target="_blank">anatomy of close relatives</a> to fill in the blanks. If you have an incomplete skeleton, you can look to other parts of the body (maybe you have a left arm, but not a right) or parts from other specimens (this T. rex has legs, that one doesn't). Then we get down to the disarticulated, jumbled together jigsaw puzzles. I'm working on a project like that right now, where we have <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02724634.2017.1349776?casa_token=zgV2PznuFb8AAAAA%3Aabey2Uwt5XEyLV0lT533WM9K0_0DJdTreNHqfZOVfVgbAsGu8E7qtIukdIHS0Kttc5XeacOCyg" target="_blank">\~4 croc species all mixed together</a> in the same site. We do things like look at sutural contacts (the complex surfaces between bones in the skull) and joint surfaces to figure out which bones go together. We can look at left and right duplication, size variation, etc., but these all have some degree of risk and error. We can look at bone histology to tell juveniles of large groups from adults of small groups.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the last one, do you also use carbon dating? Or is that not accurate enough/is it probable that they all died around the same time so there'd be no point?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on the age of the fossil. But for stuff like dinosaurs, they use mainly (i believe) the layers of rock they find them in for dating. If you find a fossilized bone in an 80 million old layer of rock, it is assumed the bone is also 80 million years old.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By the time anything has become a fossil, there is not enough radiocarbon left to analyze for dating. Remember that fossils are not organic, and carbon dating is perfect for things like (actual) bones, wood, and other once living matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there are other isotopes used for similar dating techniques, but usually they look at the surrounding rock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. How do you look at the skeleton of a new species and decide if you have everything? What if it's, say, missing some vertebrae?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi there! Another vertebrate paleontologist here. Good question! Some fossils are compressed and carbonized, and you can tell that the animal is entire. But most fossils, especially the large ones of charismatic species such as non-avian dinosaurs, are rarely complete. They are often fragments of an individual. One thing to note is that the vertebrate skeleton is highly anatomically conserved. Especially within the less inclusive tetrapod group. Land-dwelling vertebrates (i.e., tetrapods) may lose bones (e.g. snakes losing limb bones), or fuse bones (e.g. reduced number of skull bones in mammals), but evolving new bones is a rare occurrence. Therefore, we have a pretty good idea of what bones are present and what bones are absent from a fossilized individual. Now, regarding what the missing bone, or bones, would look like is a complete guess. The default assumption is that the bones look as they do in closely related species where the bones are known. But there have been exciting moments when our assumptions were dead wrong. A colorful example is in the dinosaur Deinocheirus. Check out reconstructions of that animal before and after the rest of its skeleton (beyond its arms) were discovered!</p></div>		</li>
