			<div class="markdown"><p>Structural unemployment being an utterly alien concept to the UK Government, who will insist that an unemployed engineer apply for minimum wage jobs in supermarkets in order to continue receiving unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>Result: An engineer working in a supermarket, struggling on minimum wage and paying fuck all tax, while someone who actually wants to work in a supermarket stays unemployed because an engineer has &quot;their&quot; job</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>many people fail to understand structural unemployment too...behind getting aligned there is also the change in job processes...the most literal example being handmade textiles to machine made textiles...the machines didn't &quot;destroy&quot; the handmade industry but they did cause many of the people who did it by hand and maybe weren't that good at it to have to move to another profession or learn to use the machine to make the textiles....in essence the workers job and job location changed but the job itself was still making textiles</p></div>		</li>
