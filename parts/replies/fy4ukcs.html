			<div class="markdown"><p>I love this issue of how we can combat our own personal biases when we see data we want to be true. I wrote an article for Nature about <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/how-scientists-fool-themselves-and-how-they-can-stop-1.18517" target="_blank">how scientists do this during data analysis</a> and while researching the article found fascinating literature around this. For consumers of data and news (who are not necessarily analyzing data themselves), I think it's really helpful to know the common cognitive biases by name -- especially all the ones around confirmation biases. You're more likely to spot your own biases if you know what to look for. I'd love to hear tricks that other people use, but when I read some stat/data that's particularly infuriating or elating, I try to ask myself how I would feel if it were in the opposite direction, or to try falsifying it. The &quot;blind data analysis&quot; and &quot;adversarial collaborations&quot; I discussed in the Nature piece could probably be adapted for general consumer use -- that gives me a good idea for a new article!  -- RLN</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People are notoriously bad as making up realistic data as for example when faking amounts on tax returns. There is a law, called Benford's law that is often used to test whether the distribution of data looks &quot;real&quot;. <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691147611/benfords-law" target="_blank"><a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691147611/benfords-law" target="_blank">https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691147611/benfords-law</a></a></p>
<p>Personal biases are a much harder problem to overcome! </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Benford's law of large numbers? I know it's probably not that but I heard it watching Ozark. I've learned a good deal about stats already but I'm surprised I've just started hearing about Benford now: chalk it up to confirmation bias, or that closely related phenomenon named after two people, hyphenated together.</p></div>		</li>
