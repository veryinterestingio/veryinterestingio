			<div class="markdown"><p>That was going to be my question. At that speed, wouldn’t the likelihood of you hitting something, no matter how small, be extremely high? Over a distance like that, with zero idea of what’s out there at any time, wouldn’t it be a death wish at best?
I know voyager and those kinds of things make it just fine to planets, but once you hit the Kuiper belt are we all in space wilderness?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At those speeds, the interstellar dust and random atoms would be like friction. As for collisions with something substantial, such as a rock or asteroid, the chance is virtually nonexistent. That having been said, a collision with something as small as a grain of sand while moving at a high percentage of the speed of light would be like a huge bomb going off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically, yes. But you would have to have a targeting system that could see a very very small object coming at you at almost the speed of light, and then be able to focus on and destroy it in a ridiculously small amount of time. I have read of other possibilities, but they all involve science so advanced as to be impossible with anything we can currently envision. It’s a huge challenge.</p></div>		</li>
