			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. CPUs are so fast that the distance the electricity has to travel becomes the bottleneck. The smaller the CPU is, the less distance there is. It would be impossible to have a room-sized CPU (like they had way back when) that performs as fast as, say, the CPU in your phone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can however link together several CPUs and fill a room with them, and have them work together on a single problem. This is however very different from having one CPU that's as big as all of them added together.</p>
<p>Each CPU will need its own RAM (and lots of other local resources) close to it, because, as mentioned earlier, if it was to use the RAM halfway across the room, it would have to wait figuratively forever before it got the data it needed to keep working. </p>
<p>Because of this, multiple linked CPUs work best on tasks that have lots of independent calculations, where the result of one calculation doesn't depend on the result of a different calculation that was performed on a different CPU.</p>
<p>This is how supercomputers are built these days. There are entire rooms filled with hundreds of independent computers, linked together to function as one single computer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>One &quot;common&quot; example of this kind of system could be a 3D rendering for example. If you're rendering a 1minute video, its having 25frames per second, thats 1500 independent frames to render/calculate, lets say it takes 30seconds to render one frame with one cpu/gpu, that would take 12,5hours with one computer. So if you can have access to, \~24 computers, and share that 1500 frames with them, you can have your 1minute clip rendered in 30minutes. That was very handy at my school where we had chance to render with all the computers not in use at that moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not just about speed, a large CPU is also more expensive to manufacture due to the higher rate of errors and also that you simply can fit more CPUs onto the same wafer if they are smaller. The 24 core IBM POWER9 CPU has a huge die (the silicon block which the circuit is etched into) compared to other CPUs, and at least historically IBM's CPUs, while not clocked as high as consumer CPUs, have excelled on many workloads (largely due to huge caches and good IO) but been very expensive to buy. Its die is 693 mm² which can be compared to the 213 mm² die of the 32 core AMD Threadripper.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And depending on the product and the facility, that rate can be <em>really</em> high.  The industry - at least when I worked in it - operates very close to the absolute limit of its manufacturing process.  The result is high performance products, but frequent faults.  I remember seeing lots/batches that would start out as a box of 50 wafers, but finish with like four - and those wafers weren't pristine, themselves.</p></div>		</li>
