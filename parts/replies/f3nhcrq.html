			<div class="markdown"><p>I get OP scenario even when doing complex things though. Like driving. I will suddenly be aware I'm driving and realise I cant remember say the last few minutes of my route. Almost like it a dark or blank spot. Yet all the while I could be breaking turning changing lanes etc yet seemingly completely in a daze</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, man.  Highway hypnosis.</p>
<p>Confession:  Driving long stretches of highway just makes story ideas flow like crazy.  It just seems to open the creative floodgate.  I’m in the car, nothing to do but drive (it doesn’t work as a passenger), in this weird mix of attention and abstraction, the world whizzing by all around me.  It’s like magic.  </p>
<p>Sadly, it’s also bad for my health and everyone else’s when I to write them down mid-drive, as well as illegal.  :(</p>
<p>Edit:  To add to this, did you know that brains have been studied while someone is learning a new task, and researchers found that the parts of the brain involved with learning are distinct from the parts that have learned something and need to recall it?  </p>
<p>“As well as measuring changes in brain structure, MRI scanners can also be used to look at brain function when performing different tasks. MRI can tell us about how brain activation changes as we learn new motor skills. Studies have shown that at the very beginning of learning a new movement there is a large amount of activity across the brain, but particularly in an area known as the pre-motor cortex, which lies just in front of the primary motor cortex[8], and is normally associated with movement planning. High levels of activity are also seen in the basal ganglia which is an area normally active during movement initiation [9,10]. The high levels of activity in these areas are probably related to the fact that, in order to learn a new skill, each action has to be planned and thought through. After repeated practice of the action, as it becomes an effortless almost automatic skill, the activity in the pre-motor cortex and basal ganglia decreases[11,12].”</p>

<p>So you know how to drive.  Especially if you’ve driven a route many times before.  But you still need to concentrate, except your brain is like “meh, easy...” and wanders elsewhere.  Scary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just because you don't recall, doesn't mean you are a complete zombie.  I'm not implying that you were or were not in one or the other task state.  Short/mid term memory just did not record the information.  Quite common for unstimulating repetitive tasks.  </p>
<p>Take another example, brushing your teeth.  Did you brush your teeth this morning?  Do you actually remember the action?  You do it every morning as part of your routine, so... probably?  Or are you, right now, using deduction based on past experience comparing unbrushed fuzzy teeth with brushed?</p>
<p>Memory, and how it is formed is pretty far outside my wheel house.  But I'm pretty sure we don't have a full grasp of the mechanisms.  I'd speculate that a task state (positive or negative) is not always stored in short/medium/long term memory.  Perhaps I'm incorrect though.  It could be that task-positive is defined by our memory perception of the state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a sense, driving can be a form of sensory deprivation. Not in the usual way of externally shutting off the stimulus, but by the exact opposite: you are so used to driving and the usual scenery, that you don't register the road and the fact that you are driving. The monotony acts as a kind of all-sensory white noise machine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that can be exciting and overwhelming.  Lol.  The more we know, the more we learn we don’t know. One of my new areas of interest has become what part of us can be aware of and observe both of these states?  And which parts of the body are activated with this awareness?</p>
<p>How did you learn about task-positive &amp; DMN?  We struggle with explaining those concepts clearly and concisely. You did a great job.</p></div>		</li>
