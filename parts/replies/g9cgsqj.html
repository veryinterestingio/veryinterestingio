			<div class="markdown"><p>When you start a full time job, you usually fill out a form W4. This form is essentially a worksheet to figure out the number of exemptions on your taxes. It's a number that is essentially a multiplier of a fixed value that should be considered the portion of your income that is exempt from taxes.</p>
<p>To use simple numbers, let's say you earn 50k per year, and lets say the exemption amount is 5k (it's not this exactly but it's close to it I think, and it can change from year to year). If you claim 3 exemptions on your W4, you're basically saying 3 * 5k = 15k of your income is exempt from taxation and you'll only be taxed on 35k of it.</p>
<p>Since everyone is going to have some kind of deductions each year for various reasons (including the standard deduction), it helps to figure out how many exemptions most closely match your own tax situation. When I purchased my home, I had to update my W4 because the mortgage interest I pay each year is tax deductible and that would add a significant deduction. If I didn't update my W4, I'd be overpaying my taxes quite a bit.</p>
<p>Because it's an integer multiplier it's impossible to get super precise with it, but you can usually figure it out within a good ballpark so that your tax paid over the year isn't super different from what you actually owe, so you either get a small refund or owe a small amount. At the minimum, most people should claim 1 exemption for the standard deduction. If you follow the worksheet instructions, you'll usually end up close to where you ought to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So whenever you get paid, you might notice on your paystub that some money is taken out for &quot;federal withholding.&quot; This is how most people pay income tax, a portion of their paycheck is sent to the government, this is why you don't have to save up to pay income tax.</p>
<p>But by default, this withholding is set to be higher than you have to pay in tax, so at the end of the year you have to ask the government for some of that money back. This is known as a tax return.</p>
<p>You can ask your employer to change your withholding to better represent how much tax you estimate you have to pay. </p>
<p>You can't set it to too low though, if you have to pay the government a lot of money at the end of the year because you set the withholding to be too low then there might be additional fines because of that. But if you make a reasonable estimate for how much to withhold, you don't have to worry about this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First some background:</p>
<p>When you pay taxes, you have what are known as &quot;deductions&quot;.  These are essentially dollar values that you &quot;deduct&quot; (i.e. subtract) from your total income to get your taxable income.  Essentially, your taxes are calculated as if you made less money than you actually earned.</p>
<p>Everyone can apply the &quot;standard deduction&quot;, which for the 2020 tax year is $12,400.  So if you earned $40,000 and choose to take the standard deduction, you pay taxes as if you had earned $27,600.  Also, that's the standard deduction for filing as a single person.  The deduction is different if you're married (and varies again on whether or not you and your spouse are filing a single tax return, or filing individually).  And having children or other dependent in your household adds to your deduction.</p>
<p>Or instead, you can choose to &quot;itemize&quot; your taxes.  Instead of taking the standard deduction and calling it a day, you can go into excruciating detail about each and every tax-deductible thing you did throughout the year.  For instance, if you paid $4,000 toward interest on your mortgage, you can deduct $4,000 from your taxable income.  If you're self-employed and used your car for business purposes, you can deduct some of the expenses that went into owning and operating your car.  If you made donations to charity, you can deduct those (to a limit) from your taxable income.</p>
<p>So when it comes time to do your taxes, what most tax-filing software will do is have you enter in all that information, and then figure out whether you save more money by itemizing, or by taking the standard deduction.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now, when you are hired at a new job, you have to fill out form W-4, which is used to estimate your deductions, and thus how much the employer will need to withhold from each paycheck to make sure that they're paying the correct amount to the IRS on your behalf.  If you fill out the form incorrectly, your employer may end up withholding either too much or too little of your income to cover your taxes, resulting in you either owing a significant amount of money, or getting a large refund.  Neither of those are ideal (no one wants to owe money, and the refund is just money that you should have had in your paychecks all along), so it's best if you correctly fill out your W-4.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Property tax isn't a thing here, that's why I didn't understand the US system. But if you make £40k as a salary and £10k from self employed work then your employer should deduct the appropriate tax on the £40k and you fill in a tax return for the rest. You give your National Insurance Number (Social security) on your tax return as your employer also has this then the inland revenue know what you've earned as a salary and tax you on your self employed work accordingly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you only have one income source and don't have any additional deductions they more or less do, favouring giving you a small refund instead of a surprise payment. If you have any reason for additional deductions, you need to fill out the worksheet - payroll doesn't automatically know you have dependents, or tuition, or a bus pass, or any of the myriad other things the government has decided to incentivize via tax refund.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See none of those things you mentioned are a thing in the UK that's tax deductable. There are occasionally cycle schemes run through employers that are deducted from tax, however this is all done by payroll. How would something like dependants or tuition be tax deductable? I'm not trying to sound smart btw, I genuinely don't know how it works in the US and I'm trying to learn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  Ideally you'd set your withholdings to underpay such that you owe a tax in April that comes in just below the amount that would result in a penalty.  That amount basically represents an interest-free loan from the government.  Your tax refund represents your having given the government an interest-free loan.</p></div>		</li>
