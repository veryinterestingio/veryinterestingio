			<div class="markdown"><p>My fiancee has tritanopia. She had a head injury when she was very young, and she has issues differentiating between blue/yellow, but also has an issue with differentiating shades of green (which in the lighter shades is &quot;yellow.&quot;)  My favorite situation is when there is a blue or yellow item, and everyone assumes that the item is invisible to her. No that is clearly a banana, and that is there. Or, yes, that house is clearly there.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Though I did learn something new from this, I was unaware that the common cause is from a lack of short-wave pigments, but is it the same issue in the case of head injuries?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible that tritanopia could somehow stem from a head injury (maybe from injury to really specific nerve tracts between eye and brain). The 'blue' cones run through a really separate neural system than the 'red/green' cones. I don't know much about pathology of tritanopia though.</p>
<p>Red/green colorblindness, I think, must be congenital/genetic. The red/green cones feed into more-or-less the same neural channel, it seems impossible to injure one without injuring the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the standard test to distinguish colorblindness types uses pictures called 'Ishihara plates', here's an online version of the test that seems to work ok:</p>

<p>there are other tests that can tell you more specific things (protanope/deuteranope each is actually more complicated than I made it sound, with subtypes of each).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I was kind of confused reading the descriptions because I noticed disparities with how I perceive things and how they were described. I’m pretty sure however mine works is a bit different but with a few similarities. I’ll check out those tests, though, thanks for the link! On a side note, it’s kind of a shame there’s no good source for learning about the biological sources or causes of colorblindness that I know of. Knowing the biomechanical causes would probably help me (being an ecologist/biologist) more excited about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I met a gentleman that carried a blue laser pointer for classes he went to because he had trouble seeing the red due to his colorblindness, he said he could see the red, but only if the instructor shone it off to the side of the slides then 'dragged it' to what he wanted to point out, he couldn't tell where it was if the instructor started shining it on the slide.
Now I want a blue laser slide clicker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He didn’t have trouble “seeing it”. He had trouble DISTINGUISHING IT..... they see some color as the same.  It’s not that the brain can’t see it—doesn’t become invisible to them ....</p></div>		</li>
