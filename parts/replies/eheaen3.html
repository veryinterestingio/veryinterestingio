			<div class="markdown"><p>You hit on an important point. Swear words separate people by class, race, religion or national origin. By saying the wrong word you might give the impression that you are of a group of undesirable people. You used the word cunt, that’s an excellent example. </p>
<p>Now we have two new swear words they were acceptable 60 years ago and one of the problems with saying them is that it might make the person who says the words look like they are either racist against African Americans or bigoted against homosexuals.
Yes there are other factors in the words, but this is one of them.
I don’t think I need to type the words. </p></div>		</li>

Still one of my dad's favorite parent teacher conference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, at least in English! I'll add a couple points: </p>
<p>1) Another way that swear words have formed are through religious terms that may have been taboo to say. I remember the author of one of my linguistics textbooks remarking how funny it is that words like &quot;darn&quot; and &quot;heck&quot; came into being -- did people think God would be fooled?</p>
<p>2) This may be obvious, but other swear words tend to be terms for stigmatized objects/topics. There are Germanic terms for a lot of things in English, but most of them aren't swear words. Another funny phenomenon is how we continually update euphemisms for stigmatized things and ideas, and the older terms are seen as offensive (names for black Americans being a classic example). The problem is the stigma, not the word.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Zounds is similar, derived from &quot;God's Wounds&quot; (the injuries from crucification). Came through the elided middle step of &quot;swounds,&quot; which was considered sufficiently profane that it was censored out of plays in the Elizabethan era. </p>
<p>I'm trying to bring back &quot;byrlakin&quot; as a minor expression of dismay or disgust. Yet another one from this family, shortened from &quot;By our ladykin&quot; (ladykin = Mary).</p></div>		</li>

<p>aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minced_oath" target="_blank">minced oaths</a></p>
<p>But they're not just religious expressions, although many are - you can mince anything offensive or taboo. My favourite is calling someone a 'berk' (which is so un-curse-wordy they use it on children's TV) which is from the rhyming slang &quot;Berkley Hunt&quot;, aka c*nt.</p></div>		</li>
