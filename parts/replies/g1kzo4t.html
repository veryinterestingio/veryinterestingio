			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty spot on. &quot;High art,&quot; if we can put aside the problems with that term for a moment, has a very different <em>goal</em> in mind than just enriching the world with beautiful objects. Each one is intended as a statement in a generations-long conversation <em>among artists</em> about understanding and breaking down the relationship between visual representation and emotional/intellectual response.</p>
<p>Of course there is arguably a problem with implying that this is in some way a higher/purer/more worthy pursuit than the &quot;decorative arts&quot; or &quot;lower&quot; forms of art, but that is a separate issue from whether it achieves the goal it sets out for.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The artist, the auction house, the buyer, everyone else in the room, the cameraman...</p>
<p>Banksy is a lot like Damien Hirst. They’re both brilliant individuals, but not for the reason people often credit them for. They’re hack visual artists, at best. But they’re capable of eliciting a brand new response and emotion in people, which is itself an art form. And they’re probably world champions at laundering filthy money too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's quite well explained, in a very polite and detailed manner.
However it's still problematic in my opinion (not your explanation, but the very type of art you diligently described): not only it's an open door for a (at best) mediocre, lazy work in many cases (pioneering isn't a merit on itself), but it also leaves room for the art to be contained exclusively on the discourse explaining it rather than in the object itself. So it's semantics, not really art. If all is left for the eyes of the public to interpret then the work of art itself is meaningless, having no intrinsic artistic value.
But that, however, is nothing but my opinion and I'm not an expert.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true, and I think you tapped directly into why I can't fully wrap my head around the &quot;ultra abstract&quot; - I, personally, find art with such little foundation that it comes off as &quot;here's a color&quot; to be pretty bland. I still accept it for what it is when I can, but it's often in more of a &quot;uhh...okay...&quot; kind of way. I do know that some of the pieces that are simple in appearance, such as the canvas piece in the OP, are actually quite impressive to the art world in their technical skill. As someone with zero artistic ability, that whole realm is outside my scope, so I try to remind myself that I shouldn't harshly judge something I can't even do myself. What looks like a simple canvas with one color might actually be hundreds of hours of getting it <em>just right</em>, and while it looks easy to do, anyone else's attempt would come out with slightly noticeable flaws. That's just speculation on my part though!</p>
<p>What I DO think is impressive and worth deep thought is when an artist with a demonstrated capacity for vivid, realistic, creative artwork <em>chooses</em> to create a piece lacking those aspects. Art like that makes me go &quot;okay well, I KNOW this sculptor/painter/photographer has an incredible skillset for capturing the world in vivid detail, but for some reason this piece looks pretty simple/boring. I wonder what the artist is trying to make me see?&quot;. Cue the cliche movie scene where someone stares longingly at a blank canvas thinking &quot;huh&quot;. Or in more modern vernacular, me looking at a blue canvas going &quot;wat&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there's also something missing about being the &quot;first&quot; to do something, especially in modern art. There's going to be another person who has done things very similar to some of the things that OP included. What makes those pieces initially gain attention is often because it came from a specific artist. John Doe won't be recognised when he submits a modern study on colour, Richard Prince will. </p>
<p>You touched on this in this in your second paragraph. It's frustrating that things are seen as good or profound or thought provoking when they are displayed because of the name, not the work. I can't quite articulate what emotion it invokes, but it almost feels almost like arrogance on both the audience and the painter. Bah, maybe that's not the word to use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The position you've outlined here presumes that the primary audience of an artwork is the lay public. In my experience, that's almost never how it works in practice in modern society. If you are an artist, the people who are most likely to pay attention to what you've produced, to laud it or trash it, to be inspired by it or declare it uninteresting, to even be having a conversation about it at all, are <em>other artists.</em></p>
<p>So, in many (perhaps most) cases, a piece of art gets famous because it matters to other artists, not necessarily because it matters to anyone else. And what matters to other artists is often subtly technical, or based in tiny gradations of color or value, or just an expression of an idea that they see as radically new.</p>
<p>I've always found it odd that (in my U.S. culture at least) people have this idea that expertise doesn't matter in the arts and humanities. Like if you saw a complex math equation, you might very well say &quot;that looks like gibberish to me,&quot; but you wouldn't say &quot;that IS gibberish, and mathematicians who say otherwise are just scamming rich idiots.&quot; </p>
<p>But in the arts, people who have put exactly zero time into the study of art feel comfortable making pronouncements not only about their own impressions of the art (this does/does not look like gibberish to me), which is fine, and not only about how other people ought to perceive the art (and anyone who says otherwise...), which is presumptuous, but about <em>the very essence of art itself</em>, in statements like &quot;true art is supposed to be X, NOT Y. People who do Y are no-talent hacks and offer no artistic value whatsoever. But that's just my opinion, I'm not an expert.&quot; Can you imagine doing this with any other area of expertise? Math? Cars? How to run a business? Dog training?</p>
<p>Tl;dr: it probably wasn't made for you. It probably was made for experts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have such a good point. The audience is a big consideration. Think about meme culture. There is so much context to them at times that someone who is out of the loop will look at it and just shrug it off, meanwhile many will laugh their butts off. Then I see these memers strip the template or format even more and many who have all the built in context will eat that up. </p>
<p>Or take music as well. Growing up listening to hip hop I would hear ppl say it all sounds the same. Not paying attention to the nuances and the context in which it was created. Now here I am in my late thirties feeling the very similar feeling of all the new stuff sounding the same. But I then I remember that it wasn't made for me. I'm not the audience and the nuances in the newer styles are lost on me who has been out of the loop for years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;That car looks like a square box of shit&quot; is a comment I've heard frequently.  You don't need to be an expert in the art to know whether something is aesthetic or not, even when it's subjective.  If you want to make a diamond-encrusted ugly thing, of course the public will think it looks shit, and the hip-hop millionaire will think it's the most beautiful thing ever.</p>
<p>But to remove the subjectivity, you have to have a measure - how difficult was it to do.  Everyone can appreciate &quot;Well, I wouldn't want it on my wall, but it must have taken a lot of work&quot;.   What they don't appreciate is &quot;Not only does it look like crap, but I can make another... here... (splosh) done.  Why's that worth millions?&quot;</p>
<p>You have to have a definition, a requirement.  You can't just say it wasn't aimed at a certain group of people if you're then putting it in a public gallery (and being paid to do so), producing postcards of it to sell, etc.  It's contradictory and it's hypocritical.</p>
<p>In the same way, as a mathematician, I don't expect people to appreciate the beauty of a wonderfully simple equation.  E=mc\^2 is perfectly simple but took centuries to arrive at, and all kinds of far-nastier equations were required to get that.  But we appreciate the genius and the work that it took to get there.  Einstein was revered.  The Flat-Earth Society aren't.  If they wrote it, then it would demand explanation and people would be able to distinguish between bullshit and groundbreaking.  You can't just say &quot;this is amazing, you just don't understand&quot; if someone then cannot explain to someone who's interested in why.</p>
<p>People appreciate skill they cannot understand all the time (When Albert Einstein met Charlie Chaplin, Einstein said: “What I most admire about your art, is your universality. You don’t say a word, yet the world understands you!”. “It’s true”, replied Chaplin. “But your fame is even greater: the world admires you, when nobody understands what you say.&quot;).  But skill is a demonstrable, measurable, non-subjective, global attribute.  If you ask every artist to paint a cow, and he puts a blue square there, he's not &quot;being clever&quot;.  He's failing in the task.  Now if he put a joint of meat cut through with a butcher's knife, you could say it was an interpretation - but it would require skill to make that interpretation clear such that people know it's a joint of meat with a butcher's knife in it.</p>
<p>What I don't claim is that anything that Einstein then scrawled on a bathroom wall is then somehow valuable.  That's when it creeps into celebrity and is present in all kinds of artforms (Stephen King / Richard Bachman).  That's where modern art stands at the moment.  It's celebrity art.  You have it to say that you have it, not because it's any good.</p>
<p>You're making a statement about yourself, as an artist or a collector, not about the &quot;art&quot;.</p>
<p>If it was something only understood and shared by the upper echelons, then I don't need to see it, do I?  Does it need to be in the National Gallery on it's public day, for a normal event, with free entry, on a weekend?  No.  Nobody of import is going to be there to see it.</p>
<p>It's not really an argument that holds water, and it all just comes back to the same thing.  &quot;Art&quot; is a different thing now to what it used to be.  The name has been stolen for something completely different.  So take it, and off you go.  And rename the public galleries &quot;Craft Galleries&quot;, or &quot;The Museum of Modern Craft&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Luckily, many art critics have disdain for art that is directly derivative of another. So people who look at &quot;White Painting&quot; and think &quot;wow, all I have to do is paint a canvas all in one color and make $ / be famous&quot; will end up very disappointed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And eventually, we’ll circle back to actually having to be creative rather than reducing it to its simplest form. There will only be so many canvases of one color, or dots on the wall.</p>
<p>We’ll work back to how to take that blank canvas and say something new with it. What to say more with a dot, or dots.</p>
<p>Edit: not an artist myself, and while I can respect the craft, anyone can critique an idea or message or statement, you know?</p></div>		</li>
