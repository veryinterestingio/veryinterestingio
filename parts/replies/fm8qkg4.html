<p>So by compressing the second stage, the lithium undergoes fusion.</p>

<p>Fission. It's products undergo fusion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and they cast off excess alpha particles - hydrogen!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An alpha particle is not hydrogen. It's more like a Helium-4 nucleus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>these hydrogen atoms are just neutrons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A hydrogen atom is not a neutron; deuterium and tritium contain neutrons, but they are not just neutrons.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>THERMAL neutrons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fast neutrons are the ones produced by the hydrogen fusion reactions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thermal neutrons are WAY more energetic than those of our previous fission process. They're moving at 17% the speed of light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thermal neutrons are generally understood to have an energy of less than 1 eV. The neutrons produced by this reaction are well above 17 MeV; they are not thermal in any sense. They are fast.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They fly right through that u-238 housing like it isn't even there, causing it to decay instantly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, they are absorbed, inducing fast fission in the casing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fissile isotopes are radioactive variants of some element that decays when it absorbs neutrons, and releases neutrons when they decay. Fissile isotopes can sustain a chain reaction, where one decay can cause an adjacent atom to decay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whoa. Fission and decay are two different processes. Left to itself, a U-235 atom will almost always decay into Th-231 by emitting an alpha particle (He-4 nucleus), with a half-life of 700 million years. However, if it absorbs a neutron it will usually fission, i.e. split into two atomic nuclei, each of roughly half the mass of the original atom. Plus two or three neutrons -- fast neutrons -- which may cause other uranium atoms to fission in a chain reaction.</p>
<p>[Edit] There is a very small chance that a U235 nucleus will decay by spontaneous fission, which can set off the fission chain reaction.</p></div>		</li>
