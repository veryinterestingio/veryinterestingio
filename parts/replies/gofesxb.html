			<div class="markdown"><p>If youve ever gotten hurt or a tattoo on an empty stomach, youll know this feeling all too well. I got a tattoo on my leg and didnt think about eating before I got there. About 30-45 minutes in I realized I was getting tunnel vision. I asked for a break just before it wouldve been too late. I sat up in the chair and started taking deep breaths. I didnt pass out but I was effectively blind and deaf for a minute or so. Not fun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was bleeding internally and severely not know why standing up in pretty much faint, winded to try to walk even ten paces without having to sit. Doc said I had lost something like 70 percent of red blood cell count and could have gone to sleep and not woken up if I didn't go to the ER when I did. They put several litres of blood in me, and had and endoscopy to caulderize the internal hemoraging from a bacterial infection that caused it. I legit thought I was going to die and cried in the ER.</p></div>		</li>
