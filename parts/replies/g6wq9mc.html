			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, I used to work in restaurants from when I was a kid in the 1970s to '90s. I learned early on that there's restaurant food and then there's home food. Restaurant food is a celebratory thing for every now and then, home food is for every day. Go to any Chinese restaurant towards lunch or dinner and you'll see the staff meals are healthy everyday dishes that are mostly not on the menu.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not anti GMO, but I'm not exactly comforted by the fact that they're not trying to poison everyone. There's better reasons to be in favor of GMOs than that.</p>
<p>It isn't like the people who make DDT weren't trying to poison everyone. The people who started using asbestos weren't trying to poison everyone. The people who started using CFCs weren't trying to make a hole in the ozone. The people who started to burn coal weren't trying to cook the planet.</p>
<p>Lots of harm happens because people make mistakes. Even more happens because people put making a buck ahead of other considerations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The WHO almost always airs on the side of &quot;better safe than sorry&quot;, even if the data doesn't support their conclusion. But there have been several large studies on glyphosate and cancer published recently. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230012000943" target="_blank">Here's</a> a meta-analysis from 2012 that looked at glyphosate and cancer generally. It said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4866614/#__ffn_sectitle" target="_blank">Here's</a> another meta-analysis from 2016 that looked at glyphosate and cancers of the immune system specifically. It said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, a causal relationship has not been established between glyphosate exposure and risk of any type of LHC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article-abstract/doi/10.1093/jnci/djx233/4590280?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank">here's</a> a human study with a sample size of n=54,251 from 2017 that looked at glyphosate and cancer generally. It said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this large, prospective cohort study, no association was apparent between glyphosate and any solid tumors or lymphoid malignancies overall, including NHL and its subtypes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And before you ask, no, I'm not a &quot;Monsanto shill&quot; or whatever. I'm just a professional pharmaceutical chemist who gets pissed off when I see bullshit on the internet.</p></div>		</li>
