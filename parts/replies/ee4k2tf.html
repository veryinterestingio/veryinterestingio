<p>You have to train them up a bit.  They have a serious homing response, but if you take them out of the dovecote for the very first time, drive them 500 miles away and let them go, they're unlikely to find their way home.  Number one they won't have built up their stamina so they'll drop of exhaustion long before they make it, and number two they use a lot of visual cues to find exactly where they are going.</p>
<p>The first step to raising a homing pigeon is to buy a group of homers with a good instinct for it, not all pigeons have the same skill for it.  Then you have to breed them.  This is important because they fly home.  If I buy a homing pigeon from a breeder, get it to my house and raise it a while and then release it, it will fly back to the breeder.  You take those offspring, raise them to adulthood, and then chuck them up into the air.  They fly up and around in a small circle and then back to their box.  You do that a while.  Then you take them out a little farther, but still within sight of their home.  You've taught them what it looks like from the air so it takes them a second to orient themselves and then they'll head home.  You let them get used to that and then you go a little bit farther, and a bit farther, and a bit farther.  This both teaches them how to navigate and builds up the muscles and stamina for those really long flights.</p>
<p>Pigeons have the ability to see polarized light and feel magnetic fields, but it's unlikely this does anything more than orient them.  Like a compass pointing north it won't do you any good if I blindfold you and drop you off someplace you've never been.  You wouldn't know which direction to go to get home and I suspect it is similar with pigeons, but I could be proven wrong.</p>
<p>GPS studies with homing pigeons on long flights show they tend to navigate the same way people do.  They follow rivers, mountain ranges, and Interstates.  Once they get close enough to recognize something it becomes rote like it is for us when we follow the same route to work everyday.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not correct.  They can have multiple homes.  You train them to learn where he is by caging them and keeping food and water readily available. So, when you take them away from home and release them they know where to go back to to find food. </p>
<p>The next step is to take the bird out to another cage a few miles from home and keep them there, again with food and water for a few weeks.  Eventually, they will associate that spot with home.  Idea being that you can now remove the food and water from one location and leave the cage open and they will return to the other.</p>
<p>As long as they find food and water reliably when they go home, they will continue to fly between the two locations whenever you remove the resources from one.  </p>
<p>Pigeons were even used on the front lines during both world wars. As long as a military unit didn't move too quickly, the pigeons were able to fly back and forth between various camps.</p></div>		</li>
