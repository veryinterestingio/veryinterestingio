			<div class="markdown"><p>this is directly linked to hormones that make you feel &quot;full&quot;
after you start chewing, you will start to release a hormone called grehlin, you can keep eating till the levels spike enough that you feel full, or you actually fill your stomach, or you can eat half the amount, wait a bit, and the hormones will still rise and you will feel equally full.</p>
<p>whether you feel &quot;sated&quot; or not, and for how long that satedness lasts, is down to the nutritional content of your meal, if half the amount is enough to keep you satisfied untill the next meal, do that! if not, try eating a little more :)</p>
<p>by the sounds of it, you guys have figured it out and are taking full advantage of the ol' half a double cheeseburger at 11pm to take the edge off ;)</p></div>		</li>
