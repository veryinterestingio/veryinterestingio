			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to communicate the word &quot;dog&quot; to someone in normal speech, you'd usually just say it: &quot;dog&quot;. But you could also spell it out, naming each letter: D O G.</p>
<p>But if you're trying to send the concept across a long distance, sound doesn't work. It &quot;attenuates&quot;, or fades, in short order. Options for long distance transmission (before radio) were on/off pulses on a wire or flashes of light. (Other options, like semaphore flags, also exist for medium distance.)</p>
<p>Representing a letter with is physical shape is hard when all you've got is pulses. So instead you &quot;encode&quot; each letter with a unique sequence of pulses. In Morse code, combinations of long (&quot;dash&quot;) and short (&quot;dot&quot;) pulses make it easier to tell which letters are which even when they come one right after the other.</p>
<p>So Morse code doesn't &quot;code&quot; a message in an encryption sense. It just &quot;encodes&quot; the letters so that they can be sent over a distance by pulses on a wire or flashes of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Morse code uses ‚Äúon‚Äù and ‚Äúoff‚Äù signals to make letters. If you wanted to talk to your neighbor across the street with a flashlight, spelling the letters out with light wouldn‚Äôt work. So you create a chart that relates letters to ‚Äúon‚Äù and ‚Äúoff‚Äù patterns of a light. They‚Äôre easy to interpret. A quick blink on/off is a dot. A slow on/off is a dash. So turning a light on and off three times quickly would be three dots, or, ‚ÄúS‚Äù. Turning a light on for a second, off for a second (3x) would be three dashes, or an ‚ÄúO‚Äù.</p></div>		</li>

<p><del>The ‚ÄòQ‚Äô in QAM just means there are 4 possible symbols to modulate and demodulate.</del> (&lt;-- Was thinking of QPSK here, not QAM) There is only amplitude information and phase information, the demodulation does not use frequency information.</p></div>		</li>
