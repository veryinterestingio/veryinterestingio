			<div class="markdown"><p>Once someone stole a replacement card (an extension to an existing card, which was expiring that month) and went on a spending spree of things just under $100. I was at work and didn't know about it until the bank rang me about it. I got all the money back a month later, but yeah, that was annoying.</p>
<p>I asked, but the bank doesn't requiring activating the card because it had the same number as the older card. Weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, if you are responsible with money and can make the necessary payments to a credit card each month to not have a balance rollover, then you should never use a debit card. Credit cards offer so much more protection and rewards and are only ‚Äúbad‚Äù if you don‚Äôt make your payments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually, fraud on credit transactions is taken up by the credit issuer so they can prosecute with their full legal resources and insurance. (i.e. They treat it as a crime against their corporation, not you.) This leaves you with minimal risk, an entry on your credit reports, additional credit monitoring, and often a new card number.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you would have to deal with your bank to correct any debit fraud, often under suspicion.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit to add: with 'almost literally everywhere' I mean that I cannot remember being in a shop in the Netherlands (restaurant, etc) that didn't accept debit cards. They probably still do exist though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an American living in Europe for 2 years now, I can attest the payment systems and how people use them are <em>very</em> different.</p>
<p>Credit cards are everywhere and highly encouraged in the US because they have a bootload of benefits. Some cards offer 2% cash back on everything, others offer categories where you can get 4% on gas and 6% on groceries. That's straight cash back. Pay $1000 on groceries, get a $60 credit on your statement. Some have allowances where the bank will simply take off up to $300 in anything travel related over the year. There are other non-monetary benefits that are amazing as well: car rental insurance, extended warranties (got a $2k laptop replaced free last year with this), purchase protection, theft protection, travel insurance, concierge services, global entry or TSA pre-check rebates, airport lounge memberships, and the list goes on. Seriously, <a href="https://upgradedpoints.com/chase-sapphire-reserve-card-benefits/" target="_blank">check this out</a> (I have this one and don't have to pay the fee because reasons). Credit cards are also much better in terms of fraud protection for the cardholder. If someone steals my card info and racks up thousands of dollars in charges (happened before), I simply call up the bank and say &quot;wasn't me&quot;. They remove the charges from my account and send me a new card. If someone gets your debit card info and PIN, you don't always get your money back...</p>
<p>European credit cards aren't nearly as lucrative because they don't offer these benefits. They can't. The EU made it unprofitable by <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_19_2311" target="_blank">capping interchange fees</a>. In the US the card company takes 2-3% of every card transaction as a fee. They use these fees to offset benefit costs (in addition to the annual fees, which as shown above don't always cover the value of the perks) and of course make money (gotta prop up that share price). The EU limited those fees to a tenth of that, hence the lack of provided perks for European cards. There's no incentive to use them.</p>
<p>Another key difference between the two systems is that we don't have Bancontact, SOFORT, iDEAL, SEPA or other similar services, heck we barely have contactless payments. I personally love how Bancontact and Zoomit work in Belgium, and will miss it a bit when I go back to the US, but back in the US I will use my credit card for all my bills (possibly even rent) and rack up more cash back or points. Bank transfers in the US are cumbersome and irritating, and often people still use <em>paper checks</em>. The electronic transfer option is ACH, but it's nowhere near as convenient as BNP or ING make it with a SEPA transfer. It's like making a wire transfer...</p>
<p>So yeah, it's easier and more convenient to use Debit in Europe, while it's no more convenient but more lucrative and secure to use Credit in the US.</p>
<hr />
<p>Culturally speaking it seems like being in debt is a <em>Bad Thing</em> in Europe, or at least it isn't a casual decision, which I personally agree with in most cases and wish more people back home would take to heart. That said, being in some sort of debt, even up to your eyeballs, has been normalized in the US, whether for school loans, car loans, home mortgages, etc. It's nearly expected to have tens of thousands of dollars of debt hanging on your neck by the time you're 30...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man. I wish you could talk to all my otherwise intelligent friends who think credit cards and the idea of being in even $10 of debt in general is evil. They just don't understand/want to believe that it's possible to use credit cards without being in tons of debt and to not only get money back but to literally
-buy time- if you are already good at managing money.</p>
<p>I get many 0% interest for 6-12 month offers each year between my cards... I can do things like buy expensive gear for my business, or take an expensive certification class/testing, and then pay the offer back before it starts costing interest while benefiting from that gear or knowledge right away.</p>
<p>Sure, I could &quot;responsibly&quot; put aside a few hundred a month for a year and -then- take the class saving myself paying the very tiny balance transfer fee and horror of technically being in debt.</p>
<p>But in that scenario, I had to wait a whole extra year before- A) making more money from getting more/better work due to the extra certification B) being able to start on the next certification after that C) losing a year of advertising myself as more skilled.... piles of benefits that they don't even realize are possible cuz you only get these offers after you've had cards in good standing for a while.</p></div>		</li>
