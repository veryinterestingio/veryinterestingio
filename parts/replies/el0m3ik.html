			<div class="markdown"><p>If I may, I'm just gonna try to explain IR since water is a pretty good molecule to include even if we do want to get into the hairy bits due to its simplicity. And how we combine the big three (IR, NMR, and MS) into putting a molecule together.</p>
<p><strong>INFARED SPECTROSCOPY</strong></p>
<p>View the bonds between two molecules like springs. These springs are most comfortable in  thier relaxed position; pushing them together will cause them to push back, while pulling them apart will cause them to pull together.</p>
<p>Now, what if we want to know what kind of spring it is? Basically we push or pull these bonds to see how they react and at what force they &quot;give&quot;. We never break them; that would be MS like described above. Rather, we manipulate the bonds and see how they push back.</p>
<p>Infared Spectroscopy shines a broad spectrum of light to act as our &quot;push&quot; on these springs. This puts in energy into the molecule. Through some quantum mumbo jumbo, a molecule (such as water) can only wiggle at certain amounts of energy in certain ways. When light hits the molecule and causes this wiggle, the light's energy is transferred to the molecule and becomes the energy of the bonds moving. </p>
<p>So, in our spring example we drop some weights on our spring to test how strong they are. Once the spring starts moving, we know how much weight it can take, and take a pretty good guess at what type of spring it is.</p>
<p>By measuring what light makes it through the sample, we can see at what energy light was absorbed by the molecule to cause this wiggle. Since the wavelength/frequency is directly realted to it's energy, we get a great number at which we made our molecule move. </p>
<p><strong>THE BIG THREE</strong></p>
<p>These numbers can be used to compare to other numbers we've tested experimentally along with other data to show how the molecule is bound together. If MS shows you how many pieces of the puzzle you have and what size each one is, IR gives you the size of the interlocking widgets that allow them to stick together.</p>
<p>NMR, which can get REALLY confusing, basically tells you who is next to who. It would be akin to the picture on the puzzle piece; by inferring that part of a leg in one piece MUST be connected to the rest of the leg, you narrow down what pieces that one piece can connect to. Also, since legs are used to stand, you also can infer it must be close to the ground, and therefore near the bottom of the frame. </p>
<p>Now we have: the size of each puzzle piece amd how many pieces we have, what widgets are present and how they fit together, and a picture to try to put together that makes sense. All we have to do now is jam stuff together and see what works!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation!</p>
<p>I'm <em>really</em> not a fan of IR; it sounds so great in theory but in practice it is so damn inconclusive. NMR and MS give so much more relevant information that I rarely do IR at all.</p></div>		</li>
