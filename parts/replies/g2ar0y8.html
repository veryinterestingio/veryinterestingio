<p>I mean, a chiropractic appointment is ESSENTIALLY a target massage/stretching. Who... wouldn't... like it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an evidence-based chiropractor, so I have an issue with some of what you said. It's not completely inaccurate, but much of it is a caricature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chiropractic claims to be able to heal/cure/treat a medical diagnosis that does not exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're referring to subluxation theory. Most chiropractors do not believe in this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chiropractic claims to manipulate energies that do not exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Same as above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chiropractic benefits are anecdotal, and can't be reproduced via legitimate rigorous scientific study.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is not accurate, here are some studies on the benefits of chiropractic:</p>
<p>This is a cochrane review showing SMT as effective for treating chronic LBP as physical therapy, exercise therapy, and standard medical care (<a href="http://www.cochrane.org/CD008112/BACK_spinal-manipulative-therapy-for-chronic-low-back-pain" target="_blank">http://www.cochrane.org/CD008112/BACK_spinal-manipulative-therapy-for-chronic-low-back-pain</a>)</p>
<p>Patients that initiated care with an MD first for low-back pain paid about 20% more than those who saw a chiropractor first.

<p>This single blinded placebo controlled study demonstrates that maintenance SMT is effective for the treatment of non-specific chronic LBP (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21245790" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21245790</a>)</p>
<p>study from the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine reveals that chiropractic care costs significantly less than other forms of low back care (<a href="http://journals.lww.com/joem/Fulltext/2014/06000/Tracking_Low_Back_Problems_in_a_Major_Self_Insured.6.aspx" target="_blank">http://journals.lww.com/joem/Fulltext/2014/06000/Tracking_Low_Back_Problems_in_a_Major_Self_Insured.6.aspx</a>)</p>
<p>A study of 1,250 patients showed that those undergoing primary care for low back pain were &quot;generally worse on all disease-related parameters than chiropractic patients&quot; all results were statistically significant. (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4236958/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4236958/</a>)</p>
<p>Those are for spinal manipulation only and ignores other techniques that chiropractors use, such as McKenzie Technique. Let me know if you would like more research.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chiropractic is a breeding ground for other, even worse medical bunk (like anti-vax, acupuncture, and faith-healing).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, yes, and at higher rates than other healthcare providers. However, again, it generally represents a minority of practitioners at this point. See point 1 in my other post in this thread <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/idl9h4/why_is_chiropractic_considered_pseudoscience_and/g2e8cv3/" target="_blank">here</a> for some research on anti-vax beliefs and how they are changing. </p>
<p>Acupuncture is interesting, because while some chiropractors utilize this, the amount of physicians performing acupuncture is going up dramatically. This is especially true in the Military Healthcare System (MHS). From a 2018 study:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A total of 15,761 people received acupuncture in the MHS in FY 2014...
A cumulative 76% of diagnoses were for musculoskeletal or nerve and system issues. <strong>Approximately 60% of patients received acupuncture from physicians</strong> 16% from physical therapists or chiropractors, and 9.7% from physician extenders.[emphasis mine]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5799885/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5799885/</a></p>
<p>So saying that chiropractors may perform acupuncture doesn't support your point because it appears that physicians are starting to do that also.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chiropractic is dangerous, and is more likely to have no medical benefit or even cause harm than it is to have a positive effect beyond placebo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I put the evidence for effect beyond placebo above. I assume you are referring to stroke when you say &quot;cause harm&quot;. If you are referring to stroke, that is not a scientifically evidenced belief, as no research has ever demonstrated that cervical spinal manipulation causes stroke (I posted the most up to date research <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/idl9h4/why_is_chiropractic_considered_pseudoscience_and/g2dy5by/" target="_blank">here</a>. If you were talking about a different type of harm, let me know.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If chiropractic wants to be taken seriously as actual medicine, it ought to be able to withstand the same rigorous scrutiny that science-based medicine does.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such as, for example, lumbar surgery for spinal stenosis? Spinal stenosis is one of the most common reasons for lumbar spinal surgery. However, the research we have demonstrates no improvement in outcomes over conservative treatment, despite significantly higher rates of adverse effects. Don't take my word for it, here is what the research says. From Cochrane in 2016:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have very little confidence to conclude whether surgical treatment or a conservative approach is better for lumbar spinal stenosis, and we can provide no new recommendations to guide clinical practice. However, it should be noted that the rate of side effects ranged from 10% to 24% in surgical cases, and no side effects were reported for any conservative treatment. No clear benefits were observed with surgery versus non-surgical treatment. These findings suggest that clinicians should be very careful in informing patients about possible treatment options, especially given that conservative treatment options have resulted in no reported side effects. High-quality research is needed to compare surgical versus conservative care for individuals with lumbar spinal stenosis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why are we doing a procedure that is</p>
<ul>
<li>Substantially more expensive</li>
<li>Significantly increased risk of adverse event, including death</li>
<li>No improvement in outcome</li>
</ul>
<p>? Despite that research, Lumbar surgery is still widely used as a treatment for lumbar stenosis.</p></div>		</li>
