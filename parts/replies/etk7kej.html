			<div class="markdown"><p>I do not. After hearing that our son had situs inversus in the womb it just sounded scary and much more serious so I asked the Dr to explain things as simply as possible. Partly so we truly understood and partly because the big words scared the hell out of me so I knew they were scaring my wife and she didn't need the added stress with the pregnancy. The string thing was his explanation of how the body decides where to place things. I'm sure it is way more complicated than he made it sound tho.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything is fucking terrifying when you're going to the doctors throughout the pregnancy. It's like every other appointment is a routine check for the most terrifying thing ever, only to find out there's things ten times worse they're checking for next time. &quot;Your kid's insides are backwards&quot; would have probably caused me to pass out before I could find out the risk factors for complications resulting. </p>
<p>I hope he's been healthy otherwise and this is just a weird fact he has about himself!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the person you are asking, but I believe the doctor was referring to nodal cilia.</p>
<p>Cilia are little &quot;hairs&quot; in the body that move back and forth or in circles. They move eggs through the fallopian tubes, clean lungs, and a bunch of other random stuff.</p>
<p>Embryos have cilia in a region called the primitive node. These are aptly called <em>nodal cilia</em> and they usually rotate clockwise, move stuff to the left, and trigger the placement of developing organs in the usual arrangement. When something is wrong and they don't move, it's basically a coin toss as to which way things will flow and there's a 50/50 chance organs will be flipped.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I decided to Google it, and apparently a study has been done. According to that study, there was no correlation between this condition and handedness. But apparently there was a correlation between this condition and which wrist you wear your watch on, which is really kind of baffling.</p></div>		</li>
