			<div class="markdown"><p>it isn't a fruit, but rhubarb freezes well. it is a bit sour though, so if you don't like sour foods add some sugar. if you find you like it and you have room I would recommend growing your own, as it's perennial so you won't have to re-plant it every year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they contain oxalic acid, which strips calcium from the body. In large enough quantities it is fatal. A cat would be unlikely to chew on the leaves because once they take a bite they will spit it out due to the awful taste. If that happens, watch for any signs for kidney stones. Due to this quality rhubarb leaves can be used as a pesticide. When the leaves decompose the oxalic acid is broken down in the soil.</p></div>		</li>
