			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the first example is progressive loading but the blurry image is a common lazy loading tactic. On first load you load in a super low res image with a blurry effect, then when the user scrolls it into view it loads in the high res version. Makes it SEEM like the blurry images suddenly gets clear when itâ€™s just a new image replacing it.</p></div>		</li>
