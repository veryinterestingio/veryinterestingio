The first to hatch is expected to be the only one to survive, but if it dies or is sickly/weak, the mother will move onto the next one. If the first one is healthy, the rest are allowed to starve to death. The video is a little sad or hard to watch, but it has Attenborough narrating, so that makes up for it.</p>
<p>But this is an instance where they have specifically evolved to sacrifice young to allow a single chick to flourish, not an adaptation to reduced food availability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In species like bald eagles, the eggs hatch a few days apart so the first born is already getting larger and stronger by the time the second egg hatches. When the parents come to feed the young, the older one will often be better at getting to the food first and sometimes even pecks the younger one so that it doesn’t produce the ‘feed me’ call and isn’t able to get food. It’s called cainism and is named after Cain and Abel in the Bible. Birds of prey have a mortality rate of almost 90% in their first year so if there’s a lack of food in the area, there’s a definite benefit to the oldest/strongest offspring getting most of the food.</p></div>		</li>
