			<div class="markdown"><p>Just the CO2 isn't enough as it would just lower the pH and the metabolic processes of the cells will further lower the pH. We add sodium bicarb to work with the carbonic acid to buffer the pH. HEPES is also frequently used as a non-physiologic buffer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Buffer the pH, exactly. CO2 dissolved in water enters a dynamic equilibrium with carbonic acid (H2CO3) and bicarbonate (HCO3^âˆ’ ), with single molecules of the three species continually transforming in to one of the other.</p>
<p>Introduce more acid in the system and it will balance out by producing more bicarbonate (a conjugate base), shifting the pH waaay less than what the added acid should have done. On the other side, add a base and the system will react by making more carbonic acid.</p>
<p>Up to a point, obviously.</p>
<p>This is the mechanism the human body, among others, employs to maintain pH values in a narrow range in a number of tissues (the blood and duodenun, I remember).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Silly niggling, but increasing the carbonation is actually increasing the acidity, not just the perceived acidity.  The more dissolved CO2 you have, the higher the concentration of Carbonic Acid (H2CO3) you have in solution.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It does. In sodas, it also offsets the sweetness (that's part of why flat soda tastes so much sweeter)</p></div>		</li>
