			<div class="markdown"><p>A good example is when one time when I came out of the mall there was another car of the samemake/model/color as mine parked 2 spots closer to the door. I walked right up put my key in it, unlocked the door and got in. I then noticed there was stuff on the passenger seat that wasn't mine and I was in the wrong car! My key fit it though! My Dad also likes s to tell the story of when he and his buddy had motorcycles that weren't even from the same manufacturer butt their keys worked in each other's bikes. These situations presumably is why they started making smart keys with computer chips. Even if you have a key that fits you still can't start the car or turn off the alarm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In high school my friend and I both drove the same model car. My key could fully operate his, his key could unlock mine, but due to some work on the ignition, he couldn't start my car. I used to prank him and move his car around the school parking lot, but it was great that we could get things from each other's cars if needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. When you buy locks for your house, you have to pick the same lock configuration for all doors or youâ€™ll have to get separate keys. They are labeled on the containers when you buy them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a pretty common phenomenon. It's due largely to the fact that most combination locks will accept numbers within a certain margin of the appropriate number, mostly for ease of use (and to bring down costs). So if one of your numbers is 73, it's likely that anything from 71-75 will work.</p></div>		</li>
