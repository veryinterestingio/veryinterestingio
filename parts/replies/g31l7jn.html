			<div class="markdown"><p>Look at a phase diagram. There is a threshold for both and they affect each other. So, a lower temperature means that water will become ice at a lower pressure. Ideal situation for ice is high pressure low temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like he said. If you get closer to the core of the earth, the temperature increases. However, at the same time, the pressure increases. Take a phase diagram for water (altered a bit for salt content), and you could theoretically calculate the max potential depth of the sea. Pressure increases ability to form ice, but temperature obviously detracts from it. Someone could likely do the math if they had the right numbers. Obviously this is only a theoretical max depth of an ocean on this earth, and disregards the the effects of the earth's plates shifting itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pressure wouldn't be there.  The water is making that pressure.  Air would fill in the space, and the air would create some pressure but far, far less, only 49 psi of air pressure at the bottom of the Mariana Trench.  This is equivalent to diving to just 21 feet in water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like just assuming air pressure at that depth? Yes, you would be able to inhale, once. The pressure would be too high for you to exhale.</p></div>		</li>
