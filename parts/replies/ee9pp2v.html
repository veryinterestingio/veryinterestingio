			<div class="markdown"><p>The result of the quantum computation is in general not the average of all possible calculation paths. Each path has a phase, which cannot be measured. Anyways the path can either contribute with a positive or negative sign to the end result. In a good quantum algorithm, all correct results will add up with the same sign to have a high probability, whereas wrong results will sum up with (more or less) random sign and have a low probability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The results are an &quot;average&quot; taken with a different system of probabilities--with (complex) quantum amplitudes instead of classical (real) numbers.   This is the fundamental difference between quantum mechanics and normal statistics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A bit means 'two answers'.  A coin that you flipped can either be 'heads' or 'tails'.  So after you've flipped the coin, the 'bit' is how the coin landed.  The bit is now either 'heads' or 'tails'.  A bit can also be 'on' or 'off', or 'up' and 'down'.  If you can ask a question that only has two answers, you can put the answer inside a bit to keep it safe.  If you put a 'yes' answer into the bit, and open the bit again later to check on the answer, it will still say 'yes'.</p>
<p>A qubit is a very special upgraded bit.  It likes to be alone and doesn't like to be looked at or touched.  Left alone, a qubit can be a mixture of two answers.  It can say 'maybe yes' or 'maybe no'.  It can say 'usually it's on', or 'usually it's off'.  When you try to touch the qubit, it gets really nervous and picks a straight answer.  It suddenly becomes a regular old bit.</p>
<p>This is really special because you can put 'more' than just two answers into a qubit.  It can hold more information!  The trade-off is that qubits get scared easily and turn into regular old bits, so you have to be really gentle around them.</p></div>		</li>
