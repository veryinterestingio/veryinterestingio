			<div class="markdown"><p>This can also be because of where you live. For example, my in-laws live in Alabama. They dont regularly drink a lot of water. When they visited us in Utah, they EASILY drank a gallon or more of water a day! If you live in a dryer climate, you need to drink more.</p></div>		</li>

On the other hand, several years ago, they changed the rules to include even caffeinated beverages like coffee and tea as contributing to the total as well - as well as juices and decaf coffee and herbal tea (and, yes, even the occasional soft drink) - so folks who don't like &quot;just water&quot; can still get the necessary amounts.</p></div>		</li>
