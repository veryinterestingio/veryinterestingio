			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, as a massage therapist of 12 years, this is the answer. It's hard to convince clients with a lot of shoulder, back and neck pain that my work on their Pec major/minor, Lats, Anterior Scalenes and even Bicep/Tricep/Deltoid is really the long lasting solution to the aforementioned complaint areas.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I'm not spending a ton of time on the area that hurts them all the time.</p>
</li>
<li>Pecs, and Lats tend to hurt like Hell when worked on, even without using much pressure at all. Sometimes just lightly touching the area is enough to set them off. You wouldn't believe it unless I showed you how bad it can be.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read your comment and tried doing it to myself (I'm a guy). Can you elaborate on what you mean by &quot;working on the pecs&quot;? I don't suppose that just squeezing the muscle group after finding an image from a simple google search is going to substitute for experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most shoulder/ upper back relief I’ve ever experienced was the result of myofascial stimulation of my pec minor. I will never forget the sensation of warm blood rushing into the muscles stabilizing my scapula as it slid into place for the first time in god knows how long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! I had no idea about this at all. How can I work on my pecs to fix it? Doing dips? Pushups? And how do I massage pecs, and those other muscle groups you mentioned? I’ve never even heard of lats and anterior scalenes... I’ve always been cranking out on the knots in upper back and it only gives temporary relief.</p>
<p>Edit: wow thanks for all the tips people! I appreciate the advice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stretch your pecs so they don't pull as hard on your back and can naturally rest in a more comfortable position. You might still have posture to fix, mind you. Keeping your spine aligned goes a long ways towards even wear.</p>
<p>You can stretch your pecs by grabbing something with your arm (I 'think' palm forward or down are best, but not sure), and moving your arm around towards your back with your arm sticking out above a 45 degree angle. You don't need to keep your arm super straight unless you want to stretch biceps too.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if that's the best way by any means. It's just how I do it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i think doing pushup will make your back worse. as for massaging the pecs, i tend to rub from sternum edge towards the tip of the shoulder. never massaged my scalenes before, but i suppose google image, then finding the muscle on yourself and hold it in a pincer like grip. then glide up and down the length of the muscle would work</p>
<p>hope this helps</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This fun fact is what I learned in massage school about your lower back! As far as I know, the shortening(tightness) of your hip flexors, causes a big strain on your lower back, based on the principle you described above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. I had terrible posture for years, forward head, anterior pelvic tilt, and I had no idea the hip flexors were key to realigning my entire body. After I stretched out my hips (took a few months due to the rigidity of the muscles), I could FINALLY feel my glutes working while I did squats and lunges, since the two are also interconnected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is adaptive shortening. Happens a lot nin upper cross posture. Which you have sort of described above except that the pecs and the posterior cervical muscles are the ones effected. You get an elongation of the anterior cervical muscles and the back/scapular stabilizers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, upper cross syndrome has not been validated in the research, and we can’t exactly measure the tension in muscles to even verify that muscles are “tight” or “loose.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would disagree that we can't measure tension in muscles. This is the basis of stretching. Muscles have an elastic property to them which you feel when stretching a health muscle. Also this is biomechanics 101, changing the distance between 2 joint markers means a muscle has either shortened or lengthened. Let's take cerebral palsy for example the disease cause muscle contracture. If you tried to move their joint it is impossible due to the muscle tension</p></div>		</li>
