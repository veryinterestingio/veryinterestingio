			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not. Quantum tunnelling is when a particle goes over a boundary that classically it could not surmount. Imagine a marble rolling in a valley; back and forth, back and forth. Classically, it will never cross over the valley because it simply doesn't have enough energy.</p>
<p>If instead, this is quantum mechanics and we're talking about the particle's wave function, quantum tunnelling means there is a non-zero chance of finding the particle on the other side of the boundary. This is because the particle's wave function &quot;leaks&quot; over the boundary a little.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you first sentence implies two different interpretations. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Particles that small do not really have a position as such</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Small particles are positionless. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>just areas where they are more <strong>likely to be</strong> than others. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Small particles do have a position, yet it behavior is governed by a random process (or something that appears random given our innate limitations in detecting it). </p>
<p>Is it really the first or the second? Or am I making a false distinction? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The second part was a bit badly worded. It is more accurate to say that each point in space has a certain chance that it will act as if the electron is there during an interaction. Quantum particles do not have a position, just a chance that any given area will act as if it does contain that particle. Certain areas are more likely to act as if they contain the particle which is what I way trying to say in the first sentence</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ok so this interpretation is wrong:</p>
<p><em>Quantum particles do have a position, yet that position is governed by a random process. We can't know where the particle will be beyond saying that it's position follows govern by a given random distribution.</em></p>
<p>The latter was always my interpretation as an educated outsider, although I don't mind being wrong! I guess I am not sure what the second interpretation fails to account for. Does it fail to account for the double-slit experiment? </p>
<p>Thanks so much for you insights on this!</p>
<p>EDIT: After doing a bit more reading on wikipedia, I found that there are multiple interpretations of these phenomena. I think this answered some of my questions. </p>
