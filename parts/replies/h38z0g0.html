			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, much of what you're feeling when you &quot;have a fever&quot; is other symptoms of whatever you're sick with, and in particular the general immune activation of your body fighting off an illness. It's why everyone feels shitty after getting the COVID vaccine - it basically makes your body think you've been infected and freak out, causing a brief inflammatory response that feels like being sick.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some people might have such a reaction, but it’s definetly not the rule.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I wouldn't say everyone. I had my first vaccine 3 days ago, and the only effect it had was an achy arm for 24 hours. Felt like I'd been lifting weights for hours. My mum and dad had zero reaction after both of their shots - not even aches. (and they're in their 60's)</p></div>		</li>
