			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that they like your heat, and want to fly at the highest point. When I was a kid playing soccer (standing around in an open field during the evening), we would hold an arm up high -- the gnats seemed to fly higher, up around the hand, rather than the face. An imperfect, 8 year-old science, but seemed to work.</p></div>		</li>
