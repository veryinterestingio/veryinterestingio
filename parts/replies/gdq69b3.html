			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, the near constant &quot;it's super rushed so it's dangerous&quot; talk almost entirely ignores that it's modified from a very long period of work on the existing COV virus combined with newer methods of making vaccines. </p>
<p>If a new variant of measles came out that was only very slightly different such that they could adapt existing vaccine marginally and get to a vaccine for the new measles 10x quicker than it took for the first vaccine you wouldn't just discount all of the original work.</p>
<p>Even when it comes to SARs an RNA work, this is all built on decades and decades of scientific knowledge. This is pretty usual in every industry, you build on existing knowledge with new techniques, new improved ways to get to the same things faster, or cheaper, or more effectively. No Vaccine today is made in isolation using all the learning steps required for every other vaccine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you please provide a link to a reliable article regarding this? Not because I doubt what you're saying, but because I have several folks in my circles that are worried about taking the vaccine once it's available and I'd like to help allay their fears. Everything on CDC is just saying, &quot;New, new, new!&quot; but that it's been studied for decades. I need something put it in terms that I think my stupid friends would easily metabolize and just haven't found anything I felt worth sharing. I'd just share this thread, but I don't think my stupid friends would believe there's real scientists that just want to share science on the interwebs without getting paid. I am very sad that I have stupid friends but happy that I'm trying to unstupid them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.racap.com/covid-19" target="_blank">Here's</a> a complete map of all the vaccines (and other medicines) being devleloped for Covid-19.  As you can see there's a whole set of different methods used and very few involve RNA.  There are 8 adenovirus vectors, 8 subunit, 6 mRNA, 5 DNA, 4 inactivated, 3 VLP, 1 live attenuated, 1 measles vector, 1 flu vector vaccines in the works in various stages of progress.</p>
<p>It's just that it usually takes 5 years to develop a vaccine and the really exciting thing about mRNA is that you can use it to develop a vaccine much more quickly than you could otherwise.  I'm sure if we wait a few years, though, most of the vaccines for Covid-19 won't be mRNA based.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right but wouldn't free floating proteins in the bloodstream still be targeted by the immune system as foreign antigens due to obviously not expressing MHC1? What you describe seems more geared to how your immune system might respond to infected cells but the immune system also does respond to free floating stuff. That's what antigen presenting cells are for.</p>
<p>The post translational modifications would be accounted for by producing the proteins in vivo or in situ right?</p>
<p>I do see the purification process being potentially messy though so that's a good point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Free floating proteins get internalized by macrophages or other antigen presenting cells, get processed, and then are displayed in the context of MHC1. The processing results in little bits being presented rather than the full protein being expressed on the surface of a cell. This generally works for a quick IgM response (or IgA depending on the location) but if you want a long term cellular response you rather have the full protein. Both will work, it's just a matter of efficiency.</p>
<p>Also, in this case the COVID spike protein binds to ACE2 receptors. That alone can have some unwanted effects.</p>
<p>Post-Translational glycosylation is very tricky. It's why things like recombinant interferon eventually becomes ineffective - it becomes immunogenic. There are major differences between species so it's very hard to duplicate in vitro. Protein folding is still a bit of a black art but we're making progress. Still not at a point where we can do it all synthetically so we're back to purification challenges.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the job of natural killer cells to kill virally infected cells that are not expressing MHC1 due to viral deregulation. It was a very cool trick of viruses to downregulate this and an even cooler trick for us to use nk cells. This requires the target to be s cell though, and also display other surface proteins. For example red blood cells don't have any mhc1 and are not attacked by nk cells.</p></div>		</li>
