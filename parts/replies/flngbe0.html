			<div class="markdown"><p>Strange as it seems I learned a lot about investing and the stock market by playing with some cheap crypto assets. There are 5 number of coins that have been mined and people are willing to buy that coin for $10 - market cap is $50 dollars. Now let's say someone is willing to pay $11, this raises the total market cap to $55 as each coin is theoretically worth $11. How does that make sense? How did 1 person willing to pay a dollar more increase the market cap by 5 dollars? Well if news comes out the coin is based on bad tech or easy to steal you might have that same person try to sell it at $11 but nobody wants to pay that, so they drop the price until someone buys it at $5. Buyers and sellers are in a massive tug of war like this all the time. If people stop buying when it gets to $6 dollars and buy more when it drops to $5 dollars the market has &quot;agreed&quot; the fair value is $5 giving a market cap of only $25. The one thing people always forget is that not everyone can sell when the price is $11, as people sell if nobody still wants to buy it the fair value of each drops. So market caps of $X Billion aren't really a good indication of how much money there actually is. Just like that $1 increase looked like a $5 increase in market cap, a 5 dollar decrease decreased the market cap by $25. Add 7 zeroes to each of these numbers and it's pretty easy to see how so much money &quot;disappeared&quot; in the market.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the cancer curing apple is a critical part of this,  the time the apple had a valuation of $100 was because people had a belief that in the future cancer would be cured (which obviously has tremendous economic value) so the total wealth in the system was (erroneously) believed to be higher than it actually was.</p>
<p>Similar to the valuation of stocks in February, their value was contingent on things carrying on much as they had been, rather than the economy grinding to a halt. Value was &quot;instantaneously&quot; destroyed, in the sense that the belief of the market collectively underwent a rapid revision when it grasped what coronavirus was going to do to economic activity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're speaking on a broad-range basis, taking in the entire market. There are absolutely going to be companies that profit hugely from this.</p>
<p>Aside from the obvious upswing in masks sales, I would be willing to bet that netflix subscriptions are up too.</p>
<p>Not all stocks will lose value. The value is only a figure placed on it by the parties as to what they're willing to buy or sell at.</p>
<p>We're all still bartering for goods and services as humankind always have. The only difference is we now have physical money to represent our own personal value. </p>
<p>A goat herder only had goats to trade with, but the Apple seller was vegan and so not interested in goats. Rather than trading for useless goats now we trade in money that has value to everyone</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard for me not to feel like the entire thing is just trying to make money off of perception instead of actual business profits - insofar as to say that &quot;My stocks have value because this company is doing well please believe me so I can make money&quot; where a stock holder has done absolutely nothing to help that business, other than attempt to profit off their success. They had no hand in the labor or management processes, just some outsider with a Thing Called Stock getting people to consider it valuable.</p>
<p>What if the stock market never existed? Or rather, in an instance, we just shut it down? Would the crash that caused the depression back in the day be kind of, in some way, at fault because so much money was pumped into something so volatile and unpredictable? It's basically gambling, only the value of a chip can change just as much as when you decide to play your hand to get one, yeah?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mmm, not really. It's more that because apples are in limited supply, people want the apples (and speculate that others will too) so they are willing to pay more to get the apple to sell on later. The price increases because of the perceived value of the apple. I don't think many investors think about the days when cancer is cured, imagining some increase in global wealth as a result. If they think about it at all it will be to predict a future crash in apple prices when everybody with cancer has eaten one and been cured, and they will use that to judge when to sell their apples.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, now replace an apple with stock.  If you have $50k in a mutual fund, you probably say you have $50k, right?  But that's just $50k of &quot;apples&quot;.  The vast majority of &quot;money&quot; in the system is the perceived value of holdings, and not actual cash.</p></div>		</li>
