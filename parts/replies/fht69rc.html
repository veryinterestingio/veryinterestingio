			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems there is a range of usage. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24980809-detection-of-respiratory-viruses-and-bordetella-bronchiseptica-in-dogs-with-acute-respiratory-tract-infections/" target="_blank">This paper in the Journal of Vet. Med.</a> for example considers it to be caused by a range of agents with <em>B. bronchiseptica</em> the most prominent. The term was defined by very broad upper respiratory symptoms rather than by a specific agent (these were found later) and usually a range of agents are present.</p>
<p>So not saying you’re at all wrong, just that OP may not be wrong either depending on convention.</p></div>		</li>
