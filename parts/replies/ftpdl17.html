<p>A far more useful metric for this is the question is specific volumetric heat capacity, which takes the density into account. This is because you're only interacting at the surface boundary and particle density makes several orders of magnitude of difference rather than just the factor of 4 of specific heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As your other response says, it's the combination of density and specific heat capacity that does the trick. At room temp air is roughly 1.2kg/m^3, where water is 1000kg/m^3.</p>
<p>Which means in a cubic meter, there is roughly 1000x more water to transfer heat with than in a cubic meter of air.</p></div>		</li>
