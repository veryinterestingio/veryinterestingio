			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems filling the LHC from the feeders is a real bottleneck.  Based on size and complexity, I imagine the LHC cost many, many times as much as the feeders.  Why do they not build more feeders in parallel to fill it sooner?</p>
<p>Would it not work for other reasons?  Cost too much?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Beam dump to new collisions takes ~2-2.5 hours in the ideal case and ~3 hours is more typical. Out of that only 20-30 minutes are used to refill the LHC. And that's needed two or maybe three times per day.</p>
<p>You wouldn't save much time with more pre-accelerators but the cost would go up quite a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple stages. After the previous beam you need to ramp down, prepare the injector complex, inject new beams (multiple bunch trains times two beams), ramp the beam, then squeeze and adjust before going into stable beams and physics. Filling is probably &lt;20% of the whole time when you don't produce collisions. My guess is ramping up/down faster would be a better way of optimising turn-over rate. I remember some tests of other/faster ramps done two years ago. I think it didn't go exactly as expected (desynchronized with RF) and they postponed it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure about faster magnet ramps, but they started squeezing during the ramp, that saves time afterwards.</p>
<p>squeezing = changing the beam parameters to get more collisions</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Dumping&quot; particles: how does this work? My brain imagines the beam being redirected to a prepared surface of some particularly stable element. Or is it just left to its own devices as the control elements turn off and randomly collides with the walls?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You generally have a dedicated location, called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_dump" target="_blank">beam dump</a>, where the beam is dumped. You don't just let it hit the walls anywhere/everywhere throughout the beamline. The reason is that dumping the beam will result in some residual radioactivity, and you'd rather have that in a concentrated location rather than distributed around. Depending on the intensity of your beam, the beam dump can just be a bunch of material (metal, concrete, water, etc.) placed in the path of the beam, or if your beam is very intense like at the LHC, they have to be engineered with cooling systems and other bells and whistles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The LHC beams have as much energy as tens of kilograms of TNT (hundreds of MJ). Just letting them hit the wall at a random spot wouldn't just make things more radioactive. It would burn holes into the walls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The LHC beams have so much energy that this needs quite a large dedicated system. Each direction has its own beam dump: A 700 m long tunnel leading to what's basically a big graphite block. The beam is spread out over that block and widens while traveling along the tunnel (that's why the tunnel needs to be so long) in order to avoid burning holes into the graphite block.</p></div>		</li>
