			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to complicate things a bit more, you can get into &quot;native ISO&quot;, and how not all sensors start at the same light gathering ability. While it is a general rule that the lower the ISO the better, there are some cases in which a higher ISO will actually be cleaner and more detailed than a lower one due to the way the gain is applied to reach that value.<br />
If a camera's native light gathering ability is somewhere around iso 320 for example, iso 300 is going to be applied using a series of digital negative gains to reduce it slightly which will introduce noise. A camera like the Sony A7S with it's ginormously massive photo sites will start at a whopping ISO of 1600 supposedly, which means you'll get the most detail and color accuracy around there.  </p>
<p>I recall using a Canon way back and taking pictures with the lens cap on to determine which ISO values were the least noisy. If you'd never done this, you might actually be surprised to see which values are cleaner than others... sometimes turning it up a little bit gets a BETTER image! At the end of the day you need to know your camera to make the most of that, because the optimal values vary from model to model depending on sensor size and technology used.   </p>
<p>For more on this, here's a link to an article in which someone shows their 5D taking noisier pics at ISO 125 than at 1250!<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea of a DSLR with a native ISO of 1600 kinda blows my mind. I worked with a D700 when I was shooting and it's native was only 200. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know, right? I'll be honest, the first time I touched a Sony A7S, my mind was blown as well. ISO up to 409,000?! The photosites are YUUUUGE on that thing, which is why it has such a killer native ISO, but also why it is so relatively low resolution compared to other cameras in it's generation (less densely packed sensor).<br />
I've seen it used to record a short film via moonlight. Moonlight!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the sensor itself will heat up the same amount for a low ISO as a high ISO. Every frame a sensor captures is taken at the same sensitivity - the sensor itself only has <em>one</em> sensitivity. Digital ISO is an amplification function applied by the image processor AFTER the information has been output by the sensor. In other words, ISO doesnt actually come into play until all the information has already been dumped by the sensor's temporary memory cache into the processor. </p>
<p>edit: for clarity</p>
<p>edit 2: While adjusting the ISO will not increase the rate at which pixels heat up, adjusting the exposure time WILL. Pumping electricity through the circuit for 1/30 of a second will heat up the pixels a lot more than 1/500 of a second. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for all this information. I have known what all 3 functions do, but never 100% knew what was actually happening inside the electronics as far as ISO goes. I have one question from this comment. If the ISO is applied by the image processor, why can't I adjust the ISO from a RAW file in post? It is my understanding that a RAW file is the data directly from the sensor before being processed. </p></div>		</li>
