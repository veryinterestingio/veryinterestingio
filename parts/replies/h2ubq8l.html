			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s interesting, I didn’t know that about headaches.  Do you know if there is a reason why the body swells around the injury, is it just a natural response to try and immobilise the area ? And what is the swelling, like is it blood or some other fluid ? Or is it the actual muscles increasing in size ? Haha sorry million questions</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It swells to increase blood flow to the area to help healing.  The pain from inflammation is your body's way to tell you that it's injured and to protect it from being further injured. As long as you're taking care of the injury you can safely reduce the inflammation and that'll help the pain go away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be a stupid question, but if the increased blood flow is to help the healing, wouldn’t it be prudent to keep the swelling, to help it heal faster ? Or does it get to a point where the swelling is more of a hindrance ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Swelling is the result of increased blood flow, but have you ever popped a blister? It's not blood that comes out but pus. Pus is an amalgamation of red and white blood cells, but mostly white blood cells. Burns (technically a blister is a friction burn) are the surface injury type most at risk of infection so the body swells that area with white blood cells. </p>
<p>Did you also notice that a blister is much bigger than the area that got burned? Even after it pops? Inflammation can actually kill the tissue <em>around</em> the burn simply to prevent infection while the wound is healing. Short term, yes, inflammation immobilizes, sterilizes, and provides blood flow to the affected area. But long term it inflates the skin and everything else around the area (if it's internal for instance) causing damage to areas that were never actually injured by the incident. </p>
<p>To answer your question, inflammation is the bodies way of saying &quot;would you rather lose a leg, or die of an infection?&quot; but typically on a smaller scale. The biggest couple of reasons to reduce inflammation are to prevent that extra tissue damage, but also mainly to reduce pain so that the wound may be properly cleaned and dressed without any unnecessary discomfort. </p>
<p><strong>basically, inflammation is the body's version of Neosporin anti-bacterial lotion, and the swelling of the skin is it's version of a bandaid. We reduce inflammation because we have anti bacterial drugs, hydrogen peroxide, and bandages all of which do a better job of cleaning and prepping a wound for self healing than the body can do itself.</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. Lot of questions. Okay, a sinus headache is inflammation of the sinus mucosa and also often the tubes that connect your nose to your ears helping balance. Most headaches are from tension... ball up your fist as tight as you can for a couple hours non stop... that is tension and it would hurt like hell. Sinus headache adds in inflammation, so that hurts worse. Inflammation is blood and other fluids and yes it stretches whatever has blood pumping through it. But put enough water into a balloon and it will start begging for mercy too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally the accumulation of the inflammatory fluids can impede proper lymph flow (which helps to fix whatever problem )</p>
<p>So getting swollen and managing swelling can somewhat (in theory, disputed ) enhance the healing process. As does GENTLE massaging, for stimulation. (Massaging is never recommended for initial stages however as you could cause further injury)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would highly recommend cussing </p>
<p>Personally I believe it assists in proper breathing which will increase oxygen flow. Works best if someone is around and you death stare at them while this is happening. </p>
<p>Your negatively charged energy will assist in drawing out the positivity of persons in the vicinity. </p>
<p>None of these have been scientifically proven</p></div>		</li>
