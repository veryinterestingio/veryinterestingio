			<div class="markdown"><p>The only thing i’d add to this is that not all viruses have a lipid bilayer envelope. But they all have proteins that can be denatured, particularly the proteins that allow the virus to enter cells.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”When the membrane dissolves, the virus stops existing”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The virus continues to exist, it still has a capsid, but the proteins required to enter the cell are in the envelope so the virus is now unable to enter cells making it harmless.</p>
<p>Edit: For example, coronaviruses have an envelope with “spike proteins” which are responsible for binding to a receptor on your cells. Damage spike protein or destroy the envelope and the coronavirus can’t infect you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Harming the Covid RNA may not be a solution. The latest issue of Scientific American has some interesting articles on Covid. </p>
<p>From article:</p>
<p>The SARS-CoV-2 genome is a strand of RNA that is about 29,900 bases long — near the limit for RNA viruses. Influenza has about 13,500 bases, and the rhinoviruses that cause common colds have about 8,000. (A base is a pair of compounds that are the building blocks of RNA and DNA.) Because the genome is so large, many mutations could occur during replication that would cripple the virus, but SARS-CoV-2 can proofread and correct copies. This quality control is common in human cells and in DNA viruses but highly unusual in RNA viruses. The long genome also has accessory genes, not fully understood, some of which may help it fend off our immune system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>UV light happens to be right around the same wavelength as Tertiary Carbon bonds. So it turns the bond into a free radical, which then forms a carbonyl group.</p>
<p>So carbon life is full of these tertiary Carbon bonds.  When you have carbon chains in life that suddenly oxidize, it's not so easy to carry on with life any more.</p>
<p>So no, it doesn't just disrupt the DNA, it disrupts everything that has a one of these bonds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! My work focuses on Norovirus and when I see people treat hand sanitizer as a total replacement for hand washing, it makes me cringe. Norovirus is super contagious, super unpleasant, and not effectively neutralized by alcohol.</p>
<p>Yes, alcohol is a great stand-in when hand washing facilities are unavailable, but if there's soap and water nearby, use it!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bleach is a strong oxidising agent, and so chemically reacts with proteins etc. via a Redox mechanism (it's not an acid base action, typically).</p>
<p>Alcohol is primarily a solvent, that induces the breakup of lipid bilayers and misfolding of proteins without necessarily changing the chemistry. Of course, it may also do that, solvents aren't inert, but it can also influence things without necessarily breaking covalent bonds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also both of these are disinfectants meaning they kill the vast majority and work really well at keeping pathogens under control. You have to go a step further to sterilize something (wipe out all pathogens). The hardest pathogen to kill is a bacterial endospore. Endospore are something some bacteria turn into when you try and kill them or they run out of food. Endospore a can live through almost anything and lay dormant for long periods or time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Effectiveness depends on pathogen anatomy, specifically the outermost layer that interacts with the environment. Bacteria for example can be classified as gram negative or gram positive. Gram - the outermost layer is a lipid bilayer (alcohol works well, but if inside the body these are antibiotic resistant). Gram + the outermost layer is a cell wall made of peptidoglycan, antibiotics destroy this peptidoglycan layer. While in Gram - the antibiotics can’t reach the cell wall because it’s surrounded by a membrane.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Not quite. There are a variety of antibiotics that act in a variety of ways. The penicillins famously block the assembly of peptidoglycan, but do not destroy existing peptidoglycan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Forgive me as my last bio class was years and years ago, but do bacteria have cell walls? I thought that was exclusive to the plant kingdom, and in general is what gives vegetation it's rigidity. How would that rigidity help a bacteria? Don't they have to move around and stuff? Or are bacterial cell walls different than the cell walls found in plants?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The outer layers of our skin are dead cells packed with tough proteins, so the membrane disruption caused by alcohol cannot kill anything. There are alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic layers in the skin, which slows the penetration into deeper layers where alcohol could do damage to cells that are still alive. If you have a cut or abrasion exposing deeper layers, alcohol will kill cells and you'll feel pain.</p></div>		</li>
