			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically the entire Hanford site.  Many of the early reactors there did simply dump liquid waste a few hundred yards from the facilities or buried in unmarked vaults in the case of solid waste.  Later facilities would store the waste in tank farms, or giant basins.  By the time the Cold War wound down enough people found out about some of this and discovered that was all a very bad idea.  Radioactivity not withstanding, much of the liquid waste was just nasty chemicals that polluted the groundwater and was making it's way toward the Columbia River.  The tanks have corroded and started leaking and the giant basins leaked as well (did I mention the basin was basically right next to the River?).  All of this just so we could keep up with the Soviets in the nuclear arms race.  Needless to say simply burying nuclear waste isn't a viable solution since the groundwater will eventually get into the supply for a human population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hanford was actually a site started for the production of the bombs dropped on Japan.  It was a secret facility that refined the uranium.  There’s a couple good books on Hanford but the point is that site was operating well before the Cold War.  Not trying to take away from the fact that there has been crazy negligence and ignorance in the disposal of nuclear waste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dilution is unappealing for a bunch of reasons, but my above comment is sort of playing along and illustrating the technical issues even if it was desirable. I took the goal to be &quot;dilute waste to something like background uranium levels&quot;, which mixing it with its original tailings fails to do, even if we ignore that uranium ore tailings are hazardous before adding nuclear reactor waste. Just a note: diluting hazardous waste into tailings would also be counter to the containment philosophy of tailings.</p>
<p>For context, the largest nuclear spill in the US was the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Rock_uranium_mill_spill" target="_blank">Churchrock tailings spill</a>, which is an EPA Superfund site, along with a bunch of <a href="https://www.epa.gov/navajo-nation-uranium-cleanup/cleaning-abandoned-uranium-mines" target="_blank">abandoned uranium mines in the Navajo Nation</a>.</p></div>		</li>
