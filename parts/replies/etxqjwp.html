			<div class="markdown"><p>I put a glass bottle into my hand (accident) about a year and a half ago. Clean slice through both flexor tendons of my middle finger, through an artery, and through my digital nerve (just downstream from where it branches to serve the middle/ring finger area). </p>
<p>Thankfully I gained about 95% of my middle finger function back, but there's still a lot of sticking/hangup on the tendons when fully extended. Nerves got sewn back together, but I wasn't operated on until about 18 hours after the injury so I think the damage there is permanent, can't feel a thing between those two fingers. Also, because the artery was clean cut, the ends pulled away and my hand surgeon wasn't able to reattach it, so they just cauterized and closed it off. </p>
<p>I have immense respect for you and the people in your field, you guys work in a ridiculously packed, delicate, and tiny environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny. I did the same thing as you, basically, also on a bottle (Apple juice).  I however cut my middle finger at the first knuckle down to the bone, sounds like your injury was in your hand?  My finger bends about 95% of the way, with no meaningful sticking (99% of the time, every once in awhile something catches weirdly) and I have normal feeling. I recall some sticking initially but it went away with OT. The scars are very sensitive to being banged on things (makes my whole finger go numb/hurt/tingle).  I had small bits of improvement to various aspects over years.   This happened to me 25yrs ago. </p>
<p>The best part was the removable split thing that had me giving everyone the finger for 4 or so months. </p>
<p>Good luck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, mine will bend totally fine, but OT was a bitch in that aspect. Bending my fingers was something I really struggled with and had to work on, and at one point they had my entire forearm and hand in a brace with all these rubber bands and pulleys to isolate movements. </p>
<p>My surgeon said &quot;don't move your fingers or you'll tear the stitches in your nerves and won't feel again.&quot; My OT said &quot;if you don't move your fingers they'll get stuck how they are and you won't be able to move at all.&quot; So I kinda chose movement over feeling haha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comment really helped me understand something! I cut my finger at the join to the hand recently with a bread knife. It didn’t come off but had stitches etc. Docs said I’d cut through some nerves but weren’t specific. It’s fairly numb which I expected, but I keep grabbing things without thinking and if it touches the scar (which is fairly new) it hurts SO much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would one start with the tendons? In my ortho lecture this week Dr said he preferred starting with arteries - tendons last</p>
<p>Presumed it was imperative to establish blood flow ASAP?
Thanks in advance</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That has something to do with it.  The other factor is that the arterial repair is very much more delicate than the tendon repair, so we tend not to want to risk accidentally avulsing the artery while positioning/suturing the tendon</p></div>		</li>
