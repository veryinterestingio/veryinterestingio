			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate specialized appliances usually, as I feel we clutter our kitchens with too many things.  That said, I absolutely love Cuisinart egg cookers.  People will reply to my comment and say, &quot;but boiling eggs is easy!&quot;  I can do 7 eggs, and not have to worry about under or overcooking, because they are the same way each and every time, and if I leave them sit when done, short of an annoying beep, they won't continue to cook because they work off a steam timer essentially, once the steam is gone, they stop cooking.</p></div>		</li>
