<p>I really hate phone conversations. I much prefer speaking to someone in person.</p>

<p>I'm the same way. I always pace around while talking on the phone. A few years ago I think I figured out why I pace around. I think that, subconsciously, I'm trying to walk to the person to turn the phone call into a face to face conversation, even though my conscience brain knows that's usually impossible.</p></div>		</li>
