			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the theory is that they will prevent things from becoming bunched up and will constantly &quot;fluff&quot; the cloth. However -</p>
<p>&quot;A 2009 Popular Mechanics article was unable to find any beneficial effects from the use of dryer balls.&quot;</p>
<p>So, perhaps the answer to your question is that they don't. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have both the Wool balls and the rubber/silicon balls. I stopped using dryer sheets once our pediatrician told us to because of our baby’s skin condition. We couldn’t even use it on our laundry. For a while, we were just using nothing. Once I got the wooly balls (heh...) our drying time was significantly reduced and our clothes were softer then with out any softener. Now when I feel towels and other clothes with fabric softener, they feel oily and gross. I even bring my own towels when I travel!!  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know what they’re supposed to do, but I can tell you that it works to reduce static buildup at least. I was having huge issues with my clothes being unbelievably staticky until I got some wool dryer balls. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are typically (usually? Sometimes? I don’t count on the authenticity of a lot of them but I’m cynical) made from wool, which is naturally coated in lanolin from a sheep’s skin and acts as a fabric softener. No scent (or sheep odor) though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In spite of the headline, this article says the bumpy plastic ball is a physical agitator (like stirring a pot of food on the stove) to stop the laundry from forming a wet-in-the-middle clump in the dryer, and keep stuffed articles from getting clumpy stuffing (well, in my experience, the result is <em>less</em> clumpy stuffing). The &quot;tester&quot; had a load/dryer combination that didn't suffer from clump to begin with, and that's why he didn't see a difference; both loads came out dry, no reason to say the ball doesn't work as advertised.  However, the ball doesn't add any chemicals to prevent static cling, so you still need fabric softener if you want slippery, fragrant coating on the cloth, duh.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting. If the article that states the plastic balls don’t work Is true but your comment that it keeps everything separated is also true may explain why I am having success with them. It might simply be because my load to drain more quickly and don’t have as much time to build up static electricity. Either way I very rarely need to use dryer sheets. I hate the thought of all of those chemicals all over my clothes!</p></div>		</li>
