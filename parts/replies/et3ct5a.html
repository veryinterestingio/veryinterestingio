			<div class="markdown"><p>Presumably because if they don't, Iraq could kick the bases out (or make a million other things more expensive/inconvenient for America). Whether or not Iraq <em>would</em> do that is up for question. And of course if it tried to, America could find a way to &quot;discourage&quot; them.</p>
