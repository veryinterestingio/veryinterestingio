			<div class="markdown"><p>I prefer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIwdf3WKe3Y" target="_blank">this one</a> because it includes interesting information about <em>why</em> soap works, why it doesn't need to be &quot;antibacterial,&quot; and why simply washing your hands is more effective than using hand sanitizer.     </p>
<p>Plus before he was made to edit it, it had a funny joke at the end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. Both sanitizer and soap will disrupt the virus' lipid membrane and kill it, but soap will also wash the dead virus down the drain while sanitizer just leaves everything on your hands - gross but unlikely to transmit an infection.</p>
<p>The soap is obviously better because it's the only method that actually removes stuff from your hands, but, both are pretty effective at killing pathogens.</p>
<p>It kinda seems like it should be common sense but somehow people think sanitizer is better in some way.  It may be faster to apply so easier for some, but then you also need to let you hands dry naturally and people tend to wipe it off instead, and if you do that, it isn't as effective.</p></div>		</li>
