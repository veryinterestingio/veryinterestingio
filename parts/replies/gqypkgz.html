<p>You also need to accurately &quot;Forecast&quot; your call demand, which is sometimes more art than science.</p>

<p>There is a lot of science, though. There are companies  -Blue Pumpkin comes to mind - that specialise in call centre staffing algorithms, based on your expected call demand. I worked at places that had call stats dating back years, and their ability to predict call volumes was very good. </p>
<p>But any random event can ruin that planning. An internet outage - such as we've seen sporadically over the last few months - means an almost instant uptick in call volumes, as people can't get to their online banking, for example. Can't predict or plan for those.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes a mass of science. I was with a major Australian Government CallCentre Network, (5000+ seat at capacity), I was with the Central Management Area. A good forecast was critical, it what never a good thing to have the CEO (of the Agency) stand in front of the Call Boards and look pissed.
Yes random events such as a major Government announcement out of the blue could really turn the day to poo!! I was lucky in that I was the Finance/Resources Manager so only guilty by association.
