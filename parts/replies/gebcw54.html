<p>About inflation, things are set up so that as the economy grows, the amount of money grows just a bit faster. Due to machinery, processes improving etc. the number of actual things grows over time, but the amount of money grows just a bit faster, causing a small bit of inflation. This is considered a good thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the better answer to his question is that inflation encourages money to circulate.  When you have no inflation or worse deflation money tends to sit in bank accounts and be saved going unused.  Money sitting in a bank account is not productive to the economy.  Inflation encourages money to be active either through investment, or through spending.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This may be a dumb question but why do we not really care that inflation (good, steady inflation) will continue indefinitely?<br />
Eventually you’d be paying $1000 for a loaf of bread and making $20,000 an hour etc.<br />
is it just because countries and their currencies don’t tend to last long enough for it to really become cumbersome to deal with such large numbers?<br />
Do countries ever reset the numerical value of their currencies? Like if the US declared one day that $100 is equal to 1 “dollero” and they’re only issuing dolleros now and you can exchange your dollars for dolleros, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, Econs major here. We (i.e. normal consumers) don't pay attention because it usually is very small (2-3% average change for most of the developed world annually). Not only that, average wages SHOULD increase by at least the same % each year, so you get slightly more money to pay for slightly more expensive goods. Whether that happens or not is up to the government, employers, and/or demand for workers.</p>
<p>However, one thing that stays static is debt and savings. So inflation (in theory) encourages you to spend more now, which keeps the economy alive and healthy (money exchanging for services, keeping people in business), because (in theory) your savings are worth less every year in &quot;real&quot; value.</p>
<p>And yes, countries have reset their currencies before. Take Germany, who've switched their currencies 3 times to combat &quot;hyperinflation&quot;, where inflation was so mind-bogglingly high (due to money printer go brrr) that Germans back then needed to be paid TWICE A DAY because the price of bread might have doubled during that time.</p></div>		</li>

Then we adopted the euro and that made it so we could go from 1000 lira to 50 euro cents (I think that's the approx conversion? It was so long ago I forgot). Basically we got rid of an inflated currency and adopted another one, so it is entirely possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is very well explained, I would note that how much money is in the economy is not as important as some descriptions of inflation may imply.</p>
<p>A lot of money that's created gets spent <em>at</em> CPI goods once, and then just kind of hangs around, in people's savings, in investments, etc.</p>
<p>What really matters for inflation is the flow-rate of money that is actually being spent at consumer goods. The total quantity of money in the economy is 1) very difficult to define, much less measure, and 2) not relevant for price-setters. Price-setters only care about the money that's headed their way.</p>
<p>It gets simpler to explain inflation, when it's conceived of as spending vs goods, as opposed to amount-of-money vs goods.</p></div>		</li>

<ol>
<li>How does money get &quot;created&quot;?</li>
<li>What are &quot;CPI goods&quot;? </li>
<li>What is &quot;flow-rate&quot;?</li>
<li>I assume the &quot;price setter&quot; sets prices? But what prices and/or what goods? Also, why do they only care about money?</li>
<li>WTF is a &quot;price setter&quot; I'm unironically curious now...</li>
<li>&quot;Spending vs goods&quot; and &quot;amount-of-money vs goods&quot; sounds like terms straight out of an economics textbook and that makes me uncomfortable... that's not so much a question as it is a statement about how I feel emotionally.</li>

<p>1- Big printer.  Or virtually, through ledgers.  (This is partially a joke, but partially true. Without a long discussion of the fed, it's hard to answer more accurately)</p>
<p>2- Consumer price index.  A tracker of the price of staple goods over time.  Used by economists to find real changes in value over time by pegging currency to a suite of goods.</p>
<p>3- The speed at which money changes hands.  If our imaginary economy has one dollar, and it gets spent once a day, that is a flow rate.  If that same dollar gets spent a twice a day, the flow rate has doubled (and, presumably, so has income).  </p>
<p>4- People who sell and buy things are price setters.  When managers at your local grocery set prices, they consider a bunch of factors. They care about money relative to the value of the good(s) they are selling, and later want to buy.  They use money, rather than other goods, because it's convenient and you can pay your taxes with it (seriously, this is what my secured transactions professor said).</p>
<p>5- WE are all price setters, every time we decide whether to engage in a transaction at a given price.  More usefully, people who consider the value of a good before deciding how much to buy or sell it for are price setters.  The manager at your hardware store is a price setter.  So is the pricing team at generic tech company.</p>
<p>6- There is finite amount of stuff (a term that includes goods and services) in the world at any given time.  There is also a finite amount of money.  Divide one by the other.  As the amount of stuff goes up, each dollar buys more, since the number of dollars didn't go up with it.  Alternatively, as the number of dollars goes up, the amount of stuff it can buy goes down, since there are more dollars, but the amount of stuff hasn't gone up.  </p>
<p>If it's easier, imagine each dollar has to correspond with a certain amount of stuff.  If you add more stuff, but not more dollars, then you can add an even share of that stuff to each dollar.  If you add more dollars, but not more stuff, then you need to take a little bit of stuff from each dollar so that they can all have some stuff associated with them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1.Don't know how to simplify this to ELI5 but I'll try. When the bank wants to give out a loan, they don't have to hand over 'cash', they hand over an agreement saying 'so and so bank will hand over this much money' which is functionally the equivalent of cash. This means banks can immediately create 'money' out of nowhere. </p>
<p>BUT remember this is for a loan. So whoever took out the loan must pay it back. In this manner the bank makes money (they give out money then get back that same money plus interest from loan) but also puts out money into the economy. </p>
<p>(This is a pisspoor explanation on review but it'll do).</p>
<p>2 &quot;Consumer Price Index&quot;. Basically a standard set of items your average person might buy. Everyone buys different things but governments need a way to measure how much stuff costs. So they make a standard shopping list and the stuff in there are CPI goods.</p>
<p>3 Flow rate is a measure of quickly a dollar is being spent in an economy. So if I take a dollar and do nothing with it the whole year then it's flow rate was 0. If I spend it on candy on NYE then it's 1. If the shopkeeper then uses it to pay his toll on the same day then it's 2 and so forth. </p>
<p>4 and 5 Price Setter is basically the person selling the good. They are quite literally 'setting the price' of the goods. They only care about money because they care for profits. Now, not every company/person selling is a price setter. Say a company sells apples at 1$ per apple. Say a new company also wants to sell apples, if they set their price at 1.5$, they can't sell any. So they have to set their price at 1$ as well. But they didn't really set the price there did they?</p></div>		</li>

<li>
<p>This is a very complicated answer that has to do with Fractional-Reserve Banking. Money is created through the issuance of new debt. Whenever a bank issues a loan, there is an increase in the money supply. Yes, this is as wild as it sounds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CPI is the Consumer Price Index. It’s a measure of prices across various bundles of goods over time to see a general level of prices and this measure inflation over years/decades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How fast things move. In this case, money. How does money move? It is spent by person A on tutoring to person B, then person B spends it on a sandwich at a local shop owned by C, then C spends it paying his mortgage... how fast the average dollar moves is what we call the Velocity of Money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(and 5) Price setters are just businesses or anyone selling anything. Price setters are bound by the market type they exist in. They care about what the <em>current level</em> of prices are, which is largely dependent on demand, and how many people are buying things.</p>
</li>
<li>So yeah, think if it like this. </li>
</ol>
<p>You have two things to think about when thinking about money in the economy.  1) how much of it there is (the Money Supply) and 2) How fast it actually circles through the economy. Think about it: If you keep the amount of money the same, but  it cycles twice as fast through the economy, then that means the TOTAL AMOUNT SPENT is higher.</p>
<p>If you know a bit about algebra there’s a neat equation for this.</p>
<p>MV = PY </p>
<p>Money supply <em> money Velocity = Price level </em> Output</p>
<p>money supply (basically how much money is in everyone’s checking and savings bank accounts) times Velocity (how fast it’s spent) should be the same as (equal to) the Average price level for stuff times the Amount of Stuff (goods and Services)</p></div>		</li>

The &quot;flow-rate&quot; was quite stable from the 60s through the 80s, spiked a bit in the 90s, and then declined all the way through the 2000s and 2010s.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it encourages money to continue circulating, and thus encourages people to continue to produce and consume goods and services.   </p>
<p>In deflation, money gets more valuable over time, just from sitting there. So people are incentivized to hoard money, which has no intrinsic value, slowing down the real economy. As the real economy slows, people are even more incentivized to reduce their economic activity and spending, and the cycle begins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saving isn't just &quot;hoarding money&quot; though, it's putting off a purchase today in favor of one at a later date. If you view the whole timeline of the economy at once, the circulation is still occurring, just with a different time preference. </p>
<p>Inflation gives an incentive to be present-oriented instead of future-oriented. This works fine the majority of the time, but causes huge problems when something unexpected happens that shocks the economy and nobody has any savings to carry them through a recession.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can think of cash as also having a demand/supply line. If the economy has more jobs, more production, and more growth, people will have a higher demand for money. Monetary policy is a way to handle supply on that line. </p>
<p>If a country is in a recession, demand for cash may be low due to unemployment, less investments, etc. The federal bank can enact &quot;expansionary&quot; monetary policy by lowering interest rates and increasing the money supply in the economy by buying bonds or loaning more money to banks. This increase in money supply and lower interest rates will encourage more people to take loans to invest in businesses, as well as encourage spending overall. However, it will basically guarantee higher rates of inflation. </p>
<p>That being said, &quot;contractionary&quot; monetary policy may be used to try to curb inflation when it gets a little too out of control by reducing the rate at which money enters the economy. Increasing interest rates disincentivizes taking out loans to make businesses or big purchases, and instead incentivizes investing in those higher rates, lowering the demand for cash. Taking money out of the economy by selling bonds and increasing interest rates may slow down economic growth, but can be necessary.</p></div>		</li>
