<p>Can men have erections in space?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As far as I know, yes. Although it takes a while for the circulatory to adapt to microgravity, eventually it should be able to provide the proper blood flow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why can't humans have sex in space?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The physics of sex are pretty reliant on gravity to keep two people together. As you'd thrust, there'd be an equal and opposite force pushing you back that you'd have to overcome for the next thrust. There was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2suit" target="_blank">2Suit</a> specially designed to use velcro straps to keep partners together during zero-g copulation.</p>
<p>Another reason you don't hear about astronauts bunking up very often is that in all reality, they are co-workers on the job. You don't (typically) have employees hooking up on the job, and the same professionalism is expected of astronauts.</p>
<p>Also, sex can be...messy. Fluids can float around and get into sensitive equipment and cause a whole bunch of problems so it's better to avoid those kinds of situations.</p>
<p>Finally, the risk of pregnancy and potential loss of the fetus in space is too high and there are too many unknown of how the human reproductive system would handle the pregnancy. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110809060317/http://gateway.nlm.nih.gov/MeetingAbstracts/ma?f=102222743.html" target="_blank">Some experiments with rats</a> have shown that gravity does play a crucial roll in fetal development.</p></div>		</li>
