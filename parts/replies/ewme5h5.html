			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that's a valid argument simply from shear size... They predated very different animals. Even today you dont see GWs attacking whales umless they're weak/old/young (or a particularly small species i Guess), they mainly stick to seal-like mammals. Megalodon was almost forced to eat big stuff to get by</p>
<p>In my opinion that's like saying a fox drove tigers extinct. </p>
<p>I saw Somewhere on this thread that the real reason megalodon died out was the pole freeze 6 thousand years ago that decreased the water level and thus had many consequences for the big mammals in the oceans and those who predated them</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should be asking for sources that there <em>are</em> &quot;living fossils&quot; instead. Because things only get called that due to subjectivity and ignorance. The idea that tens of millions of years could pass with <em>no</em> change just doesn't hold any water. Even if parts of the external morphology are similar due to ecological restraints, other parts can change, internal morphology can change, behavior can change, and the genetics certainly do. Literally any paleontological study of evolution disproves the idea that things don't change. But here are some targeted examples of clades often called &quot;living fossils&quot;: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23382020" target="_blank">coelocanths</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22905810" target="_blank">tuataras</a>,
<a href="http://paleopolis.rediris.es/cg/CG2003_L01_CCE/" target="_blank">lingulate brachiopods</a>, and <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/62/" target="_blank">tadpole shrimp</a>. And <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jul/06/why-its-time-to-make-living-fossils-extinct" target="_blank">here</a> <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-living-fossil-14360996/" target="_blank">are</a> <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/the-falsity-of-living-fossils-39524" target="_blank">some</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/08/a-rant-about-living-fossils/" target="_blank">essays</a> on the matter. </p>
<p>Pro-tip: If a neontologist---even a respected one---says a group is an example of &quot;living fossils&quot;, they almost certainly haven't actually delved into the expansive diverse history of that group, so they may as well be Jon Snow on that subject. And many sci comm sources are also guilty of perpetuating the myth instead of delving into the research that disproves them, including museum education &amp; outreach departments that aren't able to or don't work closely with paleontologists studying those clades.</p>
<p>I'm not going to give specifics because it would be too identifying, but I study another group often called &quot;living fossils&quot;. Much of my work on them involves studying the millions of years of change that supposedly hasn't happened but is actually quite substantial. I've spoken to established neontologists who've spent their careers on the same clade as me, and they were shocked to hear how different most of the extinct species looked. They'd just been assuming instead of actually looking at the literature.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Thought to be the most ancient conifer present on the planet, these living fossils are identical to Monkeypuzzle trees fossilized 160 million years ago. &quot;</p></div>		</li>
