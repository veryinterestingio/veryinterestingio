			<div class="markdown"><p>The photons are very dispersed, so you would need a telescope lens of a gargantuan diameter in order to pick up all the photons. Here’s a 5 minute video by The Infographics Show that explains it: <a href="https://youtu.be/SbXNmVsp_t8" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/SbXNmVsp_t8</a></p>
<p>He mentions in the video that a telescope would need to be at least 4.4 light years across in order to see a dinosaur, the dino would look like a small dot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine the processing required to resolve an image? It couldn’t be real time. It’d take years just to collect the data let alone process it. And being that far away, think of the relative motion and rotations it’d have to account for. I’m starting to think this project won’t work.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's deep - and a very interesting point</p></div>		</li>

<p>Space is not actually a vacuum there are always errant molecules.  Negligible for most things, but not for maintaining light over eons of time.  You would quickly lose fidelity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well in your question you said: if you had a telescope strong enough.</p>
<p>Asuming the light from earth encounters nothing but the vacume of space, it would thereticly contintue to move forward indeffinetly.
however i would asume that the &quot;beam&quot; of light would consine to grow wider and wider.
eventualy resulting in such a huge surface area that no real telescope could ever pick up enough particles to create an image.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but remember that there would be also some kind of polution or debris in the space between the dino and telescope that blocks the light beams. So it could be possible that you just would'nt be able to see much on the image. Just saying...</p></div>		</li>
