			<div class="markdown"><p>Carob can be really good, sounds like you might have had a sugar-free version? I haven't heard of people with diabetes choosing it over chocolate before.
Really the only benefit to it is that it's caffeine free, unlike chocolate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad who is diabetic eats ultradark chocolate. It's not quite baking chocolate, but it's so high in the cocoa solids content that the fiber counteracts the sugar so the net carbs are very low. It's one of the few &quot;treats&quot; he still has, otherwise eating a pretty strict keto diet.</p>
<p>Thankfully it works for him, he's never been on insulin and his doctor took him off his medication last year so long as he keeps a strict diet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You make a valid point. I was subjected to the sugar-free version, and it never occurred to me that sugar would ever be added to the stuff. Now that you've lowered that particular mental shield, I'm going to have to track some sugared carob, because my memory also tells me that it was <em>this close</em> to being good. That's why I equate it with sad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing I would like to add is that not all sugar free products contain artificial noncaloric high intensity sweeteners. There is a lot of products out there that contain natural sweeteners (monk fruit, stevia etc) in their formulation that do not have the same impact in your GI tract as sugar alcohols and others. One problem when using high intensity sweeteners instead of sugar- aside from the mouthfeel mentioned above (which is extremely important)- is the sweetness  profile. Sugar has a temporal profile that people are used to and desire. Meaning, sugar sweetness &quot;hits you&quot; early and it doesn't linger. That is what we are used to consuming and we expect it from products. A lot of the natural high intensity sweeteners have a delayed sweetness (hits you a lot later than sugar) that lingers and some have additional off flavors such as lingering bitterness. All these make it really challenging to mimic the sweetness profile of sugar accurately and that affects the entire flavor profile and all sensory attributes of a product not just sweetness. Add to that the mouthfeel (viscosity/thickness of a product) visual (shine, frosting etc) and other functional issues created by removing sugar from the formulation and you have a very challenging task!

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you're in the artificial sweeteners industry I was wondering what your thoughts were on allulose?</p>
<p>I've started using that over erythritol for most things.  It doesn't cause intestinal issues for be and it melts better when cooked.</p>
<p>I've noticed the price coming down a little over the last year and I'm hoping it totally replaces other sugar alcohols like malitol in sugar free junk food.</p></div>		</li>
