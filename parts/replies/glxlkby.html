			<div class="markdown"><p>For anyone wondering, there is an alarm clock app on the iPhone to help with this. You’re more likely to move during light sleep phase, hence you set the alarm clock for the time you want to wake up and leave the iPhone on the bed. Up to half an hour before it will sound the alarm when I believes your in light sleep.</p>
<p>I used it for naps and it seemed like I’d get less groggy (or it was all in my head)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer must be wrong. It seems to be propagated by reddit hive thought. Every time this question is being asked, this is the most upvoted answer for it and because of that becomes most upvoted for the next time too.</p>
<p>From my observation when I wake up after extra sleeping and am feeling tired, I wake up naturally - without alarms, without some kind of noise or other external disturbance. In fact, the extra sleep that I get I've noticed is always dream sleep. This makes me think the tiredness is not being caused because I'm being woken up during deep sleep.</p>
<p>It has been shown that duration of deep sleep decreases every successive sleep cycle. Therefore, in the morning the more you sleep, the less likely you are to wake up during deep sleep.</p></div>		</li>
