<p>For the gas giants, the convention has been to define zero altitude to be the atmospheric depth at which the pressure equals 1 bar (100 kPa).</p>

<p>If you were flying an aircraft on Jupiter, could you fly at an altitude of -100,000 meters?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes in fact the Galileo mission survived approximately 140ish km past the 0 altitude point.  The temperatures and pressures are rather extreme, but compared to the max extremes further down in jupiter they are quite mild.  Youd find a variety of chemical cloud compositions, but besides those factors and rather large wind speeds one could probably design a craft that could stay at that altitude without being destroyed for some time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Curiosity landed in a crater site that was about 4.4 km below the average radius/pressure line of Mars.  I'm not sure about the average landing altitude, but in sure if you looked up past missions the info would be readily available.</p></div>		</li>
