<p>It is also large enough too hold on to a lot of the atmosphere it started with </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just FYI, this is also true for Venus. </p>
<p>Although we talk a lot about how 95% of the Venusian atmosphere is CO<em><em>2</em></em>, the atmosphere is also so thick that it still has more than twice the total amount of nitrogen as Earth fitting into that remaining 5%.</p>
<p>Moreover, looking at the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/AElooxM.jpg" target="_blank">Nitrogen Isotope Fraction</a> can tell us how strong atmospheric escape is, since lighter isotopes will escape preferentially and throw off that isotopic ratio. Notice how Earth and Venus have essentially the same ratio in that graph - which in turn tells us that they're both about equally as primordial.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(so it can have a noticeable weather that collects water from the surface lowlands and rain it down on the mountains) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weather has less to do with how primordial your atmosphere is, and more to do with...</p>
<p>1) Whether the atmosphere is dense enough to allow for the liquid state of a common condensable (water is good, but so are ammonia, methane, carbon dioxide, etc). </p>
<p>2) Whether the vertical temperature gradient is steep enough to allow the formation of rain clouds.</p>
<p>If we're getting technical here, not even Earth has a primordial atmosphere. The impact that formed our Moon destroyed whatever early atmosphere Earth once had (one we're fairly sure was much higher in noble gases), replacing it with several different atmospheres over time - <a href="https://i.imgur.com/SvRQHYc.jpg" target="_blank">including a rock vapor atmosphere</a> for the first few thousand years immediately after impact (from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2944365/" target="_blank">Zahnle, et al, 2010</a>, a fun read).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and has heating in the core to keep a semi liquid mantle for the continental plates to float on for billions off years after it was first formed. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, also true for Venus.</p>
<p>The thing we think is different here - i.e. why Venus does not have tectonic plates - has more to do with its lack of asthenosphere. On Earth this is the layer that transitions between crust and mantle, and we believe it's packed with hydrated minerals - water has seeped into the region and chemically combined with the rock. This is important, because hydrated minerals are much more malleable than non-hydrated minerals; this is what lets Earth's tectonic plates slip around with relatively low friction.</p>
<p>On Venus, the planet is essentially dessicated. The vast majority of water vapor escaped long ago when temperature spiked and oceans-worth of water evaporated. That also means there's likely little to no hydrated minerals left, essentially locking the planet's crust into place.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sure - the y-axis is showing the relative ratio of the ^(15)N isotope of nitrogen compared to the ^(14)N isotope. Both are stable and naturally occurring, but ^(15)N is about 1/100^th to 1/500^th as common in our Solar System - though exactly how much less common depends on where and what atmospheric evolution processes that area is subject to.</p>
<p>The primordial values (i.e. what came from the proto-solar nebula that formed our Solar System) of this ratio are closer to 1/500^th, as marked in the graph by the range of light blue marked &quot;SUN (N in solar nebula)&quot;. We're fairly sure all planets started with a similar ratio, but that ratio evolved as these planets were subject to different kinds of atmospheric loss; note that Jupiter's nitrogen ratio falls in that same range, suggesting Jupiter has not had considerable atmospheric loss during its lifetime, and the primordial nitrogen ratio has remained.</p>
<p>For other planets, that's not necessarily the case, though. Since ^(15)N is one neutron heavier than ^(14)N, it's a little harder for it to reach escape velocity at a given temperature. For an atmosphere that's experienced a lot of atmospheric loss, we'll see a lot more ^(14)N preferentially escaping, which will drive the nitrogen ratio up as more ^(15)N sticks around relative to the^(14)N that's more likely to escape.</p>
<p>Both Earth and Venus are over on the right of the graph, the area which shows &quot;secondary processing&quot;, i.e. something happened to change that primordial ratio from it's original 1/500th value. For these two planets, a fair bit of atmosphere has escaped, leaving a ratio closer to 1/300th for both planets; in retrospect, that's not too surprising, since the two planets have very similar masses and escape velocities, so we'd expect atmospheric losses to be pretty similar, too. (Note that this is also further disproof of the myth &quot;all planets need a magnetic field to hold on to their atmosphere&quot; - Earth has one, but Venus doesn't, yet loss rates are very similar.)</p>
<p>Mars is also a particularly interesting case here, since we have two samples marked in the graph: one from Martian rock, labeled ALH84001 for the Martian meteorite we took the sample from, and another from the current atmosphere labeled &quot;ATM&quot;. When the nitrogen first got locked up in the rock, there had apparently already been some escape of ^(14)N, since its ratio is closer to Earth and Venus than primordial values. Since then, however, the atmosphere has continued to preferentially lose ^(14)N until the nitrogen ratio in the atmosphere is now more like 1/180^th. This essentially show atmospheric loss in action, and again, shouldn't be super-surprising given Mars' lower mass and escape velocity.</p>
<p>Finally, notice Titan, largest moon of Saturn, is off the top of the graph with a value closer to 1/60th. While Titan already has tons of nitrogen (1.5x higher pressure than Earth's atmosphere), it must have had way more in the past for the ratio to climb that high - that's an awful lot of ^(14)N it must have lost! Again, from gravity considerations, though, not surprising since Titan has even lower mass and escape velocity than Mars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For what it's worth, I never said water was necessary, I said an atmosphere that could transport fluids around as weather. I had in mind places like the gas planet moons that likely have liquid methane or other stuff that is normally a gas on Earth. So if any mountains did form on those moons, it would be subject to weathering much like Earth mountains. </p>
<p>As for the presence of hydrated minerals aiding tectonic motion:  I knew that; on Earth, water helps the motion of plates, especially by lubricating fault lines. I hadn't known about the role of hydrated minerals deeper under the surface. Is it known why Earth's asthenospheric minerals manage to hang onto their water despite the heat and pressure? Also, do we know roughly when Venus surface temperature went ballistic? Because, comparing to Earth whom we know to be formed around the same time, it could give us a good idea of how long it took water locked up below the crust to migrate and escape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tidal heating due to the moon is completely negligible as a geologic energy source. The largest term by far in Earth's geologic energy budget is radiogenic heating, and the next is the release of latent heat as the outer core material crystallizes onto the inner core. In addition, heating due to the giant impact wouldn't ultimately have any long term effect on the thermodynamics of Earth past several tens of millions of years after it happened. The planet can only get so hot before material vaporizes off, and it was already that hot just 30 million years before the impact happened anyways—its not gonna mean anything another <em>billion</em> years later.</p>
<p>And maybe a bit pedantic, but the mantle isn't at all liquid, it's very much solid. It behaves viscously over geologic time, but on human timescales it's still solid, not ooey gooey like chocolate.</p>
<p>I'm interested to hear where you heard that all the terrestrial planets experience tectonics at some point. My understanding of Mars at least is that it never had <em>tectonics plates</em> per se, but it experienced processes similar to tectonism early in it's history, such as the processes that led to the Valles Mariners, and likewise with Mercury. </p>
<p>It's rough to even try to say early Archean <em>Earth</em>, prior to 3 billion years ago, actually had plate tectonics. It's an open question among geodynamicists whether plates subducted in the same way back then as they do today, because heat remaining from planetary accretion changes the thermodynamics of the system. While aspects of plate tectonics were present then, there's no doubt it behaved in ways we'd find unfamiliar today, and I'd only expect it to be even stranger on other planets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did say that I wasn't certain about the effects of tidal heating. As for plate tectonic activity, I am definitely guilt of being sloppy in my phrasing. Tectonic activity, including volcanos and non-erupting bulges of magma below the surface are still tectonic activity and totally overlooked by me in my attempt to answer the question.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because it seems like you might know...</p>
<p>Other than a few pages in book 5 of Annals of the Former World, where does someone who doesn't have a doctorate in one of the Geosciences and a fellowship grant to burn go to learn what we've learned since then.  That had better (understandable to me) coverage than anything else I've found, and a good chunk of that was informed speculation with the caveat &quot;it's really damn hard to know, but maybe someday as the science advances we'll learn more.&quot;  It left me fascinated and hungering for more.</p>
<p>I know they can't all be a Pulitzer winning text packed with information, understandable to the everyman, read like an adventure novel and anything learned since then and and boiled down to my level is still just going to be informed speculation at best, but it's been 20 years since it was written, and there's been a lot of roadcuts and even entire mountains leveled since then and I've been dying for more for a long time now.</p>
<p>In the bookstore it seems like you can't walk 5 feet without tripping over another  pop-sci  cosmology and/or theoretical physics &quot;edge of knowledge + speculation + my own wild theories + footnote: this could be totally wrong but it's interesting an I'll be long dead before the tech exists to prove or disprove it so lets run with it&quot; page turner.  Is there a Bryan Green of Ancient Geology?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there is, I've never heard of them, and if you find out, I hope you let me know! I only realized how absolutely crazy geology can be taking undergraduate courses with a professor particularly interested in Archean geology. I wouldn't have glanced twice at Earth's geology if it weren't for him. It's a damn shame that even though everyone and their mother's published a best-selling book on cosmology and string theory, books about the Earth we stand on seem to get far less attention.</p>
<p>Geology as a field moves faster these days than ever before. It's still a field in its infancy compared to physics, which was already insanely advanced 100 years ago without the benefit of computers. Anyone trying to survey the field right now and find the bleeding edge of our understanding of Earth's past is going to spend a <em>lot </em>of time sifting through speculation and heated debates.</p></div>		</li>
