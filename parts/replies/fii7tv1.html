<p>If I might ELI5 it a slight bit more:  It's the difference between someone giving a speech to a stadium full of people, and a stadium full of people trying to have conversations with every other person in the stadium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, think about Cable, even if there are 600 channels, everyone gets the same 600 channels. The total data you need to send out is just those 600 channels. With internet, you could have 600 people in a simgle city each watch or using the internet for something different. Satellites cover a pretty ulhuge area, so although it seems like more data is being put out by cable, the data necessary per person is pretty small, cause no one really has a choice</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>also, the dish is mostly there for reception the real big guys in the transmission equipment are the ones sending the signal, but with internet you and everyone else will have to send back the information to the satellite.-</p></div>		</li>

<p>There might be lag on it, how would you know? All you're seeing is the images and sound as they arrive.</p>

<p>Wouldn't that make shows start at wildly different times depending on where you are?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The transmission moves very quickly and becomes too &quot;spread apart&quot; to detect properly over a long enough distance, so the distance required to make a large delay is too big to see anything clearly. </p>
<p>There are several other factors to delay and more than one way to send the video data, so even if you compare your machines to your neighbours while watching the same broadcast you will often find significant delay between the two.</p>
<p>The reason you can still &quot;catch&quot; a broadcast over huge distances is either a satellite broadcast or another tech capable of gigantic range, or several broadcasting stations.</p>
<p>In both cases delay is diminished because: the satellite would be about as far from everyone, and broadcasting stations can synchronise broadcast times. </p>
<p>In any case, there are several technologies for this and the majority of delays are caused by random or not obvious things like how long it takes a local modem to decode the video/audio and such.</p>
<p>Edit: worth noting that I'm not an expert and any of my knowledge can be outdated or misleading. As far as I know, right now most places use cable or data streaming and not broadcast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not wildly different, but that even happens with Over-The-Air digital TV and with now all-digital cable. Every TV (or cable box) decodes the digital signal at a different speed, for orders of magnitude larger than the imperceptible lightspeed lag for different distances. Which type and quality of codecs in your device, how many dropped or interpolated frames from weak signal, etc.</p>
<p>Nobody is watching the touchdown, home run, or election results call, for example, at exactly the same time even though they're watching the same channel. And everybody is watching it some measurable and perceptible time in the past, unlike the olden days of analog TV where for all intents and purposes, you, your kid on the upstairs TV, and everybody in your local TV station's coverage area heard the crack of the bat on the ball and saw it head out into the stands at the exact same time.</p>
<p>Try it. Turn on 2 different TVs in your house to the same channel. They won't be totally in sync. When I was growing up before digital TV, they would be.</p>
<p>With digital cable it's even longer because speed of light/electromagnetic signal in copper coax cable is lower than in air. Fiber optic, faster than copper, is still lower than air. Plus lots of amplifiers, repeaters, with their own electronics delays. And your neighbors may be on a different node or signal path with different amplifiers etc.</p>
<p>Satellite has the speed of light delays of the high geosynchronous orbit, plus dropped frame processing and your own electronics in-device high-end or slower cheap/older box processing.</p>
<p>Same for any AM or FM station that broadcasts in HD Radio (HD = Hybrid Digital, not High Definition, when referring to US/Canada radio broadcasts.) There is an encode delay at the station and a decide delay in your HD Radio. </p>
<p>To avoid weird time skips as signal fade makes your radio pop in between speed-of-light analog reception and encode/decode-delayed digital reception (signal itself is speed of light but audio delayed by all that processing), the stations add a  delay to the analog audio that hopefully is within a few milliseconds of what they expect the typical home or car HD Radio decide delay plus station encode delay will be.</p></div>		</li>
