<p>Classical Sanskrit, at least, underwent substantial standardization and simplification. While it's possible that Vedic speakers could understand Classical speakers, I suspect the reverse is not true. There has been a substantial loss in grammatical complexity in Sanskrit over that period.</p>
<p>However, in this situation, Sanskrit is akin to Latin, Classical Hebrew, or Coptic. It's effectively a liturgical language... though I'd point out that modern Church Latin isn't particularly similar to the Latin used even in the Principate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Was that the language that they do chants in that are very old and they have to memorize it exactly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The post was in regards to how far back in time one can go...Pali and Prakrit both ,although language of masses, were developed later on when their need arose. It was from them only that modern Hindi came to be..so I intentionally did not mention them...plus atleast one still studies Sanskrit(albeit in a diluted form ) in Schools...</p></div>		</li>
