<p>and either way the said ups and downs to come make life interesting enough to hang around, and there's a bit of positivity in the fact that no matter how bad your life gets you will eventually return to a better state</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re only stuck in that state until you realize that lasting happiness doesn’t come from chasing and attaining “rewards”. You already have everything you need to be happy. You just aren’t doing it. </p>
<p>You need to shift your thinking from happiness as something that happens to you to happiness is a choice. Take the time to intentionally focus on what’s good in your life and allow yourself to feel the full appreciation of it. </p>
<p>Admittedly one challenge is that if you haven’t been doing this for your entire life, you probably haven’t cultivated many blessings... if your entire life is using drugs, watching porn and playing video games, you aren’t going to magically have a lot of things to appreciate. That makes starting a little difficult. But you can even start with those.  </p>
<p>It gets easier and easier and you get happier and happier.</p></div>		</li>
