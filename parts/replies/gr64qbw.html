<blockquote>
<p>(* not actually berries) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>By their botanical definition, berries are &quot;simple&quot; fruits (i.e. a single globe of fruit flesh) that form from a single ovary, typically with multiple seeds <em>within.</em> Raspberries and blackberries comprise multiple 'globes', so are not true berries - and strawberries have their seeds on the outside, so they are &quot;accessory fruit&quot;.</p>
<p>Technically, bananas, watermelon and a few citrus varieties qualify as botanical berries.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(*not actually nuts) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, the botanical definition of a nut is a fruit that comprises an inedible hard shell and a seed inside - and the shell does not naturally open by itself. This is how walnuts and hazelnuts, for example, differ - a walnut shell naturally opens as it matures, but a hazelnut shell does not. 'True nut' shells normally release their seed by animal intervention (it gets eaten and pooped out), the shell just breaks down over time, or some other form of external agent.</p>
<p>But <em>originally</em>, the term 'nut' basically covered any edible kernel with a hard shell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Squash and cucumbers fruits are a special type of berry called a pepo that has a thick rind. Another type of berry with a thick rind, and also divided into segments inside, is a hesperidium like an orange or lime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haven't seen it yet here, but the fascinating thing about strawberries is that those 'seeds' aren't actually seeds at all but entire fruits called achenes. Which makes the strawberry both an accessory AND an aggregate fruit. I'm not aware if there are any other fruits like that.</p></div>		</li>
