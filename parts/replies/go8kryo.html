<p>Actually it was the opposite. Covid numbers slumped so steeply in the summer that it took longer than expected to return pivotal phase 2 trial results, which were event (covid cases) based. </p>
<p>See the whole saga about vaccine results before election day; the TLDR of it was they originally projected enough covid cases in the trial to make a determination on efficacy by late September/Early October. That didn't pan out, and though the data was ultimately available the final week of October as cases started to resurge, the FDA asked them to wait on releasing the results until the following Monday.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They fast tracked the vaccines. The normal process is designed to fail safe, and takes alot of time on purpose, so we know that a new drug actually works on the long term.</p>
<p>Normal process is six months of paperwork before they start a trial on a new drug, then the do phase 1 trials (does  the drug have a desired effect - non human based tests), then they do phase 2 (human based, is it dangerous to humans tests), then phase 3 (improving efficiency, data capture for long term effectiveness). Yes, I over simplified the phase descriptions. </p>
<p>For COVID, they ran phase 1+2+3 in parallel, and the trials still are not complete (why they don't have the data for the vaccine to be allowed to be administered to kids)</p></div>		</li>

<p>In the West we're a bit spoiled for choice, and we wanted to go with vaccines that actually worked the best which means inefficiencies as we wait to see which cantidates we need to mass produce</p>

<p>What you call inefficiencies, I call necessary waste. Good explanations though, thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, &quot;inefficiency&quot; carries with it some negative connotations but I don't mean to imply that it was the wrong or suboptimal route, though there were advantages. e.g. the UK is a leader on vaccine rollout mostly due to their heavy reliance on the Oxford/Astrazenica vaccine produced domestically, which worked out with middle of the pack efficacy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I totally get it and agreed. I deal with all these big players quite often with work. AZ, J&amp;J, BMS, Moderna. They are all extremely methodical and know what they are doing with this stuff. Efficiency, at least at a high level, is their thing.</p></div>		</li>
