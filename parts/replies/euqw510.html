			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep this is a real serious thing. People can  end up being in intensive care units. The low phosphate is extremely concerning here because it is the building block for ATP (adenosine tri phosphate), the energy unit made from glucose and other sources used by the body. If that is very low, you can’t maintain the simplest bodily functions like breath, heart beat, nerve conduction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Refeeding syndrome is seen in children with severe acute malnutrition of both types marasmus and kwashiorkor. To avoid this they are initially fed with specialised therapeutic feeds called F75 and then later F100 as the child improves. The numbers refer to the number of calories in the feed. The quantity of the feed given is also controlled carefully, starting with a small amount and gradually increasing as the weight of the child improves. Many times several weeks of hospital care is required for these children. These feeds correct the electrolyte imbalances associated with refeeding.</p>
<p>As for dehydration, a dehydrated malnourished child is very difficult to rehydrate. IV rehydration is very risky and can be fatal. It is reserved for cases in shock. What is used is a solution called Resomal (rehydration solution for malnutrition). If the child is not able to take the solution orally, it is given via nasogastric tube.</p></div>		</li>
