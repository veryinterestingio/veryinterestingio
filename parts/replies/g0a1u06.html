			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I’m wrong, but I thought beer gas was used to push beer through long lines in a commercial draught system to avoid over carbonating the beer. Using straight co2 on kegs going through long lines would over carbonate the beer because you need more pressure to push it through the line. Typical serving pressure for beer is 10-12 PSI co2 but that’s not enough pressure to push the beer past a certain length, and if you hold a keg higher than that on co2 it will dissolve and over carbonate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That might be true. But I'm going by what I was told when I started brewing my own beer, and I had the option of getting either straight CO2, or a N2/CO2 mixture. This was using external carbonation. </p>
<p>The same gas was used to both carbonate the beer, but also to serve it.</p></div>		</li>
