Like the many asymptomatic carriers of Covid, they were still infected, but they were better equipped immunologically than those who fell ill. </p>
<p>This could be due to any number of things, like a pre-primed immune system from already having a cold or something. But generally it's always good to take care of yourself and get good nutrition, exercise and especially sleep to keep your immune system functioning at it's highest level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also another factor probably involved, which is the particular MHC alleles a person has received.  Certain ones by sheer luck can make them better able to present specific short peptides from coronaviruses.   So that would be passed on genetically.  Though I guess that falls under &quot;because their immune system handles it well&quot; which you mentioned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also lack a factor the organism requires, in particular viruses often hijack cellular machinery to enter the cell, if you had a variant of this that the virus couldn't use you would be immune.</p></div>		</li>
