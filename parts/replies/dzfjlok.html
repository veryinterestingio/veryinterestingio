The 37m is just a waste of time, they should have had him do some conservation work or some sort of work that requires him to appreciate what his shithead actions took. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point of what?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The state effectively paying itself? Well it's money that it gets to keep instead of paying out.</p>
</li>
<li>The kid not getting his winnings? Well at least he's either out of the debt or at least owes a lot less.</li>
