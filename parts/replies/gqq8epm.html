The added weight, complexity (cost), and as you said friction losses in the transmission just don't make it worth it for consumer cars, generally speaking. Most companies seem to agree that it makes more sense to just put a more powerful and higher voltage motor and battery system in the car and call it a day.</p></div>		</li>
