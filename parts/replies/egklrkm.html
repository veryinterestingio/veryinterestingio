			<div class="markdown"><p>This plus it basically kills off all microorganisms in the soil as well. Trees and other plants absorbing too much salt can also damage them greatly. In forestry class we learned how to identify damages on trees and too much salt leaves a typical picture which almost always appears close to roads.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I donâ€™t think the roots are absorbing much if any of the salt.  The toroidal gates on the cell walls would lock down to prevent further moisture loss from the cotyledon upwards, pretty quickly.  I suppose after the root has desiccated and died, salt can infiltrate the root as it breakdown.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The roots usually get damaged as soon as a certain level of salt is reached and the natural lock down is hindered in its efficiency.  So together with not being able to effectively absorb nutrients and water the plant also is poisoned by salt from within.</p></div>		</li>
