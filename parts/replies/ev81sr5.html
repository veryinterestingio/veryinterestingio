			<div class="markdown"><p>I think they meant arcing in a layman's sense in op's post. The top comment goes through three cases as pressure changes, from an arc discharge (a formal arc) to a glow discharge (not technically an arc) to an example of thermionic emission in a vacuum tube. All of these are what a lay-person would think of as an arc, i.e. electrons crossing a gap</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was referring to the example of electricity travelling through a vacuum in the last paragraph of the above comment. An example was given about electricity traveling through vacuum diodes in older style radios and other electronics, and I suggested that a more commonly familiar example of electrons flowing across a vacuum might be classic televisions, not that CRT style displays involved any sort of arc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would this mean, that to create a space lightning gun, you would need an atom emitter to pre-stream the space ahead, then you can fire the lighting along the path of atoms? Would this be more effective if the atoms were pre-ionised?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a mechanic like that on <em>The Gap</em> series, a space opera. There's a weapon called &quot;matter cannon &quot; that can only be used in the vacuum, it's like a beam of light that accelerates any particle it touches to near-light speed (including virtual particles created within its beam). </p>
<p>If used on atmosphere there are so many targets that the beam dissipates after only penetrating a few metres. But in vacuum you end up with a smaller number of super energetic particles that can , if sustained for long enough, rip a hole in the other ship's hull.</p>
<p>Anyway, one of the plot points is that someone figures out you can use it from space against earthbound buildings by first punching a hole in the atmosphere with a high power laser and then firing the matter cannon down the same channel.
You only get a short blast of course but that's enough to wreck stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well you could just use a very powerful electron gun to shoot high energy electrons at someone, which would be effectively the same as bombarding them with beta radiation.</p></div>		</li>
