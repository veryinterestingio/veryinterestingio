			<div class="markdown"><p>What matters is <em>partial pressure</em> of CO2: the concentration times the overall pressure of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Earth has a 1 bar atmosphere with 0.04% CO2.  Mars has a 0.003 bar atmosphere with almost 100% CO2.  If you do the math, you find that the partial pressure of CO2 on Mars is 7.5 times Earth's.</p>
<p>That, plus the lower temperature, allows CO2 ice to form on Mars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What matters is that the partial pressure is greater than the vapor pressure at the local temperature. And a couple other niche thermodynamic processes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>how did dry ice form on Mars?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The winter poles of Mars are <em>much</em> colder, as low as -140 C (-220 F). That's enough to freeze out even the low partial pressure of CO2 there.</p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Pffxyem.jpg" target="_blank">Phase diagram of Mars</a> (from Longhi, 2006). The surface shows a wide range of temperatures, but around -140 C (133 K) is exactly where CO2 at that partial pressure crosses from gas to solid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it the areas where dry ice forms on mars (very high latitudes) are far colder than at the equator. It seems likely that CO2 (95.9% by volume) held in a \~-100C environment would begin to deposit on the surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's the minimum concentration of co2?  I'm just curious because exhaled breath contains about 5% co2, and I'm curious if I could theoretically exhale dry ice at people.  PCO2 is about 40 mmhg...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a combination of temperature and concentration (partial pressure). A few other commenters below linked to some phase diagrams. Eyeballing things, it would be close at 5%, but as soon as you exhaled it would be mixed with atmosphere and the partial pressure would be too low.  </p>
<p>Also at those temperatures you wouldn't want to have any exposed skin and you would likely have on a special breathing apparatus so you don't destroy your lungs.</p></div>		</li>
