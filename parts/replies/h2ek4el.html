			<div class="markdown"><p>An excellent question, and one that science fiction writers have been attempting to answer for decades.</p>
<p>The scientific answer is we use the &quot;second&quot; as defined by a universal constant. Scientists have come up with one that's complex but boils down to the time it takes for cesium-133 to change it's state 9,192,631,770 times. (A more in depth explanation would take paragraphs and isn't entirely needed for this topic) but that supposes that we can demostrate what cesium is and how we measure it's change. Which supposes a shared method of communication.... The simple answer is, we don't know, and won't until we have to figure it out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is there any reason for this particular number? Is that just the closest approximation in the timekeeping process of a nuclear clock for what we had already defined as &quot;one second&quot; ? So it's arbitrary rather than an actual base unit that would make sense? I guess what I'm asking is: &quot;would it make more sense for us to say that the universal unit of time we should use is <em>the time it takes for cesium-133 to change its state a single time, and hear on earth we use a second, which we define as 9,192,631,770 cesium-133s&quot;</em> ?</p></div>		</li>

<p>On the golden record, we have units dictated by first giving the wavelength of hydrogen, then giving the size of other elements in relation to that, and so on and so forth to give the speed of light, the height of a human, and the size of the record itself.</p>
<p>Stargate played with this idea a bit in one episode, where the 4 ancient races communicated with each other using their understanding of the elements as a universal language.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even on earth, the length of an hour is variable. That is if we count it as 1/24 of a day. A (solar) day in December, is longer than it is in June due to Earths orbit.</p>
<p>There was a period where scientists tried to account for this with how clocks worked, when clocks started getting precise enough, and they just gave up. </p>
<p>We've also had to adjust our calendars several times (such as Julian to Gregorian) because &quot;near enough,&quot; leads to funky things happening with dates that need correcting every now and then.</p>
<p>Basically, the length of an earth day and/or year are approximates at best. They are not good guides for tracking anything (on large scales anyway)</p>
<p>BUT sometimes &quot;Near enough&quot; is good enough anyway. On galactic scales, you could use light as your basic constant and basis for measurements. On a localised scale, the decay of certain elements (such as cesium) works. But who knows really.  </p>
<p>Chances are there is an acceptance that time is relative, and they just reset their clocks/calendars when docking in port like 1800s sailors would have to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not just that different parts of the universe are different ages. It’s also that objects very far from us can’t be meaningfully given an exact age. The idea of simultaneousity only makes sense when two events are close together and moving at the same relative velocity. When you look at a star 1000 light years away, for all intents and purposes, it is 1000 years younger, not accounting for differences in gravity and velocity which could drastically change that 1000 year difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But 1,000 years might as well be a quarter second on a scale of almost 14 billion. Does that mean the universe only appears to have various ages, or it really truly does? Would a hydrogen cloud that somehow didn't get snatched up by a galaxy always be way way older than an old neutron star? Does a black hole stay frozen in time to a third person observer the second it forms? If light travels at the speed of causality and nothing can happen quicker but a black hole is so dense that light created by smashing down atoms can't escape, does that mean a black hole is faster than light and therefore faster than causality? Could a black hole be so dense that time doesn't actually stop but goes backwards? Could there be an infinite loop between black holes eating the universe and spitting out smashed up hydrogen in the Big Bang singularity, simultaneously? </p>
<p>Ugh I don't understand time <em>at all.</em> But I'd like to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We are pretty close to as old as you can get. </p>
<p>Time is slowed by gravity / acceleration (since according to Einstein those are indistinguishable from each other) and traveling at relativistic speeds.</p>
<p>The earth's gravity well is not that deep so our time dilation due to gravity is minute.</p>
<p>If you add up the speed of the earth + the speed of our solar system + the speed of our galaxy all relative to the CMB, we are moving at a decent speed of ~300KM / second but that is still only 0.1% the speed of light in a vacuum, so once again the time dilation is quite small.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm still not happy with this; I spend a good amount of time establishing that there was no preferred frame in physics, and now the CMB has one? I will only accept this begrudgingly.</p></div>		</li>
