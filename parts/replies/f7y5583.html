			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not so much the amplitude, but the sound pressure. Of course, those are relatively the same thing, but I feel like this would be more understandable by explaining it by sound pressure.</p>
<p>Our hearing system works so that our ears react to rapid changes in air pressure, also known as sound frequency. The &quot;vibration&quot; of air vibrates our eardrums, which translates into us hearing things.</p>
<p>The way noise canceling works, is that it creates the same kind of pressure wave, but in 180Â° phase. Think the example in parent comment. You can visualize this by pushing and pulling a door with equal forces. This results in the eardrum not vibrating at all, and nothing being heard.</p>
<p>So no, active noise cancellation doesn't damage our hearing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this mean you are creating a fairly constant pressure on the eardrum, but there's no sound because there's no change in it's position?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are trying to create as little fluctuation in pressure as possible. The ideal case would be perfectly creating opposite amplitudes, resulting in no sound and therefore zero change in pressure.</p></div>		</li>
