			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about the person writing <em>postal regulations</em> and the people that decide which regulations to pursue enforcing. Congress doesn't write the majority of regulations, it is bureaucrats. You'll never know who wrote them, what their influences were, what their reasoning was. They can't be fired by the President or by Congress. You'll never know their name, probably won't even know their job title.</p>
<p>Same with the people deciding enforcement priorities. Think about your city. How much time police spend handing out tickets is something an unelected bureaucrat has decided. When to stop investigating a murder, or deciding to increase patrols in x neighborhood. The police chief likely isn't deciding these things in most large cities. It is bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Or with the postman analogy, the person deciding his route, and whether you get mail at 7 am or 5 pm, that isn't an elected official. The person deciding whether your city should get daily shipments from the nearby hub, or a weekly shipment, that's not an elected official.</p></div>		</li>
