			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen" target="_blank">semen </a>is a liquid, and the sperm swim in it too.  Basically, during sex, semen (the liquid) is placed in the vagina, not &quot;dry&quot; sperm cells.  The wiki article lists what's in semen (besides the sperm cells and the water).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The uterus is NOT filled with liquid. Its walls are “moist”, similar to the inside of your mouth, but it is a hollow cavity. It is definitely not a water tank, if it was, liquid would continuously leak throughout the day as the cervix is not a perfect seal.</p></div>		</li>
