			<div class="markdown"><p>Consider a closed environment with two adults and a growing child:</p>
<p>One adult says &quot;bananas&quot; when they express anger/frustration/surprise. The other adult says &quot;fuck&quot;. Both adults are otherwise similar in their appearance, demeanor, and their treatment of the child.  In other words, the child has no bias between the two adults. The child is not disallowed to say any words, even swear words, and both adults have no visible shame or restraint when saying any words either.</p>
<p>Which word will the child copy? Will the child exclaim &quot;bananas&quot; when they stub their toe against the doorway? Or will the child say &quot;fuck&quot; when they hit their shin on the low table in the living room?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, we know people have intuitions about which sounds go with which sensations, painful experiences being more intuitively associated with something like a hard-<em>k</em> sound than something like a soft-<em>ba</em> sound for example.</p>
<p>So presumably, the child would choose <em>fuck</em> because it feels more intuitively appropriate for pain - or at least for short, sharp pain. It might use <em>bananas</em> for more drawn-out but lower intensity pain.</p></div>		</li>
