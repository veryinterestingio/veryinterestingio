			<div class="markdown"><p>It's only partially correct. The Carbon dioxide part is good, but as for what happens in the actual tap, it's not quite right. When the bottle is tapped, the bottle is sent downwards, but the liquid wants to stay put. When the bottle moves down and the liquid doesn't, a vacuum space forms at the bottom of the bottle. Due to air pressure wanting to close that gap, the liquid is forced from the vacuum toward the bottom of the bottle at high speed... this all happens in a fraction of a second. The liquid is accelerated quickly by this, then stopped again by the bottom of the bottle. The quick and harsh forces on the liquid cause co2 to be released from the turbulence. This is what causes the rush.</p></div>		</li>
