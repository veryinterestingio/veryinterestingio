			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what OP means is what's the difference between a wave coming directly from another bat, and one that bounced/ is a return signal.</p>
<p>If all bats were screaming louder than any bounced sound, the bats would be blind (again!). That seems to be the logic.</p>
<p>Edit: Hey I was just stating my opinion on what OP meant, you don't need to explain anything to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no expertise in this field but I would guess that bats can differentiate between their own voice and those of other bats. And as OC said it’s only effective over a few meters and bats don’t hunt that close together. If they did, they’d probably be crashing into one another.</p>
<p>Also their ears are highly directionally sensitive. They know in which direction they’re “pinging” and from which direction to expect an echo. They aren’t hunting with a soft 3-D focus. That’s the prey model of sensory perception. Bats have directionally attuned senses like all predators.</p>
<p>My high-school advisor was a biology teacher who did his PhD thesis work on owl’s use of hearing to hunt. He literally put corrective goggles on owls to skew their vision off-center, and they relied on their hearing to supersede their vision and course-correct their strikes. Pretty cool stuff.</p>
<p>When you consider OP’s question, you have to understand that a bat’s sense of hearing is akin to a human’s sense of sight in terms of the detail it picks up and its prominence in comparison to the bat’s other far weaker senses. And if an owl can rely on its ears over it’s eyes, which in owls are also highly developed, think of how dominant a bat’s ears are in comparison to their often near-blindness. You wouldn’t question why a human doesn’t crash into other people while walking down a busy sidewalk. He can see them!</p>
<p>Once again, feel free to dismiss everything I’ve said out of hand, as this is all anecdotal and conjectural.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll correct one thing. It's a common misconception that bats are blind or poor sighted. They actually see pretty fine, especially in low light conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact! Bats crash into each other constantly! They are not actually very good at avoiding each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The analogy with human sight is off. Imagine a completely dark room and lots of people with strobe spot lights. There would be interference, they'd end up blinding each other if they were looking in the wrong direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Contrary to popular belief, bats are not blind. They just don't have very good night vision, so they rely on echolocation. Not sure why they are nocturnal</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This plainly isn't how it works. The calls are focused pretty neatly, that pays off for a single bat as well. Also, the processing going on in the brain already needs to account for hugely dynamic signals that only differ in phase slightly. The bat already needs to make out the faint echo under its own calls. It doesn't make a huge difference if other bats are nearby. Also, while in the &quot;final approach&quot;, bats will call softer and quicker, to reduce reaction time and to adapt to the rising signal level.</p>
<p>Think about it like hunting the same insects with a sort of flashlight that you'd flash on and off. While you're not directly approaching an insect, you'd see many insects flashing now and then. You'd focus on one of them, and flash your flashlight quicker and more importantly, in your own rhythm. You'd easily make out the insect you're chasing, even when there's other signals in the background.</p></div>		</li>
