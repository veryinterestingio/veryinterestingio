Telemarketers interrupt by phone and not in-person because isn't not efficient to do so. But if you're known to be wealthy, you probably have people coming up all the time trying to get you to fund their eg. perpetual motion machine development or whatever. And sometimes they might get a little too aggressive, so you need someone who can push back, if needed.</p>
<p>Another way to look at it: a lot of security can be obtained by not having to be somewhere. Eg. If the President wants a Big Mac, either the Secret Service can put together a 60-car motorcade so he can go down and buy one, or they can just send the new guy out to the drive-through. Sure, it might be &quot;demeaning&quot;, but it's actually a lot safer and easier for everybody involved.</p>
<p>In your friend's case, doing the Personal Assistant-type work probably is the same thing. It avoids the harassment which might otherwise need to be &quot;handled&quot; if it was done by them.</p></div>		</li>
