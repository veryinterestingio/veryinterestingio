			<div class="markdown"><p>1st sorry for your loss, and 2nd that one at least makes some sense.  My moms number is now someone else‚Äôs.  Dad cancelled the cell phone when she died and someone else got that number. I pocket dialed it one day and some dude called me back from it and freaked me out too when it happened</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ugh, my caller ID info got cloned by a scammer.  Over the course of about four days we got like 700 calls from little old ladies &quot;returning my call&quot; and dumbasses hurling abuse.  We finally put an explanation in the voicemail message and just shut the phone off for like a week.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They spoof numbers and also can send you a text from a number that isn't theirs. There's a common scam going on in the UK right now. You get a text message supposedly from the Royal Mail that says you missed a delivery and to pay to have it redelivered. It's only a small amount like ¬£1-3, but they are sending it to millions of people.</p>
<p>Edit: another scam here in the UK is one that sees you get a call from your bank telling you there's been some dodgy transactions. They tell you to hang up the phone and call 1471 (number to check what number called you last), then call the number back. It will show that it was the bank, when you call the banks number, the scammer answers it and then he has your complete trust. He tells you he's making a new account for you to put your funds in. The account is the scammers account which is probably setup with fake ID or stolen. </p>
<p>When the scammer tells you to put the phone down and call the bank back, the scammer stays on the phone and doesn't hang up. With a lot of people's phones if the other person doesn't end the call, when you pick up the phone they'll still be on the other end. So when you dial 1471 to check the number, the scammer just plays a voice recording as if it is 1471 service. Then when you call the bank back, he just says hello again.</p></div>		</li>
