<p>Did you drink anything other than water? Milk, OJ etc?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a super unhealthy way to lose weight, and can actually cause death. The poster mentions that he had to go without food due to a surgery they were having. If you plan to lose weight, make sure you do it the right way. I need to drop about 40 pounds personally. The only reason I'm commenting here is because I have personally seen people die from too much weight loss too quickly. I knew someone who lost 100 pounds in just a little over a month by switch to an all protein diet. He weighed 700 pounds and decided to get healthy for his kid, but because he lost the weight so quickly, his kidney, liver, and other organs all shut down and he died. Just be careful, and see a doctor if you plan to start any new diet routine.  </p></div>		</li>
