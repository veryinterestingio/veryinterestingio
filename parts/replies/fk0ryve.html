<p>A VPN is centrelized, so it would be more like a post office. You go there with a letter, leave it there, and the mail carrier takes it to the destination you specified. People see you stop at the post office, and people see the mail carrier deliver a letter to your destination, but it's hard to make the connection, and realize the letter was yours.</p>
<p>Besides, that's only a single use of VPNs that everyone seems to get fixated on, other answers already described what are its other uses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Onion Routing would be a set of taxi-drivers who only get part of the information from the driver taking over and only giving part of the information ot the next driver, so that when you arrive, no one has an idea where you came from. You also get a disguise-layer from each taxi-driver so the next driver can't recognize you when you drive with him again...</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's absolutely not true. It's not just the owners of the &quot;underground train&quot;. If you're taking that train to Walmart, then Walmart sees you exiting that station into their store. So they don't know exactly where you came from, but they <em>know</em> you took the underground train.</p>
<p>So it's not just about what the &quot;owners&quot; record. Any website you interact with will <em>know</em> where your traffic is coming from, and it's pretty obvious if it's coming from a major VPN provider. </p>
<p>That's why services like Netflix or Hulu are able to block the majority of people using VPNs. They just recognize that lots and lots of people are coming from IP addresses that are owned by VPN companies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sure, walmart knows that a certain amount of customers enters their store through the underground-exit. But they have no idea where they are from.
At least if you pay &quot;cash&quot; instead of using an account that identifies you at least.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sure, but you claimed that the ONLY person with info is the ones who run the underground train system. That's just false. Whatever site you talk to, can absolutely identify you're using a VPN.</p></div>		</li>
