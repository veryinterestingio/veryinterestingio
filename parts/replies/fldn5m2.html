			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve wondered for a long time if different ethnicities of people (meaning the tendencies for certain slight differences in human head shape, eye separation distance, eye lids) have a noticeable enough effect on perception, depth of field, etc. or even other traits related to sight. I haven’t been able to locate studies about this before when I’ve searched. Do you happen to know of any tendencies or studies I could read?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not, those differences are too small and inconstant to be studied. What I know for sure is that color can affect how much light enters the eye, blue and greens eyes being more sensitive, and certain populations have epicanthic folds to protect them from cold and overwhelming brightness in the desert or snow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know of any studies, so take my word with a grain of salt. I’m a film student and a recent film teacher I had mentioned something similar to this. He lived in Singapore for about half his life and as a film maker there, they used a 50mm lens. But when he moved to America they used a 30-35mm lens. Now this is important because the difference between a 50 and a 30 is that a 50 is a wider depth of field (aka wider view of the world), and a 30 is closer. This is also not proof of your query, as it could just be a cultural choice over a visual one. The difference is still interesting, given that different schools of thought or different ethnicities have a different take on what they view.</p></div>		</li>
