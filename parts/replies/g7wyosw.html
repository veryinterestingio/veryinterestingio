			<div class="markdown"><p>My father lives on coffee, canned tea and, in the summer, lemonade. He hates plain water and would only drink it if nothing else was available, but might choose to do without and wait half a day or so until something else was available.  So basically, he will go <em>months</em> without an actual cup of pure water. +70 years.</p></div>		</li>
