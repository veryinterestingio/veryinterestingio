			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. First of all, since velocity is relative, so the only relevant thing for the purposes of temperature is the velocities of particles with respect to the frame of the center of mass. Secondly, you need to have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann_distribution" target="_blank">specific shape of the distribution</a> in order for temperature to be meaningfully defined at all. You can only have a temperature if the particles are constantly bouncing into each other, exchanging energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a simple situation in which this happens in practice. When compressed gas is expanded supersonically into vacuum through a nozzle, the atoms or molecules in the resulting stream can have a very nearly identical linear velocity.</p>
<p>The velocity of the stream as a whole can be kilometers per second, while the random movement of the particles with respect to each other can correspond to the temperature of well under one Kelvin.</p>
<p>Of course, to study the gas at this low temperature, one has to observe it in flight -- you cannot bottle it up. (When the stream hits an obstacle, it gets hot again.) Here is a good example of how this technique is used for <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1686859" target="_blank">spectroscopy of very cold gases.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. For an example that is easy to visualize, think of a snowball. All the water molecules are moving slowly with respect to each other, so the ball is cold. If you throw the ball very hard, the molecules may get a high velocity all in the same direction, but that doesn't mean the ball is hot while in flight.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's only true for idealized black-body radiation. For real-world objects it depends also on things like color and chemical composition (hence eg. spectral lines)</p></div>		</li>

<p>True, but so long as it's optically thick (Ï„ &gt;&gt; 1), real-world objects generally don't emit that much differently than idealized black-bodies. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissivity#Emissivities_of_common_surfaces" target="_blank">This list of real-world emissivities</a> all show values close to 1 (where 1 = a perfect black-body).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What exactly makes the absorption of photons by electrons lead to more movement? I know it's more &quot;potential energy,&quot; but what exactly is it that causes the electrons to move more and do stuff like make quantum leaps? Additionally, when they DO make quantum leaps, does this change the shape of the atom? In not quite sure how isomers are possible, but my guess would be the changed shape due to quantum leaps leads to different geometric orientations. Any truth to this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once you start thinking about the quantum picture of what is going on, it's better to switch from thinking about particle velocities to just energy. If you have a black box with some material in it, an electron might absorb a photon to reach a higher energy level. The electron might go back down to the same level as before and emit a photon of the same wavelength as it absorbed, but it may also go to a lower level (not necessarily the same as before) and exchange some energy with surrounding particles, through collisions, lattice vibrations, etc. Over time, you will get an equilibrium where the particles absorb just as much photons as they emit, the distribution of energy levels in the system then determines the temperature. Geometry doesn't play an explicit role here.</p></div>		</li>
