			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who moves around whilst asleep and knock my pillows off my bed quite often- does this mean I’m less likely to experience sleep paralysis, as I’m experiencing the opposite of it? Sleeping and unconscious but moving around vs Conscious but unmoving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This explanation doesn't male a lot of sense when you think about the other cranial nerves. </p>
<p>Let's take cranial nerve 12 for example (hypoglossal nerve, controls tongue movement).  </p>
<p>If your explanation for eye movement during REM sleep was true then we'd be wagging our tongues around like hungry dogs when we dream. </p>
<p>Or take the accessory nerve which innervates the trapezius muscle. We'd be shrugging our shoulders during our dreams.</p></div>		</li>
