			<div class="markdown"><p>Excedrine also contains caffeine. In my experience headaches can be remedied (other than migraines) by one of three things - hydrating, taking caffeine, or taking an allergy/nasal decongestant. Headaches from caffeine withdrawal are no joke. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wound up in the hospital for a bit after surgery for a few days fuck knows how long ago. I’d asked for some sort of soda or something just out of craving but was told no. The resulting caffeine headache actually wound up convincing the doc to allow me a soda.</p>
<p>Why they couldn’t just IV me something for it I dunno, but I learned you really don’t fuck with caffeine headaches.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a common prescription med for headaches called Fioricet. Combination of butalbital, Tylenol, and caffeine that works amazingly for headaches / migraines. Butalbital is a short acting barbiturate, Tylenol is an antipyretic, and caffeine is a CNS stimulant. Technically, how each contributes to headache relief is not fully understood but it works regardless.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excredrin also contains caffeine - so if you are a coffee or soda drinker and get a headache from withdrawal that might be why it seems more effective for some. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently had a headache that felt like a giant was pelvic thrusting his wasteline into the back of my skull then tied my skull to the back of his truck and dragged it down the road for 10 miles. Was this a simple &quot;something changed&quot; headache?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds like a tension headache. Feels like something is pulling your head back or a band around the sides? For me that usually comes from poor posture/carrying my stress in my shoulders. Or because i slept on the wrong part of my bed, because it's not level anymore since the memory foam is too good at remembering my body shape.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>My migraines are basically on the skull right where my eye lid meets it, and everyone I've ever talked to that also has them get them there as well, or somewhere on the front half of the head, so I don't think it's a migraine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the same sort of terrible terrible headaches that lasted for a week. I went and got a chair massage and pointed at the base of my skull. The guy spent 15 minutes pushing on the base of my skull and side of my neck, and my headaches went away. I was so thankful I sent him a thank you note. There are a ton of trigger points on the base of the skull - try a chair massage if you can!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just did a quick search on giant pelvic thrusting waistline and getting dragged down the road for 10 miles by the back of your skull and for some reason they didn’t come as diagnostic criteria - this must be a new disease entity </p></div>		</li>
