			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. I'd like to add a couple of details though. The electric field caused by the high voltage tears the negatively charged paricles (elecrons) in the opposite direction as the positive ones (nuclei). At the same time the particles are flying around in a random manner. So wherever the &quot;flying around&quot; happens to benefit the seperation, that's where the current will flow.</p>
<p>You might also notice that the arc always goes up as it's discharging. This is because the conducting (ionized) air becomes hot, and hot air rises. So the conducting part rises with the heat until that path becomes to long and a new line has to be ionized again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do they control the charges in the interior space of reactors where collisions occur? Like, helping to make the conditions of the interior space in the reactor mirror the conditions of the space in nature that is primed with charge and then lightening strikes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not exactly sure what you are talking about. But reactors that produce electricity like nuclear reactors do so by heating up water and running the resulting steam through a generator. So no, completely different process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It it absolutely truly random, like the radioactive decay of a particle? Or is it just pseudo-random as in there are too many variables for us to calculate with any accuracy?</p></div>		</li>
