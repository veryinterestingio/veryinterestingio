<p>Beyond just dying of normal animal things, they're also adapted to an aquatic environment. Even if you had an air supply, your body would definitely react poorly to being submerged in water. It simply isn't adapted to an environment where it has to be constantly subjected to being wet, same as how whales are not used to not being surrounded by water. Their cells don't form the same protective, insulating layer of oils that we do that prevents us from dehydrating.</p></div>		</li>

They cuffed him but they had to put special gloves on him to protect his wrists because they were worried after so much time submerged his skin would basically rip off at the slightest abrasion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whales also are conscious breathers, they have to remember to breath, whereas we don’t. The more tired and stressed from above mentioned things like weight, heat exhaustion, sunburn and dehydration takes away their energy to remember to even breathe</p>
<p>edit. “To avoid drowning during sleep, it is crucial that marine mammals retain control of their blowhole. The blowhole is a flap of skin that is thought to open and close under the voluntary control of the animal. Although still a matter of discussion, most researchers feel that in order to breathe, a dolphin or whale must be conscious and alert to recognize that its blowhole is at the surface.</p>
<p>Humans, of course, can breathe while the conscious mind is asleep; our subconscious mechanisms have control of this involuntary system. But equipped with a voluntary respiratory system, whales and dolphins must keep part of the brain alert to trigger each breath.”</p>

<p>Edit: I get it guys, the info is out there, my question is why can't it be some sensory feedback that triggers the breathing when out of water? Human Babies also don't breathe underwater, are they consciously making that decision?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s just a typical Seinfeld episode involving George pulling a golf ball out of a whales blowhole.</p>
<p>It gets consistently referenced as like one of the best written tv comedy bits. Like, I’ve seen it referenced so much as one of the best Seinfeld moments that I had to go watch the episode, and I honestly don’t see what the fuss is about. </p>
<p>It’s just an episode of Seinfeld, but like I said, people hype it <em>so much</em> like there is literally a guy in this comment chain who said he “envies that you get to see it with fresh eyes” lol, it’s not really something that belongs in a museum. You won’t be telling your kids where you were when you first saw it.</p>
<p>It baffles me honestly, but Seinfeld just has that cultural adhesive, it’s got a lot of quotables.</p></div>		</li>
