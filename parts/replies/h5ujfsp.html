			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely the correct answer. The main reason being that airline crew need to have clear visibility outside in case of an incident occurring so they can advise the pilot and ground staff of the state of the wings etc, and where any fires appear to be.  This crucial process in an emergency would be impossible if you’ve shut your window blind. In an emergency with people freaking out having to ask you to open it both costs time and might be difficult if there is a lot of noise. Hence at least in Europe it’s the law that they must be open on takeoff and landing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The incident I was thinking of was one where mechanics the night before had changed the engine and installed it improperly with a forklift holding the engine pressing into the mounting point such that it cracked the metal flange the engine attaches to.</p>
<p>The engine didn't so much &quot;fall off&quot; as &quot;tear off&quot; because its own thrust broke the weakened mount and the engine pivoted on the remaining mounting point, making it pivot around, up and over the wing until it tore free.  Not only did it come off, but the ripping motion also really degraded that wing's lift.  Up in the cockpit the only information they have is that the engine isn't running, and there was zero fuel pressure and oil pressure for the engine.  In that scenario it's kind of important to know that there's just no point wasting time on the restart procedure for an engine that isn't even there, and that requires that visual check to realize the reason all the engine's status readings are flatlining is because it's not even there.</p></div>		</li>
