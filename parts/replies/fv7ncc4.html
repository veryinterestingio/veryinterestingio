			<div class="markdown"><p>Please use water. Every time. There’s a very real possibility that a pill gets trapped where you can’t feel it. As it dissolves it can eat away at your throat. When I worked in pharmacy, it happened to a regular patient. He came in one day barely able to speak. His voice went from normal to 90 year old chain-smoker— and that was after 1-2 weeks of recovery. I don’t recall whether his voice fully returned to normal. </p>
<p>I think the risk gets higher with age. Throat muscles get weaker and saliva production goes down. So it may work at 15, 30, 45... I just wouldn’t recommend developing this habit. </p>
<p>We chew our food to incorporate saliva throughout it so that it easily goes down our throats. With pills you want an excess of water to ensure it is flushed down. Unless you’re regularly drowning in your own saliva when you lay down... </p>
<p>It’s just a stupidly easy thing to prevent by taking a few sips of water, even if it’s somewhat low risk.</p>
<p>Edit: I saw a friend take a pill without water and I had to tell him about this story. He was really glad I did, seems like most people are happy to read this as well. Please spread the word.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the notice. I can swallow pills without water easily, I only use water when the medication tastes disgusting or when I feel it stuck. Will always use water in the future.</p></div>		</li>
