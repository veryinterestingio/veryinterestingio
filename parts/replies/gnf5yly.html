			<div class="markdown"><p>Best answer so far! So then I guess the mutations that the body can’t effectively fight off become the “infamous” strains that spread to others. But if the host quarantines really well and never spreads this mutation, it will “stop” at the host? Or are some mutations so common that a ton of people get it and then that creates the other strains?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well, yes and no.  The bodies of the people who first developed some of the nasty strains still probably faught them off...  They just spread the mutated virus before fighting it off.  That's part of the insideousness of viral infection - in many cases you can pass it on before you have symptoms.  Indeed, some people never get symptoms but are still infectious.</p>
<p>So, yes, if you have symptoms or have reason to believe you may have been infected, and you go into isolation, then any new mutations that take place within you will stay contained.</p>
<p>It does happen that the same mutation occur in multiple places and are not related.  We can test this on the basis of other mutations and generate a lineage of viruses.  Neat stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well said! This answer is the most correctly detailed explanation I've read on this post so far. </p>
<p>The key is the polymerase!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are viral polymerases known to have other impacts beyond the propagation of a virus? It sounds like it would leave an infected cell more mutation-prone going forward? Or are polymerases very specific in their function such that it would be extremely unlikely for a viral polymerase to replace a native one in anything?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In most cases the host cell dies after viral infection, either explosively as the viruses bud through the cell membranes taking more and more until there's not enough, immune cells trigger cell death as a way to control the infection, or the cell itself triggers its own cell death through internal antiviral sensors. So the viral polymerase wouldn't be able to stick around to cause mutations in host genes.</p>
<p>There are a few notable exceptions though slightly different mechanistically with oncogenic DNA viruses like HPV. These viruses need to activate host DNA replication machinery to be able to replicate themselves as they do not carry their own. Eukaryotic cells have tightly regulated DNA replication so as to prevent rampant cell division and cancer. So these viruses will inhibit a few key regulators of replication and enable DNA replication to go forward. Which generally wouldn't be a problem as the cell would die after infection. But if the rest of the virus is not able to package new progeny virus appropriately or has some issue downstream preventing viral escape then there is some problems as now the cell is being forced into cell division and thus forming tumors, like cervical cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the polymerases hang out in the cell, and during a viral infection keep getting produced and increase in number.  But often the cells that are infected get so messed up, and so stuffed full of viruses that they pop and die.  The contents of that cell then get spilled out and the viruses infect other cells (depending on the virus type - CoV2 has a membrane, so it needs to get budded off from the cell membrane).  The polymerases then get degraded and disappear.  They aren't integrated into the person's DNA or anything, so that's not really an issue.  Infected cells get screwed up in a bunch of different ways (membranes go all wonky, regulation pathways are hijacked - so that everything gets focused on producing tonnes of virus and nothing else).</p></div>		</li>
