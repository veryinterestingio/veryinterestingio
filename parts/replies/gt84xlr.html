			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the things that I learned in rehab was that alcohol is a poison that affects your entire body while other drugs just affect certain parts of your body.  Alcohol gets in your blood and your blood reaches everywhere in your body, so everything gets compromised.  </p>
<p>Nuts to think I was doing that to myself for years.  Now it's embarrassing to think back on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, alcohol is literally a poison for other reasons, however pretty much any drug will get into the bloodstream. It has to get in the blood somehow in order to get to the brain and affect it, since we don't apply it directly to the brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is poison for sure. To think 100% alcohol is literally ethanol blows my mind sometimes and people drink it like it's nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not op. But recently sober (7-months) after heavy drinking for 12 years.</p>
<p>-Dealing with everyday social interactions have become a lot easier.  Helps building and maintaining relationships with friends, family and loved ones..</p>
<p>-Thinking rationally and logically has become easier. This helped a lot when running a pop-up and starting my own company.</p>
<p>-Brain is less of a cluster. It's easier completing a thought, while at the same time its easier to let go of an obsessive one. Helps being alone with myself.</p>
<p>-Reading has become easier. Its nice to read.</p>
<p>OP's &quot;the increased productivity&quot;. It's just the brain, finally starts to functions normally, as opposed to being less productive because of alcohol. That's why the things I have mentioned, might sound normal for most. Though my experiences, are not quite dramatic, since I was fortunate enough to cut down on drinking in a span of a few months, opposed to having to go form day-drinking to full stop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After being addicted to alcohol for about a decade, it took 2 years of withdrawals and relapses to quit. Now, my wife and I are nearing 3 years sober and I swear, my brain function is still improving. It wasn't until almost 2 years sober that I felt myself get back to thinking and reading and questioning the way I used to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well for obvious reasons your fine motor skills return and your body starts to process things at a normal speed. So my reaction times were quicker, I felt safe driving, my thoughts were more creative and in depth, my memory improved, someone previously posted getting to read again which is true, my new intake of water helped repair my hair and skin which boosted my confidence. I slowly started to have more energy and my body looked less like it was dying lol I actually developed high functioning anxiety that I seek treatment for but it’s unclear if it’s related to or causes by the drinking. I can’t remember if I felt this way before being an alcoholic so it’s hard to tell. Essentially now that I can have full length thoughts again my brain literally doesn’t stop talking and I’ve developed numerous anxious behaviors that my drunk brain just couldn’t handle before. I had quit cigarette smoking a few weeks before and that combination just made me feel better overall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol withdrawal can cause hallucinations and a potentially deadly condition called delerium tremens. </p>
<p>Symptoms of delerium tremens include, sweating, shaking, shivering, heart issues and vivid and frightening visual and auditory hallucinations. Often, people suffering from DT report seeing snakes or being covered in insects. They become so confused and scared that they are unable to speak. </p>
<p>The disruption in GABA causes potentially deadly increases in blood pressure, heart rate and temperature, causing seizures and death. </p>
<p>All together, this makes alcohol withdrawal one of the worst ways to die. You have horrifying hallucinations about being covered in snakes or spiders and then die of a seizure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the response but I knew that, as a theoretical explanation but I never heard exactly from someone who saw them after withdrawal  (and somehow everyone talks about snakes or insects but it can't be just that, isn't it?)</p>
<p>My question was rather personal, meaning what were her/his illusions. Sorry for not being more specific.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was an alcoholic from about 19-26years old. I drank myself drunk every night while still managing to hold down a job. I stopped drinking after one day I finally looked at myself in the mirror and saw past all the excuses I’d made for myself as to you I was the way I was and who I saw was so disappointing. I had so many dreams that I gave up for alcohol. As for the hallucinations the first day of sobriety I saw things move that shouldn’t have, my world was in motion but I wasn’t. I later learned that people with sever alcoholism should seek medical advice when attempting to sober up lol</p></div>		</li>
