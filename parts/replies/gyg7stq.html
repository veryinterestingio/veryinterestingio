			<div class="markdown"><p>As the water boils, it doesn't simply disappear obviously... It turns into vapor. Could the increasing vapor pressure reach a point at which, despite the vacuum and lowered pressure driving the phase change towards the gaseous state, it will still reach a point in which it is in a new equilibrium that makes it so the proportion of water in the gas state compared to the liquid state no longer increases? Just a thought... It's been a while since my college chemistry and physics courses.</p></div>		</li>
