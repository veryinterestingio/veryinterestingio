<p>Interestingly, GaN has some very good properties otherwise and is currently being researched as a replacement for silicon in our computer chips, which will hopefully make them more power efficient and faster.</p>

<p>Is this gonna be the next big thing in computing? Is the average end user going to see big jumps in computer power?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Be interesting to try some silicon milk.  I've sampled oat, almond and soy milk and find them equally disgusting...</p></div>		</li>

<p>The average user uses a minuscule percentage of their computer's power already.  So, no, they won't notice.</p>
<p>What the average user needs is more internet bandwidth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who works with a major ISP who offers both FTTH and Gigabit of Coax broadband service, no we don’t. I can see actual data transmission rates and see how much bandwidth most customers use. The average consumer doesn’t exceed 250mbps. Heavier users don’t exceed 700mbps. I have never seen anyone over utilize a gigabit service. Actually, outside of speed tests, I’ve never seen anyone touch 800mbps in usage. </p>
<p>Expanding broadband services to rural area is definitely necessary, but our broadband capabilities already outpace our download usage. The only area we need to work towards is increased upload capacity, which will be possible when Docsis 4.0 starts to come to market around 2022. That combined with extended spectrum Docsis that is currently being worked on, we won’t have to worry about bandwidth caps for decades. And reaching out to new areas and rural customers will happen over time. It’s happening as we speak. It just takes more time because of how costly it is and you don’t hear about it because it doesn’t impact many people when it does happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, bandwidth is totally fine. Most places have access to gigabit or much higher these days.</p>
<p>What the average user needs is less heat, aka more efficient everything. No one likes holding a phone that's getting hot while playing a game or watching videos, no one likes a hot laptop on their lap, or a gaming desktop that increases the room's temperature by 10-20F. If we can make more efficient processors and GPUs you'll see even thinner devices due to smaller coolers, smaller fans, plus you'll get the benefit of batteries lasting much longer which could allow manufacturers to reduce battery size which will also make your device easier to make into whatever form factor they want, while making it lighter. Many benefits for the average user by increasing efficiency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main point is that GaN electronics can switch at much higher frequencies, which reduces switching losses and allows for smaller passive components (inductors and capacitors). Altogether, you have more compact and efficient PSUs witch GaN components. We should also give silicon carbide (SiC) an honorable mention as it performs similarly well as GaN or maybe even better for very high voltages. That’s why SiC components are found in many electric cars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TIL! I had just assumed all LEDs were white and then they just put colour plastic casing around them if they wanted to change their colour. Actually why didn't they do it that way, surely it would have been easier?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>White LEDs are just red, blue, and green LEDs all put in the same package. To create a white LED one must first invent all of these, there is no way to make a white LED directly. </p>
<p>The effect the LED is based off, electroluminesence, is a quantum physics effect that emits light mostly in a single frequency (color), which depends on the properties of the semiconductor it uses. There is no “white light” frequency, white to us humans consists of a combination of various light frequencies which at its most simplest can be red, blue, and green. </p>
<p>There is of course a bit of filtering often done by the LED plastic cap since it’s not exactly one frequency, there is a bit of error and a plastic color filter cap can help alleviate this if needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some LEDs do use R G and B LEDs to create white, but most use a higher frequency light like blue or UV and turn it into white light using a phosphor layer (similar to how fluorescent lights work).</p>
<p>RGB LEDs make colors look bad due to the large gaps in the spectrum of light emitted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really, no.</p>
<p>The LEDs in your lightbulbs are just blue LEDs with a phosphor coating to convert the pure blue light into a combination of other colors in order to create &quot;white&quot; light. They're not RGB LEDs, though they do certainly exist.</p></div>		</li>
