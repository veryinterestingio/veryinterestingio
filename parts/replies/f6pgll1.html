Even after the child learns the facts of life, there understanding is largely clinical and theoretical, being exposed to the reality of it as they become sexually mature is part of the conflict.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I gotta admit, I'm pretty much in Freud's camp on this one. </p>
<p>99% of ever decision I ever made before I got married (at 40) was &quot;Will this improve or hinder my chances of getting laid?&quot;</p>
<p>Maybe I was right or maybe I was wrong, but it was always a consideration and justification of action--Which clothes to wear, whether or not to exercise, study, work another hour, etc.</p></div>		</li>
