			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Basically, the body releases stress hormones caused by emotional trauma, which in turn does a number of things to the body. </p>
<p>Your heart has to work harder as blood vessels contract, some of your bodies functions (like your digestive system to mention one) gets it energy severly reduced because the body thinks this is an emergency situation and diverts energy to systems you need for imidiate survival. These thing leads to physical symptoms.</p>
<p>Sever emotional trauma also puts the body in fight or flight mode. Which is great if you need to survive a bear chasing you, or defendig yourself in a fight, not so much if its not an emergency. Fight or flight takes a big toll on the body, espescially the heart.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Other systems like immune, digestive and if shit is really hitting the fan, brain will even filter our colors, so you see in grayscale to be able to have more energy for other things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly I think the fact that feelings of grief and depression are actually super wrapped up with chemicals in the body should be enough proof that things aren't so simple to &quot;just get over&quot;. Dealing with a loss is hard enough and then your body goes into overdrive so that you feel like crap physically too. This is why self care is so important. Sleep. Stay warm. Eat things that are good for you. Give yourself gentle exercise. As your body stops slamming on the panic button and unwinds, everything starts feeling easier to deal with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am guessing alcohol is probably not a good idea but boy does a person turn to it in time of grief. Mainly to dull the thinking process I guess. Being around with people who love you could bring one out of it.
