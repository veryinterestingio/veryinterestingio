			<div class="markdown"><p>If a clone has offspring and the 'original' sheep had offspring, are the offspring considered &quot;clones&quot; too?    </p>
<p>Like I know they aren't identical clones in that sense, but putting a human spin on it: theres two kids(pardon the pun) who have Dolly as a mother but in this case Dolly is two separate people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I’ve read it has to do with the immune systems ability to recognize the cancerous cells. Cancers are caused by mutations in cells that make them duplicate indefinitely, this is usually picked up by the body quickly and eliminated before it can get to a point where it’s even noticeable, however the body’s ability to recognize this change can be hurt by retroviruses. Cancer happening on its own is actually hella rare, as far as the chance that during an individual cells duplication it will accrue all of the mutations required for it to spread and not be noticed by the animals immune system. The only reason cancer is pretty prevalent is because being made of MANY cells this duplication happens very often. Increasing the overall chance one of those cells will happen to have all of the mutations to make it unrecognized by the body as a threat.</p></div>		</li>
