			<div class="markdown"><p>I know someone IRL who lost his emotions earlier this year. It wasn't through loss so much as multiple life events in his past that I think caught up to him (kidney cancer at 2 years old, followed by heart surgery, his parents not accepting his homosexuality, alcoholism). I'm not sure if he has recovered any of them back because I accidently completely socially distanced myself even at a conversational level this year, but I tried helping him and found it is a condition.</p>

<p>It has a more scientific name, but here are causes that includes emotional pain. Loss is definitely emotional pain [](<a href="https://i.imgur.com/ucS3vdo.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/ucS3vdo.png</a> </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I’m a nurse and I have a lot of experience in trauma and ICU. I was also a combat medic in the Army. I’m not going to say I lose all emotion but I will say that I’m very numb to it. I’ve lost family, friends, and a LOT of patients I’ve cared for. It effected me a lot in the beginning. Now it’s very close to not caring at all. I see death as more of a part of life than some kind of loss. It’s a journey all of us take. Some people have reached that point before me. I’ll be there at some point. Some people get there before they should. Some people get there after they should (family prolonging life when death is inevitable). I know I sound cold and distant. I’m sorry for that but if you see enough of it, it stops effecting you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if enough loss can lead to you not feeling close to people, but it is possible to become numb to the feeling of loss if it happens to you constantly. People in war and in the hood commonly have this happen to them.</p></div>		</li>
