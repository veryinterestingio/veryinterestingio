			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting video. Though it got me to think, what happens when the the electrons on the same energy level collide with each other? Why don't they cancel their momentum and start to form disc? Or do they &quot;collide&quot; at all?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electrons aren't balls that whiz around like the typical diagram shows. I'm not sure I'll be great at explaining, but his is why the video mocks that model.</p>
<p>First of all they're not really orbiting the core of the atom in the same way as planets orbit stars. It's not gravity that keeps them away from the centre, it's their opposite charge to the positive core.</p>
<p>Second, they're not really in one specific location. They're more nebulous than that. They're more of a wave function of different energy levels. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital" target="_blank">The wiki entry</a> can probably explain it better than me though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very [very] good question.  </p>
<p>The commonly used image of an atom is very wrong. Electrons don't orbit a nucleus in the same was as planets orbit a star. Electrons are best thought of as excitation of an omnipresent &quot;electron field&quot; [not to be confused with an electric field]. This electron field has a base value everywhere. And wherever the field has an excess value over that base you get an electron (voila!).   </p>
<p>So now you have a field interacting with another field [specifically, an electron field interacting with an electromagnetic field]. And that influences where excitations happen, what momenta they carry, and what angular momenta they carry etc. Elementary quantum mechanics simplifies this picture by instead talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital#/media/File:Hydrogen_Density_Plots.png" target="_blank">probabilities of finding such excitations in a given region of spacetime</a> --that's the &quot;wave&quot; nature of the particle in loose-speak. If it helps, look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital#Qualitative_understanding_of_shapes" target="_blank">these pictures</a> instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for answering. You got me thinking again: I know there is EM field (made of photons?), Higgs field (Higgs bosons?), and now &quot;electron field&quot;. Can hardons form their field (like a &quot;proton field&quot;)? If not, what makes bosons and leptons special to have field?</p>
<p>Also, if electron is &quot;excitement&quot; of the electron field, can two excitements happen at the same time at exact location?</p>
<p>EDIT: did some research. Looks like electrons (fermions) can't be the same location at same time due to Pauli exclusion principle. Quantum physics is so interesting.</p></div>		</li>
