<p>Gravitons</p>

<p>Hm....why not gravitons?   Don't they travel at the same speed as light?  Or is the jury still out on whether they actually exist at all  (but that if they did exist, they would travel at c)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravitons, if they exist, are thought to be chargeless, massless bosons with a spin of 2. Any such boson would be indistinguishable from gravity.</p>
<p>We basically know that they are massless, since General Relativity has gravity propagate at the speed of light. Before GR it was thought to be much faster, or instantaneous. That’s because the attraction resulting is towards the point where the mass will be, not where it was (if it’s not accelerating, acceleration leads to gravitational waves). So the Earth isn’t attracted to where the sun was 8 minutes ago, it’s attracted to where the sun will be now provided that it keeps moving at the same velocity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The question said &quot;If <em>something</em>...&quot;, so that sounds like we could be talking about a lot of different things.  We're really only talking about 2 things.  I was clarifying and adding extra info, as Robus also did below me.</p></div>		</li>
