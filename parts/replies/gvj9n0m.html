			<div class="markdown"><p>I've also noticed - and my university English lecturer affirmed - that singing in foreign language helps in learning the correct pronunciation. I'm not a native English speaker, but I dabble in singing and my English pronunciation has gotten better and better by singing in English.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It vanishes when doing any type of vocal activity that is not the basic speech for a person: i.e. accents, not just singing. If you know someone for a long time that stutters often, pay attention to how they speak. You will notice that, over time, they will subconsciously change their &quot;normal&quot; speech patterns as they learn what words they are having difficulty with and either start using alternate words or pronouncing them differently. The stutter will reduce for a time, possibly disappear entirely, until whatever causes it takes hold of the new vocabulary, and the process starts again.</p></div>		</li>
