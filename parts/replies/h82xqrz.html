			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also myostatin,we have more of that (having more of it makes it harder to grow muscles) but this gives us finer motor control.</p>
<p>Our bodies are also lazy,so we will only grow muscle mass when necessary (this is why you lose muscle mass two or three weeks after you've stopped working out)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I always heard separated us.  Our fine motor control ability allowed for the precise use of creating tools and using them to their maximum potential.  A gorilla may be super strong, but could it ever hammer a nail into place? Not likely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only growing when needed also saved us a lot of energy/food and allowed us to survive much longer with minimal food, as well as spending less time eating and doing academic/inventing things instead</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A pretty standard rule to remember with evolution is traits cost energy.  We are constantly in a state of needing more energy or we'll  eventually die, so if a trait doesn't help, but costs energy, then it's a negative, not a positive.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While you have your basic answer that hominids evolved for upright walking/running (and cooling using sweat) for endurance, the exact details are up for debate.</p>
<p>While upright endurance running and grasslands are often stated together it turns out upright hominids evolved in savanna-woodlands which means areas with a lot of trees and bushes not flat grassland (where hominids migrated to later.)</p>
<p>This makes endurance hunting questionable as such an environment requires good tracking skills to hunt prey through the bush for long periods where endurance would be useful (unlike grasslands where it is easier.) It is believed these early hominids lacked the intelligence to track in heavy bush or trees.</p>
<p>So humans evolved to have more endurance and less raw strength in order to have endurance to do... Something. Might be hunting, might be scavenging, might be gathering from plants. It's not 100% clear what the original evolutionary advantage was.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't know if I have seen &quot;proof&quot; either but we do have a list of unique features that other primates don't have, that are explained by evolution to run a LOT:</p>
<ol>
<li>Body covered in sweat glands</li>
<li>Body not covered in fur (both to shed heat)</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess the persistence hunting piece?</p>
<p>Not exactly skeptical, sounds logical but keen to read more.</p>
<p>In born to Run the author argues that we just basically just ran down prey by tiering them out which sounded like an overly simple explanation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth mentioning that we also did not need to rely on muscles exclusively to survive. Even a less than fit ancestor could still have a better chance at surviving if they were of big intelligence.</p></div>		</li>
