Much like people's nutrition wasn't as good <em>on average</em> but there were still people who ate well. And those people would seem very tall back then compared to today's tall people who are just above average.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. And it certainly added to the common idea of the ruling class as &quot;gods favored&quot;. Imagine being a 30 year old 155cm tall 50kg farmer with a hunched back, rotten teeth and a boil in the ass you can't get rid off, seing a 185cm tall prince, athletic, well fed and in good health. Hard to believe you are born equal from that perspective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a tour of Mayan Ruins in Honduras, we were told that the nobles and the King were significantly taller than the regular population. The peasants didn't have a lot of access to meat, and what they did get they were supposed to bring as sacrifices to the gods at specific ceremonies. When they left, the nobles cached all the meat in secret underground stores, and ate it later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Add to all this that geography, topography, and climate impact this as well. People whose ancestors settled in tundra or mountainous or alpine regions e.g. Chile, tend to be shorter as this allows you to conserve more body heat in colder environments. Although I’m guessing this will and already has started to change post-industrial revolution?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Didn’t the Romans talk about how the Celts were all freakishly taller than them though? The Celts were further north compared to them (and closer to the Alps in some cases) so I’m wondering how that happened, consider  how much sense your post makes lol</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's the opposite in fact. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergmann%27s_rule" target="_blank">Bergmann's rule</a> states that body mass goes up in relation to colder climates, not down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly this is why Napoleon had the piss taken out of his height.  He was slightly above average for the time but well below average for the ruling classes.</p>
<p>In Mesopotamia, where farming was first taken up, the very early farmers were shorter, malnourished, disease ridden, and died young compared to neighbouring hunter gatherers.  The rich have generally managed to maintain a healthy diet while the poor had to survive on what they could get.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IANAHistorian,</p>
<p>I have also read that Napoleon was slightly higher average height but his Imperial Guard were all cavalryman so they were already tall, then you're picking the biggest, strongest, of the cavalry to be the Imperial Guard. And the Imperial Guard wore big tall hats and Napoleon's hat wasn't' quite so tall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. Since before the Neolithic era (agriculture essentially.. aka better nutrition) early Europeans prior to 16,000 BC were \~6'0&quot; on average.</p>
<p>But after the Neolithic era started, humans became shorter (down to 5'5&quot;)</p>
<p>We just recently started to get taller again. Also, not EVERYONE was taller/shorter etc. Obviously you had people who were taller and shorter than average, but the average shifted.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So I wonder if it is due to nutrition/health care, or if it's something else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Contrary to popular belief, agriculture was actually one of the most harmful things to individual people's health at the time of its conception. For thousands of years, humans had evolved to be hunter-gatherers, and the shift to agriculture was a great shock to the human body.</p>
<p>Agriculture greatly restricted the variety of nutrients available to people at the time, and it wasn't until widespread trading that the diversity of nutrients available to agricultural societies matched that of hunter-gatherers. This is why things like the Silk Road were such a big deal, although by that time, our lifestyles became more sedentary than our hunter-gatherer counterparts. The agricultural revolution could be seen as a huge step back for people in terms of life expectancy and individual health. For the population as a whole, larger (but less diverse) food supplies that were more consistent allowed people to have more babies. That was the biggest advantage of the agricultural system. Hunter-gatherers were still much much healthier.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sure, if you discount the fact that modern medicine needs agriculture to exist. We can't all hunt and gather, you know...</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At one point in our history there were to factions of humans, sapiens and neanderthals. The neanderthals were much bigger and stronger but they lost because the sapiens developed better tools and thus humans became sapiens rather than neanderthals. I dont know if this is that same time period.</p></div>		</li>
