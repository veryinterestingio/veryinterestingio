			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it would be better to say that the productivity gains have largely accrued to the wealthy. Jeff Bezos didn’t “grab” anything from workers, nor did Warren Buffett. </p>
<p>They both have seen generational wealth because our economic policies favor returns to capital over labor.  If you look at marginal tax rates, it used to be a lot harder to get that rich and stay that rich. </p>
<p>Furthermore software has enabled those whose businesses benefit from automation to see massive returns on equity relative to what was possible 30-40 years ago. When you own a business where there is almost zero marginal cost to deliver to the next customer (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix) you are going to do exponentially better than someone who has to work another hour for another hour of real wages (which, as said elsewhere, have stagnated).</p></div>		</li>
