			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't detect the missile itself with the RWR, but IR missiles are often launched with a radar lock to prevent friendly fire, which would be picked up on the RWR. You couldn't tell the difference between a lock and a launch though (although the loss of a lock in the kinds of ranges IR missiles are used might be a good context clue). There are also systems on more modern aircraft that can detect the missile's own IR signature.</p></div>		</li>
