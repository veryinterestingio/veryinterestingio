			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw that episode! It gets even scarier once you start researching even deeper into it. Most medical things are based off the male body, like for example heart attack symptoms are different for men than women, but you only ever hear about the mens'. I think I remember seeing an article once about a study on a treatment for ovarian cancer, in which all the test subjects were male. I'll see if I can find a link to it again...</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This is a common misconception.</p>
<p>The most common heart attack symptoms, the &quot;typical&quot; ones, are most common in both men and women. That is, the majority of people of any gender having a heart attack experience substernal chest pressure. These typical symptoms are contrasted to &quot;atypical&quot; symptoms like sharp pain or no pain (just difficulty breathing or dizziness for example).</p>
<p>It's true that atypical symptoms occur at a higher rate in women than men. They also occur at a higher rate in elderly folks and in people with diabetes. Even still, somewhere around 70-80% of men with heart attacks have typical symptoms and around 50-60% of women have the same. This leads to doctors being less likely to pick up on heart attacks in women overall, but the same occurs with men with atypical symptoms - because there's more conditions that can cause those same symptoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only some organs will be bigger - a good example is that lungs are generally sized relative to height which is used to calculate an “ideal” or standard body weight for calculating how much air is required per breath on a ventilator. For example, a 500lb 6ft person would have a similar lung volume to a 180lb 6ft person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Disclaimer--the following is very generalized and barely scratches the surface of drug dosing:</p>
<p>Your reasoning is sometimes correct and sometimes not.  It depends a lot on the drug and method of administration, and also the individual patient.  For example, children have larger liver to body ratios than adults.  So adverse effects of some medications, such as acetaminophen toxicity, are sometimes not as severe in children.  (Meaning that mild to moderate pediatric acetaminophen overdoses tend not to be as severe as mild to moderate adult acetaminophen overdoses.)</p>
<p>But at the same time, the adverse other drugs that are hepatically metabolized in other ways may be more severe in children due to immature liver development.</p>
