<p>I see no reason to believe this is accurate in any way. The new definition streamlines things and gets rid of the issues associated with linking a dimensional unit to a physical (and ever-changing) object, but it's not like we just magically increased the precision of how we determine masses. We just changed the reference point. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I'm trying to make computations with high degrees of accuracy, changing a reference point to be a constant <em>absolutely</em> helps make more precise calculations. If you're trying to say that before this change that all of the calculations were just as accurate because we accounted for the variations, then making it easier should still reduce error and speed up the process. </p>
<p>Or what other point are you making? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Are those really the examples you want to give. Maybe the medicine, but how accurate do you need to be for planetary measurements? Does it matter if Mars is actually a meter to the left?</p></div>		</li>
