Itâ€™s a cost/benefit decision about things like workers comp/taxes/payroll expenses -and every company is unique.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just about everyone on set is in a union, and they get health plans thru the union. They're contractors. </p>
<p>Proper records are supposed to be kept to determine pay. So time cards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right and wrong. there are both union and non-union sets. Generally anything from a studio or that you see on TV/theatres is a union show. Non-union stuff is more the realm of indie features, music videos, and web stuff.</p>
<p>For the most part though no one on a union set is considered a contractor. They are paid through the production company's payroll and if it is a union show, a portion of the paycheck goes towards their pension plan. The exception here is if the crew member is being paid through a loan-out corporation, usually because production is using their gear.</p>
<p>It's currently common for non union shows to pay crew as independent contractors, to save on the tax burden, but there has been a major ruling in CA that outlaws this practice starting next year. You may have seen the articles about Uber which does something similar and is the cause of that case. The reason this is illegal is film crews don't pass the test for a contractor, namely, they don't make their own hours, production sets their call time for work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™m going to speak from personal experience, I work in the Netherlands so maybe this wonâ€™t apply to your location.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s a lot more relationship management than I expected it to be. Almost all the work I do I get called for because I worked with these people before and they liked me or because someone I know well referred me to them cause they couldnâ€™t do that job.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s important to be social and nice to people, next to just being good at your job. </p>
<p>The production company needs a crew. They maybe have a director in mind they think is good for the job. That director has worked with a DOP he wants to work with because this is a horror film and that DOP has a lot of experience with horror. That DOP in turn has maybe some assistants he worked with before and likes and he wants to work with them. </p>
<p>In this country itâ€™s a relatively small world where many people know each other and it can be hard to wedge yourself inbetween if youâ€™re just starting out.</p>
<p>You gotta be lucky to get that one job that gives you more jobs and build a network of people you work with. I started out doing a lot of small, low budget jobs cause you need to start somewhere and somehow the ball got rolling enough to where I am now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd definitely reiterate the relationship/small world points from others. I live in New York City and it's the same thing. </p>
<p>PA'ing (being a Production Assistant) is an entry level job, and even if your eventual goal is to work on big budget movies, I'd strongly encourage working on as many indie and even student projects as possible. PA'ing on big movies, you can end up posted far from set, acting as a human signpost or somesuch BS. I worked on an indie set where I was brought on as a PA and ended up with an Art Director credit because I took initiative and went above and beyond. Went from getting recommended for PA gigs to Art Dept gigs. You never know. </p>
<p>Find small sets where everyone HAS to wear multiple hats. It'll be the hardest work, longest hours, but also best learning experience you could ask for. The high of making it through a 20 hr day, accomplishing the seamingly impossible with a group of strangers who have become like family is unrivaled in &quot;real life&quot;. And each department head you work for and get along with and impress, will recommend you to 5+ other people looking to hire you down the line. </p>
<p>Do you know anyone who works in film? Have them ask for you to PA on the next gig they do. It might not be much pay, but don't let people bully you into working for free. The only times I've worked for free are for good friends on projects I really believed in. </p>
<p>Beyond that, be personable and work your ass off, and you'll be fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is solid advice, but disagree about not working for free (at least in LA; dunno how it is in NY).  Lots of student gigs in LA want freelance crew, and a lot of them are unable/unwilling to pay for that crew.  If you didn't go to film school and want to get into a technical department like camera, free student gigs are imo a great way to get basic knowledge.  Especially since the department heads are usually going to be paid freelancers who know what they are doing <em>or</em> the more advanced film students (in which case you can basically get their education for free by assisting them).</p>
<p>If the alternative is sitting at home and not being on set, I personally think taking free gigs is fine when you are starting out.</p>
<p>Now no-pay on a commercial gig?  Yeah fuck that noise.  If the product is making money, so am I.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is very helpful insight thank you both. I donâ€™t think I know anyone who works in film making. Iâ€™ve typically only worked on documentary type projects (which I enjoy.) but i will keep an eye out for any entry level pa listings and try to get a foot in the door.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Move to a big market (LA/NY/Chicago/Atlanta in the US) and start working.  Craigslist/Facebook groups to get jobs at first (get ready for shit/no pay and probably some shit working conditions from these sorts of gigs), while you are building out your contacts.   At a certain point, you will know what you want to do department-wise and start specializing your skill set to that department, and at a certain point you will have enough contacts that your phone rings enough to get by for work without you having to constantly hit up strangers on the internet about listings.  From there on out, it's just a matter of building up your skills and contacts until you can get into the union.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect for Los Angeles film production. Perhaps it's correct for non-union crews elsewhere.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, crew are paid as employees (because they are employees, not contractors, under U.S. labor law*) but by a payroll company, not the production company itself. They have a union-negotiated hourly pay rate that automatically scales depending on a variety of factors.</p>
<p>Source: union film crew in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>*Lots of non-union productions try to pay you as a contractor anyway, but it's illegal.</p></div>		</li>
