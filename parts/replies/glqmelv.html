			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember when most of this advice was relevant but I am also under the impression that we've controlled for this over the years. I specifically remember getting my first laptop with a power manager so I didn't have to fret over the battery anymore. The batteries definitely last longer than they used to, but that's also expected with advances in technology. I suppose it isn't too hard to believe thst while the tech is better, it's still not perfect and you can still use this advice to make it last even longer though it's not as important to as before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called a coulomb counter.  You basically pre-load a profile based on the battery size and chemistry, then it tracks and re-profiles the battery as it degrades to report that percentage of charge that you see.  These circuits also handle the charging of the battery.  Are you saying that these circuit manufacturers are secretly damaging the battery?  Would you like to present any evidence of this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did not say anybody is actively doing that, just that I wouldn't put it past them. Planned obsolescence and all. Manufacturers actively not letting you set a charge limit is effectively the same thing, because &quot;100%&quot; charge (be that 4.1V per cell or more, it does not really matter) can't possibly be just as good as 3.8V long-term.</p></div>		</li>
