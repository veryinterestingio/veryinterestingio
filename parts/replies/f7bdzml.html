			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, because you want at least a cursory look before you hit go just in case something has gone egregiously wrong. Accidentally depleting several thousand to hundreds of thousands of accounts because of a software glitch tends to be bad for business.</p>
<p>Not that it's a normal problem for automation to fail on such a collosal scale, but if it happens once it could have financially crippling legal implications to the responsible party.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> I'm getting tons of excellent questions around the topic of isn't AI less error prone than humans, why not automate sanity checking our automation, etc. I'm happy to answer where I can. </p>
<p>I think a good read for those interested in AI, Machine Learning, and automation would be &quot;Weapons of Math Destruction&quot; it's mostly around where technology is often misused even by well intentioned individuals causing harm at scale. It also helps address ways those of us who create automated systems ensure we don't create a harmful system. One tip being to regularly question our system assuming it's wrong until proven right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It happened recently (in the last couple months) when a payroll company abruptly shuttered their doors and just took all of the money their client companies had allocated for employees. This resulted in chargebacks from banks, sometimes hitting several or dozens of times, including one employee's account being nearly one million dollars in the negative.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly it. I work for a bank and part of my job is going over wire transfers. Unless your a special case that does wires multiple times a day then even if you do it electronically it  gets looked at by 2 sets of people before it goes out and gets processed. I'm the 3rd person who looks at certain high risk ones after to fact to make sure we didn't mess up. </p>
<p>Its automated in the sense that we transfer the funds electronically now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best productivity comes not from AI nor humans alone, but putting them together as a team. People often think AI will get rid of all jobs, that’s not the case, but it’s going to vastly simplify a lot of jobs to the point where much fewer humans are needed. I don’t know if this is the case with banks yet but I suspect they’ll be headed this way, not total automation.</p>
<p>The human is/will be there as another check and balance, perhaps looking for meta-patterns in the AI’s judgements to make sure it continues to do the right thing, training it, and intervening for individual transactions when it doesn’t. </p>
<p>This is going to happen to truck drivers too once self driving trucks get good enough, it’ll become an office job just like a drone operator except the human will oversee multiple trucks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See you're thinking like someone who is sending money to a friend.at best a few grand. There are people transferring millions of dollars. Then there are those who are transferring money between accounts back to the same account multiple times. Illegal? No. Shady as fuck? Yes. AI might not catch that. And when 7 figures is transferred that shouldn't be done automatically</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you happen to know if mobile check depositing is completely automated, or does someone have to verify the image of the check with the amount entered in on the banking app? I’m assuming the latter. When I used to have to cash my paychecks before we got direct deposit, only a portion of the funds would become available to me until some time in the next business day.</p></div>		</li>
