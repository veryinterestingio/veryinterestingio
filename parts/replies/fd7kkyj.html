<p>On Wednesday, in Canberra, south of Sydney, it was 5,000 PPM</p>

<p>Small correction, that's not a ppm concentration,  that's an air quality index number, a weighted index of multiple pollutants. Still absolutely, fucking, crazily high. We use different standards at the workplace here, but from a rough estimate, that's where I would have to shut down and evacuate a workplace. Way beyond that, actually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Point 3 isn’t back burning, but hazardous reduction burns. The terms are often confused.</p>
<p>Back burning is a last-resort measure to stop wildfire from burning out specific areas. It works by setting fires from containment lines, such as established fire breaks or hastily contrasted ones made with a bulldozer or cut by hand. Sometime back burning does make the fire worse, which is why it is a last resort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No? Stratospheric O2 is not involved in CO2 formation - that obviously happens when the carbon is burnt at ground level. Furthermore, the tiny concentrations of CO2 compared to O2 (400 ppm vs 200,000 ppm) mean there's no appreciable effect on solar flux absorbed by O2 to form ozone.</p></div>		</li>
