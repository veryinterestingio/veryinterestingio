<p>Google asks for permission to use your camera, microphone and location. If you tap &quot;allow,&quot; you gave it permission to record you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you exchanged messages discussing meeting up, perhaps it applied her interest history to you.  I remember when I first started dating my wife, I got irrelevant-to-me ads regarding some of her interests for a few weeks.  I still come across an ad for some of her interests from time to time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible it knows from your online profiles that you're both single and looking and have similar interests (YT is linked to Google so they know you look at jazz content). Through location tracking it knows you met up for an extended period of time, and probably talked about your common interests. Maybe it's trying to predict you'll go to jazz concert on a date next, or that you'll take up flute lessons to better bond with her. I have my doubts our phones are listening, esp considering how much audio data that would take to trawl through and store. I think we give off way more subtle cues than we're aware of. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another option is that it is much more complex that than, and algorithms have been self trained to recognize entire collections of our behaviors and figure out things humans never would have made the connections to. I like to link to this article whenever the &quot;how does it make the connections&quot; come up, since it's kind of relevant: <a href="https://www.damninteresting.com/on-the-origin-of-circuits/" target="_blank">https://www.damninteresting.com/on-the-origin-of-circuits/</a></p>
<p>Another similar thing would be the MarI/O thing on YouTube somewhere, where an algorithm trains and evolves itself to play through Mario levels from scratch.</p></div>		</li>
