			<div class="markdown"><p>That's kind of already happening. Ice sort of flows out over Greenland and melts in the North Atlantic. It used to be replenished by ice forming in the Beaufort gyre, but that's been stopping, so now there's just a lot of loose ice melting instead of a fresh solid icepack forming.</p>
