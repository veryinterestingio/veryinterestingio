			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's entirely possible. The issue is that such an adaption usually requires changes that are detrimental in other contexts. So those adapted bacteria get outcompeted if regular exposure to alcohol isn't an issue.</p>
<p>But in some situations it can be a problem. For example, NASA uses alcohol to disinfect their probes and they found some extremophiles that could withstand very highly concentrated alcohol and even metabolized (&quot;ate&quot;) it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but it assumes some knowledge about the difference between &quot;antibiotics&quot; in the sense of drugs, vs &quot;things which kill bacteria by destroying the whole cell&quot;. It's possible for bacteria to develop resistance to antibiotic drugs because they work via a specific protein within the bacteria. So bacteria that mutate to alter or substitute that protein will no longer be affected by the drug. But in the general category of &quot;things which kill bacteria by destroying the whole cell&quot; like hand sanitizer, there's essentially no way that a bacteria could evolve to prevent that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To evolve to be resistant to alcohol, the bacteria would need to basically do the human equivalent of evolving to have skin made of non-carbon based biological tissue that resists acid. Possible? Yes. But it would likely need to be caused by an extremely unlikely major shift in the bacteria’s genome that happens to get it right the first try and not affect any other workings of the cell. It virtually cannot happen via a slow process and multiple generations (which is generally how bacteria evolve). </p>
<p>We’re talking something akin to Bruce Banner being zapped by gamma radiation and turning into the Hulk. But for bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Alcohol/soap actually destroy the cell walls</p>

<p>Does SARS-CoV-2 have a cell wall? I thought it had a protein membrane.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Alcohol kills germs through a simple chemical process known as denaturation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From what I understand, alcohol does indeed bond with the membrane, and, as you say, what that does is making the membrane soluble in water, making the membrane lose integrity, exposing the internal workings of the virus to more alcohol. This is where the real damage from denaturation happens. But to be clear, denaturation is an extremely broad term. It means that the molecular structure of proteins or nucleic acids are changed so that they don't function as they are supposed to. In general, this can come about for many reasons, where extreme temperature and pH being prime examples, but also organic solvents like ethanol.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Kind of, but it isn't clear to me that it goes about denaturing anything, but it does open the membrane up like alcohol. Soap is amphiphiles, meaning in competes with the lipids of the membrane dissolving it, and exposing the internals. Without the protection of the membrane it can't survive. It is the same reason soap is good at removing dirt, because it makes dirt soluble in water. That said, we shouldn't under appreciate that soap also is highly effective simply because it removes the virus.</p></div>		</li>
