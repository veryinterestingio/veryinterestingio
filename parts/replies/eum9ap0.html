			<div class="markdown"><p>The analogy is also deeply flawed IMO. In case of any water balloon higher is always better. Nukes have a yield dependent sweet spot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you pop a water balloon higher and higher up, there's a point at which it doesn't spread any further than if you just did it lower (winds etc. excluded).</p>
<p>That point is not much higher than your head.</p>
<p>Similarly, a nuke miles up in the atmosphere isn't &quot;any more effective&quot; as one only, say, a quarter of a mile above ground level.</p></div>		</li>
