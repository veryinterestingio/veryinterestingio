			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for asking!  For a setting like this (where multiple decades have passed), I use historical information (death certificates, funeral home records, newspapers) and cross reference details with the biological data.  When so many years have passed, it can be difficult to get specific information about an individual (although I have the same problem today, due to record retention schedules for dental records).  DNA is the next step when paper records aren't available.</p></div>		</li>
