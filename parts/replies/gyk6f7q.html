			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a problem for polling in general nowadays. Live, in-person calling polls used to be considered the gold standard. But now, we have good evidence that they're not very accurate, because who the fuck answers phone calls from random numbers anymore? Certainly not a random cross section of the general population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The companies that gather this data typically recruit a nationally-representative panel who write down and record their TV/radio consumption over a certain period, in order to avoid such skews.</p>
<p>In the UK, TV numbers are reported by the BARB panel for example, which consists of 1,000 households that have been selected to be representative of the demographic make up of the UK as a whole. These numbers are reported roughly every single day, the following day (called &quot;overnights&quot;) and the checked and vetted figures are released about a week later (called &quot;consolidated&quot;).</p>
<p>Radio numbers are reported by RAJAR in the UK, but I can't remember how big their panel is off the top of my head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Way back when, it was logs people kept and boxes that recorded the radio station they were listening to. And they were paid to do that. Today I think it’s all automatic devices. The people are chosen by age, sex, etc., to be a representative sample.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I fill them out. they can be pretty long and tedious. the ones from Nielsen can be long or short depending on what they're asking about. I stopped when I stopped watching as much cable TV bc all they wanted to know about was if I watched the premiere episode of shows I don't care about and why do I not care and what can they do to make me care more. I hate the radio ones. the only ones I've done have you listening to hundreds of clips of songs and rating how much you like them or if they're being overplayed on certain radio stations for 2+ hours. last one I did was for country music. 1278 clips, took me an hour and a half at super speed where I just listened to the first 5 seconds of the clip. got a $30 gift card for it however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few years ago I got one from Nielsen about what radio stations I listen to over the course of a week. They offered $20 to fill it out and send it back for each member of the household, so my (then) fiancee and I both did it and got our $20.</p>
<p>Honestly didn't take that long each day, especially since I only listen to one radio station.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have.</p>
<p>When living in Colorado Springs, CO in 1998-99 I got a random mailing.</p>
<p>It contained a letter from Neilson explaining that this was a radio survey, a survey form, and two brand new dollar bills. They said i could just keep the 2 bucks if i didn't want to participate.</p>
<p>The survey was set out for two weeks of me recording what radio station/s I listened to and where i listened to them. At the time, I was an apartment man, and basically listened to the radio during most of my work hours.</p>
<p>I mailed that survey back, and they sent one for another two weeks, along with another brand new dollar bill. Once I sent back the second survey, they sent me two more dollars, and that was that.</p>
<p>Oddly, my late FiL received exactly the same proposal, dollar bills and all, less than a year ago here in CA. Unfortunately, he had passed before they sent the mailing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They use things like radio contests too. If they know a certain percentage of listeners statistically will call into a contest, they can make an educated guess about how many people are listening by how many people call “in the next ten minutes.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ehhh not really. Response to contests can vary greatly due to time of day and what is being given away. To the extent that it's not anywhere near predictable. Contests are just a way to keep people engaged and more importantly to sell stuff on behalf of clients. </p>
<p>And a lot of contests have moved away from &quot;caller 10&quot; to keywords, texts, and online. Because nobody actually used a phone to make phone calls. </p>
