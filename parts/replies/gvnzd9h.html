			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the relativity of the time.</p>
<p>When you wake up earlier in the morning, you say to yourself just 20 minutes more and you wake up two hours later and an hour late for work.</p>
<p>When you're at work, you say to yourself just a 20-minute nap and 3 minutes later your boss is standing over you and shouting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hereâ€™s what I do. Itâ€™s essentially mindful meditation though. Close my eyes, relax my jaw (Iâ€™m a jaw clincher), slow deep breathe in, imagine the number 1 and really, really concentrate on it, really visualize the number, slow breathe out. Do the same with 2, then 3, etc and restart when I get to 10. If your mind wanders, your forget your count, or you count past 10, donâ€™t stress it, just start over.  You will eventually fall asleep. Do this every single night and youâ€™ll get better at it.  Unless I have caffeine at night, I canâ€™t remember the last time I made it all the way to 10.  Iâ€™m almost asleep now just thinking about it. </p>
<p>I even do a count like this to put our little kids to bed. They have a harder time with controlling the flow of their thoughts but it still works.  I count slowly to 100 and I try to time it with their breathe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find even music causes too much distraction, even the minimalist kind that is pretty boring. The best for me is Spotify's &quot;Sleep machine&quot; playlist, which is hours of different wave and other water sounds. It is also great for blocking out little sounds in the night that might wake you.</p></div>		</li>
