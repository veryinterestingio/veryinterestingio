			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the original quote is the plural of anecdote <em>is</em> data.  It was an admonishment not to treat your data as too holy because the very act of measurement itself is imbued with subjective biases.  When I was an active chemistry phd researcher I would keep reminding my colleagues that because sometimes they sorely needed it (I'm a programmer now)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fellow technologist.. I’ve done things and started programming in q basic as a kid.</p>
<p>Religion and Science are extreme opposites of the same coin. Both use things developed within their system to validate their ideas. When you are bound by your system it’s hard to see the flaws of it when you can’t look at it from outside...</p>
<p>Did Pavlov really need to “torture” a dog to observe the every day and common? The ethical atrocities committed by both institutions are hard to overlook... and the fact that they still go on today as medicinal science has become in the forefront in money making for sometime. Oncologist who misdiagnosed people with cancer and then killed them comes to mind.</p>
<p>Both are a bit whackadoo in some regards. And often times the answer is we don’t know on both ends. </p>
<p>Anyone who uses an institution as viable source to defend their work falls under bias. Just as so many drs. I met have a professional bias and will belittle you if you’ve thoroughly researched all the possibilities... literally was prescribed antibiotics for shingles... she didn’t believe it was because it had crossed both sides of my body. It in fact was, and horrifying. </p>
<p>We literally have just about the entirety of human knowledge in our pockets yet we are still masses of willful ignorance chasing financial success, and often times at great ethical damage the higher they move up that ladder. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is certainly a fascinating bit of trivia! It seems we have a malleable quote that can work for either side! </p>
<p>Now that I have your ear, and you are a self admitted programmer, let me introduce myself.  I am a power user of almost any business computer application I’ve met. In the course of my career, random, unable to be duplicated errors occasionally happen when using a program, and there is no good explanation. Do not try to blame me, kind programmer, I have a long career, and I’m not foolish. But these anecdotal “glitches” have happened a few times over a 30 year period, and I have always wondered how to explain them. I’ve retired so I would take a moment to recall the specifics, but it doesn’t really matter too much. The facts are, perhaps once every year or so, (rare) from DOS to Windows 10, I’ve observed a problem that either occurred for no apparent reason, or was solved by using the identical keystrokes or clicks that I tried 5 times before, and then I couldn’t duplicate the issue.</p>
<p>I feel like destiny has made our paths cross, as I’ve been wondering this for years, have only anecdotal evidence, and you are a programmer who has a keen understanding of anecdotes vs rules of logic. Computers are logical- not arbitrary in their operations- so why do I have a small handful of data collected over a 30 year period that are anomalies without explanation?</p>
<p>I am ever so sincerely asking you this question... you will improve my life if you have a plausible explanation to my lifelong dilemma. ;)</p></div>		</li>

Not only is that line almost lifted word for word from there, but it is a funny insight into a conversation with someone who has a complete disregard for science, facts or reasoned logic.</p></div>		</li>

<p>One of the MDs at my hospital says that <em>n</em> of 1 is the most powerful sample size to a patient. It's an uphill battle counseling patients on treatments and therapies when they've heard something negative about it from one friend/relative, even for standand of care treatments.</p></div>		</li>
