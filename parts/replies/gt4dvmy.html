<p>Having a &quot;freeze&quot; response is extremely common and should be noted when talking about our natural threat response.</p>
<p>Why didn't they fight back? They froze.
Why didn't they try to move out the way? They froze.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Freeze is, for the most part, a very good survival strategy. Most predators have visual systems that rely on movement. If you don't move it's much harder for them to see you. Think t-rex from Jurassic park. Fight and flight (without a car) responses would both get you killed. Freeze might give you a chance of survival.</p>
<p>Many predators are also not scavengers. So even if they've spotted you, if you've not moving, then they are likely to ignore you. That is, they'll assume you've been dead a while that your flesh is rotting. That if they eat you, it will make them sick. This is mostly an evolved innate response rather than a conscious decision.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also fawn, if you're not familiar. If someone's angry, instead of running, yelling yourself, or freezing, you try to appease them, like apologizing profusely, or maybe going to do something you think will make them less mad, like chores, if it was my mom that's mad at me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's definitely a major oversimplification, but hey this is eli5. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response" target="_blank">wikipedia article</a> on it is actually pretty comprehensive, though it mostly focuses on the physiological parts, and not the psychological parts. Hyperarousal or acute stress response is a more accurate term for the effect (though it hasn't really caught on outside of academia yet), to reflect the fact that it's not entirely an either-or thing, and there's other options (like freezing, yelling to attract attention of others, etc), but those aspects of the response don't really get at why we respond to pain with anger sometimes, so I left them out.</p></div>		</li>
