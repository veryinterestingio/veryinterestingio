			<div class="markdown"><p>I was under the impression that the Tetanus shot was because Tetanus has a lower lethal dose than the immune system can detect and mount a successful response against, so the vaccine's effectiveness requires a relatively high amount of Ab production to maintain an effective surveillance of the body. The constant revaccination is to make sure that there's still a decent amount of cells available to detect Tetanus early enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also tetanus doesn’t transmit person to person, therefore it’s always in the environment and no level of “herd immunity” can be obtained. It’s a constant level of risk, rather than a diminishing level of risk</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, I’m confused as to the link between not transmitting person to person and not being able to obtain herd immunity. Can you please explain?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny enough, the vaccine don't immunize against the Tenanus bacterium, but agains the toxin it produce.

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes finally someone mentioned it. Its called a toxoid vaccine where we are not attacking the disease itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct that the lethal dose of the tetanus toxin is far lower than what our immune system needs to confer immunity, but the way we get around that is by conjugating the toxin with another protein that will elicit a stronger response. The actual disease tetanus also does not confer immunity if someone recovers from it because the lethal dose is so low.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went in for a tetanus shot after cutting myself in the garden. It had been right around 11 or 12 years since my last one so I was kinda freaking out.</p>
<p>The doctor said the exact same thing to me. &quot;These things last at least 30 years.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heh it's funny, I used to work with rusty stuff all the time (old piping systems are always rusty) so my Dr had me dosing every 5 years like clockwork.  It was cheap and I didn't mind a sore arm for a day or so to be pretty comfortable I wouldn't die from cutting my hand at work one day.</p></div>		</li>
