<p>Not quite. The support acts instruments are often packed during the main performance, and sometimes in the truck, but very little of the “tear down” will occur while the performance is still happening. This is partially because it doesn’t speed things up that much, but mostly because almost everything is still very much in use, and performers tend to get upset if you start removing bit of their lighting or sound rig while it’s being used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. Broadway-style shows will start packing scenic pieces and props before the show is done, but the hands usually just sit and wait until the encore is over before loading out musical performances.</p></div>		</li>
