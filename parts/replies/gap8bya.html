			<div class="markdown"><p>Specular is the term for the way a shiny mirror reflects light (a ray of light gets reflected as another ray), whereas a non-shiny mirror scatters the light ray into a diffuse spray of light. But the total reflectance is the same for both.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The two sides probably look identical in infrared. IR wavelength is so long that it can't pick out tiny defects.</p>
