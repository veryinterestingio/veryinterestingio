			<div class="markdown"><p>For anyone interested, your gut health is best helped by eating probiotics as well as prebiotics. Probiotics are things with live and active cultures; yogurt (not the sugar filled candy type), kimchi, sauerkraut and Clausen pickles (only the refrigerated kinds), kombucha, etc. Prebiotics are nutritionally dense foods like fruits and vegetables (sweet potato, mushrooms, spinach, blueberries), real whole grains, etc. The good bacteria in probiotics get sustenance from the nutrients and process of breaking down the prebiotics.</p>
<p>Edit: theres loads of interesting information in the replies to this comment!  Some notes: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you need to be consistently eating pro-and-pre-biotic food for this to do any good (this is my diet, so DM me for recipes, or please share yours!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ideally you will be adventurous in your probiotics and eat a variety of different things</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>probiotic pills really are not the same as eating actual, live, probiotic food.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you want to eat fibrous food (prebiotic food) because it takes so long to break down that it keeps the probiotic bacteria alive throughout the entire gut-journey. </p>
</li>
<li>fermentation differs greatly from food to food. Lots of good info on this in comments.</li>
</ul>
<p><del>Edit2: so many people in the comments are trying to argue that theres no science that backs this up. I've already done my research on this, back when my <em>doctor</em> told me to start eating a certain way to improve my gut health after a series of events that basically trashed my microbiome. So I'm not going to do it all over again for you guys, but here's a bunch of articles I got from 5min of googling. If you want to argue please actually bring your own research, not just ask for mine</del></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most probiotics are pretty useless as they cannot get through the stomach, so calling them probiotics is misleading/ a lie.</p>
<p>Also, of those bacteria that get through the stomach into the intestines, it is a very small number, like plonking 2 Italian guys in China and expecting them to fix the country's woes. Only it would probably be more like plonking 1 Italian guy's small toe in China, or 1 Italian skin flake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I can add some relevant information here. I'm in second year of medical school and have had lectures on this subject this week, with a couple of hours just today. One of the lectures held today was held by one of the leading researchers in gut biota, who is planning a project to do a gene sampling (PCR) of a <em>million</em> bacterial species in human bowels.</p>
<p>What's interesting is that this is a very new field of research, and there is no &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; answer in this. However, until very recently, we didn't have a clue to what our gut bacteria does. And we still really don't. There are a lot of ongoing studies of it right now, among them many which are following children who were born through Ceasarian cuts compared to vaginally born children (whose faces will scrape along the vagina and ultimatly the anus of the mother and collect a lot of anaerobic (non-oxygen breathing) bacteria before being born). However, most of those studies still need to wait 15-20 years until the followed kids are adults to be able to come to any conclusions.</p>
<p>What we do know is that the gut bacteria are different in obese people compared to normally weighted ones. It's also different in starving/anorectic people. It also varies between ethnicities. But it's too early to draw conclusions as to what all the species in our guts do and how they affect us.</p>
<p>What's worth noting is that most probiotics are different subspecies of <em>lactobacillus</em>, which doesn't really colonize the gut, but is rather flushed out with defecation. They <em>do</em> however produce acids while they are in there and other metabolites, which could affect the existing flora.</p>
<p>There aren't enough or good enough studies to warrant clinical treatments with probiotics, but there are a bunch of reported cases where patients with IBS or IBD or similar inflammatory gut diseases have lowered their symptoms with probiotics. Furthermore, the same subspecies of probiotic bacteria they've taken haven't had effect on all patients, rather they had to &quot;find their own species&quot;. There have also been reported cases where conditions have worsened after taking probiotics.</p>
<p>As a medical student, I'm really looking forward to seeing how our knowledge of the gut biome affects health, because we're currently quite certain that it does affect health, and that a varied gut biome is good. But we don't know enough to actively affect it. Doctors in Sweden aren't allowed to prescribe probiots yet due to this, but we are allowed to recommend probiots to patients who are about to undergo heavy antibiotic treatments for instance.</p>

<p>I've heard about the potential differences in c sections vs vaginal birth... If you're a parent forced into a c section, could you just ask the doc to take some samples from the vaginal area and smear it all over the babie's face?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I studied this area and a lot of the research is in the correlation phase. So a study will focus on a population with or without a disease and then look into the microbiome changes. People also need to keep in mind we could only start figuring out what microbes were present in the gut around the time of the human microbiome project (2007-2016) which at the end provided researchers with a way to actually characterize the microbiome. </p>
<p>It’s all very new so we shouldn’t expect to know any long term outcomes for human health any time soon. It’s still very interesting stuff, but the how it happens isn’t known yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be wary of the probiotic advice that they will &quot;repopulate&quot; your gut. The biggest populations of bacteria in your gut are not bacteria from fermented foods. The bacteria of fermented foods can initiate gene expression and that's often where the health benefits arise.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gastro.org/press-release/agas-interpretation-of-the-latest-probiotics-research" target="_blank">This study</a> argues probiotics actually slow down the rehabilitation. The bacteria from fermented foods often don't last very long in the colonic environment by themselves which is why the benefit is from continuous ingestion of fermented foods.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really interesting! But that only relates to fermented foods, right? So the probiotics in yogurt, keifer, etc are different? Or am I dumb and those things are also considered fermented?</p></div>		</li>
