			<div class="markdown"><p>I know that's how they describe it microbiology class. It's 'hiding' in the ganglia but not really it's more in a state of constant guerilla war with the immune system.  Every time it shows itself outside the ganglia the immunity from the initial chicken pox infection hammers it so it cant spread to cells in the rest of the body where the immune system is active. However as you get older, the original memory cells that were stored start to die off or become less responsive and the infection breaks out again. </p>
<p>Quite a few of the herpes viruses behave like that, they're not really gone when theres not symptoms. Think of cold sores and genital herpes. You want to see the mother of all herpes flair ups? Tip the scales with some stress to the immune system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So does that mean anybody who had chicken pox as a child is routinely having immune responses to chicken pox? Or is that just something that <em>can</em> happen but doesn't very often?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am in my 30s and I have had shingles. Anyone that has had chicken pox can get it. Get the damn vaccine. The pain is excruciating. You do not want to get this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can get shingles later in life from the primary varicella vaccine too. But yeah, when you're age appropriate, get the shingle vaccine.</p></div>		</li>
