			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure that's less because the Great Lakes suddenly have access to the sea, and more just ships with stowaway organisms can get into the Great Lakes through the seaway. The St. Lawrence always connected the Great Lakes to the sea, the seaway just exists to bypass various stretches of rapids that kept the river from being properly navigable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep... it’s the access they suddenly had which helped the introduction of invasive species vs a saltwater infestation. </p>
<p>Good points tho  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some pretty big differences. </p>
<p>Salt vs fresh water being the most glaring. </p>
<p>The invasive species in the Great Lakes aren’t from the oceans but from introduced fresh water species and bilge water.  </p>
<p>I thing the lamprey eels were from bilge water introduction. It’s been decades since I’ve payed attention.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your wrong on that.  One of the most famous invasive species in the great lakes system is the <em>alewife</em>.  A form of anadromous fish, that spends both time in the salt and the fresh water.  Once past the natural barrier of the Niagra falls populations surged without natural predators.  There were massive die-offs that would wash up on shore as a result.  So what did we do to try and alleviate it?  Introduce another saltwater fish, the Salmon.</p>
<p>Goby's are also sort of salt water fish.</p></div>		</li>
