			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a nuance, but alcohol doesn’t suppress the production of ADH. It’s still being made in the pituitary at the same rate, it just isn’t being released into the circulation. Hence, you get a rebound effect 6-10 hours after drinking where you have very high circulating ADH levels (I.e. you’re hungover and can drink 2 liters of water without making much urine)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This helps explain a lot. I recently had a heart attack and I suspect some meds plus only a couple beers are making me get dehydrated very easily and when that happens my BP drops super low which knocks me out and puts me in bed for 6+ hours and I don't pee the whole time no matter how much I drink. Good to understand what's happening.</p>
<p>For now I'm just doing a 1-beer limit once in a while. Even though doctors said I can drink.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maintaining volume status in heart failure plays with a lot of the same knobs. Your kidneys/blood pressure sensors/hormones trying to fine tune how much water and salt to hold on to, and then booze just comes along and spins the dials like “haha good luck!”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reality is that most people who binge drink are in fact over-hydrated, at least acutely. High blood volume itself is a major inducer of urination. Alcohol is also an ADH release inhibitor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chronic alcohol abusers can in fact be over hydrated (euvolemic hypotonic hyponatremia). Alcoholics that drink large amounts of beer have a problem excreting free water. Alcoholics are notorious for having poor nutrition and can be deficient in solutes. Water follows salt thus the body needs salt (via proper diet) in order to excrete free water. In alcoholics large intake of hypotonic fluid (beer) and poor nutrition (lack of salts) can impair the kidneys ability to excrete free water... this is called &quot;beer potomania&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Peeing more when you drink more is normal, but you normally don't dehydrate. you dehydrate drinking beer because the ADH inhibition adds to the peeing, resulting in dehydration. So yes, the ADH inhibition is the reason for dehydration.</p></div>		</li>
