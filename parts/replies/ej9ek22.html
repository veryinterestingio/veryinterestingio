			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add my two cents, today many people use trackers, small devices that let their scopes and cameras lock on a certain position and correct for Earth's rotation, allowing for more stabilized shots/footage. Doing it manually kinda sucks really. At high magnifications the Moon for instance basically floats across the field of view of your telescope in seconds. More distant objects need adjustment less often but they also get out of focus soon enough. You need multiple long exposure photos and at different apertures combined to get full details. They are all there in real life but our eyes can’t see them without help.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And in professional astronomy/at observatories (including space-based), we use guiding and guide-stars plus stabilization in the form of gyroscopes.</p>
<p>In addition: pictures of planets from the ground or in space (given a decently sized ground-based telescope) have to be exposed so quickly that the motion is practically non-existent. This is because the planets appear so bright that they would overexpose if we shot for even a second. I know this because when we had down-time during my masters at the observatory, we used to shoot planets and well-known constellations for fun before we shut down for the night, and the exposure times were fractions of a second.</p></div>		</li>

<p>By that, do you mean basically a high tech star tracker? Back when I did astrophotography (amateur, very), I got a star tracker that I'd put on the tube, hook up to a laptop, then the laptop would see the stars it's pointed at and hook up to the mount and give it tiny adjustments. It was an equatorial go-to mount and tracked the rotation of the earth itself, but for any errors in polar aligning, the star tracker and laptop software was supposed to make adjustments to center it again.</p>
<p>Seems like 99% of astrophotography is just keeping the stupid tube pointed at the same stupid spot for a long time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This isn't exactly true.</p>
<p>The motion of another planet, or even the moon, is minuscule compared with the rate of rotation of the Earth.  it's the Earth's rotation you're largely correcting for.</p>
<p>Now, the Moon <em>does</em> orbit us opposite of our rotation, and so it's angular velocity is actually faster, but only by about ~3%.  So <em>if</em> you're using equal magnification on the Moon vs another Planet, you'd have to adjust the Moon slightly more often.</p>
<p>But if you use a higher magnification on a planet. Ie, take the normalized example such that the other planet looks the same size as the Moon at a lower magnification (same apparent size) then you'd have to adjust the telescope <em>more</em> often to track the planet.  Because your field of view occupies a smaller arc, and the planet will drift out of frame faster.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> If you're tracking automatically/continuously, you need to track the Moon at a faster rate, but if you're manually centering the telescope, you'll need to do it more often if you're zoomed in more [as you might be at a distant object].</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Objects further away will tend to move closer to equal of earth's rotation.  There are a few exceptions, such as with some of the orbital patterns of objects relatively near us.  But angular rotation generally converges on earth's rotation with distance because you have to be moving so much faster to compete with earth's rotation.  For example, you pass your finger in front of your face and move it side ways.  If there were an object matching your finger's &quot;shadow,&quot; it wouldn't have to be very far away for it to be travelling fasting than the speed of light to stay in the shadow of your finger.  Earth's rotation is the constant under which all of this converges on from our perspective.  Magnification doesn't change this relationship against other bodies, it changes against other levels of zoom because you are focused on a much smaller arc - so it's really beside the point.  He is overwhelmingly right. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth noting that a very large portion of &quot;photos&quot; of space and planets and such you see around the internet are actually artists' renderings, <em>based</em> off actual photos. The photos taken by telescopes themselves arent usually anywhere near as pretty or spectacular-looking as the super-colorful dazzling rainbow-nebula kid of stuff you see everywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most NASA photos are actually multi-channel photos layered together, often in false-color because they represent non-visible wavelengths of light. They don't usually have one full-color camera on spacecraft, instead they have multiple single-channel cameras, one for each wavelength of light they're interested in. </p>
<p>For example, while not owned by NASA, the GOES-16 weather satellite has 16 imaging channels. 2 visible (470nm blue and 640nm red), 4 near-infrared (750-1400nm, commonly used for night vision), and 10 mid-far infrared. Each channel has a unique purpose, and stitched together form a composite image with multiple uses. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of what you said isn't really quite accurate.</p>
<p>There are plenty of actual photos of space and planets on the internet, taken by Earth-based telescopes, space-based telescopes, and various space probes such as Voyager 1 and 2; I wouldn't say the portion of artists' renderings compared to actual photos is &quot;very large&quot;. Also, the &quot;super colorful dazzling rainbow nebula kind of stuff&quot; you see usually <em>has</em> been photographed by a telescope (just look at NASA's &quot;Astronomy Photo of the Day&quot; website).</p>
<p>I think you maybe meant to say a couple of related but slightly different concepts: (1) when <em>looking</em> through a telescope, what you see with the human eye will not look as good as long-exposure photos; and (2) often the photos taken by telescopes and space probes undergo post-processing in Photoshop to enhance, sharpen, bring out details, etc. But they're still photos nonetheless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much all of the nebulae pictures are IR, and certain elements are given certain color in post-processing. Oxygen or hydrogen gets blue, sulphur gets red and so forth. Thats why the nebula photos are so stunning looking. In reality they wouldnt look anything like it because sulphur doesnt radiate red light, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it’s true that many astronomical images aren’t a single unedited frame - they are often composites or mosiacs, and can use filtering and/or false color to enhance specific features - they aren’t really artist’s renderings.  This process is technically rigorous and intended to improve the scientific value of the image, not necessarily to incorporate new features based on an artist’s imagination.  True artists’ renderings are generally labeled as such.</p></div>		</li>
