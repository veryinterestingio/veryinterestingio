			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the important point. Almost anything is toxic in the right/ wrong dosage. Dogs and cats have evolved to be more sensitive to some things so their threshold is lower, for reasons we aren't quite sure of.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's the other way around: humans and other omnivores and herbivores have evolved to be less sensitive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn’t this be the opposite? Wouldn’t omnivorous animals be the ones that adapted while some carnivorous animals didn’t/didn’t need to?  </p>
<p>Like only the creature that WOULD choose to eat these plants I.e Omnivores and herbivores, would have any pressure to compete in the toxin/toxin resistance arms race.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect the situation is opposite: dogs and cats did not evolve the necessary detoxification pathways for these plants because their wild ancestors simply didn't eat them at all, or ate them too infrequently for it to matter.</p>
<p>Plants don't &quot;want&quot; their vegetative and storage organs, or the embryos contained in seeds, to be damaged by herbivores. They also need to fight off fungi, bacteria, and viruses. So they produce chemicals that are toxic or unpalatable to a variety of organisms.</p>
<p>Onions make you cry? Jalapenos make you feel like your mouth is on fire? We may love it, but a mouse would not eat that again, and that protects the plant.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you get co-evolution between a plant and a herbivore, maybe the plant produces fruit that the animal likes to eat, helping to disperse its seeds. Sometimes that is very species-specific (eg, birds and chili peppers). Sometimes the animal simply keeps one step ahead of the chemical arms race and tolerates eating a plant despite all that plant's various physical and chemical defenses.</p>
<p>And then sometimes humans come along and decide that the toxic/irritant chemicals are actually delicious.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In the case of theobromine, it's still toxic. It's just more accurate to say that our livers can clear it out of our body faster than it's absorbed under most circumstances. Even if we do eat to much chocolate too fast (the old trope of children feeling bad b/c they ate too much candy) it's generally not enough to be dangerous or lethal.</p></div>		</li>
