			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, kind of. </p>
<p>My company is the one doing this. </p>
<p>Initially we will collect and process an IG because we are already set up to do that. So the person above you is correct. </p>
<p>But we are in the process of working out collecting into a bag that is then treated with methylene blue and given directly to the patient (fresh frozen plasma essentially). </p>
<p>With Ebola, we make an IG using the same process as anti-tetanus, anti-rabies, etc. That’s what we are doing in collaboration with the FDA and BARDA right now. So you’re both right I guess :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, the FDA EIND and expanded access programs are for FFP or FP24. There are however something like 220 registered trials related to COVID, so maybe you guys are working on one of those? I’m getting this mostly from an ASFA webinar yesterday with Beth Shaz, Lou Katz, Evan Bloch, and Peter Marks (FDA).</p></div>		</li>
