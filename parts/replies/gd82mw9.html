			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't take melatonin at all because, while it works very quickly, I end up having pretty severe hypnogogic hallucinations during the night afterwards, and then in the morning it's as if I physically CAN'T wake up.  The way I haphazardly explain the hallucinations is that certain parts of my brain start going to sleep before all the other systems shut down and I'm left in a weird consciousness limbo, and then my struggles waking up in the morning seem to be that I haven't metabolized the artificially introduced melatonin sufficiently and get stuck in sleep mode.  But I don't actually have any knowledge or background to know if my theory makes any sense, and I'd love to know what you think.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The melatonin cycle is not the part of sleep that is disturbed by narcolepsy. We have no real issue with the sleep itself only with the order and amount of time per phase.</p>
<p>I.e. Too much REM not enough deeper sleep phases</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't been diagnosed narcoleptic but when looking at the symptoms of narcolepsy I sense a certain familiarity with some of the minor aspects (so I always peek in on discussions like this one).  I was mainly referring to the way that melatonin supplements, specifically, DO greatly <em>disturb</em> my sleep phases and wanted a possible explanation for that from a chemical perspective.  I've never found anything in any research studies that seems to echo what I've experienced unless the melatonin was taken in conjunction with some other substance or medication.  Melatonin supplements by themselves don't generally cause the things that I described (namely the pronounced auditory, visual, and sensory hallucinations and &quot;sleep paralysis&quot;), but it happens nearly without fail when I take them.  There are other factors and conditions which trigger these things for me as well, but never as severely as when melatonin supplements are introduced.</p></div>		</li>
