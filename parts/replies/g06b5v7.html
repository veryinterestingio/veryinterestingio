			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no number for you, but it is not a receptor for every chemical. These receptors react to a group of molecules. For sugars for eyample you have glucose, fructose, lactose, maltose, and many more. You have sweeteners like aspartam or saccharin that all bind to the same receptors. Thats why they all taste sweet. It is not the whole moleculethat binds, but only certain groups within the molecule. The rest of the molecule can also influence the binding but the functional group is deciding if there is a bond or not. And yes there are molecules that have no taste at all. Water is tasteless. Oxygen has no smell or taste. Carbon dioxide neither. Ifa molecule is abundant around us, receptors would trigger our brain constantly. If a molecule is neither food nor danger, there is also no need to have receptors for it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When i'm drinking tap water, i'm not tasting the water, but only the minerals and whatever else is in it?</p></div>		</li>

<p>In the nose, for aroma (not taste) receptors, it works the other way too. Each smellable molecule binds to several different aroma receptors. Humans only have about 400 different aroma receptors, but can distinguish thousands of different aroma molecules. Each molecule produces a different <em>pattern</em> of receptors that it binds to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Other commenter explained receptors / binding differences pretty well, but I also wanted to add that there are genetic components as well! </p>
<p>This is particularly true for bitter receptors. I'd advise looking into &quot;super tasters&quot; in particular, if you're interested in the subject.</p>
<p>Long story short - there was never going to be one coherent number representing the number of receptors. And also, the interaction of these different receptors (and how much they're expressed) means they almost everyone will have a unique set of subjective tastes. (lots of overlap / similarity across people, obviously but still!).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i am a super taster, so was my mother. through repeated exposure i have actually learned to enjoy the bitter tastes of a lot of vegetables, anything kike canbage or broccoli, inused to not be able to tolerate, same with coffee  but there are somethings that a still very difficult for me to get through. overly salty food for one. salt has a metallic taste for me and too much and i just can't finish the meal. mcdonalds french fries come to mind, tho people seem to love them. i have abstained from dairy for quite some time because all of it tastes &quot;off&quot; or too sweet. papaya taste like vomit to me, and i can't let anything with it in it touch my tounge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also some other funky stuff. Well known genetic oddities are asparagus, which a part of the population can't properly taste and cilantro. which some people think tastes like soap. </p>
<p>Weirdest thing that i personally ever encountered is when i had a pepsi max, and i couldn't taste the sweetener in it. Didn't have it with other stuff like Coke Zero, which apparently has the same artificial sweetener, so i don't know whats up with that</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good response.</p>
<p>This is a little bit of a tangent and not strictly related to &quot;taste&quot;, but the texture of food also contributes to whether we like it or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not completely pertinent, but almost: I've been told (in an extremely eli5 way) that whenever we smell or taste something, every chemical detected lights up a little spot in the brain, forming a shape like a firework. Our brain &quot;takes a picture&quot; of said shape and stores it. When we taste something, the brain goes through the pictures to find one that matches, even roughly, that shape. That's how we can identify what we are tasting/smelling, even though a fresh unripe strawberry, strawberry jam and a strawberry flavored candy all taste quite different but we know it's &quot;strawberry&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sort of leaves a problem of why one strawberry in a batch can be sour, though, right? How do we still know it's the same food when it's &quot;off&quot;? And what happens when you've been out running, and you guzzle water and it tastes better than ever - what changed in this view?</p>
<p>I'm just gonna use this to segue into what I think a lot of people in this thread are ignoring (although rightfully so).</p>
<p>I remember the neurologist David Eagleman mentioning that when doing blind taste-tests of teas, if you present the same tea in two cups, but tell the person tasting it that one is a typical brand, and the other is an imaginary brand - which happens to have the same first letter as the person tasting it - you'll find that people more often than not report that they prefer the tea they share a first letter with.</p>
<p>There are loads of contextual clues which somehow affect how we interpret the taste that we ultimately experience. Price is also a classic which can affect how good we think something tastes. What about if you got creative with food coloring, do blue potatoes taste different? What about your perception of the cook, or the color of wrapper the candy comes in?</p>
<p>I couldn't possibly begin to dissect how and in what ways our mindset and experience affect taste, but I'm honestly not even sure we have an agreeable explanation because you're probably going to have to take a stance on qualia at some point.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, there is a purely afferent interpretation of the food, which is the triggering of receptors (and their corresponding neurons) not unlike how our eye has cones for different types of light. But just as the brain applies contextual experience to visual input - think Rorschach inkblots, or spotting shapes in clouds or seeing things in a dark wood - so our brain applies contextual clues back onto our food as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good comment indeed, plenty of interesting prompts for trippy conversations! I work in the wine business and can confirm how much psychology can influence your tasting experience, even for the most skilled tasters. Taste is a weird thing too, I am a professional but I'm definitely not a fan of sauvignon blanc so even though I know I must be impartial and evaluate other things than &quot;I like it&quot;, I always tend to give a higher score to sauvignon (compared to other people tasting the same wine) because I know I'm biased. </p>
<p>With the fireworks thing I was just trying to explain how your brain identify and records some distinct smells, not the concept of taste (as in the things you like or don't like). It's also true that your life experience will influence this a lot: I, being a country girl, had a really hard time trying to make a New Yorker smell tomato leaf in a wine, or barnyard (barnyard smell is a typical wine flaw). On the other hand, I realized how my idea of mango smell was totally different from the idea a Brazilian coworker had of it.</p></div>		</li>
