			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  You can improve your heart and your muscle efficiency, but the lung is not a muscle, and it doesn't improve with sports, yoga, qi gong, breath-holding, or any other sort of training</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Serious question. I smoked cigarettes and other substances for about a decade then quit, I later started cycling and progressed to the semi-pro level. I later began having exercise induced asthma, mainly in cold weather and that progressed into full time asthma. It is completely controlled with meds and I still cycle quite a bit. When I go in for lung tests, my lung capacity (not sure of the correct term) is 120% of normal and I've had several folks mention it and act surprised.</p>
<p>My question is, does that mean I had this lung capacity all along and it wasn't aided or expanded because of the exercise?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is definitely possible to improve lung function if you are running very hard nearly every day and eating well and you are still relatively young. I think what he is saying is once you have emphysema / COPD you are stuck with it no matter what. Smoking even 20 years isn't necessarily going to give you lung disease. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Incorrect. The lung is not a muscle.  Most of us are cardiac limited in our exercise. Doing sports will improve your delivery of oxygen by pumping more blood. Your lung function does not change with more training. Exercise improves cardiac function. There is no way to improve the mechanics of breathing for most people. Running and eating healthy will not improve lung mechanics.</p>
<p>Eating a carb-heavy will improve your respiratory quotient, meaning you produce less CO2, and that could have some effect on breathing. Athletes used to do this in the 80's, but no longer do this because the carb heavy diet doesn't really improve performance, just changes a number </p></div>		</li>
