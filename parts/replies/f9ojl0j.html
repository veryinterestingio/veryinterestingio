			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>Short answer</strong>: Because not all cells in the body are the same. Some cells die faster than other cells, even if they are the same type of cell. </p>
<p><em>(Some cells even have different DNA or different expression than the others! This concept is called mosaicism. Be aware that the most common mosaic differences are non-damaging and non-disease causing. Links and more info about types of mosaicism in the notes below.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Long answer</strong>: You don't exist in a perfectly controlled environment. Cells experience different levels of stress and damage, and so they die at different rates. </p>
<p>Not all cells are the same either. They don't all start out on the same footing with the same odds of survival. There are inherent and normally occuring differences in the DNA and epigenetics between cells of the same type in your body. You have a patchwork of cells with different DNA or epigenetic factors throughout your body. There is normally occuring random mutation and genetic shift in cells as you age, i.e. your cells, even in a perfect environment, don't always put their DNA back together correctly. Some cells also acquire variations in DNA and DNA expression from damage done to the cell. (These tend to be more chaotically spread through the body than development related genetic differences, affecting single cells instead of patchwork sections of cells.) So to add to it, some cells, through damage or natural variation, are inherently less hardy than others.</p>
<p>So, it's not random hairs going gray. In most cases, in an otherwise healthy individual, it's a bunch of little things that build up to cause any one cell to appear to randomly die faster than the others;  internal stress, such as malnutrition, illness, infectious disease; or external stress, such as sun, wear and tear, DNA damage; compounded with normally occuring random mutation, or normally occuring inherent variation that can amplify the risk of cell death. The effects of different stressors add up. </p>
<p>Single gray hair strands occur when more of the melanocytes die (and are not replaced by natural division/stem cells) at one hair follicle than at the surrounding ones. The result is one or two random gray hairs 10 years before the rest start to turn. IIRC, people who start with lighter hair shades are more prone to this because they start with less melanin production.</p>
<p>(Next paragraph copied from another of my replies and edited for here)</p>
<p>Anything that stresses one chunk of cells in a follicle more than the cells in the surrounding follicles can lead to the pigment cells dying faster and the hair growing gray or white from a spot sooner than the rest of the hair. It has to be something that causes the sensitive melanocytes to die but not kill off the hair producing cells in the follicle, so the hair grows gray or white, but doesn't fall out or stop growing all together.</p>
<p><strong>Notes and links on mosaicism</strong></p>
<p>On genetic and chromosome mosaic conditions; there are tons of them. Genetics is more complicated and less consistent than what you learned about in science class as a kid. It's really amazing!</p>
<p>Most organisms don't exist in a perfect binary, or in discreet catagories. There is natural variation between organisms within a species and even subspecies, populations, or individuals that blur the line between species, like mules (or a favorite of mine - narlugas). So this varience extends not just between individuals within a species, but between cells within an organism.</p>
<p>In a biological context, mosaicism is broad term. It refers to any time there are cells in the same individual that have different numbers or arrangements of chromosomes, or different expressions of those chromosomes within the same tissue type. </p>
<p>Mosaicism is more common that we ever new until genetic testing became more widely used. Many people have some form of mosaic anamoly from birth (or more accurately from conception) and live perfectly happy healthy lives. You've probably met several and couldn't tell. They probably don't even know, as long as it isn't causing health complications. It's only a disorder when it causes some fertility or other health complication. </p>
<p>At the beginning of this reply I'm referring to the commonly occuring DNA differences and accumulated mutations in the body, because I'm talking about things that can vary between cells and cause some to die before others. DNA damage, epigenetic factors, and non-damage related DNA differences can play a role in early cell death or better cell survival, some but not all of these are kinds of mosaicism.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01780-9" target="_blank">Nature article on dna mutation and mosaicism</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Medicine, as a field, tends to focus on mosaicism as it relates to disease. (Which makes sense, honestly, since medicine is about treating disease.) However, the most prevalent kinds of mosaicism are natural (read natural as commonly occuring) and are non-damaging and not disease causing. For example, cancer is a type of mosaicism, but so is the natural and healthy variation of color in hair and skin. You may have brown hair, but, when examined closely, not every hair is the exact same shade of brown. Again, falls within normal variation.</p>
<p>Another example, a kind of mosaicism that occurs in the majority of females (46xx) (i.e. approximately half the human population) is epigenetic mosaicism, so not a difference in DNA or mutations, but a difference in the mechanisms that determine which genes are more (or less) active.</p>

</ul>
<p>Back to a broader context of within species variation, there is genetic and developmental variation that creates a spectrum of human sexes. Some of these variations include sex chromosome mosaicism.</p>
<ul>
<li>Here's a basic introduction to the topic in a video: <a href="https://youtu.be/kT0HJkr1jj4" target="_blank">There are more than two human sexes</a> YouTube video by SciShow </li>
</ul>
<p>(By the way, SciShow is another resource for answering your random science questions. Slower than Reddit, perhaps, but much better curated.)</p>
<p>Mmk...  And with that, I think I'm done editing for a while. Let me know if there's anything I should expand on or doesn't make sense to you. I've read through it enough times it's blurring together, so I need to take a break.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Each hair on your body has a distinct terminal length. </p>
<p>Your eyebrow hairs grow only so long. Same for eyelashes. </p>
<p>The other hair on your body is the same: it stops at a certain length. </p>
<p>Each hair on your body has a lifecycle. It grows then rests then falls out then is replaced throughout your life. </p>
<p>Sometimes a stressful event occurs and is followed by an increase in hair loss, within a month or two. It doesn‚Äôt happen immediately. </p>
<p>A change in diet (malnutrition) can cause a change in hair growth and renewal. </p>
<p>During pregnancy, the mother‚Äôs hair pauses in its cycle. She experiences an increase in hair loss after delivery. </p>
<p>On your head, if you don‚Äôt cut your hair at all, which seems relatively uncommon these days but I have done for many years, you will observe that each hair grows to its terminal length then rests then falls out and is replaced. </p>
<p>Only so many cycles of original hair color are possible. It gets replaced with white hair if you live long enough. </p>
<p>Let‚Äôs assume all hair on your head grows at a similar rate. I ‚Äòm sure it doesn‚Äôt, precisely. </p>
<p>The hair on your head with the longest terminal length is furthest from your eyebrows. The hair with the shortest terminal length is closest to your eyebrows. </p>
<p>Hair with the shortest terminal length has followed the growth cycle many more times than the long-growing hair on the back of your head. It is replaced with white sooner than the longer hairs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Logically, if these melanocytes have the same life expectancy regardless of their position on the body, you would expect the hairs you've had the longest to go grey first, on average. Many people get hair on their temples coming in thicker earlier in baby/toddler ages, relative to the top of their heads. So it follows those hairs would be more likely to go grey first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hair on the top of your head is a different type than the hair on the sides. This is why when men go bald they still have hair on the sides of their head. Hair can go grey because of genetic faults, you body shuts down melanocytes if you have inherited genetic damage. This is why people like me go grey in their early 20s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not true. People with grey hair do not lack melanocytes. The true cause of grey hair was only discovered in 2016. The cause is a lack of the enzyme catalase which converts hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. When there isn't enough catalase - hydrogen peroxide builds up and bleaches the hair. This is the same mechanism which causes vitiligo of the skin.</p>
<p>Unpigmented hair is not white - it's yellowish. It is possible to reverse grey hair and vitiligo by applying a chemical compound called pseudocatalase to the skin and activating it with a narrow band uv light. This will restore hair colour permanently but you would have to shave your hair off to do it.</p>
<p>Still - it's a good solution for a greying beard since most men shave it off anyway.</p></div>		</li>
