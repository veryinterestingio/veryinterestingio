I feel that it is important to highlight the fact that they decided to call these noises &quot;Fast Repetitive Ticks&quot;, or FRTs for short.

<p>I don't know about &quot;we&quot;, but the article at the top stated:</p>
<p>&quot; In fact, the army had classified ventos that came from several animals (whales, seals, walruses); only that nobody expected the herring to be able to produce such sounds. &quot;</p>
<p>So, likely yes, somebody somewhere in the army has recordings of whale farts, paid for by US tax payers. Next time people in my area are upset about something or rather and protesting, I'll be the guy you see in the news with the sign that says &quot;Stop using my taxes to record whale farts&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not only do herring fart, they are communicating. with farts</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2003/11/farting-fish-keep-touch" target="_blank">https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2003/11/farting-fish-keep-touch</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To investigate herring sounds, two groups of researchers recently lowered microphones and cameras into schools of fish. Magnus Wahlberg, now at Aarhus University in Denmark, and colleagues listened after dark in the ocean. The team noticed that herring often release bubbles from their anuses when scared or during ascent or descent. They reported this curious finding earlier this year in Aquatic Living Resources.</p>
<p>To get an even closer look, Ben Wilson of Simon Frasier University in British Columbia, Canada, set up tanks in the lab. Wilson's group videotaped the fish and correlated the bubble blowing with the sounds they recorded, which they termed fast repetitive ticks (FRTs). Wilson's group found that the herring need to gulp air at the surface for continued FRTs; when the researchers blocked the herring's access to air, the fish FRTed for a little while then stopped. The team also noted that the herring made this particular noise just as darkness was falling, when they gather. This suggests that the FRTing has a social function, Wilson and colleagues report online 5 November in Biology Letters.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The article at the top said the 'farts' are produced from a 'swim bladder' not from digestion.  They didn't offer much detail but it sounds like it isn't actually a fart as we'd think of it but something used for communication.  Akin to children using the armpit 'fart' to communicate instead of just make each other laugh.  Impressive, but not flatulent.</p>
<p>Edit: I was looking at the second link (about the Russia conflict) not the first.  The first link said the gas does actually come through their rear and came from gulped air.  Although they said there was no detection of flatulence, air coming through your rear qualifies as a fart in my book.  I stand corrected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, if the air still comes from their anus I would consider it a fart.  A swim bladder just sounds like a great adaptation for controlling your farts</p></div>		</li>
