			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah... When it comes to basic machine elements, it is amazing how much knowledge there is behind them. They look so simple - a washer, a nut, a screw... But to get to the standard metric thread took a long while, there are countless other obscure thread designs, with different advantages and disadvantages, and the metric system just took the one which makes the most sense in most common applications. Imperial threads, for example, are a lot better self-sealing due to the different thread cut angle, and so they're used everywhere in the world for plumbing (and commonly also for hydraulics...). Then bearings, even plain bearings, springs... whatever. </p>
<p>The most simple things often took the most time to develop. To make something simple and efficient, most commonly takes a lot of complex and unreliable iterations at first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just learned more than I ever wanted about threading from a YouTube fella called ThisOldTony - it seems so &quot;duh&quot; until you realize that someone had to think that shit through for the first time. My grandpa was a machinist so the terminology and the sounds of machining are strangely familiar and comforting, but I never bothered to pick up on any of it as a kid. Now that I'm older I realize how much practical knowledge I missed.</p></div>		</li>
