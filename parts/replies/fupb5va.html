			<div class="markdown"><p>My mum caught on fire on her wedding day when her veil passed a candle. Her veil went up in flames, and she hilariously ran from my father's side and screamed for her dad.  On her way someone tackled an uncle who was about to throw some neat whisky over her to put it out. They put her out but her dress scorched on the shoulder and her shoulder blistered. She also lost a few locks of hair but says she was lucky that a hairdresser was attending as someone's +1 so fixed her up and she just got on with the day.</p>
<p>She had 8 younger siblings and they have a combined 30 children so we see a lot of weddings and the rule for everyone is that you can choose whether you want a veil OR candles, but you can't have both.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know why, but It reminds me of that clip from some kid’s cooking show where the girl can’t get a jar open so she runs over to her dad in the audience so he can open it for her.</p>
<p>Except y’know with much higher stakes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I managed to catch my hair on fire with a tealight on my church altar in high school, so my fiance and bridesmaids (2 of whom witnessed this) together banned candles from our wedding. Also our wedding was in the middle of the day so it wasn't even like we missed the candles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like look both ways was taught through community and things like Sesame Street then stop drop and roll was actual school curriculum. Stop drop and roll is also way catchier and more fun to say.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that is the point of why it is so big. It's super easy to teach. Most kids have fun with the lesson since you get to roll around a bit, and if it saves even one life it was a good move.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way they taught it in my school was to set up this elaborate fake room/house that smoke went through, and you had to properly escape. So yeah, it was a blast, especially considering the subject matter.</p></div>		</li>
