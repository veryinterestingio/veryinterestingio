			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not enough of an expert to comment much on this because I did my thesis on colon cancer, but I had to do a presentation in my grad school biochem class on oxidative stress.</p>
<p>I don't remember too much from it because this was years ago, but I do recall that the radical species generated by mitochondria are important metabolic signaling molecules in the cell. So contrary to popular belief, while oxidative stress (i.e. having too many radical oxygen species) is bad, few people realize that not having enough of them (known as &quot;reductive stress&quot;) is actually abnormal, unhealthy and bad too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, that's life for you- too much of something will kill you, and too little of it probably will as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another way to look at it is that “good” speaks more to the optimal balance of things rather than an amount of any one thing in particular, so too much or too little of any one thing is not good</p></div>		</li>
