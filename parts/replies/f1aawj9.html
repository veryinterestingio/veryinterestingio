			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. It surprises me that the current top answer right now is in part “trend. stupid.” While gluten-free diets <em>have</em> been more prominent in western culture, many who participate genuinely have an intolerance. It scares me to see so many people here being hostile toward it, and reminds me of a girl I went to school with who found herself in the hospital because her waiter passive aggressively passed off her dish as gluten-free.</p></div>		</li>
