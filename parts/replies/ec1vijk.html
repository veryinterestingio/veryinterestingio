			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of great questions here. There are &quot;normal&quot; ranges based on statistical definitions of height in the general population. For example, the growth charts made by the CDC can show you the 95% range of height for any age/sex. See <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/cdc_charts.htm" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/cdc_charts.htm</a> . That being said, you need to look at a child in the context of his/her family as well as the growth trajectory of the child. </p>
<p>I do have two favorite discoveries. One about growth and one about puberty. The growth one relates to the PAPPA2 gene - <a href="http://embomolmed.embopress.org/content/8/4/363.long" target="_blank">http://embomolmed.embopress.org/content/8/4/363.long</a> . This one was so meaningful for me since I really got to know the family and was able to provide them with an answer after they had seen many medical providers. It also opened up a very interesting area of biology - the regulation of IGF-1 bioavailability. </p>
<p>The puberty one was the discovery that mutations in the gene MKRN3 cause precocious puberty when the mutations are inherited from the father (this is an imprinted gene). We published this in the New England Journal and it was a totally new insight into the regulation of pubertal timing. Girls were beginning breast development even before age 6 years. <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1302160" target="_blank">https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1302160</a></p></div>		</li>
