			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why just re-reading notes or texts for a school exam is not really the best way to study. You need to activate other parts of your brain to help enforce context. </p>
<p>The way to avoid that is to give the words/phrases new context that forces your brain to use other bits, by either self-quizing, teaching someone else the material, or further research that connects your material to other subjects. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely! The memory palace technique uses special memory to assist in memorizing information. The more parts you enagage the better. Other memory techniques include using humor, the cruder the better, to make little stories about what you wanted to remember. There is a Ted talk about memory competitions. It‚Äôs quite interesting. To me anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have ADD, so not as bad, but I do find studying is easier if it involves active engagement. So my go-to tends to be discussions with classmates, and drilling with quizlet. </p>
<p>I also loved that my most recent class was organized into having us do homework, and then we were given 3 days after that homework was graded to make corrections for a higher grade. Learning based on the context of what I got wrong gave me a huge boost to absorbing the material. I wish homework had been like that during high school.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should happen to anyone to if they do it long enough. The science behind smoking weed and creativity touches on this same sort of functionality. The refractory period of the neurons is changed on marijuana which allows neurons to fire again sooner, and you get more creative due to the additional connectivity. Words losing meaning due to repetition, is doing the opposite, it's breaking down the connectivity due to overuse in this case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For people who experience brain damage in this receptive language processing part of the brain, it‚Äôs called ‚Äúreceptive aphasia‚Äù (or Wernicke‚Äôs Aphasia to be more technical).</p>
<p>Some or all of the words sound like some foreign string of sounds. Sometimes they also have damage in the expressive language centers as well and end up speaking what sounds like a made up language but have no idea that they‚Äôre saying things incorrectly. This is called ‚Äúglobal aphasia‚Äù and is very difficult to treat (I‚Äôm a speech-language pathologist who works with stroke survivors). As you can imagine, aphasia is very socially isolating. </p>
<p>Spread awareness about this language disability üíú If you know someone with aphasia, be patient when listening, pay attention to the communication context (not necessarily their exact words), and encourage them to keep going. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this and for the work you do.
My mom has PPA. She has lost her ability to speak but still tries and points at things. We communicate by writings. I have noticed her handwriting is not as clear. I chalk that up to being 70 yrs old.
It shocks me how quickly she seems to be going.
You are correct that Aphasia is very socially isolating. It has been sad to see that aspect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will definitely hold to this information!</p>
<p>However, I might add here, I do suffer with ADHD, and my thoughts can get very muddled up.
I also repeat a few words every now and then and when trying to explain to myself this thing happens. Which I have found an answer. But Of course i will spread information :)</p></div>		</li>
