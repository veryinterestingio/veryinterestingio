			<div class="markdown"><p>While I do not want to diminish how harmful 2 C of warming could be for many ecosystems (especially coral reefs), the Earth has been 2 C warmer many times before in Earth history. The challenge is the rate of change: Ecosystems and societies have adapted over the past thousands of years to something very close to the current climate. If 2 C of warming were to occur over one million years instead of less than a century, it would not be that big a deal. The problem is the rate we are changing to 2C; 2 C of warming if achieved over a very long time period is not that big a deal for the Earth system. - Ken</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My question is, let's say the earth does warm 2 C, however long that takes. It's not going to stop warming at that point, is it? Is it just going to continue to warm, or are there limits on how much temperatures will increase?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The limit, if any is, way above two-degrees. Burning of all fossil fuels gets us to double-digit warming. Even if we exhaust coal, oil, and natural gas, some genius will invent some gas or something that degenerates into a gas that traps heat, so we need to keep an eye out forever. But warming can be halted eventually, by achieving net zero emissions and waiting for the ocean and atmosphere to equilibrate, a decades-to-century process. If we figure out an affordable way to remove CO2 after it's emitted, then a few decades (or maybe less) afterward, temperatures begin to drop.  So in theory, we can stop the warming. - Michael</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Positive feedback loops are like that, yeah. If we stop carbon emissions at 2C, these feedback loops will carry us the rest of the way to total climate collapse without any external input.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This comment alone i think sums up most of the global warming misunderstandings. At least for me. Makes total sense, and now i see why both &quot;sides&quot; are not only &quot;right&quot; but also &quot;wrong&quot;.</p>
<p>Damn, it feels good to have an open mind!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That standing ecosystems contribute to mitigating climate change. They do not, as - if undisturbed - they are doing their “business as usual” on cycling carbon.  Climate change (the component involving ecosystems) is about lost or damaged ecosystems, and the solution rests in protecting and restoring them.  On a related note, the statement every politician or public speaker uses that “the ocean supplies the oxygen in every second breath we take, is wrong.  The oxygen we breathe is not coming from either forests or the ocean (which consume nearly as much oxygen and it produces), but is a legacy of distant past periods of excess photosynthesis.  In fact, the ocean is now releasing more oxygen than it did in the past, but - unfortunately - this is coming from it becoming warmer and being able to hold less oxygen in solution…  the consequence is slow, but disturbing ocean deoxygenation. - Carlos</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you elaborate on this point?  </p>
<p>> That standing ecosystems contribute to mitigating climate change.   </p>
<p>It feels to me (and I'm no expert, just a normal person) that a &quot;greenhouse&quot; effect would make the world greener, and have more plants, and plants like turning CO2 into O2 and plant matter. Actual Greenhouses, like the buildings called Greenhouses, they often operate in a CO2-rich internal atmosphere, to facilitate plant growth. It feels to me like the real answer might be more complicated than a reddit comment might be able to shine light on, but maybe there's a link or a reference to a thing that studies the various feedback loops of the carbon cycle. I've tried to find meta-papers on feedback loops, but so far I've only found papers on &quot;Feedback loop ______ is a negative feedback loop&quot;, and nothing on the net effect of all feedback loops on the carbon cycle. I agree that any feedback loop would constitute change though, so if the premise is that change is always bad, then presumably every feedback loop would be bad by definition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Decades ago, before we understood all the other implications, higher atmospheric CO2 was indeed seen as a positive for agriculture, which it is.</p>
<p><em>However</em>, higher CO2 concentration is the start, not the end, and the heat stress more than outweighs the positive contribution of the extra energy, slashing yields for crops.</p>
<p>If I understand your question, you are seeking clarification as to the role of existing ecosystems, and why they &quot;don't count&quot;.</p>
<p>The earth as a whole produces and then reabsorbs a <em>massive</em> amount of CO2 through the carbon cycle. Under normal conditions, each side of the equation is roughly balanced- around as much is generated as is then retaken back into the earth. For perspective, the total amount we humans emit is only a few percent of the <em>entire</em> carbon cycle- deniers love to intentionally misunderstand this point and then make clever graphs about it.</p>
<p>But, just like if I steer a ship ten feet off course at the start of a voyage, humanity's extra carbon added to the cycle is slowly building up, exacerbated by our active <em>destruction</em> of natural carbon sinks. We only have to add a few extra percentage points of CO2 to the cycle for everything to go haywire 50-100+ years down the line, and that's the exact timeline we are at.</p>
<p>So, basically, the entire idea of (for example) &quot;carbon offset projects&quot; that designate pre-existing forests as carbon sinks and then use them to offset polluting projects elsewhere, a la the UN's system? It's a total farce. That &quot;carbon sink project&quot; is <em>already</em> part of the cycle, and does nothing to actually offset the pollution elsewhere. The only way to <em>actually</em> &quot;offset&quot; carbon release would be to plant an entire new forest, and even that would only maintain status quo, <em>not</em> reduce emissions overall.</p>
<p>I have no idea why the UN gets away with this illogical system, but they do, and it's a perfect example of what the Reuters team was getting at (in fact I suspect that is <em>exactly</em> what they really meant). It's infuriating that the UN gets any credit for environmental measures when their flagship emissions control project is <em>literally</em> a smokescreen for polluters to get paid for doing nothing more than what they were already going to do, and does not actually reduce environmental harm, even slightly.</p></div>		</li>
