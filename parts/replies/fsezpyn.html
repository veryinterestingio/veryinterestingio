			<div class="markdown"><p>It will most likely fuck up your joints by putting extra strain on them. Please don't. Wrist and ankle weight are for very specific training and recovering from some injuries, they shouldn't be used unless under the supervision of some healthcare professional or coach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can seriously fuck your joints because the weight isn't safely distributed. If you're wanting to add weight to improve exercise you're better getting a weighted vest, which will include your calorie burn by a small amount during cardio.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to mention, don’t run with weights. If you’re going to do weighted cardio, you want to be walking if you’re going to do weighted cardio as the extra weight causes a much larger increase in impact on your joints and soft tissue when running.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aside from increasing wear and tear on your joints, a problem with weights is that they can throw off the overall weight distribution, so you will move differently. Just think of putting weights on your hands to practice boxing for an extreme example.</p>
<p>For certain exercises (dips or pull-ups, for example) it does make sense though. But for jogging, I'm not sure it's worth it or that it makes to use weights during endurance training. Your form will likely suffer and how much will you benefit from carrying 10 pounds?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember back in my late 20's I lost about 80lbs.  Went from obese to just barely overweight according to my BMI.   I did this through diet and by walking, eventually jogging, and riding a bicycle.</p>
<p>Basically I was training my muscles to throw around my heavier self while simultaneous reducing the weight of that self.</p>
<p>I was never a very fast runner, but I remember being able to bound up a flight of stairs skipping 3 or 4 steps at a time like it was nothing.  I had incredible endurance as well from all the jogging as a fat guy.  It took a lot to get me winded.  I was in way better shape than anyone I knew who was just naturally at the size I got down to.</p>
<p>But I think its right to say that any extra muscle you have while over weight just goes towards moving that extra weight around.  You'd have to lose the fat to have an advantage and then you'd need to continue to exercise with extra weight or else your body is going to not keep the extra muscle if its not needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or exercise more. If your exercise time and modality stays constant, you will lose strength. I'm big and have lost 40+ lbs since February. I started with a 2 mile walk at an ok pace (approx 21, 22 minutes a mile). Now I do 5 a few days a week at a brisk pace (17 minute miles). If I don't get  three miles in a day, I feel bad physically. I am working my way to running. I dislike jogging as that pace doesn't fit me. Either walk or run. I can run about a 1/4 mile now. I guess interval training is the next step. Long story short, I want to keep as much of my 350+ strength when I get down to 250.</p></div>		</li>
