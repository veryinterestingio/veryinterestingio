			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern credit cards don't have a magnetic strip anymore. Nowadays magnetic strips are mostly found in cheap mass products intended for single use, like a ticket in a parking garage. The magnetic strip doesn't offer the same security or amount of functions a chip does. You're correct, a magnetic strip can be erased by a strong enough field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But even in my ATM card and credit card that have chips, there is also a strip as well. Drivers license too. Aren’t those affected by strong magnets?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, but shouldn't be a problem in a machine that can read the chip. The older pull through terminals won't be able to read the strip, though. If you want to be on the safe side, keep them away from magnets.</p>
<p>Thinking of it, Apple may have thought about this and shielded the inside of the card holder against the field of the magnet. I don't know how the magnetic system works exactly, I've only seen the quick presentation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, from my experience I can say that the old terminals with a slot to pull the magnetic strip through are way more common in the US than Europe or Asia. I assume this is because the US was among the first countries with widespread credit card use, so a lot of places have older systems and phasing the strip out will take a lot of time. In contrast to that, most terminals in Europe are now able to process contactless payments, because the technology came pretty much at the same time as widespread use of cashless payments and credit cards.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We only got chip cards a couple years ago, and every card still had the mag swipe as a backup because chip readers still aren't guaranteed everywhere yet.</p>
<p>We live in the 80s, at best.</p></div>		</li>
