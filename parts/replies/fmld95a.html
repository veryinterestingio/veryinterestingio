What is important is that the message is consistent and clear.

<p>This is why consistent talking points are so effective in politics. When every source is using the exact same phrasing, the message has a strong ring of truth no matter how untrue it may be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We know that travelers will take their cues to travel based on a variety of &quot;sources&quot; -the most trusted source varies by different segments of the population. Therefore, the consistency of the message is critical so that people have the best information to make their decisions. This information that is communicated should be based in science and supported by empirical evidence. When the messages are inconsistent, behaviors will be varied.</p></div>		</li>
