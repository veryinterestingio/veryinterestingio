			<div class="markdown"><p>When you say changed into “heat” is there some actual friction or are we just saying due to entropy it becomes progressively more disorganized so that at some point you can’t tell the difference between the original sound pressure wave and random Brownian motion, other than the fact that the net energy of the system went up ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be the heat from the friction the waves make in the material. However the specifics work, it's at least the energy of the sound waves getting transferred to and absorbed by whatever it's moving through. It would follow the first law of thermodynamics with all of the energy from the sound waves being transferred to the medium it's effecting. The umbrella term for how the energy is transferred would be &quot;thermodynamic work&quot; done by the waves as it effects its environment as it moves matter in some way</p></div>		</li>
