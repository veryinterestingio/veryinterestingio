<p>Imaginary progress bars are used when the thing you're doing takes a while but there's no way to see how far along it is. Used often in things like web apps when a request is made to a remote server. All you can do is wait for the reply, so web apps like to put in progress bars that simply count down a fixed number. Usually replaced by spinners.</p>
<p>Coarse progress bars are much more common. These are progress bars that are actually based on a metric of progress, it's just a bad metric. File transfer on Windows is a good example. If you transfer a large directory with a large variety of files from one drive to another, what you'll usually see is that the progress bar moves very quickly and then very slowly across different parts of the transfer. In old versions of windows the time estimation would also be hilariously fickle. This is simply because different file sizes behave differently when copied (1GB of lots of small files is muuuch slower than 1GB of a single file). Correcting for this behaviour is difficult.</p>
<p>Perfect progress bars do exist though. If you transfer bytes through a low-level tool like <code>dd</code> on Linux/UNIX, then you'll get the exact progress because every byte transfer is atomic and when 100% is reached, then that's the end of the operation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's depends on what they're basing the completion on.</p>
<p>If it's based on actions or sets of files downloaded, then it's arbitrary. If it's based upon the known size of the total download then it's pretty accurate when they're basing it on how many GB are downloaded to total GB.</p></div>		</li>
