			<div class="markdown"><p>I do that to trigger the sneeze when I can't quite make it happen.  It's an awful feeling when it starts and doesn't complete.<br />
Works with light bulbs too. Is that the same thing or can you make yourself sneeze without the need to just by looking at the sun?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me, when I first step outside it's practically inevitable. The sudden change in brightness causes the tingle and I will sneeze 3 or 4 times. Then I'm fine until I go back inside for a while, usually 15 to 20 minutes is enough to reset it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Without fail, i will sneeze 2 or 3 times the first time I go outside and it’s sunny out.</p>
<p>I had no idea this was a thing. Guess I’m part of that 25%.</p></div>		</li>
