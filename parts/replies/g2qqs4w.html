			<div class="markdown"><p>to add upon this, it is because on an objective scale, our everyday reality is a lot closer to absolute 0, than it is the hottest possible temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, I couldn't think how to word that well, but this is why our &quot;perceived&quot; scale is skewed to absolute zero.</p>
<p>To the universe, another scale would make more sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The universe would be even more skewed towards absolute zero, but we happen to be really close to a star. The average temperature across the universe is around 2.7 K or -270 C or -454 F.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Turns out the scale doesn't matter much. Unless you care about precise numbers, whether you use celsius, fahrenheit, or Kelvin, once you start getting to astronomical (literally) values like the temperature of a star, they're all basically the same. Fahrenheit is a bigger number but it will usually have the same number of digits which is kind of the dominating factor at that scale.</p>
<p>Physicists just say Kelvin makes the most sense and use that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the real reason. Few things even exist close to the top temperature range. A scale that was mote balanced across the whole range wouod have us recording unweildy daily temperatures of like -987,000,000,003 or 0.057x10-^-11 that just aren't easy to reason about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the real real reason, while obviously related, is that we came about a temperature system for temps we encounter first, and then discovered the universal scales after. The Celsius scale cared about the freezing and boiling points of water, so we have 0 and 100. Nobody who came up with that was thinking 'well this is going to be awkward when we teach people about the temperatures of outlier universal events..' as if they had any clue at all about how hot the Big Bang my have gotten or that we actually lived, relatively, extremely close to the coldest temps it is physically possible to get to on a universal scale.</p></div>		</li>
