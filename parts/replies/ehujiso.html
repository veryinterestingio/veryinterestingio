			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes well, I know sugar is large enough molecule a transport protein is required to permit the cell membrane to be passed. I just don't know botany well enough to say plants world invest in their root structures to be able to absorb this resource. I can see a tissue sample of plants having no issue with absorbing sugar since this would normally be provided by the xylem tissue on the internal structure of the plant. The question still remains do root cells have sugar transport proteins on their external structure. If they do not, sugar cannot be obtained from the environment, only traded internally after being created in the leaves.</p></div>		</li>
