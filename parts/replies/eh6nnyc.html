			<div class="markdown"><p>If its mobile, you would probably want to include the mobile development platform code, in which your 100 lines of codes now use 100's of thousands of lines of code just to create an empty app and have it repaint itself and transition between being active and deactivated if the user switches control between processes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When counting lines of code, you usually don't include the lines of code written by others. Your code will always be built on top of something others write, it's just a question of how much third party code you can use and how much you have to write by yourself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly boilerplate. Even a very simple game still needs an event loop, a way of handling player input, a way of drawing to the screen, and so on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to write anything in less than a few hundred lines of code. You have to think of every conceivable thing that a program must do and provide handling for that. </p>
<p>You want to be able to count scores? That requires keeping track of what the score is, where the score counter is, which font it uses, which color it uses, and so on. </p>
<p>You want the user to click with his mouse? That requires checking if the mouse button has been pressed, but not double pressed and not right clicked, within each tile, but not if the tile is already occupied by the opponents piece and not if you're in the menu or the it's the opponents turn.</p>
<p>All of the logic house keeping requires code to handle what's happening and make sure it can only happen if every requirement is filled. That takes up a lot of code.</p></div>		</li>
