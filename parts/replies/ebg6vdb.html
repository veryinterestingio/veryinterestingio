<p>Thank you for the chuckle there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. That's incredible. Thank you for taking the time to explain this. I'm a lay-person, but basically the take-home message I get is that TREE(3) is so unfathomably large that despite Graham's already ungodly magnitude, it would still be insufficient to use it for any attempt at notating it. </p>
<p>I laughed when you called Graham's number a &quot;small&quot; number in your last sentence, but that pretty much drove the point home. Thank you again! </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, the idea is that with infinitely many natural numbers each bigger than the last, terms like &quot;small&quot; and &quot;large&quot; are necessarily relative. By &quot;large&quot;, we might mean anything from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has a lot of digits (a googol, a googolplex)</li>
<li>Can't be conveniently expressed using base 10 notation together with familiar operations like +, *, and \^ (Graham's number, outputs of the Ackermann function for nontrivial inputs)</li>
<li>Can't be conveniently expressed using base 10 notation together with familiar operations like +, *, and \^ and also a bunch of recursion (lengths of Goodstein sequences and Kirby-Paris hydra games for nontrivial starting values)</li>
<li>Derives from a sequence so fast-growing it requires a significant amount of higher-order logic or set theory to even prove the terms of the sequence are finite (values of the TREE and SCG sequences at nontrivial indices)</li>
<li>Derives from a sequence so fast-growing that it outpaces any sequence an algorithm can produce, even with unlimited computational resources (pretty much any number related to &quot;busy beavers&quot; and similar phenomena)</li>
</ul>
<p>...but each of these categories is in a completely different class of largeness than the previous ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a general pattern of these functions. Sure, if you have something like the up-arrow notation, you can make numbers larger by using the large number as argument for the same process. That gives you something massively larger than the first step. But usually this is a tiny step compared to the difference between different fast growing functions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite contribution to Reddit ever was a long post in an AskReddit &quot;cool math fact&quot; thread about Graham's number. It got a lot of reaction and I had lots of fun in the comments. Starting around then, I went down the rabbit hole of learning about TREE(3) and BIGFOOT and SCG(3) and Meameameawokkalooha-Oompa (I swear I didn't make that up, and it's bigger than SCG(SCG(3)) and even Utter Oblivion (would be current largest number ever named, by infinities of orders beyond all the others, if mathematicians could agree it was well-defined). I saw lots of references to the Fast-Growing Hierarchy, but never really learned how it works.</p>
<p>So, thanks for adding something new to a subject I got super ridiculously interested in. I loved sharing what I knew, and now I love reading you share another step even further. I can't always convince people math is fun, but even though I don't have the same math background you apparently do, wrapping my head around stuff like this is so incredible. </p></div>		</li>
