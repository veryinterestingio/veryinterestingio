			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that in the modern world (every paper I and my friends have submitted over the past few decades) you give the publisher a <strong>non-exclusive</strong> copyright. You still retain copyright as an author, you just give the publisher the rights to distribute and charge. Everyone I know in CS still puts their papers on their websites.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a mix of things. It's really more about the particular journal I think, and whether it's open access or by subscription. OA journals tend to let the author keep copyright, in return the author licenses to the journal rights of publication among others. Subscription based tends more toward the journal retaining copyright, and the author asking for license when wanting to reproduce it, add it to an edited monograph or what have you.  </p>
<p>Of course this is all general, you may find journals that do not conform to this at all or have some blend not covered. We've had people ask for access to articles published here, and the answer has always depended on the specific journal or publication as to whether we contact the author or the board that runs the journal. We've even had cases where the author has called us to expressly give permission for someone to get a copy of an article, and we couldn't facilitate it because the author did not have the ability to do so. Copyright is as clear as mud, as they say.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am speaking from the writing and “arts” side—but I think they are similar:  </p>
<p>When I worked for an NBA sponsored event, the NBA owned the rights to sell and distribute the images.  I retained the copyright—but really all I can do is use the images in my portfolio and “give them away” to my friends.  But I was paid to produce the product—and that was in exchange for the images.  </p>
<p>Copyright and publishing rights are similar, but different things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, in life sciences, it is often still required you give the journal full copyright. However, we are obliged to 'self archive' from our institute, which basically means that we can distribute our manuscripts for free ourselves for non-commercial purposes, which is basically uploading the manuscripts to a publicly accessible and searchable university server. This is often in disagreement with the journal guidelines, but the university is having a legal team on your side in case they make trouble. Even more, there is a law in the jurisdiction where I live that authors are always allowed to do that, regardless of what they 'sign away' to publishers. As this is your right, you can not sign it away, and this clause of the contract is not enforceable. This is often the case with this kind of one-way contracts, where you have no negotiation over the terms and only get to accept them, very hard to enforce, but enforcement comes at a legal cost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also more complicated (and journal-dependent) than that.</p>
<p>You give non-exclusive rights to the text of the work, but there's a separate copyright component surrounding the typesetting and formatting.  So it's pretty common that you can do whatever you want with preprints, but the final copy by the publisher you <em>don't</em> have rights to post.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but I think a lot of times those are pre-publication versions of the papers, in order to skirt the copyright issue somewhat. Of course it depends on the paper and journal, but a lot of subscription based ones would blow their lids were the content not gated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Copyright length can extend well beyond 90 years, so it depends on when this journal picked it up and from whom (original author, estate?). If the author got this published in 1932, and the journal had the copyright extended 28 years later in 1960, then this would fall under the Extension Act for pre-1978 works giving it 95 years. This seems likely for a publisher/copyright clearance center, so the end result would be 1932+95 years, and this will be valid until 2027. There are a lot of things 90+ years old that are still covered under copyright because of the 1978 thing.  </p>
<p>If you're asking how someone could grab a paper from 90 years ago that was out of copyright, or the author was dead, then suddenly copyright it themselves that's a different question. And I don't know how in the world it would happen like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's a bit complicated though.</p>
<p>Peer review and curation is still really important. There are too many papers in a given subfield for researchers to keep track of and still do their own research.</p>
<p>The journals provide peer review mechanisms (to make sure the work is correct) and curation (to ensure the research is important). They aren't perfect at these jobs but it's better than nothing</p>
<p>It makes it much easier to figure out what new papers to read when you see where they are published. If the old journal system dies out, we will still need something to provide these services. Maybe like a reddit upvote thing lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's still a scam though.  You often pay to get a paper published, then journal you as a researcher in the field to do peer reviews on other papers for free, then charges your university to access the papers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could start with governmental nudging:  Require that any paper published as the product of research funded in whole or in part by government funds be released for free public consumption after a 'reasonable' period of time, say, 60 months.</p>
<p>Tying this requirement into the funding contract would negate the ability of others to permanently lock it away behind an expensive paywall.  The government would have funded it in the first place in the name of 'public good', hence the public should be able to eventually access to fruits of the investment freely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not going to, there is a reason it is like this. There are hundreds of research articles for every one spot in, for example, <em>Science</em> or <em>Nature</em>.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of research to publish, which means there is a huge job on the side of publication and review to ensure that only high quality research gets published.</p>
<p>The reason why people want to publish in these journals is because they are extremely well respected. If they tried to sell their article themselves, nobody would buy it, and it will get very few citations and reads if it is posted on a preprint server without being published by a journal.</p></div>		</li>
