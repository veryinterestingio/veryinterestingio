			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm guessing you're meaning what causes the high tide on the side of the Earth that's away from the Moon?  (Spring tides are where the Sun and Moon are aligned, and is part of the monthly cycle.)</p>
<p>It's a bit tricky to get your head round.  So, Earth's gravity pulls the water down, causing it to be a smooth bubble.  But the Earth is spinning.  This causes a centrifugal effect that means the water wants to lift up a bit.  The side facing the Moon gets a boost, and can lift up more.  The side away from the Moon feels less of a tidal force, which means there's less pull towards the Moon, and the water there is free to move away from the Moon, which causes the high tide on the opposite side of the Earth.</p>
<p>Does that help?</p>
<p>Edit: this might help</p>
