Healthcare for example is very much a professional field where in many contexts nobody is going to consider glycerin to be an alcohol, even though it is in a chemical sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;moisturize&quot; in skin products means to add oil to the skin. &quot;dry skin&quot; refers to lack of oil in skin, not lack of water. so adding oil to the skin makes it &quot;moisturized&quot; and less &quot;dry&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this isn't correct. one of the functions of your epidermis is to protect from water loss (and other important nutrients, moisturizing factors, etc.). you can measure hydration with something called a corneometer. patients with eczema literally lose water (higher rates of transepidermal water loss aka TEWL) at higher rates than those without eczema due to a defect in their skin barrier, amongst other things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to assume that you're referring specifically to off the shelf hand/body lotions that claim to moisturise your skin. If your skin is already in good condition, it's probably not doing too much. Frankly, your best bet at figuring out if your lotion is doing anything is to do a patch test and evaluate if it's making a difference (or if you want to be really thorough, let someone else who has no idea where the lotion was applied do the evaluation).</p></div>		</li>
