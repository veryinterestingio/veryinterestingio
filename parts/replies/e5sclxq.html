			<div class="markdown"><p>At the Houston Museum of Natural Science butterfly center there is a huge, three pane display section where they have dozens of species of butterflies hatching. There are easily a hundred in there at any given time and they hatch all day. I used to love going in and watching kids marvel at a butterfly fighting out of its chrysalis, then take a huge, gross dump right before their eyes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the mechanism of complete metamorphosis (larva - pupa - adult) is thought to have evolved only once, so all complete-metamorphic insects (flies, bees, ants, butterflies &amp; moths, beetles, fleas, and some minor groups) inherited it from that one common ancestor. Therefore, the developmental process is roughly similar among these groups, including the imaginal discs.</p></div>		</li>
