			<div class="markdown"><p>I love using this information when playing dnd. I have a big vinyl mat, with</p>
<ul>
<li>dry erase markers for very temporary stuff, like fireballs and minion Hp.</li>
<li>Dungeons get drawn with wet-erase markers, so that they remain intact when I roll the map up, but it's still really easy to dip my finger in water and reveal secret doors etc.</li>
<li>More permanent stuff, like layout lines for the initiative tracker, get drawn with a sharpie, so they don't get erased when the dungeon is finished and I wash the map, but if I need to make changes, I still have isopropanol to remove the sharpie.</li>
<li>I have a red 'industrial' sharpie that doesn't erase with isopropanol. This must be the polymer thing you were talking about. Luckily I didn't discover this on the battlemat!</li>
</ul>
<p>edit: people are asking questions, so here's approximately what I use</p>

<p>Double edit: thanks to all who posted the trick of tracing permanent markers with erasable ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might find that acetone (nail polish remover) can remove the red sharpie ink.</p>
<p>My brother once used a permanent marker by accident on a board game dry erase board that my sister owned. When they realized what happened and started getting quite upset with each other, I just went to the bathroom, grabbed the nail polish remover and a cotton ball, and proceeded to erase the permanent marker (and get the dry erase looking brand new).</p>
<p>Acetone can also remove permanent marker from clothing (to various degrees), but be EXCEEDINGLY careful because acetone can also remove or stain the dye in clothing. Definitely don't use it on jeans.</p>
<p>Acetone is very good at dissolving various materials because it has both strong ionic and organic components. The double bonded oxygen creates a strong dipole for dissolving ionic compounds like water-soluble inks. The propyl base is very good at dissolving organic compounds, like non-water-soluble inks.</p></div>		</li>

I used to play with my uncle when I was like 12.. But its been over 30 years... I'd really appreciate anything you can tell us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There should be a simplified rule book included within the starter set! If the rules seem overwhelming, remember that the amount of complexity is entirely up to the Dungeon Master, so streamline the rules for easier play with kids! <a href="https://youtu.be/C80hC0Rrq1s" target="_blank">Here</a> is a resource that should help you do just that!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Game stores sometimes have friendly groups. The nerd behind the counter is usually very knowledgeable about what groups and when they meet. Please go with your kid though, in case it turns out not so friendly.</p>
<p>Otherwise... read the DMG and start imagining scenarios, and when you're bursting at the seams with stuff you want to try, start playing some of it out. There's not really any &quot;wrong&quot; way to run a game, so just do whatever seems fun to you. There are lots of mistakes you can make, but it's NBD: the important thing is that your group is having fun and telling a story.</p>
<p>Also, there are other systems. GURPS is my favorite because sometimes I like to be a cyberdragon, casting spells out the airlock of my spaceship.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was in the same boat. I played 1st edition when i was 13, then recently got back into it. The current version 5th edition aka &quot;5e&quot; is focused less on killing things + get loot and more on storytelling and role-playing but there is still plenty of combat.</p>
<p>There is a fantastic YouTuber Matt Colville who created an excellent series of videos called &quot;Running the Game&quot;. You don't need to watch the entire 98 videos, just the first few. He's so entertaining and fun you might just keep watching. He is focused on how to run a game as a dungeon master:  <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlUk42GiU2guNzWBzxn7hs8MaV7ELLCP_" target="_blank">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlUk42GiU2guNzWBzxn7hs8MaV7ELLCP_</a></p>
<p>If you want a good video where someone shows you the rules through some gameplay, watch this one: <a href="https://youtu.be/jT3FRzEJDp8" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/jT3FRzEJDp8</a></p>
<p>Lost Mine of Phandelver is a great intro adventure, and lots of YouTube videos that give advice on running it.</p>
<p>If it will only be you and your child, you might want to recruit a few more people if possible, like dad or a cousin. A party of 3-4 players + DM ( dungeon master) is ideal but 2 players can work, just need to adjust the encounters so they are easier.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p></div>		</li>
