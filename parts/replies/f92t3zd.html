			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the advertisement itself that's the problem in this case. The problem is that YouTube collects user data and tracks user behavior to display ads targeted to specific demographics. YouTube was knowingly collecting data of children without parental consent and using that data for commercial gain (i.e. sell targetted ads to advertisers), which is what COPPA prohibits. After YouTube's recent changes, content creators are required to mark if their videos are &quot;not for kids&quot;, which tells YouTube it's okay to use data of users watching that video for targeted ads, or &quot;for kids&quot;, which tells YouTube not to use targeted ads.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you meant it the other way around in your last sentence right? </p>
<p>So under this now, cant videos that are marked for kids, just have adverts that are child friendly? The same as it is on TV? Without collecting data other than that a video being marked for kids?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I meant the other way around. I should've had my morning coffee first before writing...
Though something to note: YouTube ads are all &quot;child friendly&quot; (i.e. you should never find an explicit ad on YouTube), the &quot;for kids&quot; setting just tells the service not to use user data to decide what ads to display.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not different as far as the intent of the law. What tv stations can advertise to children is also regulated.</p>
<p>The gathering of information to create a browsing, location, search, purchase, and social network consumer profile also does not happen with cable television viewing. </p>
<p>This is also more complex as there was no clear way to designate youtube videos which were for children. Also the systems in place were both automatic for the information gathering and ineffective at keeping children away from the site. IE a box that says im over 13 isn't enough. </p>
<p>Ethically or morally, that's a personal decision if it's different to you or not.</p></div>		</li>
