			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, I never knew you could transmit the flu without showing symptoms. This past year was the first time in a while i got very sick from the flu. I used to get the vaccine but I got lazy and stopped getting it. Thanks for sharing this! I'll be more prepared next flu season to get the vaccine!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really good to know this, I’ve never had the flu in my life, but I’m more so certain at this point that I’ve had it many times but never known. My entire family has had it many many times since I’ve been alive but I’ve still not once had any symptoms of it my entire life as far as I’ve been aware and I’ve always wondered why</p></div>		</li>
