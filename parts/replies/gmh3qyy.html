			<div class="markdown"><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson and Novavax both have shown to be greater than 50% effective against mild to moderate disease with the variant first seen in South Africa. Thatâ€™s still high enough to be effective at slowing the spread and should in no way deter people from taking them.</p>
<p>Also to my knowledge there has been relatively little reduction in efficacy with any vaccine in regards to the variant first seen in Britain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also interesting how even if there was an intent, the intent of a virus would be the opposite of what most people think. An intelligent virus wouldn't be the one that kills people. That's destroying the place it lives. A successful virus is the one that can live in its host without doing too much damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moderna too, and the others currently approved are still effective just seemingly less than against other strains. but even that statement VERY preliminary and more investigation needs to be done.</p></div>		</li>
