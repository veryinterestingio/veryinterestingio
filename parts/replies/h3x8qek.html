			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, absolutely. As far as I (dimly) recall, people have mapped some prehistoric hunter gatherer societies as switching seasonally between bases close to the sea (for salt) and bases more inland (for hunting). You can really imagine how, over time, the hunters came to notice that salt not only nourished them but helped preserve their meat. And preserved food = less effort spent hunting fresh = more ability to remain settled and more time to spend on other pursuits = civilisation.</p>
<p>ETA: preserving food possibly explains the rise of spices too. Spiced preserved food tastes better than non-spiced food, so spices become desirable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add spice can make food taste better not only by adding interest, but covering up questionable flavours. Gamey? A bit too fishy? Past it freshness but still edible? Throw some acid and heat and you can’t detect that shit! I can imagine this helps for lots of communities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And if you leave salted to stuff to itself, fermentation will occur. one outcome is the lactic acid tangyness of sauerkraut or kimchi. I can highly recommend books on the anthropology around  food, fermentation is as much an indicator of civilization as cave paintings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  It's why we put salt blocks out for cows to lick.  And they sell those little rolls of salt to put in rabbit cages.  And though it's illegal to do, some put out a salt block in an area where they want to hunt deer in order to attract them in.  Nature craves it.</p>
<p>Edit:  I also remember something about buffalo, when they roamed the prairies, had salt licks that they would go to.  Basically areas that had a heavy salt content in the soil, so they would go and lick it, making crater like holes in the prairie.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Salt also become one of the most used methods of conserving food. Instead of ice or water, salt become one way of keeping food longer in case of shortages of food. During the Middle Ages or a bit later, it was known as the white gold. Given its practical needs, and if you had a lot of salt you were extremely wealthy because there was always a need, and scarcity of the material.</p></div>		</li>
