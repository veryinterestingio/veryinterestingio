<p>The brushed universal motors and simple gearboxes most power tool uses (grinders, drills, saws...) are very noisy, but very powerful for the size and weight.</p>
<p>Cars use induction motors (like the ones on household fans) or brushless DC motors (like the ones on computer fans) that are quiet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really true. Modern cars use 3-phase AC motors. Induction motors are very common but a lot of OEMs use Permanent Magnet motors as well. </p>
<p>I don’t know of any OEMs using DC motors.</p>
<p>Straight cut gears make a HUUUUGE difference. </p>
<p>Another point, nobody really cares if their drill is loud, but there’s plenty of people who wouldn’t buy an EV if it’s loud. So I think part of it is design. I’d rather have a cheap and loud drill than an expensive and quiet drill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>3 phase motors are much quieter than single phase or DC motors (with brushless motors as an exception, sort of).  </p>
<p>With three phase, the motor consumes constant power, the torque is the same no matter what the angle of the rotor is. In other designs, there is different power as the rotor turns, which gives you a sine-wave pulsing that naturally leads to vibration and sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't really tell apart modern AC and DC motors since they both run on switched DC. Permanent magnets does make a difference however.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>For anyone that's driven or ridden in a car that makes that speed-dependent whirring noise when backing up, that's a straight-cut gear. If you want to hear what that sounds like in all your forward gears, look for in-car footage from professional rally cars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Still uses straight cut gears in addition to vibration, lack of sound insulation, and a crappy metal fan that moves a lot of air through many small openings. All making noise.</p>
<p>If you dissembled it and just ran the motor without the gearbox I bet it would be pretty quiet.</p>
<p>Ever hear a honda back up and it whines? Those I believe are <a href="https://jalopnik.com/this-is-why-your-car-makes-that-weird-whining-sound-in-1793174286" target="_blank">straight cut gears, </a>and in forward they use helical or DNA shaped gears which are quieter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn’t exactly true. Old EV’s used DC motors but 3-phase AC motors are currently dominating the industry. 3-phase is much more expensive but is MUCH more power efficient.</p></div>		</li>
