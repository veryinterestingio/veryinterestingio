			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm trying to figure that out too, so the following are my guesses, predicated potentially on incorrect assumptions.</p>
<p>Might be that what we're seeing in the center is like the core of the sun where the fusion is happening the fastest, while the halo is the radiative or convection zones where fusion is happening at a much lower rate?</p>
<p>I don't think scattering would make any sense, since the neutrinos wouldn't interact with anything between their creation and reaching the detector...</p>
<p>It could be simply that the sensor isn't very precise with knowing exactly where the neutrinos are coming from, so the actual source is one big circle with no deviation, but the detector is introducing error...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the detector. There are reactions that only work with one type. Examples:</p>
<p>neutron+neutrino -&gt; proton+electron doesn't work with an antineutrino.</p>
<p>proton+antineutrino -&gt; neutron+positron doesn't work with a neutrino.</p>
<p>electron+antineutrino -&gt; muon/tau + antineutrino doesn't work as easily with a neutrino - this reaction needs a high neutrino energy, it's not available for reactor and solar neutrinos.</p>
<p>Combine some specific reactions with more general reactions and you can measure the different components separately.</p></div>		</li>
