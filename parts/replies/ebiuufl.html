			<div class="markdown"><p>I am one of those scientists with a healthy dose of skepticism for anything other than Carbon based life. In fact, I'm so sure I have no problem making the anonymous Reddit comment saying that &quot;only Carbon based life is possible&quot;. Would I make a comment like that in a professional capacity... Probably not. I'd end up saying something like non-Carbon based life is extremely difficult and therefore unlikely, but then I'd qualify things with something like your post.</p></div>		</li>
