			<div class="markdown"><p>And salt (sodium chloride) is transparent to IR light, so when you're doing IR spectroscopy, you put your sample in between salt plates. A good chunk of analytical chemistry is just taking advantage of how light on every part of the spectrum interacts with matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You won't get sunburned through the window, but you will still get skin damage from it. UVB rays, which cause burns, is blocked my most glass. UVA, which causes skin damage (wrinkles, cancer), passes right through glass. Long-term drivers tend to get more skin conditions on their left sides. If you're expecting to take a long road trip, put the sunscreen on even before the drive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The actual matter inside an atom i.e. the nuclear and the electrons, occupy a tiny tiny space within the atom. Photons are even tinier comparably.</p>
<p>Most of matter is just vacuum, so it makes sense that light can pass through it. If anything, it's stranger that things are solid and visible!</p>
<p>Those can be explained with e.g. electric interactions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, UV light can be further broken down into frequencies of UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C. <a href="https://hps.org/publicinformation/ate/q12082.html" target="_blank">Windows will block nearly 100% of UV-B and UV-C light</a>. The higher the frequency of light the harder time it has penetrating objects, and <a href="https://www.digikey.com/-/media/Images/Article%20Library/TechZone%20Articles/2017/July/Ultraviolet%20Radiation%20Attributes%20and%20Benefits/article-2017july-ultraviolet-radiation-fig1.jpg?ts=b76e4e6c-519f-45ce-a190-ffd45c8dc431&amp;la=en-US" target="_blank">UV-B and UV-C are higher frequency than UV-A</a> which is why they're blocked by windows.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although an X-ray machine is actually distinct from a camera right? Because it doesn't &quot;see&quot; <em>reflected</em> light, but rather it &quot;sees&quot; the light that <em>passes through</em> the object, by having the sensor and the emitter on opposite sides of the object.</p></div>		</li>
