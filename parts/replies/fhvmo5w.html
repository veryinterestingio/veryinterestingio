			<div class="markdown"><p>We didn't evolve with social ability in mind. Being social simply works better for survival then not being social. Evolution is like an electrical current, it always finds the easiest way and apparently cry is the easiest, most proper way of displaying sadness. Why do we express sadness? To let everyone else know that something is wrong and we are in danger of not being able to reproduce or live (... or something else). We tell others to help us; we tell them to help us, because they do. Our race all work together in order to stay alive for as long as it is possible. Believe it or not - it is not a life premise. Life forms which did not intend to preserve their lives died. Inherently we have to want to live in order to live. That's why we cry. It's all like electricity. The easiest way towards the destination.</p></div>		</li>
