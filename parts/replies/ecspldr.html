<p>I'm a bloke, and I've been using Dove soap and a very old shaving brush for more than two decades every day - it works wonders.</p>
<p>I shave in the shower - when I wash my hair, I shampoo my stubble, rinse, apply Dove, brush, shave - with my equally venerable twin blade razor (or the single, if I'm out of blades), and the stubble just disappears, no need for aftershave or any other stuff, my skin is fine.</p>
<p>I normally put some e45 on as moisturizer, but that's optional.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll have to try it then. I was sceptical at first wince my skin doesn't react well to shaving. (Luckily I don't have a lot of growth yet so only need to shave once per 2 weeks)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have sensitive skin, you may want to spend a bit of extra effort and learn to use a brush and shaving soap. There's a bowl of sensitive skin shaving soap from Proraso that's ~$10 that will last a year or more, since you only need a smidgeon at a time. Always shave after a hot shower or make sure to warm your face with a hot water-soaked facecloth first.</p>
<p>And if you have very sensitive skin, you may want to use a birthday to ask for a whole assortment of shaving items: Pre-shave oil, an alum block, sensitive skin aftershave, specific facial soap, and possibly even a double-edged safety razor. </p>
<p>Do some research (folks have linked some good subreddits, and there's lots of info out there) and learn how to take care of yourself the right way, right away. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this there is a massive difference between aftershave and aftershave Balm. Most aftershaves will dry out the skin due to the alcohol so you want to apply them a bit after shaving. The balm however goes in immediately after you wash off. Hit water wash. Cold water wash to close the pores. Balm. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>honestly the Proraso stuff sets my skin off worse than anything else! Biggest difference I had was going from a crappy (and expensive) Gillette mach fusion power turbo thrust excel 5000 (or whatever the fuck their marketing was calling their latest plastic money maker) to using a doubled edged razor.</p>
<p>I grabbed a Muhle r89 razor body and haven't looked back. Currently using it with Astra blades (got a 100 pack for Aus$15) and Trumper's Sandalwood Shaving Cream (which was A$39 for 200g) and I'm set for a while. Usually takes me the best part of a year to work through a whole lot of the shaving cream so while it's not the cheapest option I don't mind spending a bit more for the quality. Brush wise I've been happy using the Muhle 33K 257 I initially got and that's basically my shave setup for the past 7 years now barring some experimenting with soaps/creams and blades. My face has never been happier now it's not getting assaulted on a daily occurrence by a cartridge razor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a little girl, she's 10 and wanted to shave. She too had little growth and only shave once every week or two like you. I bought her an electric shaver on Amazon, it was $17, I also own one. It has fantastic reviews and can be used with or without water. I use mine a lot. It's not as close as a razor, but very convenient and $17 isn't bad for something that lasts for a year or more. </p>
<p>It's pink and white and you'll see it there, let me know if you want more info or can't find it, I can PM you the link :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I'd like you to PM that electric shaver. P.S. shaving at 10? Did I miss something or do young girls do start shaving at that age?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use the dollarshaveclub.com razors that are ordered online. </p>
<p>They are not plastic. The razor heads are disposable, the handle reusable metal. I don't shave every 3 days with it, I have an electric razor also that I use much more often. I throw away one blade a month or so, using it 3 times or more in that month. </p></div>		</li>
