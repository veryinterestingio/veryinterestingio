			<div class="markdown"><p>don't want to worry you but my mate had that - and epilespy. It would be worse after boozing all night... back then he had his car licence and would only drive with someone, in case he blacked out while driving...</p>
<p>Although another guy I know did that - and I don't think he has epilepsy - he would utterly stop......then resume just he'd been paused.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up absence seizures. My brother had it as a kid and it was exactly like what your friends described. You wouldn’t know from personal experience if you have it - my brother never had any idea that he had “blanked out”.  It’s usually easily treatable but needs to be treated in case you “blank out” during certain activities like driving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who learned that I probably had ADHD by doing an online test, I respectfully disagree. They ask very similar questions and are scored in similar ways, they’re fast and they’re free. Of course you’re going to need to follow up with a doctor, but it’s a perfectly good place to start.</p></div>		</li>
