			<div class="markdown"><p>I also think that celiac disease is diagnosed more. While people who have severe symptoms will die before adulthood if untreated, many with less ever symptoms will live normal-ish lives until later.</p>
<p>A lot of people in my family were diagnosed with Celiac's in their 50s, when I was a kid it was a long time before any doctor had even thought to test me for celiac disease. In fact an ancestor of mine even reported to have died of a disease with similar symptoms to Celiac's.</p>
<p>So I think that there is broader awareness leading to more people getting diagnosed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think you mean &quot;selectively bred&quot;, not &quot;genetically modified&quot;. Those are two very different things. There is no GM wheat approved for sale.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't make any sense. While larger kernels would mean more yield per plant, the amount of wheat used in bread wouldn't increase. Having a gallon vs quart of milk doesn't mean you'll use more per recipe. </p>
<p>Nutritionists can be a bit of a dodgy bunch. There are good ones, but also lots who believe in pseudoscience.</p>
<p>Edit: There is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3573730/" target="_blank">no evidence</a> that gluten <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/08/200811120112.htm" target="_blank">content has increased</a> due to selective breeding.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you want someone who has done more than print out a certificate you need a dietitian. That title actually requires certification and registration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But I think the idea is that the wheat used would be more or less glutenous, no? So the same amount of gluten in a slice of bread would change. Not saying you are wrong or right re nutritionists but just not the claim per your milk analogy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a perfect example of the difference between a nutritionist (completely unofficial term) vs a dietician (went to university, has a degree).</p>
<p>I'm saying this AS A NUTRITIONIST, because well why not? Anyone can be one, you dont need any credentials.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand the point you’re making, anyone can be a self proclaimed nutritionist. But also this person had a masters in some sort of clinical nutrition field, years of experience, and charged £100 an hour as a result. </p>
<p>I assume she didn’t have the exact requirements to be a dietician like you say though</p></div>		</li>
