<p>As an employee of a large biotech, I do appreciate the FDA's role completely. I know for many, it's an 'unnecessary burden', but their requirements aren't to make things difficult; rather it is for the sake of the patient. Yes, the process is intense, the information submitted to the FDA is huge and the burden is large. But this ensures that patients are safe and harm is rare or at least completely understood and characterized.</p>
<p>Vaccines are another level since they are by definition given to healthy people. Contrast this to a oncology drug that is given to a pancreatic cancer patient who has a single digit percent chance of surviving. The risk-benefit ratio is definitely different and is part of the conversation with the FDA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, vaccines are also injectables - which requires a high standard due to the risk, compared to solid oral dosage for example. Validation is preformed on the equipment, the process and the environment, in addition to QC and QA roles. Having worked in vaccine production for clinical trial material, it's very rigerous, far beyond what most people imagine.</p>
<p>For example every critical temp. storage unit was calibrated, goes through an installation qualification, operational qualification, and PQ - which includes temp mapped (as well as open door and power failure studies) prior to use, in addition to being continually monitered.  You don't just get a freezer and plug it in.</p></div>		</li>
