			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes sugars that out gut can't absorb (e.g. sugar alcohols like xylitol and others that are sometimes used as sugar-free substitutes) get fermented by gut bacteria instead, so excess consumption leads to lots of bacterial activity which produces lots of gas/liquid and promotes motility. So if you are thinking of that it's unrelated to toxicity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kidneys have a certain capacity to absorb glucose. When that capacity is exceeded, glucose starts ending up in urine. There are drugs for diabetics that target kidneys to make them expel more glucose. I wouldn't call it a defense mechanism. The kidneys can be damaged over time if sugars remain high.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Normal kidneys leak sugar easily out through the glomeruli, but SGLT2 sucks it back into the bloodstream. </p>
<p>Drugs that inhibit SGLT2 came on the US market in 2013-2014.</p>
<p>They reduce blood glucose by eliminating it through the urine, making it very sweet.</p>
<p>Kidney damage doesn't result directly from high sugar. The sugar causes poor circulation, poor circulation stimulates VEGF telling vessels to grow more branches. New branches are fragile, they break and bleed, causing microscopic scarring and loss of function. That's what happens in the retina, too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's evidently normal for those groups to lose the ability to digest lactose as they grow up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that one of the main causes of lactose intolerance is not consuming lactose, once you've gone some period of time without it, your body stops producing the enzymes that break down the lactose sugar. And apparently your body can't just start making this enzyme again, which sucks. A lot of cultures don't consume the milk of other animals, so lose the ability to break down lactose not long after breastfeeding finishes.</p></div>		</li>
