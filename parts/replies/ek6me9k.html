<p>From my understanding, this is the truly complicated/unexplained area. Even with a pool full of amino acids, the random formation of the simplest protein is absurdly low. I'm not talking about &quot;once in a billion years&quot; low, I mean effectively impossible. 1:10^61 if I remember correctly. Have they answered any portion of this particular step?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Take this with a HUGE lump of salt, because microbiology and biochemistry are not my areas of expertise. </p>
<p>I believe the probability was tied to the chirality issue of amino acids. For a protein to form randomly, it needs specific chiralities of specific amino acids to bond in an extremely long chain. Getting that sequence exactly right for even a simple protein is the probability trick. </p></div>		</li>

<p>ok.  I have no idea where that number comes from, but let's run with it.</p>
<p>The approximate volume of water in the world is around 10\^45 atoms.  That might be a reasonable approximation for early earth mass of space where this reaction could take place. Let's divide it by uhh 10,000 for fun.  We have 10\^41.  Cool.</p>
<p>Assuming those atoms are reacting with each other maybe 1000 times per second.  How many reactions would it take to get to 10\^61 with 10\^41 atoms?  Well, I think we'll just need 10\^20 reactions, or 10\^17 seconds.</p>
<p>That's about 1000 million years.</p>
<p>Yep, that sounds about right.  I think that's about what it took.  I suspect the numbers are a wild speculation that could be off by multiple orders of magnitude, but that still puts it in the realm of possibility.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a gross simplification. </p>
<ol>
<li>We are not talking about ANY atom reacting with any other atom. We are talking about amino acids bonding with one another in exactly the right sequence so as not to collapse or be torn apart, and instead form a protein. </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>

<p>Not sure where this estimate came from, but again it doesn't address the actual probability question on the table, which asks about the reactions between amino acids. </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>No. For so many reasons. As stated before, proteins are not a result of just one particular sequence of atoms. And even if they were, you can't just subtract the numbers to get the amount of time required. That's like saying if I want to guarantee a coin flip of &quot;heads&quot;, all I need to do is flip a coin twice, and I have it guaranteed. Proteins are even more complicated, because even if the protein is 90% built, then an opposite chirality amino acid is introduced, it ruins the whole thing. You have to start over. </p>
<p>So it's not just a simple mix-and-match probability problem. It's much more complex. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While the Miller-Urey experiment showed protein generation was possible from the <em>assumed</em> &quot;chemical soup&quot;, there <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis#Current_models" target="_blank">is no single, generally accepted model for the origin of life</a>.</p>
<p>A couple of questions are posed by the Miller-Urey experiment:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do we know, beyond assumptions, what our planet was like when it first formed?</li>
<li>Can we show, again without assumption, that the chemicals used in the Miller-Urey experiment were the right chemicals and in the right proportion? This question is probably answerable, but not being a scientist, I don't know. The initial method I would use is to drill ice cores and sample those, but that has its limits.</li>

<li>We do know. After the planet formation and after Great Bombardment Era we've ended up with element abundances in rocks, soil and ocean water that roughly remained the same till this day.</li>
<li>Chemicals used in Miller-Urey were a tiny sample of much bigger and richer set of elements and compunds that Mother Nature had at her disposal not in a tiny lab but on a planetary scale. </li>
<li>Ice cores are too young. It doesn't matter anyway. See points 1 and 2.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding point 1, another major event that could have altered the abundances was the Moon forming collision with Thea, however it happened long before 3.8 billion years ago mark when life formed and were the said abundances were already settled. Also, Thea was made of roughly the same stuff as Earth, as Moon rock samples show.</p></div>		</li>
