Or is wikipedia just full of shit on this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Read the full article on <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feldj%C3%A4gerkorps" target="_blank">Feldjägerkorps</a> (side note, German Wikipedia says that their history is amongst the least researched (&quot;am schlechtesten aufgearbeiteten&quot;, not sure how to translate that) parts of WW2 Germany, fitting as they don’t even have an article on them :D)</p>
<p>Essentially they seem to have been a close-to-the-front military police. IIRC this is not where the crimes against humanity normally happened. They hunted (and often executed) deserters and punished disobedience.</p>
<p>It’s been a while since my history lessons, so take this with a chuck of salt, but IIRC most crimes against humanity (especially things having directly to do with the gassing of jews) committed in general were on a voluntary basis as the leadership knew that not everyone would easily be able to do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know too much about the scope of the Nuremberg trials - wether it was just the leadership or if or went further down the ranks. The point I'm arguing <del>I'd</del> the following - If disobedience was harshly punished, then wouldn't any soldiers who didn't follow orders and choose to face the cruel consequences be filtered <del>or</del> out very early? And it definitely makes sense not to staff the kz's and such with newly conscripted, unreliable men.</p>
<p>I'm actually torn on the issue myself. If a soldier at a konzentrationslager refuses to kill, but this means being relocated to a fighting unit at the front, can it not be argued as self-preservation? And if they do go fight at the frontlines furthering the nazis cause, does that not mean they are indirectly causing the war crimes at the kz's to continue?
By that logic (just my thoughts, not trying to strawman you here), any action but passive or active resistance would make any german during ww2 a war criminal. And from today's view we can say &quot;Eh, probably could have made it through a few years of hard labor camp, at least you'd be one of the good ones when the allies come through&quot;. But what if nazi germany hadn't been defeated? What if it had carved out a huge portion of europe and persisted for decades? Can you imagine facing the kind life that you earned for yourself and your family by resisting?</p>
<p>Are you familiar with the <a href="https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Scholl" target="_blank">Scholl siblings</a>?</p>
<p>They were heroes, but they paid the price.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;The Feldjägerkorps had the authority in the field to officers or enlisted men for any breach of military discipline, order or duty.&quot;</p>
<p>I just find it curious that any of these would be swiftly dealt with, but if a soldier refused to take part in the execution of Jews or other &quot;undesirables&quot; there'd be no consequences.</p>
<p>&quot;Nein Herr Hauptmann, I don't feel like it today.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No worries Hans, go take 5 then.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not going to pretend that I'm an expert on the German WWII Werhmacht, so you're better of posting on /r/askhistorians but it seems that not partipating in the killing of Jews wasn't seen as a serious 'crime'. The page you link to are unit for prisoners, people who had deserted or commited muders and other serious crimes I persume. It doesn't look like not participating in war crimes was enough to get you sent to one of these unit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;However anyone who refused to join the Bewährungstruppe (English: probation troop) would stay in prison without rights to parole or be sent to a concentration camp.</p>
<p>A third of the 28,000 troops that joined the division were political prisoners from Baumholder and Heuberg.&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, according to the article there were a lot of criminals in these, but the threat to deserters or ideological dissidents seemed to be quite real.</p>
<p>Personally, I find it strange how under a regime that's widely acknowledged to be one of the most brutal and inhumane in recorded history, refusing to participate wouldn't have consequences.</p>
<p>Schrödingers nazis : Literally monsters! Except when some of their countrymen didn't take part in total war - they wouldn't have punished them or anything.</p></div>		</li>
