			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but OP is drawing a parallel to <em>other</em> items. </p>
<p>Like if it’s a hot summer day, and you roll out a thin plastic “slip ‘n slide”. If you run and jump on it, there will be a lot of friction, and you will likely hurt yourself on it. But if you add water to it, suddenly you don’t stick to it at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s because water only likes sticking to things that are polar. Something like plastic is non-polar and water doesn’t like it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh?  I doubt it has anything to do with polarity.  It has to do with smoothness of the surface causing less or more friction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense, but then can you explain why you’re more likely to slip on a tile floor if it’s wet? Is it because tile is non-polar vs. socks which are polar?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In that case it’s probably more about the shoes than the tile. Whatever kind of shoes you’re wearing, they’re probably designed to not like to get wet (rubber or oil polished). Tile is just a smooth, non-porous surface that will hold water ready to trip you up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand why so many people are under the impression that only polar molecules like sticking to things in liquid form.  All liquids share common properties that are inherent in the liquid state of matter, like surface tension and liquid molecules &quot;sticking&quot; to each other.  If they didn't do this, then they wouldn't be a liquid, they would disperse into a gas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect that you could coat your foot in oil and pull a sock on pretty easily, so it’s something about water that is not a universal property of liquid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do not share that same suspicion.  The sock will want to stick to your foot the same way it does with water.  It is possible that it will be easier than with water, but it will still be more difficult than if it were dry.</p></div>		</li>
