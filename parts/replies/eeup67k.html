			<div class="markdown"><p>That's surprising.  Normally it's required that those euthanized animals be appropriately stored until they can be taken out for cremation.  No telling what impact feeding them to the snake would have on the snake...could have been really harmful or had some other unintended side-effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's surprising, because usually there are very specific ways the animals are required to be euthanized after research.  Typically they do cervical dislocation for rodents.  Feeding them to a snake would normally violate the protocols of the research.  </p></div>		</li>
