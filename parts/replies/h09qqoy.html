			<div class="markdown"><p>well free reign is only flat out wrong in that, as an idiom, it has no connection to reality the way free rein does.</p>
<p>by that i mean horse riders really would and do talk about giving the horse free rein.</p>
<p>nobody ever talked about giving a monarch or whatever &quot;free reign&quot; over a kingdom. like, free from whom? who is granting the &quot;free reign&quot;? it just doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>if someone wants to get pedantic and say it's a &quot;real idiom&quot; because people really use it and other people really understand it, i'll grant that, but it has no real connection to another realm of experience as many metaphorical idioms do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>“Eggcorn” is also an interesting eggcorn that I’ve never seen before. In fact your comment just made me learn something new! This is from Wiki in case like me, someone doesn’t know what eggcorn means. “ an eggcorn is an idiosyncratic substitution of a word or phrase for a word or words that sound similar or identical in the speaker's dialect” AND “The term eggcorn, as used to refer to this kind of substitution, was coined by professor of linguistics Geoffrey Pullum in September 2003 in response to an article by Mark Liberman on the website Language Log, a group blog for linguists.[2] Liberman discussed the case of a woman who substitutes the phrase egg corn for the word acorn, and he argued that the precise phenomenon lacked a name. Pullum suggested using eggcorn itself as a label.[3]”</p></div>		</li>

<p>But they spend alot of money on those ads with no direct or immediate results. How can they measure thier expected profits from those ads so that they can plan the ad making process - and it's expenses - accordingly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard in a meeting once that. 1-3% rate of contacts from the ad campaign resulting in purchases a fraction of those times was the expectation. Completely random numbers below, just illustrating a point.</p>
<p>Pay $100 to reach 10,000 people. If 1% purchase something that's 100 purchases or $1 each. If 1% of them become a big customer or tell a friend, suddenly your numbers are even better. Most products you're seeing advertised aren't operating with a $1 profit margin they're selling something at $50 that cost them $30 to make and send to you. If that 30/50 scenario was the actual margin, they could sell 5 items for their 10,000 contacts in advertising and they still broke even.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>most ad campaigns don’t break even, especially when you account for all the costs. Trick is, they make the brand more recognizable, which affects long-term growth. So while you lose money at promoting that product, you earn money by having more long-term customers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked in an ad agency for 10 years, although not on the media buying side that would handle all this. But I can tell you a ton of banner ads these days are &quot;added value&quot; for larger media buys, basically meaning throw ins for a large media spend.</p>
<p>Now that's not to say clients don't spend tons of money on banner ads, and there is a certain value they bring as others have mentioned. And certain banner ads perform better than others - there's all sorts of metrics you can look up if you're really curious. But yeah a lot of time the little bullshit ads you see on sites are probably throw ins or cheap buys.</p></div>		</li>
