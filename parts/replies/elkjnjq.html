			<div class="markdown"><p>The part about the vaginal tissue is actually not entirely true. In medical school we were taught by child abuse specialists that there is quite often no visible damage to the vaginal mucosa on exam. It is not only quite elastic and therefore unlikely to tear, but heals extremely quickly so that any damage can't be seen by the naked eye. </p>
<p>Of course, there may be damage in some cases, but just to point out that it's not usually a reliable piece of evidence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding was that most child abuse doesnt require forceful restraint most of the time.  The abuser is most likely someone the child knows and believes they need to listen to them, so the signs of struggle wouldn't be there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was my thought as I read the post you're responding to. Arousal and the sexual response, for men and women alike, aren't voluntary. They're a physical response.</p>
<p>Both men and women can involuntarily become aroused (e.g. become erect or lubricated) and experience orgasm during sexual assault/abuse. I've read that up to half of female victims experience some form of arousal or orgasm.</p>
<p>It's deeply humiliating and multiplies the trauma of the experience. Abusers/assailants who observe it can use it to manipulate victims and add psychological abuse on top of the physical/sexual abuse they're already causing -- they might insult the victim, belittle them, tell them they're enjoying what's happening, and threaten to tell others. Victims, in turn, can feel dirty, betrayed by their bodies, and humiliated by the thought that, at some level, what happened caused them to experience physical pleasure.</p>
<p>This is especially traumatic for girls and women. Males are already accustomed to the idea that our sexual response is purely physical. Girls/women aren't. There's a broadly accepted, and incorrect, belief that female arousal isn't (just) physical. Thus, when a girl/woman becomes aroused or experiences orgasm, it's assumed that she wanted or enjoyed it. It's pretty much a certainty that women underreport this -- meaning lots of victims are carrying around, in addition to the physical and psychological harm of what they experienced, a completely undeserved burden of secret, hidden shame.</p>
<p>Again: arousal and the sexual response, for men and women alike, aren't voluntary. They're a physical response.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My lady friend went to the dentist for an appointment, and while the hygienist was cleaning her teeth, she said, &quot;I want to get the Dr. to look at something.&quot;  The dentist came in an looked in ladyfriend's mouth and said, &quot;Ladyfriend, you seem to have some bruising on the back of your throat.&quot;  Ladyfriend said she turned beet red and said, &quot;I must have hit it with my toothbrush.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, but your first point does not stand to make the distinction whether the sexual act was forced or under consent. Women’s bodies can very well react physically to rape or sexual assault, despite the mental trauma it causes. It also does not work the other way around: consenting women can often not respond physically to sexual acts. Physical arousal is not related to providing consent.</p>
<p>To be candidly cautious that this is not misinterpreted, this definitely does <em>not</em> mean that women who respond physically to sexual assault are enjoying it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, all true, and important points. But generally there are sufficient signs of bruising and tearing that that is sufficient to indicate assault. It’s true some women will continue with sex despite painful tearing and bruising, but most will ask to stop. When they’re found in such condition and also found murdered, it’s a safe bet there was sexual assault.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the intent of the comments were to state that  the tearing or other injuries indicate a potential for the determination of assault. Tearing plus ligature marks to the wrists, plus clothing rebuttoned improperly, as well as internal semen, could lead the doctor to suggest the sexual assault took place.</p></div>		</li>
