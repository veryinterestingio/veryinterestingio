			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think so. I play bass and find a click track annoying. I'm frequently busy listening out for cues from other musicians to change sections. It can be a guitar lick, a change in pattern on the high-hat, or just a drum fill at the end of a section.</p>
<p>Yea, you can say, &quot;Just count!&quot; but that's not always the case when you're jamming or playing through a solo-section that doesn't have a predetermined length.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no such rule, In fact a lot of rock is better without click track and letting the mood take you to the right pace. Click tracks have their place but saying they are &quot;as it should be&quot;, means your world is very, very small and consists of only few genres ;) Jazz is another where click tracks absolutely take away some of the message: the tempo changes that happens organically is part of the whole cake, it is not a mistake that needs fixing.   </p>
<p>Or would you say that all vocals need autotune or that all guitars need to have loads of distortion? We use whatever tools we must to get our message out. Click track is just another tool. And as a musician, you HAVE TO learn how to play without it anyway, one day you won't have it and you still have o keep tempo. Good news is that clicktrack can help with that but everything requires practice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, I think there is definitely room for some looseness in tempo from time to time and from genre to genre.  In the studio?  Yeah, there should almost always be a click track.  But live?  I don't think everyone needs an in-ear click.  If you're practiced, you'll be fine.  And sometimes letting the song have a bit of a say in how its played from night to night is good and can be fun (and can change the way you hear the song and play it in the future).  Can also depend on the crowd and how &quot;into&quot; it they are, maybe you wanna play a song faster than normal or slower, or fiddle around with the tempo in the bridge or something.  </p>
<p>But just my two cents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can control different channels. When I play bass I usually turn everyone off in my ears or have everyone very quiet and I max out my click and track. If I’m singing then I’ll turn myself up and other singers up a bit so I can hear better. Having a click in your ears is definitely helpful for live music.</p></div>		</li>
