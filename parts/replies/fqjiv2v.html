			<div class="markdown"><p>Although a comet can move very fast at perhelion, at 1 AU it is moving slower than the solar escape speed at 1 AU. If it was going faster, it wouldn't be in a closed orbit around the Sun.</p>
<p>Despite usually being called &quot;escape velocity&quot;, direction doesn't matter. If an object exceeds escape speed <em>in any direction</em>, then provided it doesn't hit something it will escape. Even if it goes closer to the Sun first it'll whip round and escape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. For non-circular orbits, objects move slower at greater altitudes and faster at lower ones. Rather than a constant velocity one would see from a circular orbit, these objects have a variable velocity dependent upon their position in orbit. </p>
<p>The <strong>average</strong> velocity across their orbit is roughly the orbital velocity of an object if it were in a circular orbit at about the average distance between the object and the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>just a ticky tacky point for someone curious,</p>
<p>velocity is a vector, it has direction and magnitude</p>
<p>speed is a scalar, it has magnitude</p>
<p>something traveling in a circle from a centripetal force is changing velocity, and has an acceleration. The speed remains the same, but direction changes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the hint. I never knew this extinction existed in English and didn't expect it, because it doesn't in German. It turns out you do use some words that we don't. Although we could of course just create it by throwing the words for velocity and absolute value into one new word, but it's not commonly used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there was one circular orbit around an object, could two objects share that orbit, one in front of the other, and have different orbital velocities? If were to send two satellites into the exact same orbit one hour apart, could they ever bump into each other?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the shape and height of your Orbit is a direct result of your velocity at your current location. If one of those objects was going faster than the other, its Orbit would have another shape, too. If their Orbits are the exact same, their velocity at any given point in the Orbit will be the same too.</p></div>		</li>
