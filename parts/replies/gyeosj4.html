<p>This is why people like 2 strokes on bikes, light and powerful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2 stroke oil is mixed with the fuel. 4 stroke is placed within a reservoir (sump). Also how you can tell a 2 stroke from a 4 stroke. A 4 stroke has a dipstick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it does. They're different.</p>
<p>2 stroke oil burns more easily. 4 stroke doesn't.</p>
<p>Adding 2 stroke oil to the gas on a 4 stroke could potentially plug up your O2 sensors.</p>
<p>Adding 4 stroke oil to your gas on a 2 stroke could also plug up your spark plugs faster.</p>
<p>I wouldn't put 2 stroke oil in the crankcase of a 4 stroke, either. 4 stroke oil provides better lubrication.</p>
<p>That said, it might be fine for a bit in a lawn mower but I wouldn't do it on the regular. On a high performance engine I think you'd be asking for trouble.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the idea would be less strokes the better as there’s less wasted energy. Every time the 2-stroke piston moves down its producing power, while on a 4-stroke every second ‘push’ is wasted.</p>
<p>In reality, there’s not enough time to clear all the exhaust gasses out of the cylinder and re-fill it with fresh air. Where the 2 stroke gains on number of pushes, it loses out where the 4-stroke gains a good fresh charge of clean air every power stroke and has a much better quality ‘push’.</p>
<p>The worlds most efficient engines are 2-stroke diesels though, but they’re like 3 stories tall and run at 70-90rpm instead of the 5000-6000 that your car can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's wrong to say that less strokes is less wasted energy - all the same processes are happening in 2 strokes and 4 strokes, it's just that 2 strokes use the bottom of the piston <em>and</em> the top to get it done in less time. Same goes for</p>

<p>4 strokes have the same issue - most engines typically get at most 75%. Why big cams is a common mod for more power is it helps increase this number (typically also resulting in worse fuel efficiency, by the way).</p>
<p>Regarding the big 2- stroke diesels; It's really size that makes them so efficient - and they don't work like 2-stroke petrol engines anyway. </p>
<p>2-stroke petrols also need to run richer and typically have less compression than 4 strokes, so are inherently less efficient.</p>
<p>The compression ratio of an engine is the limiting factor in efficiency.</p></div>		</li>

<p>wow! Is that like a really massive ship engine or something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A 2 stroke engine is, by far, less complicated than a 4 stroke.</p>
<p>If the goal were to make it easier to find a problem in the engine, then all we would use would be 2 stroke engines.</p>
<p>2 strokes are less fuel efficient than 4 strokes, produce less torque than 4 strokes, and don't scale well.</p>
<p>Great for a chainsaw, terrible for a car.</p></div>		</li>
