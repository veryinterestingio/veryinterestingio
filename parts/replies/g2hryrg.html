			<div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s the same concept. Whenever couple 2 rail cars you connect the air brake hose and open the angle cock which allows air to flow through to the next car. If this line is broken the air is dumped and brakes engaged</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's right. And if anyone reading wonders, each car has its own individual brakes, and they each have brakes because a train weighs an intercourseton, so braking is a concerted effort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of but not exactly.  Primary brakes in a train work only on air pressure with a tank on each car.  The locomotive supplies some pressure amount, say 100 psi, and every car fills up to that.  If they want to apply the brakes they drop the pressure, say to 80 psi, and the tank on each car vents that 20 psi to equalize, but vents it in to the cars brake cylinders.  When the pressure begins to increase significantly, the entire 20 psi is vented to atmosphere and the tank recharges over time, but I'd you suddenly need to brake again and you only hit 90 psi, you'd now have to drop to 70 to get the same brake force of 20 psi.  Over time incorrect brake usage can deplete the air available to the brakes.  A second spring loaded system which is essentially a parking/emergency brake is auto applied if the overall pressure drops below some lower limit.</p>
<p>If a train was fully charged and suddenly the air lines broke, such as a coupling failed, the on board tank would try to put 100% of its air in the primary brakes, and then the service brakes would apply to hold the train stationary since the main brakes would eventually leak out all the air and fail.  Some also have weight sensors to apply less brake force on an empty car so you don't fuck up the wheels and tracks. You can mechanically defeat the parking brake in a yard to roll a car around using the brakes of an external system to control it with no air connected.  This has on occasion led a car with no functional brakes to run away.</p>
<p>Locomotive brakes work differently and typically have both an air system and electrical brakes that basically use the traction motors as generators and pump the power into big resistor banks on the roof, which occasionally fail spectacularly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've understood trains to be essentially the reverse of highway trucks in terms of how the brakes work. Help me if I'm misunderstanding things:</p>
<p>As a firefighter I have had to learn air brakes for highway vehicles to operate my trucks. We have one or more pressurized air tanks on the truck, which are used to keep the brake shoes/pads off of the drums/discs, thus allowing the truck to move. If the system is evacuated of air, or allowed to bleed all the air out, mechanical spring pressure moves the shoes/pads <em>onto</em> the drums/discs, making the brakes activate. Absent of air pressure, you will not move a highway truck (unless you use a special bolt to mechanically move the brakes off the wheels).</p>
<p>Discussions on train brakes have happened a lot over the past few years in my country (Canada) as we have had several incidents, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lac-M%C3%A9gantic_rail_disaster" target="_blank">a fairly newsworthy one which resulted in many civilian deaths</a>. In that situation, a train was left abandoned on a mainline without sufficient car brakes enabled. My understanding is that each car has a wheel that can be turned which will <em>apply</em> the brakes manually and that the normal position of the brakes on a car, absent any other action, is <strong><em>off</em></strong> (the car can free roll). I also was under the understanding that trains rely on air pressure from a running locomotive to maintain air pressure in the brake system, and that air is required to <em>apply</em> the brakes, not <em>remove</em> the braking action (the opposite of highway trucks). In the above situation, the locomotive was in particularly poor mechanical shape, and caught fire during the night while the engineer was on mandatory rest in a motel miles away. It was shut down as a result of fighting the fire, and none of the responders (fire crews or rail company staff) were aware that shutting the locomotive off would jeopardize the train's ability to stay put. Once the air all bled off (after the FD and the rail company left the scene), and with not enough cars set to manual braking with their individual braking wheels, the train rolled downhill into a town and exploded, killing somewhere around 50-55 people.</p>
<p>So in summary: Highway trucks rely on air pressure to keep the brakes <em>off</em>, and removing it will put the brakes on and make the truck immovable. Trains rely on air pressure to keep the brakes <em>on</em>, and removing it will allow the train to free-wheel and ultimately be uncontrollable. Is that not the truth?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most newer rollercoasters use electric linear brakes that can be moved in and out by an air based system, and do deploy if the air system fails.  The primary brake force is electric linear induction though.</p>
<p>Older units may have brake pads that come up instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nitpick: the coaster brakes are magnetic (not electric) and default to the closed position such that if there's a failure in the air system, the ride will still stop the train. The brakes don't require electricity at all.</p></div>		</li>
