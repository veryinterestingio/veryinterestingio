			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had two methods that work really well. Granted, I'm a very light sleeper, so this might not work for a heavy sleeper..</p>
<p>First method was using an app called Gentle Alarm. It's no longer in development, but the idea worked amazingly well for me. Basically it ran on two alarms, a very quiet 'Pre alarm' that lasted only a minute or two and was just loud enough to wake you up if you were in a light sleep cycle. If you were in a deeper sleep, it wouldn't wake you up. That leaves the second main alarm, which is a normal volume alarm. It goes off about 30 minutes after the pre alarm, which by then you are more likely to have cycled out of the deep sleep and and back into a lighter sleep. </p>
<p>The second method is the one I currently use, which is a sunrise alarm. Similar to the first method, it starts off about 30 minutes before the main volume alarm. Only this time the prealarm is light. I use the Philips sunrise alarm clock, which has a pretty smooth light intensity curve with the start being a faint red glow, and ending with the retina burning luminosity of the sun. I usually find myself waking up about 5 minutes before the (really pleasant sounding) alarm goes off. The only time I wake up groggy is if I just had a terrible night, which at that point a smart alarm clock wasn't going to save me anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™ve learned to do this manually by setting three alarms an hour apart. I never remember turning off the first and sometimes second but will always get up on the third without any problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>can try the app sleep cycle, it uses motion sensors and sound (I think? maybe one or the other) to determine when you're in your light phase and tries to wake you up in it if possible. </p>
<p>eg. set alarm for 9 am, it will wake you up anywhere between 8:30 and 9:00 when it detects you in that lighter phase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually untrue - if you wake up from REM, there is no sleep inertia to remain asleep and you feel alert.</p>
<p>If you wake up from SWS/N3 sleep, which is true deep sleep, you will awaken feeling very slow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are 5 sleep phases. REM and deep sleep are different:  Phases 1 and 2 are light, 3-4 are deep sleep and REM is the 5th (dreams). You cycle back and forth between phases typically every 90 or so mins.</p></div>		</li>
