			<div class="markdown"><p>The real reason why audio can't be dropped is that there's no acceptable fallback for missing information.</p>
<p>If video players that missed a frame displayed an entire black screen, that wouldn't be palatable either. But they can just repeat the previous frame, which isn't so bad.</p>
<p>Audio usually does zero out for missed frames, which is terrible. But even if you just repeated the last 1024 samples of audio computer, that wouldn't be acceptable either. The phase of the frequency information wouldn't align, introducing artifacts that sound like clicks, on top of a noticeable and jarring repetition.</p>
<p>You could technically use some clever techniques with crossfading or matching zero crossings or something to create a less offensive. But that requires computation too, so if you could do that, you might as well compute what the sound was supposed to be anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how it has been halved in speed. </p>
<p>Dropping frames of digital audio is not an option, you will get nasty digital clipping as the algorithm tries to average between two non-contiguous samples. Not to mention, you are now out of sync if you are running it alongside video. </p>
<p>If the speed is just halved then the pitch will also be halved, meaning it sounds lower, deeper, half as high. Which would describe the “sounding weird”. On analogue mediums it just sounds half as fast and half as high in pitch without any artefacts because, say on tape, you’re just running the information past the tape head half as fast. </p>
<p>Digitally you have to do something if you’re preserving the sample rate because by halving it you’ve just lost half your samples and the computer wants to read them and they’re not there. It does this in a variety of different ways, so you can double each sample (hello harmonic distortion, how’d you like all these sharp edged waveforms?), which will introduce artefacts which sound glitchy, or you can mathematically average between the samples before and the sample after to add in a new sample. Which can also be glitchy and artefacted if your math sucks. </p>
<p>This gets even worse if you don’t just want to slow it down but you also want to preserve the pitch. You can’t just double the samples or average between them because that will not have the effect of preserving the pitch. You need to maintain the shape of the waveform and add in a load of samples mathematically that have that effect (we’re talking Fourier Transforms here). This is done in many different ways, some far more successful and expensive than others. That’s why Izotope plugins are so expensive, both monetarily and in terms of system resources, and are very good at performing tasks like that. Where YouTube or audible sound kinda glitchy when you start messing with the speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeap. For me, the trio to look for are: </p>
<p>1) Lagging audio - rare, for me at least.</p>
<p>2) &quot;<em>Task Manager</em> <strong><em>(Not Responding)</em></strong>&quot; or alternate: CPU/MEM/HDD all at 100% because of a rogue process</p>
<p>3) Checking to see if my numlock/capslock light on the keyboard lags.</p>
<p>If the lights on your keyboard aren't responding for several seconds, then you know shit has really hit the fan. At that point, If I'm not in the middle of a file transfer, I just force power-down (yank the power cable). Fortunately, it's rare for me to have to do that these days. Kinda miss the Windows XP days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my anecdotal experience when the audio starts to stutter like a drill, the computer is dead (either blue screen or the computer turns off, or I need to manually strangle the power button off)  </p>
<p>Makes sense tho based on this thread. Things often crash or do things wrong/things it's not suppose to do, and Windows in the background catches it and corrects it like a baby sitter watching out for kids falling from the couch. But if the highest priority, the audio, it stuck in a loop then chances are that the kernel is also stuck and there's nothing below the kernel to save the computer</p>
<p>Also since the audio is handled by another hardware like sound chip, if that's lagging it also means that the computer is unable to handle interrupts, it's calling the cpu's mobile number but the cpu isn't picking up its phone. So either the cpu is putting everything aside and doing damage control (ie blue screen) or it's dying, maybe because of short circuit or something wrong like deadlock in the software that caused the kernel to take over but it also got into a deadlock like the baby sitter also fell off the couch that's why they are unconscious, baby also ded, phone ringing no one picking up.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Minor correction: It's the kernel itself that does the bluescreen (or kernel panic if you're using various other operating systems). If the kernel itself encounters a problem it can't handle, it has no way of knowing what will happen next. If it's allowed to continue, it might try to for example overwrite data that's critical to the user. The safest course of action in this case, is to immediately stop all processes, including itself. That way, you'll only lose unsaved data, but at least you'll avoid damaging other data you've saved earlier.</p></div>		</li>
