They've got extra padding in the palm areas where you'd typically grip something so it really helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry to hear that. When I was young teenager that loved all things mechanical, I really exposed myself to the dangers without ever realizing it either. It's such a common and low risk seeming activity that I just don't think people get the risk until years later.  I know all I was ever concerned about using a grinder was the disk blowing up and taking out my eye or the kick from biting (both worth the worry and PPE too).</p></div>		</li>

I know of one guy who was told to use a ladder on a pallet on a forklift for access or not turn up Monday. He's in a better place now. </p>
