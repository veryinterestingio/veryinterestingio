			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately genetics&amp;evolution also play a role, so while it wouldn't completely solve the issue, that is actually recommended. Feed babies whole foods, let them chew on carrots, etc. instead of feeding them only baby food. Also don't use sippy cups, cut out pacifiers after age two, etc etc. All this promotes healthy jaw growth. There is a lot of research coming out on this.</p>
<p>My knowledge comes from being an office manager in a dental office for seven years. Also my sister is a dental hygienist and an orofacial myofunctional therapist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well since you work in that field, I was hoping you could shed some light on something for me. Why is it that some people have abnormally elongated canines? Could it be a left over from being hunters or does it serve a real purpose besides not having to get prostectic fangs?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard about this. I also heard that breast feeding helps develop jaw growth versus bottle feeding. </p>
<p>My only concern with giving babies whole foods immediately following breast feeding is, of course, choking. Since that's a more immediate and life threatening issue I'll likely ease them into it. I have a lot of research to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly the reason, the reason why though is that the tougher foods promote a healthier tongue posture (pressed against the roof of your mouth and pushing slightly against the teeth) whereas soft foods generally promote a more relaxed posture (tongue laying on the bottom of the mouth not pushing against the teeth).</p>
<p>The tongue is a very powerful muscle and it can literally shape your face</p></div>		</li>
