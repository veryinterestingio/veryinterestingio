			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok so I can’t explain it that well myself but if it’s something you’re interested in, please check out The Body Keeps The Score. My therapist recently recommended it to me because of my own diagnosis and it covers the history of PTSD and how our understanding of it has changed.  Not quite the quick ELI5 you were after, (sorry!) but a great read! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can second this. Actually offers a really interesting look at trauma in general tbh, which PTSD is obviously a huge part of.</p>
<p>Personally found it very useful in working through a lot of my own issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty what the person above you said. Things like traumatic brain injury weren't really understood or recognized then like they are today (and even now there's a lot still to learn), and how neurologic and psychiatric injury are very much intertwined.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just physical. Some of the conditions were akin to extended bouts of intense psychological torture. Things like days-long artillery barrages, or being stuck in a foxhole under fire while surrounded by dead, again, for days. This, on top of what was already horrid conditions and circumstances, and there was plenty of situations like the aforementioned for a person to break down long before the torment stopped.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think it was traumatic brain injury.  I’ve seen these and other films on it and it show many recovering with physical therapy.  TBI isn’t cured that way.  It’s a fundamental physiological change to the brain.  I wondered if was the nerve gas that was being used then (that’s forbidden now).  I always wondered the same thing about these very specific behaviors that don’t appear today or in descriptions of PTSD from past wars....saw a doc once on Civil War and description of PTSD on soldiers that sounds like it could from a news article today.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Brain injuries are a scary thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are and are not at the same time.</p>
<p>We will have massed fires, however the use of the saturation barrage and rolling barrage aren't really used anymore. Today artillery pinpoints targets, hammers it and either shifts to another spot, or has to move to avoid counter-battery fire.</p>
<p>The only place I can think of that might have the level of artillery fire as we saw in WW1 and WW2 would be the first 12-36 hours of a Korean War</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>fwiw i have PTSD completely unrelated to war, and have experienced long episodes of bad tremors, muscular hypertonia (like in tetanus) and seizures; all, seemingly,  a direct result of the severe stress as part and parcel of PTSD. i still experience the tremors and spasms near-constantly even since therapy. once your body becomes tuned to being poised for danger it kinda gets stuck like that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And somehow the general public still sees it as a veterans only problem. It’s sad because if you explain it to anyone, they think you’re crazy or lying about having it or they think your some weakling who can have difficult times in their life. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few questions if you don't mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Outside of therapy has anything helped with these tremors and spasms, such as medication?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If left untreated, do they get worse over time?</p>
</li>
<li>Did you tell your psych about this? If so, how did you go over the hurdle of opening up about something like this?</li>
</ol></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also have PTSD, specifically C-PTSD although I imagine that name will be changed when it’s more understood. The way I’ve seen it, PTSD symptoms are patient specific. We don’t all have all of the symptoms, and some of us have symptoms not yet recognized. So I’ll answer these questions with my specific brand of trauma in mind.</p>
<p>1) Weed helps so much, honestly. I don’t want to smoke, but I’ve yet to find anything else that comes close. The problem is, it’s still a drug and it hurts me <em>almost</em> as much as it helps me. Amphetamines also help some with the pain. I don’t have tremors or spasms, my entire body is constantly in varying amounts of pain. There is no escaping it. Only dulling the senses enough to get through the day. </p>
<p>2) My pain has been getting worse the longer it goes on, but it doesn’t even really matter. Once your body goes through so much pain, day in and day out...I can’t confidently say you get used to it because it never stops hurting, but it does become part of your daily routine so it’s hard to notice when it gets worse. I can look back and see that it’s been getting worse, but I’ve never woken up one day and realized a significant difference.</p>
<p>3) I’ve been in therapy for over a decade now and I still can’t tell the difference between a psychiatrist, a psychologist, and a regular ol therapist. PTSD specialists are hard to find, C-PTSD specialists even harder. A regular therapist is <em>not</em> in any way shape or form able to handle someone with C-PTSD. It often times makes it worse. That being said I have always been honest and truthful to whoever I was speaking with. Personally, I’ve always been an open book. The trick is that you have to ask me the right questions in the right order to get it out of me. Again, I’m not hiding anything. My <em>subconscious </em> is hiding it from me. Memory is a tricky thing..</p>
<p>Anyway not OP but I hope it helped answer some questions. </p></div>		</li>
