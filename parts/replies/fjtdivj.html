			<div class="markdown"><p>This last bit: &lt;&lt;  the peasants kept copying the rich people, and the rich people didn't like that so they kept making up more and more ridiculous rules to help differentiate themselves from the poor people. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>...explains all of fashion. The reason so much of fashion looks ridiculous is its the rich way of differentiating from the poor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all of fashion, but certainly a large chunk of the kind of cat walk type of fashion. I'd argue that another major influence on fashion is simply practicality, which is why Jeans became popular. Cheap, easy to mass produce and durable made them very practical attire for workers. And also sex appeal, especially in relation to women's fashion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. In fact, our cultural jokey hatred of the French actually stems from the Normans' own actual hatred of the French.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. But the Saxons he invaded didn't speak a word of English either. The English Language is an evolution and fusion of the primordial Germanic and Latin languages of the 11th century, which are in turn evolved and mutated forms of Latin and iirc Yiddish, which are in turn evolved and mutated forms of the hypothesised Proto-Indoeuropean language. Really, &quot;English&quot; isn't a thing at all. What people 500 years from now call English could be a far cry from modern English. English is more like a broad category of a bunch of different languages that people can roughly communicate between without too much issue. This mutual ability to roughly understand one-another results in the individual languages being called dialects. It's a bit like the whole Speciation thing in biology - It'd be nice if we could categorise things into species, but we can't because the boundary between &quot;species&quot; is vague as fuck.</p></div>		</li>
