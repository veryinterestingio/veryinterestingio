<p>Quick correction, it's the process of combining a chemical with an <em>oxidizer</em>, not specifically oxygen. Oxygen is of course the archetype though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah thatâ€™s being overly specific. Burning isnâ€™t exactly a chemical term. The correct term would be combustion which describes an exothermic oxidation-reduction reaction. Non oxygen oxidizing agents in combustion reactions are so few and far between that most textbooks define combustion as a reaction between oxygen and another compound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An oxidizer is defined as a substance that <em>oxidizes</em> another substance: a chemical other than a blasting agent or explosive that initiates or promotes combustion in other materials. It may be a substance such as a chlorate, permanganate, and inorganic peroxide or nitrate that yields oxygen readily to stimulate the combustion of organic matter.</p>
<p>You can combine fuel with oxygen, or fuel with an oxidizer that produces oxygen, but there is no burning without oxygen.</p>
<p>edit: to avoid a bunch more replies saying the same thing, I say: My comment was two parts, the first was refining the definition of an 'oxidizer'. Not 'oxidation'. I then added a <em>separate</em> note about my understanding of the definition of 'burning' which I have always referred to as a different process from 'combustion' (all burning is combustion but not all combustion is burning) which may take place without oxygen. The debate about what constitutes fire/flame/oxidation/combustion is not one I'm going to get dragged into again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oxidation is defined as a loss of electrons. You do not need oxygen for oxidation to occur or for burning to occur. Burning/combustion is a redox reaction that produces heat and light. Hydrogen and Chlorine can react producing light and heat to form Hydrogen Chloride (the chloride being reduced and the hydrogen being oxidized by the chloride).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're incorrect.</p>
<p>Oxidation is named after oxygen, but doesn't actually have anything to do with it.</p>
<p>While oxygen is the archetypal example of an oxidizer, many other elements / chemicals have been found that also do that exact same job. Fluorine, for example, is a more powerful oxidizer than oxygen.</p>
<p>The release of oxygen gas has nothing to do with oxidizing at all.</p>
<p>Burning only requires an oxidizing agent, <em>not</em> oxygen. It's just the most widely available oxidizer on Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are other substances that can serve as oxidizer, but I do believe that you are correct in that you specifically need oxygen for <em>combustion</em>, which is only one type of redox reaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>...dude, your anger here is really misplaced. I think it's great for ELI5 to provide a simple explanation, and then further information for those interested.</p>
<p>I didn't come out swinging like, &quot;you idiot, it's not necessarily oxygen!&quot; I just provided one more piece of info to those interested. I also acknowledged that the confusion is because oxygen is indeed usually what's involved.</p>
<p>The point of ELI5 isn't to provide any explanation that's dumbed down. It's to provide a good and reasonably accurate understanding of a topic for a layman. Part of that is acknowledging where a simplification strays from reality. We don't have to give the full story, just let people know there is more to it. Too many misunderstandings are caused by people learning a simplification and thinking that's <em>all</em> there is to it. This is an educational subreddit, and I'm not going to feel bad to providing more information to people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that you can mix hydrogen gas and oxygen gas and just get a mixture of the two. In order to get water, the hydrogen needs to burn, which requires 560Â°C. </p>
<p>What this means is that you don't just need them to come in contact, you need the molecules to smack into each other hard enough that the hydrogen is able to stick to the oxygen. Too slow and they just bounce off each other.</p></div>		</li>

<p>By the time you get enough energy to get hydrogen and oxygen to react, they are going to typically take the lowest energy configuration, which is water. This is why producers of hydrogen peroxide use a catalyst to produce hydrogen peroxide rather than just allowing it to happen naturally.</p></div>		</li>
