			<div class="markdown"><p>Crows assault bird nests all the time.  Last year we built a little defensive cage around this mourning dove nest up in the scaffolding because it kept getting raided and doves are too damn stupid to move it.</p>
<p>Seemed to work, the next batch survived long enough to leave the nest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hyenas are mostly hunters actually, there aren’t many true obligate scavengers - it’s an unreliable food source.  Most of the scavenging is done by lazy carnivores like coyotes and foxes.  They’re adept hunters, but definitely won’t sleep on a free meal as long as it’s not too foul.</p>
<p>Had a good sized raccoon die in the field by me in the spring, vultures were on it fast and reduced it to just some scattered fuzz by the next morning.  You probably would never have known there was a dead animal there a day before.</p>
<p>Bird kills make a mess though, especially if another bird was responsible.  Feathers everywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>bears and foxes fit too. Most animals do tbh under a sense of &quot;situational scavenger/omnivore&quot;. i.e they wont turn down free food even if is harder to digest for them</p></div>		</li>
