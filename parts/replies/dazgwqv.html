			<div class="markdown"><p>As the guy below me and the guy above me clearly state.</p>
<p>It's the responsability of EVERYONE involved, to have a good project come to terms.</p>
<p>If you have a good team, the work flows smoothly.</p>
<p>If your team is unexperienced, lacks motivation to work odd hours or insists on pointing out everyone elses faults for not doing their job... then not only engineers and managers are screwed, but the whole project.</p>
<p>The leadership of the project manager can be felt on site, as well as lack of leadership OR lack of money.</p>
<p>As Petyr Baelish says, Gold wins wars, not soldiers... even the best teams fail when money stalls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hahaha. Journeyman electrician here with over a decade of experience in high rise and large infrastructure job experience. It's generally the good tradesmen that pick up the mistakes in design and point it out to their foreman who then pass it along to the proper channels. It's good workers, not managers and engineers, that make this happen. Managers/engineers are generally only as good as their workers. They don't have time to scoure a 60 story 20000 Sq ft per floor building. They rely on the Journeymen doing the installs. We rely on them to come up with a solution to fix it, which generally falls on us to figure out depending on the severity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this exactly. Most of the architects and engineers designing these buildings have no idea how a switchgear station or steam expansion loop actually work; they just have a book (or these days, a computer program) that tells them &quot;you need to have this, this, and that.&quot;</p>
<p>That's where you find the difference between an average crew of tradesmen and a good crew. A good pipefitter, for instance, will understand the system well enough to know that (to use a personal experience) if we put the air separator on the floor where you have it drawn on the blueprints, it won't work properly. Then we can start the process of getting approval to change its location to above the pipes where it should be (so it can trap air flowing through the system), instead of having to cut it out and reroute it later once everything else in the room is installed. </p>
<p>An average crew will just install it because &quot;that's what the prints show.&quot;</p>
<p>Incidentally, (also from personal experience, unfortunately), one of the quickest ways to turn the good crew into an average one is for the project manager and general contractor to repeatedly respond to suggestions like the above with &quot;shut up and install it the way the engineer wants it, and quit wasting my time.&quot; </p>
<p>And then, when multiple major systems have to be removed, re-engineered, and reinstalled, complain to the customer that the trades are taking too long and costing too much. &quot;It's so hard to get good help, you know.&quot; ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The architect and engineers are only getting paid a set amount, and are legally liable for everything they put on the plans, but attempt to dodge that responsibility as much as possible and pass the liability onto the general contractor.<br />
Both of them are bad about copy and pasting from previous projects, which would be fine if they were properly reviewed.  </p>
<p>ADA, fair housing, International Building Codes, and local codes are all supposed to be researched and included in the plans.  I am a project manager for a GC and I am currently working on a project designed with all PEX domestic water lines.  The small city we are building in has a city ordinance that says only metal domestic water supply lines.  Neither the architect or the mechanical engineer found out about this. Now the general contractor is expected to absorb this extra expense. This is just one example of the shot I deal with regularly.  We  end up eating expenses over one note somewhere on one of hundreds of sheets of drawings regularly, and yet have to be low bidder to get the projects.  </p>
<p>I add money to bids for projects involving certain architects or engineers.  I label it a difficulty fee and charge my extra time to it as needed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You guys don't always get enough credit, but you gotta remember engineers almost always start with literally a blank piece of paper, and need to turn it into a biddable design under tight budgets and schedules. It's a team effort between contractor and engineer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm working on my civil engineering degree and it amazes me as well. The engineers legally have a HUGE amount of liability, so every tiny little detail is triple checked on plans, and then we go out and inspect what the builder actually created at each step. It's true that a lot of the actual engineering is done through spreadsheets and basic formulas, but engineers do a lot more than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol, in a perfect world engineers triple check their plans.  I've been a surveyor for almost 10 years now, and if a P.Eng had their stamp revoked for approving shitty, impossible and flat out wrong designs, there would be a whole lot less of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So others know, there's a lot of scheduling the vendors too.</p>
<p>Can't have the roofers showing up before the building frame is done. Which means you might have to keep pushing stage 2 vendors back when stage 1 hits delays due to material, weather, permits, plan revisions.</p>
<p>Delays mean you have to authorize overtime to keep the guys working on weekends or past quitting time. If you don't, you end up even further behind. </p></div>		</li>
