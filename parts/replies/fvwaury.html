			<div class="markdown"><p>It is also part of the reason why you can feel a lightning strike before it hits you.</p>
<p>Your hair will stand on end and you may even feel tingling as the air around you has an electrical charge. The lightning is still searching for its path before you even see the strike, so if you are out in a storm and suddenly feel your hair stand up or notice a different taste in the air get down as low to the ground as you can so the lightning doesn't use you as a path to the ground.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: I'm going to shamelessly self promote here because I'm submitting a thesis in the field next week and this is how I have explained what I do to my mother and 8 year old niece <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/hf6ybh/eli5_why_does_lightning_travel_in_a_zigzag_manner/" target="_blank">how lightning forms</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When u say itâ€™s still searching for a path, how exactly does that happen? Does a bit of current find the best path possible and then the rest of the current follows? </p>
<p>Also why does grounding happen? Why does the current disperse itself? Does current(like gases) like to disperse and take up space?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the closest answer. Why would ionized air be less resistive though?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ionized air majorly contains ions of gases in air.
As Ions (molecules/elements with charge) are excellent conductors of electricity, they are less resistive than non-ionised air. </p>
<p>Same goes with any medium, ions carrying charge are way better conductors than (most) nuetral molecules.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surely a large increase in ions should cause a potential drop and reduce any charge moving</p></div>		</li>
