			<div class="markdown"><p>The group speed is the speed of the envelope of the wave, the phase speed is the speed at which a point of constant phase moves through space, and the signal speed is the speed at which information is transmitted by the wave.</p>
<p>There's a nice animation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_velocity" target="_blank">here</a> that demonstrates the difference between the group and phase velocities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You seem to know stay you're talking about.    </p>
<p>A couple of things if you don't mind?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>So when they say nothing can travel faster than speed of light, it's this speed they're referring to. So technically, it's not nothing, but information cannot travel faster than the speed of light. Correct?    </p>
</li>
<li>You mentioned &quot;wave&quot; a couple of times. I've been away from academics for sometime now. But are they closer to classifying light more as a wave than a particle these days?</li>
