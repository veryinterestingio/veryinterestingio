<p>Have you played cards on a kitchen table? You have to slide the cards off the edge of the table to pick them up, which is annoying and scratches the cards. </p>
<p>Playing on a padded felt table lets you pick up the cards (and chips) in place. It also helps when dealing the cards, because they don’t fly off the table when you pitch them a long distance. </p>
