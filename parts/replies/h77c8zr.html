			<div class="markdown"><p>But if you sell me a painting for 10m, won’t that raise eyebrows? Like even before I turn around and sell It for a higher price to legitimize the money? Like wouldn’t that original purchase of 10m be a red flag? If I’m trying to clean the money how am I going to use It to buy the painting in the first place?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because 100% of your money isn't illegal.  </p>
<p>Also,  using art for money laundering isn't your first go to for that.  You would have other income sources and other ways of laundering smaller amounts of money before you'd step up to art.  Like say you owned a laundromat. Random people are pumping cash into those machines.  So at the end of the day you add a little extra to the amount you made that day,  and that extra money is now clean  You continue doing this and other smaller methods of laundering money.  Eventually you get to a point where you have the millions of dollars and you can buy art without being suspicious. </p>
<p>But really for stuff like art you need to deal with foreigners so that both sides of the transaction can't be easily traced.</p></div>		</li>
