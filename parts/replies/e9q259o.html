			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the general consensus seems to be 90 minutes is the average. There's pretty much no way for you to figure out your own sleep cycle lengths without either going to a specialist or trying to guess it/figure it out yourself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A solution to the problem is to go to bed early and let your body wake up on it's own.  Some people do it in 7hr and some in 10 hrs.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I figured mine out by taking naps and timing them. I start the timer and subtract 10 min for falling asleep time. Mine is about an hour. A 1 hr nap leaves me feeling nice and refreshed. I set an alrm for x hrs +15 min when I go to sleep for the night. Works like a charm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This has probably been the best piece of information I've gathered through the internet in the last few months. So I just have to find out my cycle and will always be fit? Or does it also depend on how long I've been awake prior to sleeping?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It usually gets longer as you sleep. The beginning of the night REM lasts 10 minutes as the night goes on it gets longer to 90 minutes. REM with non-REM makes a full cycle. So I'm thinking a cycle might last 2 hours or so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are apps that measure your sleep cycles, and after it learns your sleep cycles, it will gently wake you up close to your alarm time if your sleep cycle ends close to it. You can adjust how far away from your wake up time you want to be woke. </p></div>		</li>
