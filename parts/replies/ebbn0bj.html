			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah most lotions have some sort of alcohol in them. You need to look for alcohol-free lotions to ensure they don't burn. </p>
<p>There are a lot of ingredients in lotions that are irritating to skin. Most lotions that are very safe and actually non-irritating are pretty expensive.</p></div>		</li>
