			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. The meter was chosen such that 40000km is the circumference around the poles. The speed of light is incidental</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Was</em> incidental.  Now (well, since 1983) it's a part of the definition of a metre, being that <em>c</em> is a universal constant.</p>
<p>The history of the definition of the metre is fairly interesting.  Have a read of the Wikipedia article.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Still incendental. It doesn’t matter at all that it is now how we define it. It could have just as easily been the speed of sound in water for all it matters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, they chose 299,792,458 so that the length of the new metre is as close as possible to the length of the old standard, meaning we don't have to recalculate everything for the new slightly different value</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, in May this year we redefined the last of the metric system's measures: the Kilogram. Previously, like the metre, it was defined by a man-made artefact that was kept in a vault. Now, like the metre being defined in relation to a universal constant — the speed of light — the kilo is defined based on plank constant, the speed of light and the second (time), and can be measured with a watt balance, which measures the weight based on the electric current and voltage needed to compensate for the weight of the object.</p></div>		</li>
