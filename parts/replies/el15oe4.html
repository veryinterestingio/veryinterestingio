			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if this could be tested by freezing one tray inside of a new tupperware container and another frozen just on the freezer shelf. Perhaps a third one could be tested having been placed in an airtight container with crushed mint leaves or something.</p>
<p>Actually this would be a pretty fun home experiment to do with a kid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess I accidentally test this all the time by putting my water bottles in the freezer. To me the water in my bottle tastes normal once it has thawed. Not the same taste as melted cubes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is quite likely the case. I hate this taste, I'm particularly sensitive to it, and I notice it even when nobody else seems to.</p>
<p>But I find that rinsing the ice cubes before putting them into a drink gets rid of it, suggesting that the taste is concentrated in the surface layer of the ice, or in the layer of frost on it.</p></div>		</li>
