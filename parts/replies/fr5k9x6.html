			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, gotcha. So the body interprets it as a biological threat and attacks it with the immune system? That adds up, thanks for taking the time to reply :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A needle gun is SEVERAL (usually) needles puncturing your skin at around 5,000 times per minute. If the needle has 10 needles in actuality, the tattoo takes 30 mins, you are STABBING yourself 1.5 million times in that 30 minutes. A tattoo gun has needles ranging from 1 (very fine thin lines) to 14ish needles a head.  If its only 2 needle head, thats still being stabbed 300,000 times in 30 minutes. Your body doesnt like that obviously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This question got me really curious and you had an amazing reply to it. However, it got me thinking on what the question would be if we replaced tattoos with &quot;scars/stretchmarks&quot;. With this explanation I felt like it should apply to those as well. My own train of thought says it's dead skin and thus won't regenerate, but it's weird that the body, as amazing as it is, wouldn't rid itself of dead, excess skin in this way.</p></div>		</li>
