<p>When you repeatedly hear certain musical elements (chords, key structures, etc) in certain emotional contexts, then those musical elements will begin to be strongly associated with those emotions.</p>
<p>Like Pavlov's dog. Play a minor key during sad scenes over and over, and soon playing a minor key will make you sad even without the scene.</p>
<p>This is also why a lot of more experimental music is often ignored or disliked. The chord structures and musical elements are completely new, so people don't know how to process it emotionally, and the music just sounds strange to them instead of evoking any kind of emotion.</p>
<p>The modern western associations we have now are not actually the associations people had many years ago, and are different from the associations that other cultures around the world have with those chords and scales. All of it learned based on the contexts in which we play certain kinds of music.</p>
<p>There may have even been a time where minor was happy and major was sad. (I would actually love to have a historical examples of this if someone has that)</p>
<p>Now obviously there is the harmony of frequencies, where simpler harmonies are more pleasing to the ear, and will tend to be used more often for simpler less irritating emotions, but beyond that everything is learned.</p>
<p>EDIT: Fun fact, the major and minor triads actually have the same harmonic intervals, just in a different order. A perfect fifth, a major third, and a minor third, where the major and minor thirds get swapped in position.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dunno.. there is a certain tone (I think) that comes up when you cry AND try to talk. It’s pretty specific and seems to be similar to the tones heard in sad music. Try it! Pretend to cry and lament like “Why would do this to me what have I ever done to you!?”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there are certainly many ways to interpret this question, allow me to offer an idea</p>
<p>another part of evil / sinister songs is the use of dissonance. Dissonance is defined as a lack of harmony among musical notes. If you slam your open hand on a piano you get dissonance, which feels tense or maybe even evil. If you form a minor chord you get sad; a major, happy. </p>
<p>Think about the theme to &quot;Jaws&quot; real quick. Unlike a lot of music we listen to where there are chord patterns that have harmony and &quot;resolve&quot;, the Jaws theme is instead basically 2 notes contrasting eachother with no big pattern that resolves it. It instead just stays dissonant, giving us the feeling of tension, which is great for spooky stuff or evil.</p>
<p>As for an evolutionary explanation I'm not as sure, but predatory growls and roars do not have much of a harmonic pattern like bird chirps, but are instead dissonant</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe the tension is from the feel that it is &quot;unfinished&quot;. There is the phenomenon of you feeling anxiety over something that has no conclusion, especially when its something you have no control over, like a half-heard conversation or a cliffhanger in a TV show. You keep trying to see the full picture but can't. Maybe that's why these pieces sound &quot;tense&quot;, because you feel something is missing or should be followed by something else and you don't get the catharsis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I keep looking for an answer in the thread and i keep just seeing &quot;well minor notes are sad/sinister&quot; but... WHY?</p>
<p>If it's just &quot;societal impression&quot; -- i mean, it had to start with some composer, somewhere, right? Who was it, and why, out all the music ever composed trying to convey different things with different notes, did it stick so drastically?</p></div>		</li>
