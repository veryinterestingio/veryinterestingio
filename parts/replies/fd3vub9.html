			<div class="markdown"><p>#1 sounds like the scenes when the first firefighters arrived at the hospital and were being treated/handled while still in their gear.  Once they start removing the gear and putting it in the basement, one of the nurses who was handling it feels pain in her hand and sees that it has started to burn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also not as if it happens instantly either.  She'd been treating the still clothed guys for some time before her perspective is shown, and then likely also had to scoop up and gather the dust-covered equipment and carry it to the basement.</p>
<p>As for the baby part, I've always felt that the people screaming about &quot;radiation fearmongering/bad science&quot; for that specific part misinterpreted it to be the actual truth, rather than something heard from an unreliable narrator who either reasoned it that way herself or had it explained to her as someone who has little knowledge of medicine or radiation to begin with.  Remember that she was also on the bridge when the &quot;snow&quot; began to fall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This, you're absolutely right. #1 sounds nearly identical to a scene at the beginning of episode 2, (a nurse reacts to a doctor treating a dirty, mud+water covered firefighter with milk.) The nurse begins taking off the firefighters clothes with urgency and mentions contamination. The clothes are then shown being taken to the hospital basement <strong><em>armfuls at a time</em></strong> by several nurses. On her way back out of the basement the first nurse examines her hand to find it is red, there is also visible dirt on the hand. </p>
<p>-
The show IS accurate, #1 is realistic because the firefighter depicted is the same firefighter from #2, Vasily Ignatenko. Vasily was one of the first responders who actually got the closest to the core. One estimation has his whole body dose at 14 grays. When you combine that with the depiction of him being covered in ash/dirt/water, and, the depiction of the nurse first raising the issue; followed by her noticing her hand after carrying a full armful. And it is clear that the show went out of it's way to show that the danger in this instance was from contaminated material. (Note here that there was a LINE of nurses dumping the clothes. Obviously they had time to address her concerns; most likely it was not her first trip.) </p>
<p>-
On the subject of #2, the parent comment is my personal pick for most plausible assessment of the story. We know that the story was documented in book citing his wife Lyudmilla^[1]. We also know that there have been^[2] studies of the I-131 exposure of people who were not immediately at the scene of the accident^[3]. If we take the wife's retelling with a reasonable amount of skepticism, along with our best estimates of the radiation, and finish off with the knowledge that the firefighter in question was awarded national honor for being a first responder^[4]... all leads to a solid conclusion that the transfer of radiation from him to his wife was not only possible, but was likely.</p>
