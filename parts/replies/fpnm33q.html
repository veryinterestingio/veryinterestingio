			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny story! I started a PhD program in 2001 planning to research new collaboration and collective intelligence methods used by physicists. At the same time, I noticed many participants in an online game community I was a member of looking for ways to use their gaming skills to solve real problems, like investigate cold case crimes, government corruption and to organize real-world volunteer efforts. I got super-interested in researching what gaming skills might translate best to real-world action and collaboration, convinced my advisors (who knew nothing about gaming) to let me do my PhD research on a brand new topic, and off I went! :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Counter Strike came out in Nov 2000, replacing Doom/Duke Nukem to redefine (IMO) the FPS line. Medal of Honor: Allied Assault came out in 2002 and was excellent as well.</p>
<p>For RTS,the Age of Empires franchise was also huge then, as well as the Command &amp; Conquer series which had started in 1995  (they also released an FPS, Renegade, in '02). The Warcraft series started as an RTS, releasing Warcraft 3 in '02 as well.</p>
<p>As far as MMOs, Runescape was Jan 2001, Everquest was around for a year already. Sid Meier's Civ series was also big.</p>
<p>MOBAs, to my knowledge, didn't really except in things like custom Warcraft III games (an RTS which had an amazingly complex custom map maker, allowing the use of a nasty sort of Javascript to change the game's behavior from it's original eco-war standard to anything from an ice-sliding racer to full on 8+ hour multiplayer RPGs.)</p></div>		</li>
