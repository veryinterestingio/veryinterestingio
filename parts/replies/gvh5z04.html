			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd have to dig out my psychology of fear and evolutionary psych research, but yeah various muscles like the zygomaticus major are really good facial tells in humans, so much that AI facial recognotion can pick up a lot of latent emotion, as humans subconsciously do.</p>
<p>A person could train themselves, ie poker face, but most people have innate pphylogenetic tells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did you have a period in your life where you were discouraged from expressing true emotions or were forced to smile convincingly a lot?. For example, living with an unstable family member/partner, or working a customer service/commissions  job? You  might have inadvertently mastered this skill if at one time your safety or livelihood depended on it.</p></div>		</li>
