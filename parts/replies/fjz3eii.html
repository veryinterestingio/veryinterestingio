			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely in urban areas. Not out here! It's so cool. Starting in June we can sit out by the gravel road(we live at the top of a hill) and look at the rolling hills before you, you can see hundreds of thousands of them in the fields. It's so pretty and you can't replicate it with a picture(or I'm clueless how)</p></div>		</li>
