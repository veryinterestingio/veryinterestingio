<p>No we don't. We have no idea right now what space is. We know through experimentation that's it's not a substance, but we also know through experimentation that it can bend and warp. What 'it' is beyond that is pure conjecture right now, no one really knows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: yes. The space between molecules is the same whether it's on earth or not. Atoms/molecules on earth, even air, are much much denser together though. Go to high elevations and it's less so. The air all settles lower just like water settles in the oceans. </p>
<p>But really, when we drill down, we don't understand space, time, gravity...most of the fundamentals of our universe on a macro scale. We have a pretty good understanding of how to interact with gravity and we can predict a lot of behaviour and calculate gravity with extreme precision but we don't really get why/what it is. There is enough missing, that we're basically using models that we know are somehow fundamentally right and somehow fundamentally wrong/incomplete. It's as if there's a variable we know is missing, but we don't know what it is. That's dark energy. It's not necessarily anything, it's what has to exist to fix our equations. Scientists say &quot;look guys, we got a lot right. We can predict a lot of behaviour. There's just no way we're completely up the wrong tree. But there's something not quite right sometimes. Let's call that dark energy and try find out what it is.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that is basically what I knew and or figured but also other good info! Thanks! My high ass is just sitting here thinking about this stuff, then people are like, yeah, we actually don't know... And that just makes it worse ðŸ˜‚ that's a big one though... Like we get what gravity does, big objects attract smaller... basically... But why! How? Is the why or the how more important? I think why. Because the how is obviously magic.</p></div>		</li>
