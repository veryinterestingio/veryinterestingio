			<div class="markdown"><p>It probably has to do with how precious are the olive trees. They grow very slowly and only start producing olives after lots of years.
I am Spanish and olive oil is more expensive than wine because of that. So my guess is that it comes from that</p>
<p>Edit: as u/mki_ mentioned below you also need a lot of olives to get a litre of oil while the wine needs way less grapes. </p>
<p>Also, the process is more expensive (pressing and refining oil) than just letting it to ferment like the wine. </p>
<p>Overall it is a much more expensive product in almost all ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's that, but also the raw material/oil ratio. You need approximately a shitton of olives to produce a bottle of olive oil.</p>
<p>Edit: I think Spanish olive oil is actually the cheapest in europe though. Where I'm from they sell it in bottles saying &quot;Olivenöl - Olio extra vergine&quot; (Italian), on the back it says &quot;produced in the European Union&quot; and if you look for the producer's address in the smallprint it's somewhere in Andalucía.</p>
<p>No idea why they do that though. I, the central Europen target consumer, really don't care whether it's from Spain, Italy or Greece. As long as it's good product.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Andalucia in the south of Spain, lots of wineries have actually switched to growing olives instead of grapes as there's more money in it. The margins in the wine industry are getting very slim indeed, and there's lots of money to be made in the &quot;other&quot; oil industry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's even older than that.</p>
<p>In the Ilias (war for Troy), after Patroklos death, Achilles gives great funerary games. Maybe half the prizes and the most valuable ones are golden or bronze or whathaveyou metal cups and tripods. It's also seen on painted vases of the period. </p>
<p>So classical Greece took it from mythical Greece. </p>
<p>But then it follows as you said. Though the oil was usually given in ceramic amphorae or such with the metalware being their separate reward. </p>
<p>This is really fascinating, especially in the Panathenaean games where they gave out amphorae that were painted in two different styles. An antique one and a more modern style. And they even dated them!</p></div>		</li>
