<p>If you must have a COVID test for travel, this [PCR] is the only type that most governments will accept.</p>

<p>Just wanted to provide a different perspective here regarding travel requirements. The majority of countries in North America and Europe that require testing do not require PCR tests, but rather the quicker and cheaper antigen tests. PCR tests may be required in certain instances, like if you are traveling from a country with a particularly high case rate, but in general, antigen tests suffice for most border crossings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, by definition an antigen test looks for proteins on the surface of a viral particle, not antibodies (which the immune system creates as part of its response to infection). </p>
<p>An antibody test might come back positive, though; you don’t see antibody tests used to diagnose COVID because they can tell you only that you’ve been exposed to the virus or components of it, not whether you’re current infected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Antigen tests often look for the N protein, which is not at the surface of the virus. There's still none of those from a vaccination ofc</p></div>		</li>
