			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the habit of finishing a task you have begone. It's interesting to observe this with compulsory disorders such as nail biting as well. People who bite their nails don't do so constantly and all the time, but rather start due to some trigger (stress, a certain environment, high action scenes in a movie, excitement, embarrassment etc.) but then continue to bite that nail until it is completely cut back. In some bad cases, they will bite so much that the nail bleeds, and it actively hurts them, but they &quot;finish the job&quot; out of habbit.</p>
<p>So you start to scrape off the scab, but come to a place where the skin isn't fully healed, but pull it of anyways and regardless of pain due to prior condition to finish the task.</p></div>		</li>
