<p>No and yes, but I'm not sure why sperm would be on a submarine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In answer to the serious question (about pressure changes on a submarine for the sailors (seamen) involved), the answer is <strong><em>no.</em></strong></p>
<p>The air is kept at a fixed pressure, even on the deepest dives.  Normally all the hatches are kept sealed, even when running on the surface.  However, I definitely felt my ears pop when they opened the hatches for whatever reason, or needed to pull in air from outside such as to run the alternate power diesel generator or to take over normal air circulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The changes in pressure are normally from things like  compressing air to refill high pressure air banks .  To combat that when near the surface they often surface ventilate.  (Draw in air with the diesel intake fans) this helps keep pressure near atmospheric.</p></div>		</li>
