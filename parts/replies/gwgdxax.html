			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this the same reason I can pick up a radio station for 100 miles when I'm moving away from the station but can't pick it up until I'm 50 miles from it heading towards the signal? This is a question I've wanted to ask on reddit for years but did not know how to phrase it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FM or AM?</p>
<p>If FM, probably because your antenna is at the back of your vehicle, particularly if it's in the rear window.  The signal would need to pass through the car to get to the antenna, and this will weaken the signal slightly.  If conditions are such that signal in that whole 50-mile/80 km area is marginal, that could make all the difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of that is because of atmospheric bounce.  For example, being able to pick up a station that's 150 miles away, but you lose the station as you head towards it.  Then you pick it up again when you're 50 miles away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apart from this, there's also the position of the broadcasting antenna to take into account. If the antenna is near the east end of the tunnel, then the radio waves will propagate further into the east end of the tunnel than they will into the west end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's assuming your receiver actually has a PLL circuit.  PLLs aren't used for &quot;boosting&quot; or &quot;making it clearer&quot;, they're used for the actual demodulation of the signal.  But an FM radio may not have a PLL-based demodulator, it may have a simple discriminator or a diode-based ratio detector.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not disagreeing, but remember it's all in a single chip (unless a vintage vehicle) so the PLL is no real extra cost, and easier to tune digitally.</p>
<p>And PLL detectors &gt;do&lt; have better S/ N which can be described as &quot;makes it clearer&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
