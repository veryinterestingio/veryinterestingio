			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes..what you experienced is called a high block in medical parlance. Generally the high block will spare the phrenic nerve which supplies the diaphragm ( your main breathing muscle). In such cases you will be given high flow oxygen,the head end of your table will be raised and you will be given 'vocal anasthesia' about how breathing will get easier in 15 minutes or so. The breathing gets harder because the accessory muscles of respiration are paralysed.. with only the diaphragm doing the yeavy lifting..</p>
<p>Unfortunately,sometimes, the block will progress to a 'total block' where you will lose the ability to breathe.. fortunately we can quickly take up your work of breathing for you by sticking a tube down your throat after knocking you out.. we got your back, lady??</p>
<p>I'm referring to spinal anasthesia here..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For c-sections parents either receive epidural or spinal anesthesia. This is a local administration of anesthetic that only affects the nerve roots at the level of injection and below. For procedures in which you’re “asleep,” the meds that are given are acting centrally, i.e., in the brain. In that case your brain is doped up enough that it can’t breathe in its own, which is why you need the breathing tube and ventilator. </p></div>		</li>
