<p>a simple parabolic dish that's focusing ambient sound waves into your ear</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An easy visualization:</p>
<p>A wind scoop, like in the hood of a car.  Or a broad funnel in a narrow opening.</p>
<p>Sound waves that would normally go past are captured and bounce down the scoop/funnel.</p>
<p>That's what a parabolic dish does, it focuses a physically wider area.</p>
<p>The added noise is sound that we'd hear in other positions, all being directed into one spot. Hearing the same &quot;sound&quot; from different positions.</p></div>		</li>
