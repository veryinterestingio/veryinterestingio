<p>Have no emissions or have no emission control systems?</p>
<p>Those are vastly different things.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think this is accurate. The FIA has made some pretty big safety pushes in the last few decades to make race cars safer. While race cars don't have airbags, they generally have incredibly strong roll cages (or &quot;halos&quot; in the case of Formula cars), and 5- or 6-point harnesses instead of normal seat belts. There also used to be issues like manufacturers using dangerous designs for fuel cells, etc., but those have basically been eliminated. Plus, the drivers wear helmets and fire-proof suits. More thought has been put into track design to minimize impacts in areas where it's more likely to go off-track.</p>
<p>In the GT40 era, race car drivers died all the time, but it is far, far less common now.</p></div>		</li>
