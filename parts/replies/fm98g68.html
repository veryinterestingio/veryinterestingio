<p>There are many other reasons to have a fiscal calendar that is different. The point is that a fiscal calendar is purely a financial tool and there is no reason to have it match the calendar year.</p>

<p>One example for this, my startup, we set up our fiscal year so we can decide which personal tax year we can do our bonuses, which can helps with lowering our personal income taxes.</p>
<p>Really helpful when starting out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A fiscal year (or financial year, or sometimes budget year) is used in government accounting, which varies between countries, and for budget purposes. It is also used for financial reporting by businesses and other organizations. Laws in many jurisdictions require company financial reports to be prepared and published on an annual basis, but generally do not require the reporting period to align with the calendar year (1 January to 31 December). Taxation laws generally require accounting records to be maintained and taxes calculated on an annual basis, which usually corresponds to the fiscal year used for government purposes. The calculation of tax on an annual basis is especially relevant for direct taxation, such as income tax. Many annual government fees—such as Council rates, license fees, etc.—are also levied on a fiscal year basis, while others are charged on an anniversary basis.</p></div>		</li>
