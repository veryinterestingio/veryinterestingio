			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure &quot;efficient&quot; is the best word to use here. Resistive heating with electricity is technically 100% efficient by definition. Heat pumps are typically more cost effective to run though (it's easier to &quot;move&quot; heat from outside than it is to make &quot;new&quot; heat). The bigger problem is that electricity is more expensive than gas or oil in many situations.</p>
<p>There's totally been more and more of a push for heat pumps, especially as clean energy from grid and houses with solar panels on them get more common. I think there are still some issues with heat pumps being able to keep up in really cold areas though. In those cases, they fall back on resistive heating so it's still cheaper to use gas or oil to heat your house in lots of places.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well you also have to account that a gas furnace can convert ~90% of its gas into useful heat, which <em>is</em> less than resistive heating, however, in many places the electricity delivered to the home is created by a gas turbine running at ~70% efficiency (energy converted to elecricity) so if you have to use gas to heat the home, either by generating electricity or just by burning it in a furnace you'll actually burn less gas overall in the furnace. So given the current state of things as they are <em>right this moment</em> it makes more sense economically and environmentally to install a gas furnace in many areas.</p>
<p>As renewable energy sources come online and gas power generation is phased out, this meta will shift to all electric.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In places with abundant nuclear power, heat pumps are already the cheapest most environmentally friendly way to go.  Sadly the definition of “renewable energy” typically excludes nuclear. With the push for solar/wind to replace nuclear, the cold dark windless nights will be dependent on fossil fuels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah let me tell you, when it was 9 degrees in Austin my heat pump was useless. The auxilliary heat was running 100% of the time. Probably part of why there was so much load on the grid is how few people even have gas heat here, usually our emphasis is on the cooling side of the equation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are newer generations of heat pumps that work much better in the cold. But none of them are amazing below 0C yet. </p>
<p>There's also the fact that when it's 115 in Austin, you're cooling the place by 40 degrees. When it's 10, adding 40 degrees still leaves you colder than a witches tit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest efficiency difference happens in the car. Internal combustion engines have an overall efficiency of something like 25%, i.e. 3/4 of the energy in their fuel is lost (although some of that can be used to heat the car in winter). Electric motors are closer to ~80-90%. Even combined with the efficiency of an oil/gas power plant (~50%) you get a better efficiency, and of course the long-term strategy is an electricity grid that runs on renewables/nuclear power instead of coal/oil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>25% is a 'perfect world' figure for ICE efficiency.</p>
<p>If you're hammering down the motorway at peak efficiency for all the time you drive the car, you might see 25%, in the real world though, with sitting in traffic idling, tootling round town at 30mph, going faster than you should be on the motorway, accelerating hard, not being in the optimum gear or any number of other things which can reduce your efficiency, you are probably seeing about 15%</p>
<p>To illustrate this, compare the BTU of a gallon or regular gasoline, the mileage you get from it, and it's KWh equivalent.</p>
<p>A gallon of reference gasoline contains 114,000 BTU, this is equivalent to 33.41 KWh of electricity.</p>
<p>A big chunky electric car like the tesla model 3 gets 2.6 - 3.9 miles per KWh depending on who's figures you believe. Even at the low end that's equivalent to 86.86 miles per gallon, and it doesn't suffer from the sitting in traffic problem, if you aren't moving the motor isn't using electricity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've got a similar system.  The heat pump is there for cooling but has a reversing valve to heat the home during the winter.  The thermostat is set that if the outside temperature drops below 40F then it switches to natural gas.  </p>
<p>I upgraded from an older system that was all natural gas for heating.  My combined electric + natural gas bill dropped about $30 in the winter months.   I think the AFUE rating for the old system was 75 and the new one is 85.</p>
<p>My summer bills dropped $90 a month because I went from a SEER 10 to SEER 18 system with a two stage compressor that runs at &quot;low&quot; a lot of the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a ground heat pump and it’s amazing. No matter how hot or cold it gets outside I’ll be exchanging heat with ground that’s 40-60 F. Maybe it’s 117 F above ground and the pump is running night and day to keep up, but it’s efficiency doesn’t change much, just how often it runs. Almost everyone should consider one of these.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's great, but how efficient is the source of energy the heat pump uses? If we're talking natural gas, it is more efficient to heat a home by burning the gas directly than to burn it in a gas turbine, turn it into electricity, then run it to the heat pump.</p>
<p>It also depends entirely on what climate you're in. The coast of Northern California won't require A/C so a furnace is a better use of heating than using natural gas to generate electricity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it can be more efficient to burn the gas to generate electricity and then use the electricity to power a heat pump. Heat pumps make use of latent heat and can move several times more heat then burning the fuel directly would release. The key is that they aren’t generating the heat, simply running a compressor and creating conditions for heat to be transferred from the environment. </p>
<p>Granted you need ideal conditions for this but if we can generate the electricity in cleaner methods this can be a great way to cut emissions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>This isn't true in many cases.</p>
<p>A good combined cycle natural plant can reach up to 60% efficiency, transmission losses are typically on the order of 5%, so best case ~57% of the energy from that natural gas reaches the house as electricity.</p>
<p>Heat pumps typically operate at between 200 and 450% efficiency depending on the temperatures involved, which works out at 114-257% efficiency overall.</p>
<p>So on average, a heat pump powered by a high end natural gas plant will pump maybe twice as much heat energy into your house as burning that natural gas directly in your house would have.</p>
<p>For a less efficient power plant on the order of say 35%, it's not so clear cut. In very cold climates at the low end of the efficiency curve for heat pumps, you might only achieve ~66% efficiency vs burning directly, though in more moderate climates it would still be over 100%.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To add some more context, it's about 500g CO2/kWhr compared to about 1000g CO2/kWhr for coal. </p>
<p>Hydro is about 20g CO2/kWhr, solar is about 30g CO2/kWhr, and wind is about 10g CO2/kWhr.</p>
<p>So renewables are about an order of magnitude better than fossil fuel.</p></div>		</li>
