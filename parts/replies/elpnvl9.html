<p>On earth, there is an absolute end that stops the rain/hail from falling.  The water lands on the crust, and the evaporation cycle begins again.</p>
<p>On Saturn there is no ‘solid layer’ to stop the diamond dust (or whatever it technically is) from falling - so it should presumably fall until it reaches a temperature/density layer in which it’s light enough to stop falling.  Wouldn’t this then create a layer of diamond particles that could either coalesce into large chunks and fall through a more dense strata, or would it be more likely that the dust would re-evaporate and start the cycle all over again?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This is the more likely scenario, and is similar to other atmospheres where precipitation doesn't just hit a hard surface.</p>
<p>For example, we know it certainly rains water among the upper cloud decks of Jupiter. At some point that rain falls to a depth where it can no longer exist as liquid, and evaporates into water vapor. That water vapor then catches a ride back upwards on a rising convection cell, eventually condensing as a cloud higher up, and beginning the journey again.</p>
<p>We see the same thing on Venus, too. Although a lot of laymen-level information repeats the &quot;it rains sulfuric acid on Venus&quot; quip, that's not technically accurate - it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virga" target="_blank">virga</a>, not rain. The surface of Venus is much too warm to allow sulfuric acid to exist in liquid form, so the rain falling from the sulfuric acid clouds never gets anywhere near the surface, evaporating while still falling and rising back up again as vapor to form more clouds.</p>
<p>For that matter, we see plenty of water virga on Earth, too. Especially if you've been to a desert during the monsoon season, it's very common to see weak thunderstorms drop rain that just never makes it to the surface - the air it's passing through is so hot and dry that rain just evaporates before ever hitting the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also defining the &quot;surface&quot; of Venus is a little hard. It gets to such a high pressure that CO2 is <del>superfluidic</del> supercritical. Is that a high-pressure atmosphere, or a global CO2 ocean? It's a soft transition between the two regimes, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn’t carbon’s existence as a vapor be entirely dependent on its phase diagram and the pressure/temperature that exists at that level?</p>
<p>Carbon only becomes a vapor a temps greater than 4000 K and below 0.1 GPa.  Are there any layers of Saturn where both these conditions exist?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that 1) these diamond particles likely become buoyant well before reaching the solid core, and 2) to even get to the solid core, these diamond particles would have to pass through an ocean of liquid metallic hydrogen, which is almost certainly going to dissolve them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We're pretty sure there's a big difference between planets that formed inside the &quot;frost line&quot; and those that formed outside of it. Outside of 3 AU from the Sun (three times the distance between Earth and the Sun) is where water can stably exist as ice; inside that line, it can only exist as gaseous water vapor. </p>
<p>Now, imagine planets starting to form out of the solar nebula as the Sun starts to turn on. Inside the frost line, only rocky material can coalesce to form planets, maybe attracting some comets here and there or even a little water vapor, but really there's just not enough gravity to hold on to the vast quantity of hydrogen gas.</p>
<p>Outside the frost line, though, things are very different. Suddenly planets can form from rock <em>and</em> ice...and there's a lot of ice out there. It turns out you need a proto-planet of about 5 or 10 Earth-masses to have enough gravity to hold on to all that hydrogen gas. It ends up being only the proto-planets that can quickly grow big - with both rock <em>and</em> ice - that can hold on to that hydrogen. This is why we only see giant planets past the frost line in our Solar System.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily, I'm simplifying things here a bit, we assume that Gas giants started with a Rocky/Icy core. However its likely that due to the extreme pressure and heat at the center of a gas giant, that these cores have been partially or entirely dissolved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a super dumb question, but I’m going to ask it anyways because I’m curious. If Saturn did rain diamonds, then could a person hypothetically “harvest/take” them and sell it on earth? Or am I imagining the diamond rain all wrong and it’s not just chunks of diamonds falling from Saturn’s sky?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Diamonds are so common on Earth that transporting them from another planet would most definitely not be profitable. The only reason the prices are so high currently is due to prices being set artificially high combined with a controlled supply. They are essentially being drip fed through the market.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory, much is possible, but the diamonds would be created in areas of extreme heat and pressure. The question is how to reach them and I personally can't think of a way. Maybe we could build something so massive that withstands the pressure, but it has to leave again, that will be the problem then.</p></div>		</li>
