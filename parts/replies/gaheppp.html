			<div class="markdown"><p>Zero. And yes, I really mean that! With more than a trillion galaxies, with probably an average of more than a trillion planets each (and that's just the 'observable' universe), the chances of us being the most intelligent life-forms are vanishingly small (a fancy way of saying zero, in my view). Also, we should take into account the time factor. Earth is only 4.6 billion years old. There are other planets 'out there' that are anything up to about 13 billion years old. On some, evolution will have had time to proceed way beyond the point that it has reached on Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a similar question. If light speed is indeed insurmountable, do you think it probable that we will never find another intellgent species, or one more advancd than us?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I think we'll find one, and perhaps in the fullness of time more than one. But if there is no way round that apparent universal speed limit then we may never meet the but only communicate by radio. Even that will be hard because of the times involved in sending signals and receiving replies. No big problem  for the nearest exoplanet - Proxima b - time from sending to receiving reply would be less than 9 years. But the nearest intelligent life may be much further away. Let's hope that wormholes really exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would that then be paradoxical that if highly advanced civilizations exist and have evolved long before us, they would/could very likely come to us (hopefully visit but most likely conquer) as part of their studies, etc. Since they had billions more years to advance on other quantum phenomenon that we are struggling to grasp/prove?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a loooooot of space out there. If an intelligent species develops 50,000 lightyears away, they might not have developed far enough to reach us. And if we detected alien signatures very far away we wouldn't be able to do much to contact them</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is part of the Fermi paradox. I suggest looking it up on YouTube. The best video (well it’s in 2 parts) is made by an animation/educational channel called kurzegsagt. I most likely misspelled but you will know it’s the one when you see it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue either a significant non-zero value for this or that we simply don't have the data yet. We might just be the first based on the age of the universe - have to give time for heavier elements to be made, accumulate into planets, around the right stars in the right part of the right kind of galaxies etc etc etc. I know there have been estimates of this but they are based on so many unknowns it seems to me we are still just making it up.  And even after all that we don't really know how likely evolution is to take hold. And we don't know if evolution would ever produce an intelligent animal, nor do we have any evidence that intelligence can be any &quot;more&quot; than what we have. </p>
<p>I don't think it would surprise me to find intelligent life somewhere else in the universe, but it also wouldn't surprise me if we discovered we are the first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to put the number of planets we are talking about into perspective: if you could check one planet in 1 second for life, you would need more than a million times the age of the universe to check every planet out there. </p>
<p>The chance that none of those made inteligent life, is extremely small. The universe is just unfathomable large, making even the most unlikely scenarios almost a certainty.</p></div>		</li>
