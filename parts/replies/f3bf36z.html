I only really saw autumn colors in my country for the first time a couole of years ago as I was traveling east, but it was just as it started to turn. The norwegian west coast is so windy it all literally blows off the trees before it gets a chance to turn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/how-weather-affects-fall-colors-3443701" target="_blank">You thought right.</a> The temperature isn't what signals chlorophyll to stop making its way to leaves. It's entirely the amount of sunlight which is why warm and cool falls still lead to leaves changing color at about the same time.</p>
<p>The weather does however affect the other activation of chemicals so the vibrancy and the overall color of what the leaves change to is affected by weather. Also a windy storm will knock a ton of leaves off if it's late enough in the year so that can affect the overall amount of time we have the foliage</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We get tons of wind and often early snow here. Sometimes leaves barely have a chance to turn colour before the majority of them are just knocked off the tree. This year's been mostly raking green leaves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sunlight triggers the chlorophyll to stop being produced but temperature plays an important role as well. Indoor grows will purposely add in night temperature swings of 10+ degrees lower in order to mimic the cooler fall nights. This has an effect on the creation of pigments such as the reds, purples, ambers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention soil/water alkalinity and chemistry... which probably has more to do with the color of plants leaves than any factor other than chlorophyll.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That can be one of the triggers, but there's a lot of chemistry involved in the leaves changing colours so temperature ranges likely have an affect as well.</p></div>		</li>
