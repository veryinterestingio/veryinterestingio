			<div class="markdown"><p>Where I live (deep South Texas) the streets had to be built cheap and fast because the city grew quickly from 1930 to 1980. So they were paved with asphalt with oyster shell in it, the shell being replaced with gravel in the late 1970s for better traction. </p>
<p>We live in a hot climate, so asphalt pavement warps under the weight of traffic. This causes cracks, washouts, and rapid failure of the road surface. So the plan now is to build main arteries with concrete. Yes, it's definitely noisier. But the streets will last much longer in this climate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: Asphalt melts when exposed to jet fuel...</p>
<p>we learned this while temporary stationed at an RAF base where they used it to pave some side areas where jets don't normally go...</p>
<p>Well, that was the edge of where we parked our jets and after a minor fuel leak, we came out the next morning to find a jet half sunk into the ground. The tire had sunk into the asphalt several inches and apparently only stopped when it hit ground. The jet had to be specially towed out, took a huge chunk of the flight line with it, and the whole strut of the jet ended up needing to get replaced.</p>
<p>That was the 3rd worst incident during the 2 weeks of that TDY...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So as far as financial damage this was really like the 2nd worst, but since there was no threat to life and limb I call it the 3rd.</p>
<p>2nd goes to the dropped radar transmitter. Its a part for the jet that weighs about 300lbs and has to be changed by hand. It's lifted onto a stand and then has to somehow be lifted off that into a transport box, by walking it one person at a time down a ladder. Well, while attempting to get down said ladder, the first person lost his balance and fell backward, to hear him tell it he briefly considered trying to just catch the part on his stomach by reacted to toss it sideways at the las second. The result was the part too a softball sided chunk out of the concrete, not the asphalt (we'd moved well clear of that) the solid concrete. If he hadn't been able to push it sideways, it probably woulda done some serious damage.</p>
<p>The worst one fuck up was on weapons flight though. The jet is equipped with bombracks that have a large piston like part that pushes bombs out and away so they clear the jet. While running a test on these that accidentally caused one to fire. Normally they fire with as much force as a shotgun blast into the side of a steel bomb, without that weight to slow down the piston, well it blasted free, smashed against the ground and shattered into 3 pieces, one went straight back up and punctured through the wing of the jet, another skipped 200ft down the flightline and smashed into our work truck denting the hell out of the side, and the 3rd was found over 1000ft away on the far side of the aprons. The 3 weapons troops who were standing around the thing when it blew up, were miraculously all okay.</p></div>		</li>
