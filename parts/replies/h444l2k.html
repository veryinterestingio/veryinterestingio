			<div class="markdown"><p>But to say there is such thing as 'good luck' or 'bad luck' just doesn't make sense to me, chance isnt good or bad it's just random, a way of simplifying larger statistical occurrences. It seems like it's just people's subconscious projections of patterns that aren't really there. Like there is some hidden magical force controlling everything. I guess that's easier for some people to believe than nondescript chaos.</p></div>		</li>
