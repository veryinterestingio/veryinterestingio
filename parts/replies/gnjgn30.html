<p>That is an excellent question that would take a book to answer. There are really two questions here, which I’ve numbered above, plus a third that should be added: (3) When should eradication be attempted?<br />
(3) It is important to distinguish between two sorts of targets (a) a recently established non-native population that has not spread widely, and (b) a species that has already spread to a substantial area. In the first case, it is critically important to act quickly, even in the absence of substantial research on whether a particular eradication effort will work. Shoot first and ask questions later! Here is a paper that lays out the reasons for acting quickly in such cases:<br />
Simberloff, D. (2003) How much population biology is needed to manage introduced species? Conserv Biol 17:83-92.<br />
(2) In case (b) above, speed is not so crucial, and the possibility of eradication, including research on various possible technologies to achieve eradication, should be considered in the context of a broad consideration of both eradication and, by contrast, possible means to keep the population at low levels even if it is not eradication. A host of considerations come into play, determined by the specific invader at issue and the biological and socioeconomic context in which it is established. Here is a general reference on the sorts of factors that should be considered:<br />
Simberloff, D. (2014) Biological invasions: What’s worth fighting and what can be won? Ecol. Engineering 65:112-121.<br />
(1) There has been substantial incremental progress on more traditional methods of eradication (e.g., the Judas goat technique, the use of toxic baits for rodents), and several new approaches are under development based on genetics, especially molecular genetics, some of which entail heritable changes in the target organism but others of which do not. Here is a recent paper describing many of these approaches for aquatic invaders; the same approaches are being developed for terrestrial invaders as well:<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there are dialects, sometimes they just get sorted into categories. But usually, yes, we do have to quantify specific parts of the song! There are the obvious things, like how many notes are in the song. We also measure things like maximum and minimum frequency, length of notes, speed of notes in trills, and bandwidth, among other variables. There are debates about the best way to measure and categorize songs for different contexts, though.</p>
<p>One issue is whether the things we're measuring are relevant. We could show that one population sings consistently 0.5 Hz higher than another, but it's totally irrelevant if the birds can't tell the difference. Or maybe they notice, but don't think it's important. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that machine learning is becoming a more common method for discriminating between animal vocalizations. On one hand, it's useful not to assume that the only things that matter are things that we can see, so machine learning can look for patterns that we wouldn't otherwise look for. On the other hand, machine learning can be a really powerful tool for discrimination and categorization, so it's possible that the computer could find differences that the animals literally can't hear or just don't care about.</p>
<p>I study dialects, and while in some cases it's really obvious that two songs are different and belong in different categories, other songs fall in between. Historically, song dialects have been sorted visually using spectograms (I don't know if I can attach a picture, but it's worth googling &quot;bird song spectrograms&quot;). It's not a bad method, since it works for most songs, but some people argue that it's too subjective. I recently read a paper about &quot;fuzzy clustering&quot; that categorizes songs into dialects using an algorithm, but assigns a score denoting how confidently the algorithm assigned the song into that category.</p></div>		</li>
