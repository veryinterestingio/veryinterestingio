			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this: classes of organic structures, like alcohols, are like LEGO sets that all have one piece in common:</p>
<p><a href="https://kaiserscience.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/ethanol.jpg" target="_blank">Ethanol</a></p>
<p><a href="http://image1.slideserve.com/2263108/methanol-structure-n.jpg" target="_blank">Methanol</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.lobachemie.com/uploads/structure/123-51-3.gif" target="_blank">Isoamyl alcohol</a>...</p>
<p>They all have that &quot;-OH&quot; group on one end, which more or less means they're an alcohol of some sort.</p>
<p>Further adding to this: some formulas are long enough that you can change the arrangement of the parts (and how the chemical will &quot;behave&quot; under certain conditions) without changing the number of atoms, like with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyl_alcohol" target="_blank">amyl alcohols</a> - it's kind of like taking apart that LEGO plane and making a LEGO helicopter or boat out of all the parts without wasting anything or needing anything extra.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I asked a buddy's dad, who was a chemist, what the difference was between methanol, ethanol, and isopropyl alcohol. He was kind of tipsy so he drew the chemical formulas for them on a bar napkin. They were labled &quot;poison&quot;, &quot;poison&quot;, and &quot;tasty&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They’re really all poisons to an extent. </p>
<p>Methanol will make you blind. You need chelation to get rid of it. In alcohol distillation, this is the head and caused blindness when people brewed at home during distillation</p>
<p>Ethanol makes you sick, hurts your brain, and makes you lethargic and gives hangovers. But it’s hard to dangerously overdo somewhat</p>
<p>Rubbing alcohol will get you drunk but it’ll destroy your lover</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that I'm doubting you (I'm not very well versed in chemistry), but it's my understanding that -OH only has room for one other bond. I'm curious how it could be anything other than terminal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I know HOH is special, but can it be considered an alcohol or is there another time?</p>
<p>From my reading it looks like carbon may be necessary, but the OH is the &quot;alcohol group&quot; so is it really.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An alcohol is defined as an organic compound with an -OH group, and the term &quot;organic compound&quot; is defined as a molecule that has a carbon atom with a covalent bond. If, as in the case of water, you don't have carbon, it's not an organic compound, so isn't an alcohol. Basically, to be an alcohol it needs to be C-OH, not just -OH.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>nomenclature groups like that are really only useful bc they represent families of compounds with somewhat predictable and similar behavior. it’s not useful to think of water as an alcohol because it doesn’t follow the behavior trends of small alcohols</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Other people have answered that but there are several acid/base definitions that serve different purposes and use cases. But, fun fact, under one of these definitions, water is regarded as both an acid and a base for its ability to donate H+ protons and OH- groups.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's the preferred IUPAC name and there are names that we chemists use. While in this case ethanol is more commonly used, there are plenty of examples where the IUPAC name is not.</p>
<p>Besides, there's no confusion possible with ethyl alcohol.</p></div>		</li>
