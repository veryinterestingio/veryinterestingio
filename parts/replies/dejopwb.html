			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my music + the brain books tells me that the human mind LIKES order and predictability, but derives pleasure from slight disruptions to that order.  So if you had a predictable rhythm on a single pitch, your brain would be flatlining like the music.  But add a rhythmic change or a pitch change to one of the notes and you'd get a tick on the brain scale.  All of the non-expected parts of music are little ticks on the scale from the mind, and we love it.  </p>
<p>Yes, the mind will also try and interpret any seemingly organized sound as language.   Ever hear a pattern and you try and figure out what it means? that's almost biological.  </p>
<p>EVERYTHING ELSE IS LEARNED SOCIALLY.  Instrumentation, tonality, very little of theoretical music is inherent in the mind, but pattern recognition and the like is. </p>
<p>Edit to add more thought: IIRC, research HAS been done with people from cultures around the world, and it has been found that there are common tonal patterns (scales) and combinations (chords) with rhythmic similarities for all people.  THESE would be ingrained to our being it seems.  Steady beat, perfect intervals, and it seems to be believed that the brain finds certain resonances universally pleasing.  Perhaps it has to do with the physics of it?  The octave is two pitches whose frequency has a 2:1 ratio.  The fifth 3:2.  The unison 1:1.  Perhaps the rhythm is in time to the unconscious internal clocks our bodies run on (heartbeat, digestions, breathing, walking, blinking, etc).  Music theory has deemed certain intervals more abrasive than others, but at one point the perfect fourth was considered not as harmonious as the perfect fifth or octave.  What used to be unacceptable is now acceptable but only because we have grown to use it socially.  The 7th.  The fourth.  The augmented fourth.  The minor second.  We have learned how to play these intervals not only for their own merit, but to play them against the human (western) mind to cause tension and release into something more relaxing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really blows my mind that our music could sound so different from what we're used to. I don't know exactly frequencies, but almost all of the music that we hear in the US is based off of a scale that was basically just randomly picked a long time ago. It has a pretty significant link to math, but that still doesn't make it the only frequency of sounds that can sound &quot;right&quot; to our brains. Why not use keys that are 4 Hertz slower.</p>
<p>Math sounds good to our brain. We are incredibly good at recognizing patterns. And there are tons of musical scales/modes that don't sound similar to every pop song you hear. Our brains are amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP said context processing is also important. It's extremely important. A computer could one day spit out Beethovens 9th, but we get real pleasure from knowing the man was deaf when he wrote it. Next time you listen to rap, soul, punk, house, whatever, pay attention to how much your emotional response to it is based on your imagination of the person, community, environment it relates to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I have to respond to this, because I am so confused by what you wrote.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>What?</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>This is the first thing that confused me.  Do you mean the tonality that dominates the western culture?  If so, it's not random at all.  And it was not just picked.  It's goes back centuries, perhaps even a millenia of evolution dating back to Pythagorus and the ancient greeks and romans.  Influences of government, religion, cultural wars, population, etc. have shaped and changed the tonality we use today.  </p>
<p>If you think that all music, even all popular music, exists in one key, you're wrong.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why not use keys that are 4 Hertz slower.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are referring to the standard tuning system of A=440, that isn't random  either.  It's coerced by corporations, climate, and culture.  And 440 is not the only tuning system used.  442 is extremely common.  But over the centuries the tuning system measurement has always fluctuated.  We are in no way at an &quot;arrival&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And there are tons of musical scales/modes that don't sound similar to every pop song you hear.</p>
<p>And there are tons of musical scales/modes that don't sound similar to every pop song you hear. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, of course. This is why we have..genres.</p>
<p>I'm sure you are saying something good.  I know you are.  But I am so lost in the writing.  Please help clarify.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you have some cash to spare and are interested in the evolution of music throughout time from almost the beginning, I highly recommend Robert Greenberg's &quot;How to Listen to and Understand Great Music&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also interesting to hear that smell cuts directly to where it's processed, and not through the part of the brain responsible for emotions, because smells don't really evoke an emotional response in me, unless they're triggering some sort of emotionally charged <em>memory</em>. Whereas music can evoke an emotional response from me without being linked to any past memory; even if I'm listening to a beautiful or sad song for the first time, it will still evoke emotion. I think this is the most interesting bit of information from this whole thing and really shows how music is unique from something like smell in triggering an emotional response </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My brother and I used to get US toys from one of my dad's US mates. We got SEGA handhelds and other fun stuff including a pair of toy walkie-talkies that really were too cool and had a strong 30m coverage. Anyway, these two receivers had a strange smell (best I can describe it is a weird mix of plastic and that 'foreign' smell you get when someone opens their luggage). We had these around 1995. Loved it to bits my brother and I. </p>
<p>Two years ago at my cousin bros wedding my mate's Mrs was showing a new bag she had bought and how it had a weird smell that just won't leave. I took a whiff and was instantly reminded of the receivers. So strong was the connection that I immediately told my mates what it reminded me of and joked whether my brother would still be able to recall it. So we called him over (he was on the other side of the hall) and after half a whiff, in a heartbeat he went: hey, this smells exactly like those receivers we had back in 95!! </p>
<p>Never felt more closer to my bro! Truly a childhood well spent! ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is totally weird but I'm owning up to it. I have a bottle of a glittery body spray I bought from 'the limited too' in the late 90s. I haven't thrown it out because I will open it up to smell it occasionally because it is so nostalgic of my early teenage years. It still smells just as good as it did when I bought it 20 years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered about this. I'm nearly 22 and at Uni and my roommate brought this white roll of bin bags and the smell of them takes me back to playing CoD4 when it came out, no worries or stress just pure enjoyment (as I recall I think my mum had to buy these flimsy white ones for some reason, I remember seeing them in my peripherals while using the M40A3 on crash, good times)... I now sometimes sneak a smell of them to take me back just for a second, that free feeling...at when cod was good. Now it's shit and adulting sucks balls.</p></div>		</li>
