			<div class="markdown"><p>If we limited the spread, wouldn't we also limit mutation and atleast slow the formation of new strains?  Over time could this significantly reduce the number of viable/infectious human strains to a point where flu vaccines are more effective than the standard 50 percent, or is that just the nature of the virus?</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's possible. On the other hand, if there are a few individual virons (?) that survive the vaccine, then they have less competition in moving into new hosts. </p>
<p>This video is of bacteria, and not quite to the point, but it does demonstrate how diseases can mutate and come roaring back even if the treatments should theoretically keep them under control.</p>
