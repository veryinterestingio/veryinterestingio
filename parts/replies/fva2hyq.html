			<div class="markdown"><p>Retrain yourself to expect joy from other sources. I finally convinced myself that finishing building my storage shed and cabinet would improve my quality of life so much that I should look forward to the task, as it benefits me. Earlier today I wrote a post (tangentially) about humanity’s tendency towards seeking instant gratification; sometimes it is hard for us to think “rewardingly” about things we perceive as long(er) term. Think cooking a massive family dinner and the effort involved held against just eating some potato chips. Both “feed” you, only one is very nutritive. My advice? Do what I do. At first just objectively, arbitrarily work on a task a little, until you see proof of return on investment. I’ve noticed once I show my subconscious that something is worthwhile, I get a lot less of that laziness static!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That mix seems to me like ADHD. I've been recently diagnosed with ADHD because of depression and procrastination/lazyness.</p>
<p>Most poeple know that ADHD make you distracted but it can also drain so much energy to consentrate that you start dalaying to &quot;survive&quot; the day.</p>
<p>That mix of depression and proscrastination might be a symptome of something else and not a dopamine addiction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not as mysterious as it sounds. A better way to describe it is that dopamine is a neurotransmitter that drives your decisions. Its what gives you a feeling of motivation. It’s not a reward.</p></div>		</li>
