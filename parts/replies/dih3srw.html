<blockquote>
<p>it is now practically impossible to mine anything significant with non-specialized hardware </p>
<p>in 1 month you would produce 0.00019130 BTC, which is about 15 cents</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What's depressing is that was written in 2013.</p>
<p>Why is anyone even bothering?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well in the early days it was feasible i believe now most people mining bitcoins just use asics which can make much more money while using much less power when it comes to bitcoin. Thing is bitcoin isn't the only virtual currency and new ones have popped up that are not as popular and are still worth mining with GPU's. I believe Ethereum is the current trend for gpu miners. I also think it just comes down to the many of the miners being gamers that just wanna make a few extra bucks by leaving their computers on honestly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually what sparked my question. I was reading an article about there being a new type of cryptocurrency that was resistant to  the special ASIC hardware which necessitated people going back to mining on GPUs and resulting in AMD graphics cards becoming sold out and hard to find in most places. How are GPUs better in this case if there's special mining hardware that exists for it? Isn't special mining hardware doing what the GPU was doing but better?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yepppers.</p>
<p>You kind of already have the hardware just sitting there... doing nothing.  For a lot of gamers the cost of entry into mining is only the electrical bill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had an apartment in 2015 with unlimited internet and electricity included. Housemate had a collection of craptops and salvage computers mining. When it cost him nothing and used equipment he didn't care about thrashing the only downside was the amount he made per hour effort of setting up the craptops was abysmally low.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;mining&quot; word is only used for illustration purpose. What you are really doing is verifying the transaction of the whole network, ensuring the integrity of transactions. </p>
<p>In cryptocurrency, the ledge is not kept by a central bank but by everybody and everybody inside the network will check every single transfers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From how I understand it works somewhat like this: You solve really complex problems, this is mining. When they are solved you get x currency. Because they're complex the market isn't flooded, this (among other things) gives them value.</p></div>		</li>
