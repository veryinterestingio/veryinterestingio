			<div class="markdown"><p>The 3:2 conversion to get from &quot;about 24 fps&quot; to &quot;about 30 fps&quot; also affects the image, resulting in a <em>slightly</em> blurrier, more film-like, quality. They basically &quot;make up&quot; a frame every five frames by combining two other frames, which changes the perception of motion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sort of. It does have an affect on what you see because of the added interlaced frames, but it is in no way altering the motion blur captured on each individual frame. That blur inherent on each frame has more to do with the overall look than the number of frames. If you played 3 video clips with some kind of stable steady movement, like a long slow camera pan, and your clips were</p>
<p>a) 24fps played natively at 24fps</p>
<p>b) 24fps played at 30fps utilizing a 3:2 pulldown</p>
<p>c) 30fps playing natively at 30fps</p>
<p>clips a and b would look the most similar. Only very discerning eyes can pick up those added pulldown frames, and they're only really apparent on things that are moving at just the right not to fast/not to slow speed on screen</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not about the motion blur, it’s about the way each of those frames are recorded and the difference is a lot more like 24fps versus 60fps. 24 vs 30 is imperceptible. </p>
<p>I posted elsewhere but prior to HD, soaps, news, sports and a lot of shows were shot at 30fps, yes, but those were interlaced frames. There were actually 60 “half resolution” fields recorded per second. </p>
<p>We just count the full resolution cycle because these fields can either be recorded at the same time (30p) or one after the other (30i), but in the standard definition era, they’re always displayed one after the other. </p>
<p>So basically, there are actually 60 half resolution “frames” (we just don’t call those frames, we call them fields) and that higher “field rate” conveys more motion info to your brain and seems “smoother” because it basically is. </p>
<p>Today, I think soaps shoot in 60fps or 30 interlaced frames simply because it has that “classic soap opera look”. </p></div>		</li>
