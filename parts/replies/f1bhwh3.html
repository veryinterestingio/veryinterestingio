<p>If you measure the same angle to each raindrop from your eyeball, the resulting raindrops will be in a circle.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rainbows are arcs because that's the shape created by a constant angle between you and the sun. Imagine 2 cones on top of each other, with the same base, but different heights. The top of the tall cone is the sun, and the top of the small cone is you. Start from the sun, go to any point on the perimeter of the base, then to you. Every path makes the same angle. </p>
<p>If you take 2 points and try to do the same with a line, every path creates a different angle, apart from symmetry at the center.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The picture is a bit misleading since it looks like the Sun's light comes in at different angles in different parts of the atmosphere. Since the Sun is so far away all raindrops will be hit by the light at the same angle. </p>
<p>Except for that the picture is still accurate</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The picture shows single internal reflection, or the main rainbow. There's also double internal reflection, which happens at a slightly different angle.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking there can be an arbitrary number of internal reflections, but since light escapes the drop with each reflection the resulting rainbows are progressively dimmer.</p></div>		</li>
