			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks so much for your question! There are many ways that citizens can contribute to coral reef conservation. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Vote! Coral reefs are under threat from many environmental stressors, so voting for politicians that advocate for protecting the environment and oceans is a great way to contribute to positive change on a large scale. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get involved in a citizen science project to help plant corals on degraded reefs. If you are a snorkeler or SCUBA diver, you can join organizations like Rescue a Reef and Coral Restoration Foundation on coral restoration expeditions and get hands-on experience planting corals! </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce, reuse, recycle! Coral reefs and other ocean ecosystems are plagued by plastic pollution, so reducing your consumption of single-use plastics is a great way to help reduce pollution that makes its way to the ocean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Donate to organizations that help conserve and restore coral reefs.  </p>
</li>
<li>Talk to your friends and family about how they can make more sustainable choices. </li>
</ol>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can help in many ways. Even if you're not near the ocean and even if you don't think it is help coral directly! I'm in Dallas, but I've been able to help by taking part in lake clean-ups and river bed clean ups!</p>
<p>Also anyone can help by using less plastic, reducing your carbon emissions--- AKA take public transport, ride a bike, use less electricity... You can also eat sustainably caught seafood, reach out to your legislators and ask for more Marine Protected Areas or limits on fishing. -Tabitha</p></div>		</li>
