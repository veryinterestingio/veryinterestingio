<p>Sure there are subtleties like... we’re not sure if the universe is infinite, but it certainly does look like it.</p>
<p>EDIT: And even if it <em>isn't</em> infinite, the universe is still everywhere that can even be a where, so there's no such thing as a place where the universe isn't.</p>
<p>So yeah, &quot;The universe already exists everywhere&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't even know if the big bang was the start of the universe, it just was the start of the observable universe. For all we know there could be big bangs happening every day, just so far apart that they never reach each other. Perhaps the big bang was not the start of the universe, just something comparable to false vacuum decay. We just don't know what is outside the observable universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because there is a difference between the actual universe and the observable Universe. 99% of the time when people talk about the universe they're talking about the tiny fraction of it that we can observe, and not the whole thing.  </p>
<p>So the OBSERVABLE universe was super tiny 13.5 billion years ago but the ACTUAL universe might have been infinite, we just don't know.  </p>
<p>The only thing we know for sure is that the universe is \~13.5 billion year old. We know this because it looks like everything is expanding right now. Scientists measured the rate of expansion and 'played the tape in reverse' to figure out that everything in the universe would have existed at one tiny point \~13.5 billion years ago.</p>
<p>It would be like watching a car speeding away at 60mph and figuring out that it left Los Angeles 2 hours ago.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Everywhere we look in the night sky we can see galaxies, going back 13.5 billion years. If the Universe were smaller than that, we'd see black patches in the sky where Galaxies could theoretically exist, but don't. We don't see that. We see matter as far as it is possible to see given the 13.5 billion years.</p>
<p>What is beyond that? We don't know.</p>
<p>We know that the OBSERVABLE universe was super tiny 13.5 billion years ago, but for all we know super ultra-dense matter extended beyond that for billions of lightyears.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine two objects on conveyor belts pointed in opposite directions. If the two objects are tethered together with, say, a bungee chord and the conveyor belt is slippery, then they will stay the same relative distance apart. If the conveyor belt is not slippery and the tether is weak, then the tether will snap and the objects will move apart.</p>
<p>On a small scale, the expansion of space is easy to overcome and the forces holding atoms, molecules, and even galaxies together is relatively strong. On a large scale, gravity is not strong enough to keep galaxies from drifting away from each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't fully understand this. Here is some quick and dirty math that doesn't make sense to me:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The rate of expansion is 70kilometers per second per million parsecs.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So that is 0.00007 kilometers per second per parsec (70/1,000,000).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>0.00007 kilometers is 70 millimeters.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Our nearest star(Proxima Centauri) is 1.3 parsecs away (rounding it to 1 for easy math). So we should expect 70 millimeters of expansion between us and Proxima Centauri every second. There are 31,556,952 seconds in a year so that is 2,208,986,640 milimeters or 22,000 kilometers of expansion between us and our nearest star every year.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>That much distance should be easily detectable even with gravity playing a MUCH larger role in our distance.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So... I don't know. I need to do my own ELI5 about this!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple things:</p>
<p>1) you have a factor of 10 error in your conversion from mm to km, it’s only 2,200 km per year</p>
<p>2) I’m not an expert here, but from what I understand when you use parallax to measure the distance to a star, your accuracy is only about 0.001 parsecs, or about 30 billion km, so there’s no way we could measure a change in distance of only 2000 km.  It would take 150 million years for the distance between Earth and Proxima Centauri to grow enough for us to measure the change with the accuracy of current measurement techniques.</p></div>		</li>
