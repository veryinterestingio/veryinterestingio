			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth looking at the WHO reports to track Polio outbreaks over time. There was a point l, just a few years ago, that Polio was limited to just Nigeria and Pakistan. We were on the cusp of eradication. However, anti vaccination backlash in these communities and unsafe worker conditions for groups providing the vaccines ended all that. It's really very sad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. This was the proverbial nail in the coffin. Anti vaccination sentiment was rising for years in these populations (it turns out many people don't like outsiders telling them how to take care of their children).</p>
<p>This story is so sad on so many levels. We were so close and now that the trust is broken, people are dying. Polio health care workers have been murdered on several occasions. Just heartbreaking.</p></div>		</li>
