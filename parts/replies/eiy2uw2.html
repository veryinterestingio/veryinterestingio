<p>I didn't before but now I do; is this theoretically possible? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We generally understand most of the chemistry that takes place in the formation of wood. The problem is that it is extremely complicated and has to be precisely coordinated in a way, that only living cells can do. We know the processes, but we can't replicate them.</p>
<p>So if you want to turn ash to wood, your best bet would be to plant a new tree in the ash. Then you'll end up with new wood consisting at least partially of the atoms of the ash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus just by statistics alone some of the CO2 that was released during the burning will be taken into the plant for photosynthesis and become part of the new plant, even if just a molecule or two. The reverse reaction is indeed planting a new tree.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't this an issue of entropy more than the actual chemical processes? My memory of thermodynamics is incredibly shaky, but in burning wood you're not just going through a chemical transition, but you're releasing all that energy stored in chemical bonds into heat. So it's not just a matter of putting an equivalent amount of heat back into the system even if it were theoretically possible to reverse the chemical processes, but you'd also need a whole lot of additional energy to account for the fact that you're pushing the reaction in the &quot;wrong&quot; direction and that needs to be offset by a greater increase in entropy somewhere else. Like how a freezer appears to violate laws of entropy by moving heat from a cold place to a warm one, but only because there's substantial extra work being put into the system and it's counterbalanced by a much larger increase in entropy which means the system as a whole is still increasing </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes especially in a reaction like combustion where not only is it exothermic but also is exergonic (spontaneous) which means that it has an increase in entropy and a release of energy </p></div>		</li>

<p>Typically between 0.43 and 1.82 percent of the mass of burned wood (dry basis) results in ash.</p>
