<p>The gene was already long dormant by the time that homo sapiens differentiated from our nearest ancestor, and our metabolisms actually increased with brain size/density because our brains use an enormous amount of energy.</p>
<p>But at one time, our distant ancestors at the very least didn't have to worry about Scurvey.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was reading Good Calories Bad Calories by Gary Taubes and he mentions this, and that it might be a possibility that carbohydrates can make us urinate all of the vitamin C from our bodies.</p>
<p>He mentions the Inuit getting all their nutrients from a mostly meat diet and also that the men in the Brittish Navy who suffered from scurvy had a diet consisting of mostly biscuits, rice, and other refined carbohydrates because of their long and stable shelf life.</p></div>		</li>
