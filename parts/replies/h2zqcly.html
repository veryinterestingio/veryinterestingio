<p>Bottom line, a lot of the current medication <em>helps your immune system</em> deal with a disease, rather than the medication directly dealing with the disease.</p>

<p>Examples/sources? Which (classes of) drugs are you talking about here?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that I'm not a doctor, but from my understanding, antibiotics for example would be a class of drugs that &quot;directly deal&quot; with infections, whereas something like anti-inflamatory or pain reducers would be &quot;help the body / help the immune system&quot; type of medications.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, even with antibiotics your immune system is the real hero. Many times of antibiotics work by damaging the infections ability to reproduce quickly, slowing down the invasion to a level where the immune system can overpower it. I'm not a doctor, so I believe <em>some</em> antibiotics do actually kill the microorganism, but mostly they just weaken them and let your immune system do the heavy lifting.</p></div>		</li>
