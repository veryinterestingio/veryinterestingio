			<div class="markdown"><p>Other top comments failed to mention the importance of the momentum (both magnitude and direction). Moon being massive doesn't have to do with anything in this qustion (since still it is much lighter than the central body, the Earth). Any object, a paperclip or the planet Mercury, would be in the same orbit as Moon, if they were to have same velocity and position Moon has.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If anything the moon being massive helps answer this question. The moon has its own gravity that is substantial and has a pulling effect on earth. That's why the earth doesn't travel a straight path through space but has a wobble to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the real answer. </p>
<p>You could apply a momentary radial force to the moon and it would &quot;jump&quot; too. It would come back to it's original position because the radial force does not change velocity in the tangential direction, which is what's needed for a permenant altitude change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you had a satellite in orbit at X altitude, and applied momentary thrust in a perfectly radial direction, it would travel to X+Y altitude before returning back to X? </p>
<p>What if you constantly apply thrust, but always perfectly radially?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/70357/change-of-orbit-with-radial-impulse" target="_blank">This website</a> helped me visualize what's going on. Essentially, your orbit would become elliptical. But if you constantly apply thrust radially outward, you'd eventually crash into earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This would essentially be a force acting opposite to gravity, decreasing its strength. Bodies that experience less gravity fall into orbit either at higher speeds or further away from the earth. You’re not increasing the speed of the moons orbit with this thrust, and therefore it’s new orbit would be further away if you apply a constant thrust.</p>
<p>However, with a momentary thrust, you haven’t changed the strength of the gravity experienced by the moon or accelerated its orbit - really, you’ve just moved it further away. It will always come back towards the distance that balances its speed around the earth with the pull of gravity, though it probably won’t actually ever get there due to all of the other tiny things affecting it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By “original position” do you mean the moon would return to its original orbit? If a momentary radial force were applied to the moon it would still change its orbit and make it elliptical. However, since a radial force doesn’t change angular momentum, the total energy of the system would remain constant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was wrong. </p>
<p>So the radial force would change the direction and magnitude of velocity. The tangential component, however would remain constant. </p>
<p>Since h=rxv  so any change in direction or magnitude of velocity results in a different angular momentum and a different orbit</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you add energy to the orbit by adding some force then you will increase the Moon's velocity which will alter the Moon's orbit and it won't really 'jump' but just follow a new path.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah you're right. Your velocity would change both direction and magnitude for a given radius and you'd have a different orbit.</p></div>		</li>
