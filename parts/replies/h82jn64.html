			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. It doesn't look like anyone here is mentioning this fact. Best thing you can do for your battery is to slow charge it. I use a USB ammeter, bout $10, to see how much current is being used. I charge my phone every night off a USB hub on my computer at 0.42 amps. For a 4400mah battery, it takes almost the whole night to charge. Most phones now come with 2 amp or more chargers, which devastate the battery lifespan(yay planned obsolescence). If you use an older charger that puts out about 1 amp, you'll see a much slower decrease in the capacity of the battery over the years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically yes. But you have to look at the big picture and in the details: batteries can charge rapidly when they are well discharged and the batteries are now well protected so these fast charging do not wear the batteries too much.</p>
<p>Also, having the fast charging changed my behaviour by not charging it fully most of the time, just topping it up a bit, keeping the batteries around 50-80% charge level, which is better than keeping it close to 100% half of the night every night.</p>
<p>In general with electronics (and pretty much everything else actually), the key to longevity is moderation: use mildly, constantly, without big and fast temperature swings, without mechanical shocks... Obviously, you will have to do the trade off with what you want to do with the device.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, I travel infrequently and stay abroad for years at a time. On my last visit home, I bought a good but not flagship phone very similar to my 5 year old, very beat up daily phone. I want to have a synced backup at all times in case of loss or theft, and an immediate replacement when the old phone finally dies. What's the best storage philosophy  for the backup phone, to make the new phone's battery last as long as possible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  It is not a big hit going from like 30% to 60%.  Still constant fast charging will decrease battery life faster than 1a charging.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Lithium batteries have a number of charge wear cycles.  The first and last 15% or so charge cause the most wear.  So charging from say 20% to 70% twice would cause </p>

<p>Correct, but the numbers are 30% to 80%. </p>
<p>HP laptops already have the ability (a BIOS setting) to limit the charge to 80%, as most people dock their laptops anyway, and so don't need full 100%. This extends the battery life enormously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In regards to slow charging being better for the battery, while it is true, it doesn't tell the whole story. Generally, fast charging degrades batteries quicker, but a big part of that is because of the heat generated. Heat is one of the worst things you can do for batteries, the hotter you let them get, the quicker they degrade. Fast charging produces alot of heat in the battery. If you had a way to avoid the heat, let's say by keep the phone on a cold surface or having the plug take the heat instead of the phone (I know OnePlus Dash charge used to do this, idk about other options), then fast charging isn't nearly as bad. Still slightly degrades it, but not enough to notice over a very long time. Source: Owned a OnePlus 5 for more than 4 years, fast charged it all the time between 20-80, battery life was nearly perfect 4 years later</p></div>		</li>
