			<div class="markdown"><p>To add: this mechanism also includes a part that makes us relax afterwards. Ever seen a pet stretch or shake out after a scary event? But because we experience stress so often, these systems get out of sync, get too sensitive. The part of the brain that's responsible for stress response is hyperactive and is physically bigger. Relaxing on purpose, like with yoga, meditation, etc, with time helps the brain part shrink back to normal size and start responding to stressors more appropriately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Give it a try, yeah! I like app Headspace for very good explanations of basics of meditation. And there are different types of yoga, my fave is yin yoga, cuz it's slow and you get to sit for a while and aren't supposed to strain yourself, so pretty relaxing. Good luck!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the first post that made me consider yoga or meditation as a practical exercise with tangible benefits. Iâ€™m interested, but need to see some science done to this hypothesis.</p></div>		</li>
