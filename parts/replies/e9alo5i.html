			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on the attraction it has to the machine. If it has the same attraction as the original key, then it comes down to how many antagonists vs agonists you have, and the machine will work at that % of the ratio. If the antagonist is much more attracted than the agonist, it can almost shut it down because it gets stuck in lockdown mode</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Key is magnetic.  Lock is metal and so is machine.</p>
<p>Competitive antagonist - key goes in lock, machine doesn't respond, other keys can push it out and get in lock too.</p>
<p>Non competitive antagonist - either </p>
<p>1) Key goes in lock and gets stuck.  No other keys can get in.</p>
<p>2) Key lodges itself in the cogs.  (Allosteric)</p></div>		</li>
