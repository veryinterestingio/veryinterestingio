			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding here: there is a second metabolic pathway for alcohol degradation that gets used if the adh can't work fast enough and can become more and more efficient in chronic users and leads to tolerance.</p>
<p>We can also break down alcohol through oxidative metabolism ( cytocrome induced ) cytocromes use oxidative metabolism to break down molecules and while they are adaptative ( meaning you can drink more without feeling sick ) they create oxidative stress and more dangerous molecules that can harm the liver and are responsible for part of the cirrotic process. </p>
<p>This enzymes are the ones that allow heavy drinkers to keep on drinking without feeling sick since their pathway increases and the adh one is locked at a certain speed.
Meaning that even if they can't feel sick they are actually doing more damage to their liver than the guy that throws up after 2 drinks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this:
If I remember correctly the liver has a sort of “list“ of chemicals and when to break them down. This is why Alocohol and Coffee shouldn't be mixed at all especially not if there are other forms of coffein involved because the liver will take on the Coffee first und the Alocohl afterwards which can Snap your brain harder than Thanos</p></div>		</li>
