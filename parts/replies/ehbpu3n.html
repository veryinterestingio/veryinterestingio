			<div class="markdown"><p>This explanation is great, however in your case it doesn’t explain what shorting is and how the people in the movie got rich when the economy collapsed.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if you know what shorting is, so just in case you don’t, it’s when you borrow a security, and immediately sell it with the intention of repurchasing it in the future for a lower cost and then returning it.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you just bought a brand new car for $30,000. I then borrow your car for a year and sell it the second you give me the keys. Next year when you want your car back, I’ll buy the same make and model for $25,000, give you the car and I just walk away with $5,000 profit.</p>
<p>Cars generally go down in value. If I was shorting a security like apple stock, it can go up in value and I’ll lose money when it’s due for me to give you your shares back. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that it's a bit of an oversimplification of what happened during the housing crisis.  Yes there was a housing bubble, but also a mortage backed security bubble, failures of regulations, and a massive credit crunch.  A much cleaner example of a bubble is the dot com bubble (mainly because it lacks much of the extra chicanery that happened during the great recession).</p></div>		</li>

<p>The maddening thing is that there were lots of people warning bitcoin investors about why bubbles are bad and they refused to listen!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the biggest issue I have with crypto at the moment is how it can all die in a moment's notice. If the government passed some sort of regulation, or banks stopped accepting BTC, people might get spooked and want to cash-out. And that could cause a crash. This is the case with <em>any</em> currency, but normally people only put money in currencies that are backed by a somewhat powerful government. Also there are normally some group of people with their life worth tied to the currency. If something bad were to happen and the US decides BTC is a threat and that they're going to tax it or not allow FTC regulated banks to trade in BTC, then people might get spooked and cash and that could cause a crash. </p>
<p>So we can argue if it's a commodity or not, or if it's has inherent worth. But when push comes to shove I think most people with BTC would cash out and walk away, because crypto isn't their <em>primary</em> currency. </p>
<p>But as a point of conversation, it costs roughly $1000 to make a BTC (depending on your hardware and where you live). The current price is $3700, which doesn't seem too far off to me. But $20,000 was just laughable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe?  The ones other than Bitcoin no.  Having 100 different currencies is not viable.  For Bitcoin to work, it needs to be the only one, or one of a very, very few perhaps. And it pretty much was until the bubble.  The other cryptos were made pretty much solely to give people something worthless to invest in.</p>
<p>Bitcoin itself was starting to be adopted as s currency.  You could spend it in a few legitimate places. Even Steam at one point accepted it, I believe.  Ironically, the bubble has killed Bitcoin's value as a currency.  A currency that changes in value drastically overnight is wortheless.  A lot of places dropped the use of bitcoin as an acceptable currency because of, including Steam.</p>
<p>The very fact that Bitcoin CAN have bubbles pretty much dooms it as a viable currency, IMO.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People who bought at and above a certain price will be at a loss. That is how bubbles works, HODLers better pray for an extraordinary event because you are not getting your investment back if you bought at &gt;7k. Bitcoin is a lesson that people who aren't investors shouldn't be investing large amounts of their money in things they don't understand. </p>
<p>I'll let you in on a secret, the big investors didn't lose money in the Bitcoin bubble burst, they were the bubble bursting. When they sold their bitcoins, there where no more buyers and the price dropped. A person didn't even decide when to sell either. Forex, commodities, stocks, etc. are all traded by computers. computer algorithms do all of the trading these days and human can't compete. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another interesting example is baseball cards. In the mid to late 80s people noticed that baseball cards from earlier decades could be worth a lot of money and people began buying bese all cards by the case as an investment, never taking them out of the box. </p>
<p>Well, it turns out that baseball cards from the 70s and earlier <em>can</em> have a lot of value because so few were preserved in great condition. Now every investor was storing lots of cards in excellent condition. Meanwhile sales were up so manufacturers made many many more cards. Eventually they started making more “limited” and expensive cards which cost even more. In a few years the most expensive pack of baseball cards went from 50 cents in the late 80s to $7 for Stadium Club packs in 1991. Kids aren’t buying $7 packs of cards to collect and enjoy, it’s all investors. </p>
<p>Eventually when everyone figured out what happened the market crashed bad. I was in high school then and lost my collection along the way but I’m able to put it back together by buying still sealed boxes of cards now for less in absolute dollars than I could then. What cost $18 in 1988 now costs me $15. Inflation adjusted it should be $30 just to break even. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are lot of them.  The comic book bubble in the 90s is another one.  A couple of really valable comics, like the first Superman, got sold and the market goes nuts. Ended up bankrupting Marvel, which created a LOT of comics that they now couldn't sell.  They were so desparte to get money just to survive as a company that they sold off the movie rights with no end date to anyone who would buy them, which is why Marvel is still struggling to get the film rights to all their characters back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps the earliest speculative bubble happened in the Netherlands in the 1600s. People were buying and speculating on tulip bulbs and bulb futures (a contract with a grower to supply bulbs when harvested). Growers were coming up with interesting names and exotic colour combinations, some of which were considered very fashionable and the ultimate luxury item. At the peak, a bulb could be sold for the equivalent of a decade's wages for a craftsman.  </p>
<p>Then, perhaps due to the bubonic plague, bidders failed to show up at an auction. The prices collapsed as people seemed to remember that they were just filthy little flower bulbs and there were more important things in the world than multicoloured petals. Fortunes were lost. Lessons were learned. We now refer to the time as Tulip Mania (Tulpmania).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently this is responsible for some of the oddities in 90's comic book storylines. Any well-preserved comic had <em>some</em> value because of its rarity, but the hottest sellers were issues where:</p>
<ul>
<li>New characters debuted </li>
<li>A character died </li>
<li>New looks for an existing character</li>
</ul>
<p>Cue tons of storylines where new characters are added, or someone's killed, or someone &quot;dies&quot; but is reborn with a new identity, etc. They focused on tons of gigantic pivotal changes like this, trying to make as many must-collect issues as possible. </p></div>		</li>
