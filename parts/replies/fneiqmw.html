<p>That particle will absorb the photo</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is probably a bigger question than I realize but <em>how</em> does this happen? I know that electrons have different energy states, but does the photon really cease to exist after bumping the electron? And does a brand-new photon come into being after the electron comes down again? And how does the electron lose energy anyway? And why are there discrete states for the electron and not a continuum?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the photon ceases to exist. Yes, sometimes a new one could be created if the electron decays in the right way. Energy is conserved, so when an electron loses energy, it does so by sending it somewhere else. One way to do that is to emit a photon again. Electrons have discrete states because of the laws of quantum mechanics, and because they are &quot;bound&quot; to the atom (when you confine a particle) its allowed discrete energy levels spread out more the tighter you confine it). The wavelength of a massive particle is determined by its momentum. If the confinement by the atom were like a box with solid walls (it isn't exactly), the first allowed electron state would be where it has enough energy to have a wavelength of twice the box width, the second allowed state would be where it has the energy for a wavelength equal to the box width, and so on.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are you totally sure? I thought pigmented molecules (chlorophyll, retinal) are absorbant because of the presence of repeating units of conjugated double bonds?</p>

<p>This may be a lot to ask, but could you elaborate a bit here?</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's the &quot;quantum&quot; in quantum mechanics.<br />
It is that way because it just is. We measured stuff and found out they just are like that, so we have to build our theories upon it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no how!! There is a probability it will happen and that's all. </p>
<p>Let me be a little more descriptive. Quantum theories are one's where systems have quantum numbers, or specific discrete states if you will. It's not that electrons have states, it's that the system does. So, we can take the approach of describing a molecule as one system, and thus its got its various discrete (possibility of) states, and the photon likewise, but ultimately two separate, independent systems completely described by continuous wave functions...and saying photon is absorbed, is saying what is probability given their initial states, with all the nuances of the independent systems (energy, motion...etc) baked in, resulting in a system/wave describing just the molecule existing? So yeah, there was a photon and it disappeared. That's absorption, emission is the same in reverse. Another way is to look at the entire thing as one big system, that is, describing the molecule and photon together, and that single system has various discrete states it can exist in described by a single wave function. But now we're looking at it as one big system and it's description of a single wave function and it's probability of having evolved over time as what would be seen as absorption. Here now there really isn't even an independent photon and independent molecule, it's all one big soup, so now it's tough to argue it disappeared if it didn't even exist independently to begin with.</p>
<p>Ultimately, one has to make peace with the prospect that the underlying machinery is out of reach of our direct experience and only when we want it to be so do we have to manifest it in a way that's probabilistic. So pick your poison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for replying to me, but if anything I'm struck again just how incomplete the Copenhagen Interpretation is. I do not deny that CI produces correct measurement. What I do deny is that it is a complete theory.</p>
<p>Take a <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bean_machine" target="_blank">Galton board</a>. Yes, you can quite accurately describe the motion of the ballbearings as a probability. However, the balls (at the end of the day) have other properties which sum up to a probability (momentum, incident angle, spin, etc).</p>
<p>I fear that CI also suffers the same weakness. To say that there is only a probability of the electron being absorbed I think is missing a more fundamental quality of subatomic particles. For example, perhaps the &quot;photon&quot; doesn't really exist, it's all just electrons interacting with each other at a distance.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I can’t speak to something that would be 100% efficient, but nothing we know of can convert energy into purely photons, you’ll always get some thermal energy with it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. This is happening all the time. That’s why the earth is warm, because the blinding light of the sun smooshes all of the photons into earth, and that provides energy, which is released as heat.</p>
<p>That’s a very, very simplified way of saying it, and about 80% wrong, but accurate enough.</p></div>		</li>
