			<div class="markdown"><p>Source on the second paragraph? The only lactic acid buildup I've ever heard of is lactic acidosis, which can be a potentially life-threatening condition and does not include massage therapy as a possibile treatment. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, exhaustion/weakness, and others. Otherwise, lactic acid should be removed from your muscles within an hour of exercise. </p>
<p>Out of curiosity, I googled &quot;lactic acid massage&quot; and the first 5 links stated that the idea that massage gets rid of lactic acid blockages is a myth. I didn't look at any articles past that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish to thank you for challenging my information and after looking into, I was rather surprised.</p>
<p>Almost all of the information regarding lactic acid crystallization seemed to come off as hear-say perpetuated by massage therapists. Uric acid will crystallize and cause gout. Lactic acid however seems to be, as you said, removed. I have not had time to reference my books but I did find time for internet research which further surprised me.</p>
<p>I have removed section over lactic acid Crystal's due to lack of sufficient evidence. This information was passed into me by instructors whom I highly respected but now I shall go further in studying the validity of this before ever posting about it.</p>
<p>This does however make me question whether this was perpetuated by the idea of waste product being inefficiently removed from overtight and strained muscles and fascia and there being buildup that leads to crystallization that then causes further adhesions and discomfort or if some guy literally started just saying it without real backup and everyone bought it.</p>
<p>I wish to sincerely thank you for doing your scientific duty to challenge questionable information. I could not find any sufficient evidence online that was outside of a freaking blog or accounts from MT clients.</p>
<p>Have a fantastic day!</p></div>		</li>
