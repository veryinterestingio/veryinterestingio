			<div class="markdown"><p>They're also great fire sensors. Thermocouples, or thermopiles when you stack them, are used in furnaces and gas fireplaces. You stick one end in the pilot flame, that generates electricity, which is used to power an electromagnet. That magnet opens a valve that lets gas flow to the main burner. If the pilot goes out, the magnet stops working, and the gas shuts off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cold side has the voltage. You make a thermocouple by welding two strips of different metals together at one end and putting that end in fire. The two metals absorb heat energy at a different rate, which makes a voltage difference at the unwelded ends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Talked to a friend who used to work on these. Term for deep space converters is “thermoelectric generators” and they are more complicated than a thermocouple. </p>
<p>He says that the efficiency is something in the 5-10% range.  </p>
<p>As you say, good for a deep space probe where a nuclear pile is available but solar panels are not. Or possibly for espionage applications, if solar panels would be seen but the radioactive signature wouldn’t be noticed. Or maybe polar applications?  </p>
<p>But they are totally not the answer for power plants.</p></div>		</li>
