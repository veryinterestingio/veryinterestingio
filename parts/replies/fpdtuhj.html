<p>Glass is denser than plastic</p>

<p>Since this is such a common misconception, I'll put this here, even though you are probably oversimplying for the sake of ELI5.</p>
<p>Density has very little to do with heat capacity. Iron, for instance, has about a quarter the (volumetric) heat capacity of water but is far denser. I chose iron specifically because it has a very high heat capacity among all metals. (I think, if I remember correctly, that it's the highest of all metals, but that might be mercury.) Among similar materials, the denser material will have higher heat capacity, but plastic and glass are <em>very</em> different materials with respect to heat storage.</p></div>		</li>
