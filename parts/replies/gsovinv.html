			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats where Im really confused. </p>
<p>Imagine Im the Head Engineer of Intel ðŸ˜…, what external source (or internal) will be responsible for making the next generation of Intel cpus faster? Did I  suddenly figured out that using gold instead of silver is better etc...</p>
<p>I hope this question makes sense ðŸ˜…</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, at the scale of our tech level it's more like &quot;nudging these 5 atoms this way in the structure makes this FET have a 2% smaller gate charge&quot;. Also they do a stupid amount of mathematical research to find more efficient ways to calculate things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right now the machinary used to create the chips is not really a limiting factor. It comes down to the recipes they use on the machines. Engineers are constantly running new recipes trying to find new combinations of chemicals that makes the transistor pathways and gateways smaller or make them less resistive. </p>
<p>A misconception is that it's just one group doing this when in reality a semiconductor fab is huge with different equipment groups responsible for different steps in the process of creating a wafer. Any one of these groups can have a breakthrough that affects the rest.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a former semiconductor R&amp;D engineer, it's a long, iterative process with no finish line. Each iteration is a refinement of the last and comes with new problems that need to be solved (by trying and failing and trying again) before it becomes stable enough to become the new &quot;normal&quot;.</p>
<p>I will give you an example that my colleagues were facing. A certain smartphone company wanted thinner smartphones, so we had to find ways to make the chips thinner. OK, so you take every component in the chip and try and make it thinner. One of the hardest things to get right was the substrate. A substrate is made of the same stuff as printed circuit boards, but thinner. It goes on the bottom of each chip and serves as the interface between the die (the silicon inside the chip) and the PCB of the phone (to which the chip is mounted). </p>
<p>The normal substrates have some rigidity to them (like wood) - but the new, ultra-thin substrate was so thin that it was barely rigid, it was thin and floppy like paper. So all the robots in the line would choke when they tried to handle it because it would bend and go out of alignment and crash into things where a normal substrate would go straight. Sounds like a stupid problem to have, but these lines have hundreds of robots and create some 2 million chips a day so material handling is very important to get right.</p>
<p>After redesigning the handling mechanisms and adding extra components to actually handle the floppy substrates reliably, there was a new problem. The substrates would warp when you heat them in an oven to cure the glue. And once again nothing would work because your previously-flat board of chips is now taco-shaped and won't come out of its holder. So it took many months of intense simulation to figure out how to arrange the different layers of copper and glass fiber so that the thermal expansions cancelled out and it would stay mostly straight even after oven-curing.</p>
<p>We needed thinner dies, but thinner dies are more fragile, so again every process and machine that handles dies had to be redone so the dies wouldn't end up chipped or cracked in half. Silicon is brittle, a lot like tile or glass. If you have a large flat die, it's hard to use glue to stick them to the substrate like usual because they could crack under the force of squishing them to the glue... so you switch your production line to double-sided tape, but that means changing the whole process and validating everything anew. We needed wire bonds that didn't loop up so high above the chip, which added its own set of problems because now the wire is less flexible and the strain-relief on the bond isn't so good so they tend to crack more easily... so it took many more weeks of testing different parameters so the bonds wouldn't break off the die.</p>
<p>By the end of it we managed to shrink this chip from 1mm thickness down to 0.5mm thickness. Smartphone users everywhere rejoiced that their phone was 0.5mm thinner... then promptly slapped on a $10 case that added 2mm to the phone's thickness and negated two years of our R&amp;D work in one fell swoop *<em>grumble</em>*</p>
<p>But if we hadn't figured all that out to make 0.5mm chips, we wouldn't have been able to make the next generation (0.33mm chips). And if we'd waited to get to the end (0.1mm chips or whatever it'll ultimately be), we wouldn't have made enough money to justify getting there because we would be selling zero product the whole time - which means zero income.</p>
<p>So what tends to happen is that things go in cycles - every year or two you look at what your competitors are doing, and try to beat them slightly in terms of performance (eg. they're making 0.5mm chips so we put in just enough R&amp;D to get ours down to 0.45mm). That way, you can sell more than them without overdoing it on the R&amp;D budget. They do the same to you, and when that happens you fire back with a marginally better product that you've been working on in the meantime, and the cycle continues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Straight from OP: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>And why is the performance increase only a small amount and why so often? Couldnt they just double the speed and release another another one in 5 years?  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yes, <em>part</em> of their question was &quot;why do they chase 10% now instead of sitting on it to release a 20% improvement later.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
