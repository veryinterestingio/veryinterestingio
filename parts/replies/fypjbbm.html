			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah. But why is it called the humerus?</p>
<p>Edit: should have clicked on the link:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The word &quot;humerus&quot; is derived from Latin: humerus, umerus meaning upper arm, shoulder, and is linguistically related to Gothic ams shoulder and Greek ōmos.[1]</p>

<p>Also, don't make a habit of causing trauma to your ulnar nerve. And don't pin your arm under your head while you sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It places a more tension on the ulnar nerve when the arm is bent for long periods of time. </p>
<p>However, many people tolerate it fine. Some don't. If it's not giving you numbness and tingling in the pinky side of your hand and your pinky and ring finger (the sensory distribution of the ulnar nerve), don't worry about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FUN FACT - That nerve innervates your whole pinky, but only the lateral aspect of your ring finger (only the half that's close to the pinkey side but not the side that's close to the middle finger).  </p>
<p>ALSO - if those fingers just randomly start getting numb or tingly, go get tested for Thoracic Outlet Syndrome and/or Carpal Tunnel</p></div>		</li>
