			<div class="markdown"><p>I gave a brief description <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/a3ayo7/why_is_the_ozone_layer_hole_in_the_south_pole_why/eb6r5uv/?st=jpbzu2wy&amp;sh=c4c6c9e1" target="_blank">here</a>.  Basically, you need sustained cold temperatures for Type-II PSCs to form (180~190K).  This doesn't happen in the NH (you only get Type-I PSCs).  The PSCs help to de-nitrify the stratosphere and remove a reservoir species for chlorine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep it's a fact that South pole is colder than North pole, hence more efficient formation of PSCs. </p>
<p>But from what you mentioned it struck me that a 6 month sunset would provide cooler and better conditions for PSCs to form, while a sunrise should keep them from forming. But turns out, the weather and seasonal changes can vary atmospheric temperatures only upto the troposphere. Stratosphere is not really affected whether it's winter or summer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know much about it, but you seem to - is this why the sun feels stronger in Australia? Just moved here from California and it's more intense. Solar devices charge faster, for example. Is that just a result of the Earth's tilt or does the ozone hole play a factor?</p></div>		</li>
