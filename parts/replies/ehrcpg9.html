<p>But for skin damage including cancer - no. That's a lifetime exposure risk, and is not related to burning.</p>

<p>Are you sure about this?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4851991/" target="_blank">Here is a nice paper</a> on the relationship between severe sunburns and different types of skin cancer. They have a nice sample size: 87,166 women and 32,959 men.</p>
<p>I quickly glanced through their method and they seemed to control for amount of time spent in direct sunlight in the summer months, cumulative ultraviolet flux, and sunscreen use (among other things).</p>
<p>Their conclusion is that severe sunburns are associated with increased risk of melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma in both male and female. Interestingly the risk is lower for women with all skin cancer types. Also sunburns  on the trunk are associated more with skin cancer than sunburns on other parts of the body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. The biggest studies on this have shown that sun exposure actually decreases the risk of skin cancer, itâ€™s burning that increases your risk. Cancer rates are higher in office workers than in field workers when controlling for the number of severe burns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is some evidence that big burn events are bad, but they also don't happen to everyone at the same frequency, so even with that sample size the confounds make the power of the study shithouse for coming to that conclusion. It is a good example of bad science to take that from that study. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ay whoops I basically said the same thing. To extend a bit- uvb rays are the main culprit in terms of acute/immediate damage from sun exposure like burning and tanning. UVA rays have a longer wavelength relative to uvb rays, which means they can penetrate deeper in to the layers of your skin and cause &quot;long term&quot; damage like ageing and DNA damage. So even if you &quot;just tan&quot;... yeah. It might hurt less and look better than burning, but it still means prolonged sun exposure which is not good at all.</p></div>		</li>
