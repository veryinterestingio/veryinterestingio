			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that we know of. Crows do sometimes bring &quot;gifts&quot; to people that feed them, but we don't really know the intent behind these &quot;gifts&quot;.  They're very likely accidents, or maybe even accidents that are trained into a purposeful behavior.  What I mean by that is crows often see things that they're interested in exploring and will sometimes pick them up and make off with them.  Gifts may be the result of these items getting left behind once they see something they'd rather make off with, like a couple peanuts.  Then maybe what happens is that the receiving person is like &quot;whoa a present! here's more food!&quot; and the birds are like &quot;hmmm&quot; and they leave something else and it gets reinforced again and on and on.  It could be conditional learning just like how you use treats to train a dog.  But we really don't know.  Maybe they really are intentionally leaving people presents.  Most crow scientists don't think so, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to u/rafter613 ‘s question. I read a post quite a while ago where a crow brought a £5 note (or some currency with a shiny strip) and the person feeding them rewarded them the next time with more than the average snack. So after a while they figured out to bring actual money to get more food. Do you think it was just coincidence or they were smart enough to differentiate between random shinies and a note of currency?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you think they can be trainer for finding specific objects?  For example let a friend bring you some small and light object, and you &quot;rewarding&quot; him with food, doing this a few times in front of the crows you want to train. Will they understand eventually?</p></div>		</li>
