<p>I actually heard that there's a genetic marker in some people, missing in others that makes us choke up, get chills, or experience any type of profound reaction to music. As people are taking these DNA tests with biomarking, it's apparently one of the markers that shows up. Maybe someone with experience can confirm or deny, this is all hearsay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>God I’m not the only one? I love this reaction so much. I feel like the goose bumps are a reaction so how incredible I feel from how amazing the music is. The crying? Oh my god that’s another level. When I smoke most music is a goddamn master piece, exactly like you said not from sadness but from beauty. I my friends are like stop crying and I almost can’t stop because the musics just too amazing. I still have yet to meet anyone who feels the same way I do about music</p></div>		</li>
