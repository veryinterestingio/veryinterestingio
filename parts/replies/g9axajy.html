But even that link makes me wonderâ€” no explanation here yet includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate-term_memory" target="_blank">Intermediate-term memory</a>, which iirc is used in LTM formation to a much greater degree than the evanescent short-term memory with its period of only a few minutes</p></div>		</li>

<p>ELI5: Short term memory and long term memory are in different parts of your brain. Short term memory is in the front bit of your brain - if you touch your forehead it is behind there. To find your long term memory, drill a hole in your brain above your left ear. Go about an inch deep and you will hit the long term memory spot.</p></div>		</li>
