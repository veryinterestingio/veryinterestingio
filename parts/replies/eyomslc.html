			<div class="markdown"><p>Oil and fat are both lipids. Oil is liquid at room temperature. Fat is solid at food temp. So technically coconut oil should be called coconut fat but it's not as marketable when you call it that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something is oil when it's fluid at room temperature. In northern Europe it's coconut fat because it's solid at room temperature. In hotter countries, where the room temperature is more to 40°c instead of 20°c. It's fluid, and it's called coconut oil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The distinction between oil and fat is true, but coconut oil is a different product from coconut fat. It is coconut fat that has been processed to remove any solids at room temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I eat a lot of spicy food and I've noticed that when the food is oily it takes longer for the spice to kick in and also it lasts longer. So I suspect the reason has to do with solubility of capsaicin in water vs oil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve seen something similar to this in oc (pepper spray) the oil based stuff stays with you much longer than the water based. Of course the % of capsaicin matters as well but it was easier to wash away the water based vs the oil.</p></div>		</li>
