			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a combination of how good the lines are coming to your house, and how much you're willing to pay. For speed, telco&lt;cable&lt;fibre, but the difference between telco (DSL) and cable is small enough that the line condition is the determining factor.</p>
<p>Good DSL can outperform crappy coax cable, but good cable will outperform good DSL. Fiber leaves both of those far, far behind. </p>
<p>Assuming your lines are good, the speed of your connection is determined by the software on the ISP side, which caps your connection at a maximum rate. As the client, there are very few (usually none) workarounds, but if you work for the ISP you might find something.</p>
<p>Had a buddy once that created a 'testing profile' on the backend that set the speed limit to max attainable, and then set his home connection to that profile 24/7. He didnt even get in trouble when folks found out- it was an extremely useful profile for client testing, and became a standard in the test kit. Got a memo telling everyone to never ever do that, but that was it. Worked for the better part of a year, iirc.</p></div>		</li>
