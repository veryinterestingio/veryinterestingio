			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m still working on sweet potatoes myself. With sugary things it makes me gutsick, but I like it better when I make it more savory.</p>
<p>I learned to love oatmeal (because my husband loves it) by making the best I could figure. Steel cut oats, whole milk and salt, overnight soak method. </p>
<p>I store it in the fridge and reheat it for breakfast with more milk- and toppings like brown sugar, chopped fig, toasted nuts, cranberry raisin chutney, you get the idea. It eats more indulgent than it really is, and has a waaayyy better texture than goopy rolled oats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to recommend savory oats. It’s especially great if you don’t like sweet as much. You can cook the oats with water, but I prefer chicken broth. Then season with salt and pepper, top it with pretty much whatever. I love mine with a runny fried egg. I’ll add some veggies if I’m feeling fancy or trying to be healthier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try applesauce, brown sugar &amp; cinnamon with your oats. Also PB&amp;J is a nice mix. I use milk but water does the job, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, texture is huge to me. I've grown to love runny eggs, but over cooked pasta still makes me wretch. Also - water chestnuts. The food equivalent of nails on a chalkboard to me.</p></div>		</li>
