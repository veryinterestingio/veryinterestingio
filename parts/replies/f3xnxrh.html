			<div class="markdown"><p>We actually have 4 &quot;cones&quot; for color but the extra is not really a cone, only senses 481nm, blue light. It is what we use to sense daylight and even some blind people have this. There are no images formed from these, it is just a light sensor, not part of the visual system but part of the body clock.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PRGC is not a 4th type of cone, neither are rods.</p>
<p>Rods are used in low light vision so they are not relevant for colour perception with enough lighting.</p>
<p>PRGCs are not relevant too.</p></div>		</li>
