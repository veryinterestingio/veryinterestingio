			<div class="markdown"><p>I never understood that &quot;Would you rather fight a horse sized duck or 1000 duck size horses&quot; the answer is blindingly obvious, a horse sized duck is basically a velociraptor a 1000 duck sized horses is basically 1000 puppies with spindly little legs and no sharp teeth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ALWAYS try to look at a roof before going near it on a warmer-than-usual winter day or any days with build up, whenever possible.  I was a kid and my grandma was walking off of her porch and a GIANT slab shaped like an eaves trough fell right where she was going to be.  I shrieked and that made her look out.  But seeing what it did to the dirt (it left a large hole and it was sticking out), I will never forget how close she was to dying.  On the brightside, I learned from it, and as an adult I always clear the gutters and ice whenever possible wether it is raining, snowing, or shining.  I could never forgive myself if my lazyness stopped me from doing 10 minutes of work and got someone injured.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I luckily wasn't near death or seeing anyone die, but I got out of my car after work one day and walking to the apartment, I heard a super loud long sliding noise followed by about a second and a half of silence, followed by someone's hood and windshield getting destroyed by a slab of ice and snow.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most parts of Europe the owner of the property is liable if someone is hit by ice from the roof.
Hence on locations were ice is prone to fall they put red tape and pills to actually prevent people using certain sections of the pavement. </p></div>		</li>
