<p>That makes sense to me. So the pigments DO stay yellow and blue, but the original colors would be practically impossible to observe, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's right. Ultimately it is individual molecules which absorb and reflect one frequency of light or the other, but the scale of molecules (by no coincidence) happens to be not far from where our ability to use visible light wavelengths to see the edges of things, starts to break down.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why isn't it a coincidence? I'm curious</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, I fell down an optics rabbit hole. Learned the human eye only perceives red, green and blue, and infers the other colors based on how much of those it's perceiving.  It's been a very &quot;fucking magnets, how do they work?&quot; kind of day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive always had trouble with this statement. Because having colour means it reflects light at a certain wavelength. That is the definition of having color. Imo its a shit way to explain it. Its like saying coldness doesn't exist. Its just an absence of heat. Yet that is exactly what cold means. Sorry i dont mean to be mean, it just gets me when people say this</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pigments don't generally come in individual molecules.  They tend to be solid material that is ground to a fine particle size, on the order of tens of micrometers down to tenths of micrometers, depending on the pigment and its purpose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I work in a paint manufacturing factory and we usually aim for anything from 5 to 30 microns at the grinding stage before progressing. And this is industrial paint that ends up on buildings/diggers. Domestic paints will probably have an even lower grind depending on quality level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Frankly this saves the answer.  EM techniques can only see titanic molecules like large proteins.  Single molecule requires something like atomic force microscopy, although since this is a color question you can do colorimetric readings (fluorescence at least) on single molecules of stuff like conjugated organic polymers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the answer depends heavily on whether we’re talking about dyes or pigments. A dye is a chemical dissolved into a liquid solution, and these would be indistinguishable to an optical telescope when mixed. A pigment can be <em>suspended</em> in a liquid as a mixture to produce a similar effect, but you could potentially still see the larger individual, suspended pigment particles. The pigment-colored liquid would also fade over time as the pigment settles out of the liquid.</p></div>		</li>
