			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the issue with AC's are that it moves air around so it's equal in the entire room/building, meaning it just destributes the contamination evently across the whole room even if it mixes some fresh air in. Without AC the contaminated air moves slower, is concentrated at the source and slowly seeps away from it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if the gyms are operating on mixed air concept, then that brings in at least some fresh air. But it sounds like OP's gym is not running any AC at all, which means it's not mixing in any fresh air. I'm not sure how that's better from a disease prevention standpoint.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i think it has to do with the heat tolerance of covid.  Some people are suggesting like other enveloped virus's that it's harder for covid to survive as airborne out side of the traditional heat zones we are used to for spread of respiratory disease. </p>
<p>here's a meta study on plos:</p>

<p>This effect in addition to reducing air circulation may be preventative.</p></div>		</li>
