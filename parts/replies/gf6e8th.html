			<div class="markdown"><p>This approximation also relies on the vaccinated people being uniformly distributed. If you have one area with a lower rate of innoculation mixing sporadically with an area of higher rate, you're going to see the former acting as a reservoir of the disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on some simple math to this great explanation, here’s how the breakdown would work for the US based on finding this site when I googled US population by age:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/241488/population-of-the-us-by-sex-and-age/" target="_blank">https://www.statista.com/statistics/241488/population-of-the-us-by-sex-and-age/</a></p>
<p>There are 328 million people in America. About 60 million are 14 or younger, so let’s count them as children(I couldn’t find anything official saying what the age range is for the vaccine). That leaves 268 million adults. If 2/3 get the vaccine, then 178 million Americans will get the vaccine, which would be ~54%. So 10 percentage points away from the best case scenario and 25 away from the worst.</p>
<p>Quick edit: I should probably do the math the other way. In order to hit those herd immunity numbers, then in the worst case scenario 79.3% of Americans need to be vaccinated, so 260 million people, or 97% of adults. For 63.8% best case scenario, 209 million people need to get it, or  78% of adults.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great point! Vaccine or no vaccine, everyone should still be doing everything they can to protect themselves and others - It's all a matter of reducing overall spread risk, so we might as well make the math work in our favor if we can :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering the number of people who will likely refuse the vaccine, continuing to control risk with PPE will be essential. Unfortunately it will be most essential in the same population who don't want the vaccine and (statistically) are less likely to comply. <sigh></p></div>		</li>
