			<div class="markdown"><p>I can attest to that.  Iâ€™ve kept a Tupperware container of bacon grease in the fridge for the last several months.  Every so often when I use enough of it I top it up with fresh grease.  The part at the bottom has been there a long time, but with no access to air. The container is still fresh and delicious and my fried eggs taste way better.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The second it gets water in it, it goes bad.</p></div>		</li>
