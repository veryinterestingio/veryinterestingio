			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  Go look at pictures of the African Wild Cat - the species from which the domestic cat is descended.  The morphological differences are incredibly minor, to the point that I would argue that most people couldn't tell if an African Wild Cat was a domestic cat or not just by looking at it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many, many species of ”small cats” (as opposed to the ”big cats” of genus <em>Pantera</em> or ”medium cats” like lynxes and bobcats). Most of them resemble housecats more or less, but indeed especially the direct ancestor, and closest extant wild relative, the African wildcat, is incredibly similar to your standard domestic tabby.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes me wonder, though, how the African wild cat became the size it did. From what I understand about domesticated dogs, the small breeds exist because of selective breeding. I wonder what the cause is of the shrinking of some breeds of cats from what I assume is a much larger common ancestor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume there was a niche for a predator that size. There are lots of small prey animals for a small predator to eat.</p>
<p>The African wild cat isn't the only small feline. Some others are the Pampas cat, kodkod, southern tiger cat, and Pallas's cat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>African wild cats aren't much larger than house cats, 8-10 pounds according to a quick Google. Any change in size is probably related to the size of their most common prey. In the wild, they are all kinds of animals, but once they really focused on mice and insects, being smaller may have been an advantage.</p></div>		</li>
