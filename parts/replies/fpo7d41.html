			<div class="markdown"><p>If you could show that we sampled ratios of each animal in equivalent numbers this would make sense.</p>
<p>But the people who watch lions have the ability to see almost 100% of lions. The people who watch sharks get to see a large portion of all sharks.</p>
<p>The people who watch turtles and snakes don't get nearly the same sampling of the species they try to look at, and still they seem to catch many more two-headed specimens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Especially with lions such occurences are next to impossible. Besides everything you have stated, male lions are extremly critical about their ofspring. Killing all babies thst are weak or otherwise strange. Oh and all babies from other male lions if they come to encounter such.</p></div>		</li>
