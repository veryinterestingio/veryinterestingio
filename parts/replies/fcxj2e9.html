			<div class="markdown"><p>I get a sore neck from NyQuil. It knocks you out and you don't wake up to adjust position while sleeping. If I have issues with being unable to check the blindspots in the car without pain, I can usually trace it back to NyQuil or some other drug that knocks you out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, for me, the almost in your doctor's assertion is NyQuil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the blind spots, you can just lean forward and look in the side view mirror. It should take out the blind spot and it lets you keep your eyes on the road while not turning your neck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the real answer. Sleeping is good for your muscles. When you have neck and back pain, it's because <em>yesterday</em> you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spent a long time at a new table/workstation (shoulders/neck)</li>
<li>Found a new video game and played it for a long time in the same position (neck/elbow)</li>
<li>Worked on a home project/painting/planting/plumbing (back)</li>
<li>Lifted your kid out of the carseat (back)</li>
<li>Be older than you were last year (entire body)</li>
