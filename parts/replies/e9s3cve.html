			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a comment that VO2 of 0.3L/min is an assumption based on the subject being at rest, it is based on a metabolic requirement about 3-3.5ml/kg/min at rest. Even a brisk walk will increase your requirements to 2-3x this. </p>
<p>Your estimate of total oxygen content in the body is also incorrect, while arterial blood is close to 100% saturated, venous blood is still 50-60% saturated, so an estimate of average being 20% (1.1l of 5.5l) of the blood volume cannot be correct.</p>
<p>Essentially a lot of your assumptions don't seem correct. Having said that, OPs question doesn't exactly make much sense. </p>
<p>In simple terms your lungs recieve your entire cardiac output each minute and the blood leaving them is close to 100% saturated (unless severe respiratory disease, low partial pressure of oxygen or extreme levels of exercise).</p>
<p>Assuming 12 respirations a minute, venous saturation of 50% returning to the lung, and a cardiac output of 5L/min (at rest). Each breath must oxygenate a bit more than 200mL of blood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At rest, venous blood normally has a saturation in the mid 70s.  Some &quot;normal&quot; ranges online state normal is 60 to 80%, but thats not really correct.  If truly at rest and with no other issues at all (no anemia, hypoxa, heart failure), it really shouldn't be below 70%, and mostly will be mid to high 70s.</p>
<p>Interestingly, if you take healthy volunteers and gradually remove 2/3 of their blood and replace it with isotonic volume, the SVO2 will still only fall to the high 60s due to an increase in CO to nearly maintain O2 delivery (mostly due to HR increase, but also some increase in stroke volume).  <a href="www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/9438742/" target="_blank">This</a> 1998 JAMA paper showing that is one of my favorite papers (they volunteered for <em>what</em>?</p>
<p>Following that thought through - since the lungs then are only taking the sat from 75% to 100% you aren't really fully oxygenating 200 ml of blood - just adding more oxygen.  </p>
<p>However, I suppose with heavy exercise you can triple or quadruple your CO (or at least some people can), and even untrained subjects can get their SVO2 down into the high 20s /low 30s.  Despite that, the lungs do just fine.  Humans are very much cardiac limited in exertion, not lung limited.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an exercise physiologist, thank you for that great explanation.  It is a complex topic.</p>
<p>As to your final point, Tim Noakes has postulated the &quot;Central Governor&quot; theory of end point exertion.  It has been a topic of some heated debate.  There is also the &quot;peripheral limitation&quot; concept on exertion.  Not saying I am in absolutely agreement with either concept, especially as I was educated based on a cardiac-limited concept, but they offer some interesting ideas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder what percent of the oxygen that enters the lungs actually crosses into the body. I doubt it's 100%, so the final value might even be lower than 1%! Incredible </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the reason we breathe as fast as we do is to get rid of CO2. Oxygen only really becomes a problem at altitude (naturally anyway). </p></div>		</li>

<p>If you really want to know the percentage you could buy a pulse oximeter to measure your sp02 percentage, this is what we use in the ambulance but sometimes it will give inaccurate readings due to medical issues.
They are relatively cheap too!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>also since you're only looking at the oxygen component of the atmosphere you should have used the partial pressure of oxygen (~0.2atm) rather than full atmospheric pressure</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. The volume given was of oxygen, not air. The fraction was already taken into account. Also, when a gas flow rate is given in volume with no added context, it is almost always in terms of standard volume, which means atmospheric pressure. </p></div>		</li>
