			<div class="markdown"><p>It's cold because space is basically a vacuum. There is very very little matter to measure temperature. Temperature is the average amount of vibrations in a period of time.</p>
<p>Edit:
As u/drafterman mentioned, an atmosphere acts as an insulating blanket for a planet's infrared radiation. Coincidentally, carbon dioxide absorbs a longer wavelength (far) infrared radiation. The more CO2 in the atmosphere of the planet, the more heat the atmosphere will absorb, hence Climate Change/Global Warming. Don't believe me, check out the average surface temperatures of the planets here: <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/681/solar-system-temperatures/" target="_blank">https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/681/solar-system-temperatures/</a></p>
<p>Earth may not ever reach 870⁰ Farenheit but 200⁰ Farenheit is more than enough to kill the vast majority of living organisms on Earth. If humans somehow found a way to survive, it won't be for long, good luck finding water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, anything that got any significant portion of the earth's surface to 200F would likely fuck a lot more shit up though right? Like yeah the water table might change as a lot evaporates away, but the only thing I can see changing the earths temp like that would be an increase in solar luminosity (ironically, something bound to happen), but not really a concern of mine, tbh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_\(planet\)" target="_blank">it almost is</a>, so there are long durations of &quot;night&quot; to radiate heat away. </p>
<p>&quot;Mercury ... is tidally locked with the Sun in a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance, meaning that relative to the fixed stars, it rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>would there be an exact line of shadow where you would freeze to death, or step across it into the light to burn to death?  </p>
<p>i'm just imagining a sci-fi nomadic alien race that lives in the cold, always within a few miles of the &quot;death line&quot; - having to move every few days just a little bit further inward.  </p>
<p>Hilarity ensures when Gleeb's Glorthon has a gloot during one of the moves.  Yeah maybe more for interdimensional cable or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>for conduction of heat, yes.  if you apply a flame to one side of a solid metal pan, it will get hot.  if you apply flame to a dual wall vessel with a vaccum inside, you'll feel very very little.</p>
<p>but radiation of heat... that uses IR waves, like a heatlamp in a sauna or to keep food warm.  those do not need any physical medium to transfer energy.  this is how the ISS cools itself as well.</p>
<p>all things with heat radiate IR waves.  and FLIR cameras pick this up to show us just how how things are.</p></div>		</li>
