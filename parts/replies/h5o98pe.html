			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure about precision but you compare it to the modern day poles since you measure paleo latitude using magnetized rocks that locked in the past pole direction then moved from there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How would one account for pole drift in that case? Maybe that's just part of the margin of error when you're asking which way is &quot;up&quot; on a ball in space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For paleolatitudes that come from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleomagnetism" target="_blank">paleomagnetism</a>, the accuracy depends on the quality of the remnant magnetic field preserved in the rocks, number of measurements, etc, but typical paleomagnetic studies reconstructing changes in paleolatitude through time might have accuracies of a few degrees. This means that reconstructing small changes (a few 100s of kilometers) with these techniques are challenging, but it works very well for large scale changes. Because this is relying on changes in the declination of the magnetic field as preserved in rocks, we only get indications of paleolatitude.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Determining latitude from mag records kinda triggers my bullshit meter. Couple 100MA sure. And this is not my area, so feel free to educate me, </p>
<p>But you are seriously using mag data for reconstructions of say Rodina or Columbia? or anything over say 500MA? My objection is I thought most of such projections were based on sea floor maps, which my head image says don't survive a supercontinent cycle.</p>
<p>I realize mag strength is more than just reversals, but is there a global background mag strength study? And how could that possibly be done without some assumptions about where things were in the first place?</p>
<p>I don't see how it could be done without model fitting.<br />
Sorry brain fried, thanks for input.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To this splendid answer I can only add that the smallest unit of time that geologists are typically comfortable in dealing with is a million years.  So the Late Cretaceous extinction about 66million years ago is pretty much recent history.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Highly depends on the discipline and the method used to date whatever it is. Iâ€™ve seen 10,000 years as a common range for geomorphology because rivers change a lot, 100,000-10mil for many tectonic events because that happens slowly, 10,000-5mil years for normal tectonic things and ore deposits, 1-100 days for sudden things like eruptions and earthquakes, 100mill-1 billion year increments for things like major tectonic processes and crust building events, &gt;1bil year increments for major geologic changes and earth building events.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another example of this is radioisotope dating. Cesium-137 is used to date soils and lake sediments, and it's only seen in the past 70 or so years (it's from nuclear detonations).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on how long ago you're looking <em>and</em> how specific you want to be.</p>
<p>The Red Crag formation in South East England is only around 0.5-2 million years old depending on the section. You could be relatively confident dating subformations to within 100,000 years. Even in much older formations, if you have the right kinds of fossils (eg ones that have rapid minor evolutions) particularly stuff like Ammonites for the Mesozoic or graptolites in the Palaeozoic), you can get sub-million year resolution.</p>
<p>And for actual outcrops, while you may not be able to date them specifically, you can have a good estimate on how long say, a 50 million year old dune from an ancient coast line took to form based on modern analogues. Going back to the red crag, although the whole thing was deposited over the course of over a million years, each individual outcrop almost certainly took only a few months to form.</p></div>		</li>
