<p>As a guy with ADHD, lemme tell you, Adderall is shit.   It has the most noticeable ups and downs (like crashing), and can make some people bitchy or otherwise moody.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. I break them into pieces and take them intermittently. Even after 25 years 20 mg can be too much to take at once, lest I get tense. Slowly titrating seems to work really well.i would take time release but then Id have to take it the same time every day which is impossible</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While both statements are technically true on their own (it’s a CII drug, that’s true. It’s quite illegal to try to buy it OTC, that’s true) it’s not illegal to buy otc because it’s a schedule II.  You have committed a false cause fallacy. Cum hoc ergo propter hoc (with this, therefore because of this).       </p>
<p>It’s also quite illegal to sell ANY “prescription only” medication over the counter regardless of its controlled status. A medication’s controlled status applies to how CONTROLLED its distribution is to you, the end user.      </p>
<p>Zoloft is prescription only and not a controlled substance.
It’s illegal to buy it over the counter.      </p>
<p>You’re also moving the goalposts. You went from saying Adderall isn’t legal to saying it’s quite illegal over the counter.<br />
Regardless, you DID originally say that “popping Adderall isn’t legal because stimulant abuse is dangerous.” Which is just wrong for so many reasons.<br />
Abuse of anything is potentially dangerous. Drinking too much water in too short of a time can kill you. Is water illegal because water abuse is dangerous?     </p>
<p>You might want to read up on fallacious arguments and how to avoid them. Having all the facts first might also help.</p></div>		</li>
