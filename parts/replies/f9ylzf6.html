			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably their google feed on their phone. If you get a feel for how it works and some privacy sacrifices that you're probably making anyway (google knows what you search for), it's actually incredibly good. For me it's pretty much 100% relevant-to-me links, 95% of which I'd actually be interest in reading/skimming. I also like that it gives hyper-local news, stuff about my town/county and periodic updates on slow moving things that I have followed for years but often forget about in the interim. </p>
<p>It does have a bad rap though, I think a lot of people don't use it enough for it to really dial in. It can be pretty trash at first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is true. The lengthy answer is rightish, but leaves out the fact that the lungs will reabsorb water/saliva. Many substances will eventually disintegrate. Others are expectorated (fancy doctor term for coughing up phlegm). Generally speaking, aspiration happens frequently, given the sheer numbers of swallows performed by the average human each day. Aspiration pneumonia is a killer, to be sure, but generally only poses a serious risk to those who are already compromised health-wise, to begin with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that why swallowing a liquid and it going to wrong hole cause such a strong reaction which always feels like it takes alot longer before the coughing and the feeling off it goes away because it might stick more instead off something solid which comes out with a few good coughs?</p></div>		</li>
