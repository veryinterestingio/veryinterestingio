			<div class="markdown"><p>An excellent observation!  Skin looks and feels smooth, so does the wand.  What gives?  Well, compared to the size of the sound waves, both your skin and the wand are kinda bumpy.  Like how the Earth looks like a ball from far away, but up close we can see mountains.  The gel helps to fill in those gaps.</p></div>		</li>
