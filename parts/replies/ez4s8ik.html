<p>I appreciated it, but I wanted to put that high school German education to poor use.</p></div>		</li>

Me and a friend exchanged languages clumsily.
Now though we both communicate in the second language , and I'm completely fluent!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I speak German quite well and with little American accent, still they’d try to speak English with me. At first I was offended as I thought it was a criticism of my German, but turns out they just like to practice their second language too</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol I spent a month in Budapest and this is definitely true. The 5 words I know are &quot;thanks&quot;, &quot;hi/bye&quot;, &quot;sorry&quot;, &quot;cheeseburger&quot;, and &quot;the next stop is...&quot;. Hungarian is not a language learned by immersion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course it takes effort, you are learning a language, a new skill.  It's not that difficult though to learn a few words and some basics, even in touristic places. You just need some will.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah when traveling I always make an effort to learn some basics, but in a touristy area you can get by with very very little local language knowledge. It seems to help most with navigation and things like that. </p>
<p>But I’ve only travelled in Europe and USA where English is common and local languages have a lot in common with English and/or I studied them at school. I imagine finding la farmacia or l'hôtel might be trickier in a completely different writing system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can see how this can be done to be honest.</p>
<p>My wife and I travelled to Santiago (were from England) in a very ignorant way, I was surprised how little English people spoke, usually when you go travelling there's probably a percentage of people who speak English, but litterally no one, other than hotel staff, that we encountered, spoke English. Ordering food? Nope all menus are in Spanish and none of the staff speak English. Going to the shop and asking for things? Nope.</p>
<p>Just little things that are normally so easy at home became so challenging. In a shop a server started talking at me in Spanish, I just had to say &quot;lo siento, only English&quot; what followed was a very silent, awkward exchange. </p>
<p>Unfortunately my wife fell ill while we were away and our friend is a doctor, a quick phone call and she diagnosed her and told us what to buy over the counter.... That..... Was... a... challenge, to add insult to injury, in such a panic I left my credit card in the pharmacy, so going back and trying to explain &quot;lost card&quot; was awful. </p>
<p>At the time it's frustrating but you have to respect that this is their country, were the forgieners here. But as time went on, we started to pickup Chiliean Spanish and it got easier over time. The immersion effect is a real thing.</p>
<p>Edit: reading this back it seems like I'm complaining about people not speaking English and it being a hindrance, this is not the case at all I respect were the foreigners in their country, I mean it that it takes you out of your comfort zone in a scary yet interesting way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah most of poor countries are not good with a second foreign  language, except the very touristic places. Ex:  in mexico workers will speak english in touristic beaches, all included hotels, but go to rest of the country and there is no english there.</p></div>		</li>
