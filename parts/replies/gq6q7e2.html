			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve never heard that, but it makes sense. Sound is just changes in pressure vibrating hairs in your ear, so a large change in pressure at close range would cause serious damage to your ears, and opening your mouth would give the air trapped in your lungs the chance to escape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea that only helps if your far away.   If your close enough for a bomb to actually move you at all, your going to be close to death.  Forget about being &quot;thrown&quot; by a bomb, cause that guy is jelly inside.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I rephrased my question in a comment reply to the other person that commented. I'm kinda just curious about like, from an explosion beginning, to hitting &quot;something&quot;, to being on the other side of that &quot;something&quot;- what's the process from a physics standpoint? Like, what are the factors and how are they applied and what are the results?</p>
<p>I'm sorry if that's still really vague, especially if the video answers that, I have not yet gotten around to watching it yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The video answers an adjacent question, which might answer your question. Basically, if the explosion is close enough and strong enough, your insides get squished. Being behind something will help block the pressure wave and shrapnel, but it really depends on what you’re behind, how close you are to the explosion, how powerful the explosion is, and how lucky you are.</p></div>		</li>
