<p>Chickens DO NOT just fall over, play dead, or launch into an involuntary catatonic state at the sight of a snake. A 15 second YouTube search would show hours worth of contradictory video evidence.</p>
<p>Yes, chickens are relatively stupid, but they’re also pretty vicious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a chicken owner, I second this.</p>
<p>However, I do have a hen who plays dead as a defense response. Her only response when being threatened actually. She's really small, so every other chicken I have likes to bully the shit out of her. The hen she grew up with died, so she's also really lonely, only one of my other chickens tolerate her. Instead of running away, she just flops over and plays dead.</p>
<p>She has also been attacked by a juvenile hawk two times. Rather than run away, she plays dead, <em>and let's the hawk land on her and start ripping her feathers up</em>. She was saved by the fact that I was nearby and saw the hawk both times, and was able to scare it off. Also younger hawks are kind of stupid, so that helped as well.</p>
<p>She is treated by an outcast by my flock. If she dares  to enter the coop to eat, she is basically chased out. I say basically because if she doesn't play dead on the spot, she boots it out of there. She has to sneak into the coop when the rest of my chickens are absent in order to eat. During the winter, while the other chickens are enjoying the coop's protection, you will find her hiding under a bush. There was 7 inches of snow outside this winter and she was still outside.</p>
<p>As if she didn't need further humiliation, she was beaten by a pullet that she challenged to a fight. She can't even roost with the rest of the chickens because they just peck her until she leaves.</p>
<p>She is still alive to this day, and is currently two years old and some. She has also survived having parasites for a year, being bullied to the point where blood was drawn, and a rooster trying to exile her from the flock. She's had quite a life to say the least.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Stupid in a general sense. Their social intelligence and ability to learn rules is remarkable and probably better than that of rabbits.</p></div>		</li>
