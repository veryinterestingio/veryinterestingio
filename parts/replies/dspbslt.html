<p>Edit: Yes, yes there are better ways to save someone’s life, I know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern Military Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) is the current gold standard for combat trauma care. The general rule for any amputation, regardless of partial or complete, is to apply a tourniquet as quickly as possible. It’s difficult to determine the amount of bleeding there is at first glance, and given the myriad of dangerous tactical senarios you may be in while rendering treatment, the fastest and safest treatment is a tourniquet. There is risk for peripheral tissue damage from the lack of blood flow, but as long as perfusion is returned within 4 hours or so, it’s all good. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite right.  Arteries have a muscular layer called the tunica media, which has a smooth muscle layer.  This is what contracts longitudinally and circumferentially when an artery receives trauma.  This then provides the physiologic mechanism for decreasing blood loss.  The extremety muscles may contract a bit, but I've never found them to contribute to any significant extent towards stopping blood loss, and the amount of pressure that then can exert in this fashion is minimal.  This is a differing mechanism than a compartment syndrome.</p>
<p>Partial transection of the vessel does not allow it to fully vasospasm and contract, thus the continued bleeding.</p>
