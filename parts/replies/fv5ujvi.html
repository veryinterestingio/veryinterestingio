			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm working on the conservation of a <em>ridiculously</em> endangered species, one that's been isolated on an island since the last glacial maximum, and has probably never had more than a few thousand members in its population at any time in the last 12,000 years.  At it's low point, some 17 years ago it fell to 40 individuals (including all ages and reproductive status).</p>
<p>We are having genetic work done on the species right now, and we expect that it'll show a massive amount of inbreeding, but we also expect that inbreeding isn't going to be a big issue given the multiple thousands of years they've spend as a small, confined population.</p>
<p>The bigger concern is diseases and a lack of genetic variability to assist in resisting disease.</p>
<p>It's a primate that's in an area that's already over-impacted by tourism, and the region has its food heavily on the gas when it comes to increasing the tourism in the region.  The protective measures taken to keep a distance between the animals and tourists are under ever increasing strain, potentially exposing them to human transferred zoonotic diseases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, It's not 100% birth defect rates from inbreeding. They did a study on this and found that siblings having children or parents with children have a birth defect rate of about 42% (people who share 50% of your DNA)</p>
<p>First cousins have a birth defect rate of about 11%</p>
<p>Unrelated people in this same study had a birth defect rate of 7%</p>
<p>So, if you have children with your parent or sibling with the same parents, more than half your children would not have any significant birth defects. This obviously assumes you don't personally have any double recessive genetic defects. Those would obviously be super high probability.</p>
<p>Obviously 42% is rather high, so it makes sense for society to strongly discourage mating at that level, but the main reason to prohibit first cousins from marrying is mostly because of the family power dynamics that come into play and how that can be abused.</p>
<p>Now if you have generations of first cousins marrying as a lot of people in the midwest ended up doing during colonial times, you start to get some weird results. There was a condition where people had blue skin because of a double recessive defect known as methemoglobinemia. It wasn't actually harmful, but these people looked weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify on that 7% for unrelated people, there's a key thing about that figure which might not be immediately apparent at first glance.  It comes from the control group in that study, which was children of non-related parents, whose mothers had <em>also</em> had children by incest. Further, here's the abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A group of 161 children from incestuous matings has been examined and compared with 95 of their half-sibs. The parental age distribution showed considerable differences between the groups, and the period of observation was longer in children of incestuous origin The educational level of the parents was below average; 20 of the 141 mothers were mentally retarded. Information about the fathers was less complete in both groups, but 8 of 138 fathers in the consanguineous group were known to be mentally subnormal. Prenatal, neonatal and infant mortality was higher among children from incestuous unions, and mental retardation as well as congenital malformations, single and multiple, were far more frequent among these children than among their half-sibs who were offspring of unrelated parents.    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, this doesn't really sound like a representative sample of the general population. I wouldn't consider it particularly surprising that 7% of the control group had birth defects when at least 14% of the mothers have what sound like a birth defect. But equally I don't think this study actually adequately assesses the risk of a consanguineous relationship in healthy individuals when so many of the parents either possessed known developmental disorders or were of unknown health. Unfortunately I can't actually read the study as I don't have access, but I'd also be curious if the paper controlled for the fact that many such pregnancies occur while the mother is herself a child, which would also likely increase the likelihood of a birth defect.</p>

<p>Pinging u/whatkindofrerd, u/cutelyaware since I saw you question the study's definition of &quot;birth defect&quot;.  I think it means what you'd expect it to mean, but the 7% figure suggests the defects were overrepresented in the studied population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gotta look at how the study was conducted. They used mothers from incestuous relationships and then compared their children. Some of those children were also from an incestuous relationship, and some were not. </p>
<p>Obviously most people are not born to mothers who were born of incest, so the numbers for the general public would be much lower. </p>
<p>For a study like this the actual percentages are basically meaningless, and its more the ratios between them that matters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically everyone is born with a birth defect because some genes just never get copied correctly. For the vast majority of the populace, though, the difference isn't enough to make a noticeable difference. I'm a little curious how they defined &quot;birth defect&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
