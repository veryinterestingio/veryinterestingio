			<div class="markdown"><p>The cytokine storm and it's inflammatory results are not the only symptoms that cause long term damage. There are neurological issues, not fully understood, but unrelated to the above,  that cause long term brain fog, dizziness, and olfactory nervous problems. There are also other symptoms that can cause harm outside of the storm.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been studies that show even if you have a mild case of Covid-19 that long term after-effects can be highly (over 50%) likely in young populations (long hauler Covid.) Before spreading this outdated info anymore, please see at least these two links:</p>

<p>I'm not really digging deep into uow the neurological symptoms seem to be caused so just based on one of our talks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have actually read both of those articles, and I can state that the research is still ongoing because we don't have a definitive reason for why individuals have long covid, nor do we definitively know why getting a vaccination helped some but not others recover from long covid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. We can 'suspect' various things, but we have almost no data on or real understanding of Long Covid. Whether mild Covid in a vaccinated person leads to a lower level of Long Covid symptoms than in an unvaccinated person should be urgently studied. We need a lot more info on Long Covid, along with the many post viral disorders that have the same symptom clusters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, too diverse of potential root causes to simply name one, and too little known at the time. All I can say is that everyone should do their absolute best to not get infected even if they believe they will survive because what happens after each persons recovery is not well predicted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean then you have studies like these where long covid isn't that common</p>
<p><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.19.20214494v1" target="_blank">https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.19.20214494v1</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reports of “Long-COVID”, are rising but little is known about prevalence, risk factors, or whether it is possible to predict a protracted course early in the disease. We analysed data from 4182 incident cases of COVID-19 who logged their symptoms prospectively in the COVID Symptom Study app. 558 (13.3%) had symptoms lasting &gt;28 days, 189 (4.5%) for &gt;8 weeks and 95 (2.3%) for &gt;12 weeks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The study also shows a distinct pattern of <em>who</em> has &quot;Long COVID&quot; most often; it's mostly the same cohort who are at most risk of death (advanced age, poor health) with the interesting difference of being heavily female (most who die are male).</p>
<p>This was only based on people with symptoms, as well; estimates of how many people never have any symptoms at all (fully asymptomatic) vary quite a bit (between 20 and 80%).</p>
<p>Just like dying from the disease, a relatively small percentage ends up being enough cases across the population to be staggering; but for the individual your risk is relatively low.</p>
<p>Bottom line is that at the moment organ damage from covid seems highly unlikely in most cases unless you're hospitalized</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for posting this. Feels like a lot of folks are overestimating the risk especially for people under the age of 50. It is still rare, yet I see people acting like your chance of getting brain damage etc if you have covid, even asymptomatic, is quite high…</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I believe to be true. If the person has a severe reaction then surely it makes sense for there to be potential long haul issues as they had damage caused. However, if the reaction was minimal/asymptomatic then it would make no sense for it to cause damage after the fact. The virus was not strong enough to the person to cause problems when they had it but would leave them with an after  effect? Just does not make sense lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this accurate?</p>
<p>I thought the cytokine storm was a super overreaction, not just the normal body fighting infection creating inflammation. Correct me if I'm wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SARS-CoV-2 is to Covid-19 the same way HIV is to AIDS.  You can be HIV positive and not have AIDS, but everyone who has AIDS is HIV positive.  Not everyone who contracts SARS-CoV-2 or it's variants (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon etcetera) develop covid-19, but they are all infected with the virus.  Covid-19 is a condition that derives from being infected and your body overreacting to the virus.  That's why they say you are a hospitalized with covid-19, not that you are infected with covid-19.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the hospital if you have detectable amount of virus resulting in positive test, you have covid 19 and are on isolation regardless of symptoms /symptom severity. If you are outpatient and get a swab at a drive through clinic and it is positive, you are notified you have covid19 and are to quarantine. If you get a positive test (detecting sars-cov2) in any setting, you have covid19 and are added to the stat sheet. (I been working covid units since the beginning)</p>
<p>I agree with one term is the actual virus and one term is for a collection of varied symptoms, but not in terms of testing positive doesn't mean you have covid19... we haven't worked that way for over a year now. Covid 19 is testing positive for the virus and having any symptoms, no symptoms, anything. Think silent spreaders, think full blown out respiratory failure. Any end of the spectrum.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, cytokine storm is a defined condition, people with Covid generally aren't dying of it.</p>
<p>Even a year ago it was known only 15% of mortality was due to it. 15% is a lot but no where near enough to generalise in the manner they have. With information available from a year ago on this subject they are just not informed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>its not really. Covid is a type of viral infection, which manifests as a lot of different symptoms all over the body, the &quot;cytokine storm&quot; being a very serious reaction not always present. All of this is easily available on the CDC website where they list symptoms of covid-19</p></div>		</li>
