<p>habitation' for crew en route; to on-Mars habitats (infrastructure) ; food, water and resource availablility  during the round trip portions as well as on the Mars  surface ;  the impacts of humans living in confined space for so long; new space suits and rovers for humans on a dusty surface environment;  where to get water; how to communicate with Earth?  what to do in emergencies etc etc.    (Considere this:  The ISS is about 300 miles overhead; the moon is about 250,000 miles away--- and Mars is aboutr 50 MILLION miles away.  Imagine packing for a trip like that... and taking everything with you..... You'll be totally independent of Earth....<br />
So Everything is a big hurdle!    It makes you appreciate what we have on Earth....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a part of it would be figuring out how to build autonomous housing for the first settlers. </p>
<p>There's no reason you couldn't send Ikea buildings and some rovers programmed with basic construction operations controlled from earth. They could assemble it and clean it over a long time - dust could settle between steps and thermal expansion accounted for in tightening, or whatever. </p>
<p>2 years and 10 packages later, humans would land, move into the pre-assembled shelters, and repurpose the rovers and remaining bits that were sent over. </p>
<p>I think the biggest issue is that humans have become very very safe. Exploration used to be risky - being a pioneer meant someone you know dying of an otherwise preventable issue every year. But how many people have died in space travel? A few dozen? And most of us could probably name several of the incidents. </p>
<p>To colonize Mars, we'll need to be willing to risk our own lives. Brilliant people - engineers, doctors, scientists - will need to make a crossing they know may kill them, and certainly will be one way. I don't know if we're ready for that.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>18 during a spaceflight, all of them during launch (Challenger), landing (Soyuz 1), or deorbiting (Columbia in the atmosphere, Soyuz 11 outside). The three deaths in Soyuz 11 in 1971 are still the only deaths in space.</p>
<p>If you divide this by the total number of humans launched to space you get something like a 3% risk.</p>
