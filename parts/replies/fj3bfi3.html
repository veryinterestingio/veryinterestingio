<p>One of the concerns about GMO foods is centred around this: if DNA or RNA is robust enough to be reliably inserted into new organisms through vectors like phages (viruses), then will it hang around long enough in organisms that eat that food (i.e us) to be incorporated into their genomes as well? Still under study, but a valid worry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One that has pretty much disproven with complete certainty already. In close to 40 years of commercial use of GMOs as stock feed and in human food, not a single trace of such an extremely hypothetical gene transfer through food has been found, despite the immense scrutinity under which genetically modified organisms had been put.</p>
<p>In addition, even if there were such a mechanism, it would work for <em>all</em> kinds of food containing nucleic acids, not just GMOs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, in fact, you can purchase the product of that experimentation through glow in the dark fish, it's called Glofish. Basically they put the genes of fluorescent jelly fish into zebra fish embryos so that they inherit the gene, scientist have done the same with cats as well. But you can't buy a glow in the dark cat just yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. In fact it's a basic research tool â€” any molecular-biology grad student (and many undergrads) will have done this.</p>
<p>The fluorescent protein that Zypherus02 mentions (GFP) is a good example; it's from a jellyfish, and a very common thing to do is to splice it onto the end of some other gene in an organism you're studying (plant, animal, microbe, whatever) so that you can see when and where that other gene is active. You're basically &quot;tagging&quot; the gene with a fluorescent addition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But isn't DNA more stable than RNA?</p>
<p>In RNA the ribose sugar has a hydroxyl group at the 2' position, which makes RNA chemically unstable compared to DNA which has hydrogen at the 2' position. </p>
<p>Is that not a problem since the GI tract is acidic rather than alkaline?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your GI tract is full of RNAses and DNAses which will chew up any DNA and RNA into individual nucleic acids. The chemical properties of the molecules doesn't factor into it.</p></div>		</li>
