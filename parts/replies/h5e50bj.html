			<div class="markdown"><p>Other way around. The scientist was trying to prove H. pylori did cause stomach ulcers, and almost no one believed him. To prove that they were the causative agent, he ingested a culture a H. pylori, and developed ulcers as a result. He then took antibiotics, and showed that the ulcers went away. He won a Nobel prize for his work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's backwards. He thought it <em>did</em> cause ulcers but had failed to prove it in pigs, so he tested it on himself.</p></div>		</li>
