			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this excellent answer: evolution works most efficiently when the effects of the deleterious behavior show up BEFORE reproductive age.  Dying of a heart attack or diabetes at 55 doesn't have much of an impact on how many of your children survive to reproduce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Conversely, obesity is correlated with lower ses. Lower ses is also correlated with having more children so one might be able to argue the selective pressure is working in the opposite direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Though it may have more of an impact on humans, since we have a family and village structure that relies on the elderly, at least to some extent. The longer childrearing lasts, the more useful elderly people are, basically. </p>
<p>Old people also played an absolutely massive role in Australian Aboriginal communities, as they guided family units on their walkabouts between water locations, and getting directions wrong meant death for the whole group. And considering they had no written language, and their walking routes could take years to complete, elder knowledge was absolutely vital.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It was much more recent than that. Don’t forget that the agricultural revolution was only about 12,000 years ago. And the industrial revolution was only 200 years ago. And in our grandparents’ time, there was only about a quarter to a third of the current global population. </p>
<p>The way humans live today is all very new and unusual.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does evolutionary pressure work if the adaptation doesn't make a difference to reproduction rates?</p>
<p>Premature death from obesity still happens way past the point that most people will have ahd children and passed the genes on.</p>
<p>If we got to a society where people sudde ly because ultra picky and no-one would consider having children with someone overweight then I could see an evolutionary shift towards humans that are able to control their weight but if you consider 60% of the American population is overweight or obese and the population is growing... Its not just the thin 50% people having babies</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the adaptation doesn't affect reproduction, then it exists in the population.</p>
<p>There are things like mutations in muscle attachments that exist in  various percentages of populations, but because they do not affect physical or sexual fitness, they are just there.  If there was a reason for those adaptations to make a difference to reproduction, then it would become a selection pressure.</p>
<p>Take for example blue eyes.  Random mutation that doesn't affect physical fitness.  It will randomly spread as people with that mutation have children.  If the society they were in decided that blue eyes were more desirable, then the blue eye gene would spread.  Or if the blue eye mutation gave some other benefit that is unrelated to societal pressures, then it would tend to spread.</p></div>		</li>
