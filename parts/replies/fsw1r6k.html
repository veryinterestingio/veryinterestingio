			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation. Your examples fit the survivorship bias model well... <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias</a> From this article: &quot;During World War II, the statistician Abraham Wald took survivorship bias into his calculations when considering how to minimize bomber losses to enemy fire.[10] The Statistical Research Group (SRG) at Columbia University, which Wald was a part of, examined the damage done to aircraft that had returned from missions and recommended adding armor to the areas that showed the least damage, based on his reasoning. This contradicted the US military’s conclusions that the most-hit areas of the plane needed additional armor.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Survivorship bias. An example I used the other day was that yes, my house is 100 years old. But it was built with the whole neighborhood around it and it's one of about three left from that era. 1920s homes arent better as a rule than today, but the ones LEFT were the exceptional ones of their time. You're comparing the cream of the crop to the full spectrum of today.</p></div>		</li>
