			<div class="markdown"><p>It can and has happened, but it's rare. The hot three-minute scene you just watched probably took a day to film, with directors and ADs and lighting crews making minute changes throughout and endless stops and starts and doing the same dialogue and motions over and over again while they shoot from close-up, from far away, from different angles, etc. Multiple actors have described sex scenes as the least sexiest thing they've ever done.</p></div>		</li>
