			<div class="markdown"><p>The authority on lucid dreaming, who has done more research on this topic than anyone else, is Stephen LaBerge. Check out his books! We also like the book called A Field Guide to Lucid Dreaming, but there are many useful books on this topic. As for proven benefits and negative effects, the research on signal-verified lucid dreams is still at an early stage. There are many hints at benefits, but no guarantees, so we are cautious about saying at this point what exactly can be gained. We are in favor of more research to help address this question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You state this in your post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While in Wales, I also collaborated with researchers at nearby Swansea University to develop a new method of inducing lucid dreams. This method, dubbed Targeted Lucidity Reactivation, was able to induce lucid dreams in half of the participants in a single nap session. Now at Northwestern, I'm testing new methods and applications for communicating with dreamers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems you already have an effective method that half your participants were able to implement on the first try. </p>
<p>It seems letting people know in here how that method is done would be a great way for people to actually start instead of reading a long book (many on here will not do that and simply give up).</p>
<p>Could you share how that method works and how someone can implement it?</p></div>		</li>
