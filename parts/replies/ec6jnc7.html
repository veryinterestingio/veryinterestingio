			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to brown dwarfs, a dying star that doesn't become a black hole or neutron star can collapse into a white dwarf, which no longer undergoes fusion but still glows white-hot from leftover heat. After a really ridiculously long time (minimum 1,000,000,000,000,000 years) a white dwarf will cool to the point that it no longer glows, and become a black dwarf. But dwarfs of all types are not technically stars because they don't undergo fusion, so you're still correct.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think you mean neutron star.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, a star is created by hydrostatic equilibrium. That is when the forces pushing outwards balance those pushing inward. In stars like the Sun, gravity pulls inward while the energy from fusion in the core is what pushes outward as radiation pressure. In white dwarfs, the force pushing outward is electron degeneracy pressure and in neutron stars it is neutron degeneracy pressure. A black star would be a neutron star or white dwarf that has cooled enough to no longer emit light. A black hole forms when gravity over powers even neutron degeneracy pressure and there is no force to prevent the star from collapsing further.</p>
<p>Edit: The universe is not old enough for any white dwarfs or neutron stars to have cooled enough to be 'black stars'. So right now, they are purely theoretical.</p></div>		</li>
