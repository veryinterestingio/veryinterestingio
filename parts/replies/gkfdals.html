			<div class="markdown"><p>Something that first time home buyers might not know: when you go to the bank for a mortgage, the bank will say &quot;okay, we'll loan you up to this much money as long as we think the house is actually worth it.&quot;  So when you see a financing clause that's the potential buyer going to the bank and saying &quot;remember when you said you'd loan me the money? It's for this place.&quot;</p>
<p>Even if you're approved for a mortgage you may not be approved for THAT mortgage. The bank may be concerned with the condition of the house, state of repair etc etc etc and deny you financing for that house. Doesn't mean you can't get a mortgage, just means you can't get that house.</p>
<p>Got cash? No conditions and you're good. Similarly to a commenter above, I put in a bid for $30k less than list in a market that was taking a dip (in two years the market has gone up about 15% from what I paid for similar places) and while the seller's realtor tried to get me to revise my bid up before they would formally accept it, I stuck to my guns and got it despite having another person bidding 20k more than me with a financing clause.</p>
<p>If they had taken the other offer and the financing fell through, they would have to go back to market knowing that their place wasn't worth what they were asking and would have had to lower the price even more so they bit the bullet.</p>
<p>CIF is king.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Real estate agent here - &quot;cash&quot; buyers rarely have the purchase price of the home in cash, it just means they have financing prearranged or are so confident in their ability to get financing they don't need a condition as such. Cash buyers still get mortgages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the key difference is they put up some good faith deposit along with their offer that doesn't have the contingency &quot;well if the bank says no then I get this back&quot;.  </p>
<p>Because normally even &quot;preapproved&quot; borrowers will need to have the bank review the state of the property and appraisal and inspection results, and if the bank thinks you are overpaying they might decline to loan you the money.  If you say you're putting 20% down and the bank thinks the house is worth 10% less than your offer, then as far as they are concerned you're actually only putting 10% down.</p>
<p>&quot;Cash buyer&quot; might have a lot of leeway to pony up more down payment if bank needs them to, thus they aren't worried about risking their good faith deposit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Their confidence level and risk tolerance I guess?  Regular buyers can make offers without financing conditions as well but if they haven't arranged funding by the closing date there's gonna be a lawsuit. Cash buyers know they'll get a mortgage or other private financing and don't need to worry about a bank approving the deal beforehand. This doesn't mean they don't require bank approval afterwards</p></div>		</li>
