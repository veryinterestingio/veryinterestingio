<p>Endorphins really don’t kick in until around five miles.</p>

<p>Motivation for me to get into shape, so that I can get into shape lol. I never liked running but I've also never really been fit enough to run more than a mile. I can't wait to be in good enough shape to actually enjoy exercising. Until then, I just try to gather my satisfaction from the fact that &quot;some day&quot; it'll feel good. </p>
<p>I try to motivate myself based on the fact that I need to &quot;respect my body&quot; and &quot;get healthier&quot; and &quot;someday there might be a weird zombie apocalypse where they can actually run and not just stumble around.&quot; But sometimes it get's hard, like when my heart starts beating at a rate that I associate with being pre-panic-attack, and when my underboob sweat starts causing my sports bra to slide around. </p>
<p>I know, my life is hard. I try to take it one day at a time...(/s. obviously.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seriously. 1 mile sucks. 1-3 is a chore. 3-5 is hard. When you start doing more than 5, it's just an activity. You get runners high towards the end, and you feel great for the rest of the day</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve picked up running 3 miles a day. On the cooler months, I’ll run 5 miles. </p>
<p>My body always checks the watch at around 1.5miles. I tell myself to make it to 2 miles. Once I get there, I just keep telling myself “1 mile left!” ... some days I complete it without a problem but other days I have to really test my mind. Some lady thought I insulted her one time as I was running  behind her walk. Under my breath, “...c’mon bitch!...” </p>
<p>She was a little startled but when she realized I wasn’t looking at her, rather, staring at the ground, she just kept walking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the most important thing to begin with is doing something that you like, or at least don't mind doing. Getting a consistent workout schedule is much easier when you know you'll at least have fun doing it. Convincing yourself to exercise in a way that you hate is not a strategy with a high success rate. The only reason I kept going for runs was that I realized I liked the feeling it gave me when I was done, and I didn't mind the running itself. I've tried going to the gym, but I don't feel comfortable there, so I haven't kept going. So finding something that suits you is more important that what would be &quot;best&quot;. Like the saying, don't let perfect be the enemy of good. Something is better than nothing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I ran cross country and the 800m (far more competitively at the 800. My ankles hated CC), and even at the meets where I just ran the 800, rather than adding a leg of a relay or two, I was still on runners high. Never really got that with CC.</p>
<p>If I had to venture a guess, it has more to do with the level of exertion when racing. To get competitive in CC, you have to be able to run 10 miles pretty casually, so 3ish miles doesn't really tax you. To run the 800 competitively, you're on a full sprint for 2 laps, which is brutal even with the same conditioning as it takes for CC...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>4 years in the marine corp and never got that high people talk about. I hated running 1 mile or 12 miles and every step in between. Lifting weights was great though and always made me feel good afterwards. So the question is do some people have a harder time switching to aerobic? Or is running just the devil. If it helps I loved swimming and would regularly swim a few miles as a workout.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to run in my youth, my best result was a 10th place in a full marathon. I did get the joy of the accomplishment, but never a &quot;high&quot;. I have hear about that my all life and never understood it.</p>
<p>I switched to mountain biking some years ago, my knees couldn't handle jogging anymore (I'm getting close to 50). On a bike, 20 mins riding and I get that &quot;high&quot; people always talked about.. it's awesome, it makes my day. For the rest of the day I can only think on the next ride.</p>
<p>Now I question myself why I didn't switch earlier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My triathlete friends always say that you never get out of the pool feeling bad.<br />
It may just be level of exertion. If you are working too hard while running then it won’t be fun. Slow down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always felt a different rush from lifting.<br />
I’m sure that there are some biochemical differences between people - but everyone will eventually get to aerobic if you exercise long enough.<br />
The endorphins are different - I didn’t know as much about them.</p></div>		</li>
