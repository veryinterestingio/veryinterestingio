			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really _not_ this, and that's a big misunderstanding of how evolution works. The inputs are random (mutation) but there's a selection mechanism present: bad random mutations that stop you from reproducing are eliminated, good random mutations that increase your chance of having viable offspring are selected for. So the example is more like we have millions of monkeys bashing away on typewriters, but the random outputs that happen to move us towards the goal we want (Shakespeare) are selected while those that don't are discarded.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And you end up with 10,000 stories which each had merit to their particular editor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And yours is the most correct answer.</p>
<p>Evolution doesn't produce the MOST optimal solutions but solutions that are merely GOOD ENOUGH.</p>
<p>There are very few benefits of pain causing loss of consciousness. While you are unconscious a predator could easily eat you. Wound is left unwashed and untreated long enough to cause gangrene. Blood loss itself could easily end your life. Passing out in extreme heat or extreme cold would prevent you from seeking shelter, how fucking stupid is that?</p>
<p>In most cases it's just a side effect of pain being roughly proportional to injury. Very detrimental. I think it evolved as somewhat beneficial to treat open wounds. If you pass out the blood has a chance to clot and seal the wound thus preventing a possible infection and prevent the the stupid, ape-like hooman from interfering in the first phase of healing process. This is particularly important in case of multiple wounds sustained from  multiple bites and mauling caused by claws, talons and teeth of predators such as sabre tooth tigers or bears or lions. Encounters with these guys  guarantee bleeding from multiple wounds and resulting in proportional pain.</p>
<p>But as outlined above, there are a lot of drawbacks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that in presence of fear and subsequent chemicals released in the body, pain subsides until the &quot;high&quot; of the fear wear off... aka you are safe and can tend to your injuries...</p>
<p>This is another imperfect system, most likely evolved from the need of getting out of a situation with immediate danger (a predator? slipping on the edge of a cliff?) where the need for immediate action is more important than prevent further damage.</p></div>		</li>
