			<div class="markdown"><p>Because a tooth isn't glued on, it had roots. Permanent tooth pushes on the root, and at one point it loses the grip and falls out, and it takes a bit for the new tooth to go through empty canal and emerge outside. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because all of your adult teeth don't form at the same time. Some people have adult teeth that never form. A common tooth that never forms is a wisdom tooth. But luckily that tooth doesn't replace another one. </p></div>		</li>
