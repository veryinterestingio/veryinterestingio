			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and also sometimes in a sport called wakeskating to see at night back in the early part of last century.  We eventually switched it out for zirconium in cameras though because we decided magnesium wasn't bright enough and wanted something <em>even brighter</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why specifically for wakeskating? Couldnt they use flashlights instead? Also why were they wake skating at night instead of the day?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, wakeskating is from early 20th century? What? Did you mean late last century or is it a lot older than it seems?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One important point: The powder gets spread out a bit while it burns. This increases the surface area of the light source and gives the blinding effect (rather than a pinpoint flash).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couple of videos (loud noise warning).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amOZUGHB55Q" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amOZUGHB55Q</a>
-Notice how there is a big ball of particles that are bright / burning out.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/fHMTw7slPyg?t=137" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/fHMTw7slPyg?t=137</a>
-Notice the bright flash even off camera and the reverb. It's LOUD.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIVg9BhmIBE" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIVg9BhmIBE</a>
-Pause at 1:52 to see explosion / light source</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy6jwErb4Wc" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy6jwErb4Wc</a>
-More explosion show</p>
<p>The thing about flashbangs isn't just that they blind you. They are INCREDIBLY loud. When you use them on someone who is not expecting it, their adrenaline spikes and they completely tilt in confusion.</p>
<p>Ever sat at home and had a cabinet fall down or a door slam from a draft? It's sort of like that x 10.</p></div>		</li>
