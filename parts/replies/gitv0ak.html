<p>It makes me not trust dealerships on looking at my auto and their suggestions on what needs to be replaced.</p>
<p>I use to HATE getting back skids of parts and having to go through all of them to see if they were trying to scam our dealer returns program by putting used parts in the box for return.</p>
<p>I've had a couple dealerships licenses yanked because of that and it was annoying that they would fight my write up claims that &quot;used part shipped back in box.&quot; I documented it and had pictures but they would still say that wasn't the case in which our manager would write off it sometimes if it was under $X amount.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ehhh the incentives and bonuses arent really a perk, they are just an additional sales tool. The purpose of them really is to obscure the cost and value of the vehicle, making the customer think it's worth more than it really is. Similar concept to hospitals and insurance companies with their secret contract prices. Hospital show you a bill for $100 for two aspirin and a bandaid, but no one actually pays that, and its settled up with the insurance company, leaving the consumer completely in the blind about how much the services are really worth and who's making money. </p>
<p>Similarly, dealer buys up inventory and can honestly say to a customer that it cost them x dollars and they are 'losing money' by going under invoice price but you just happen to be there at the right moment yada yada yada... when in reality they know full well the end cost will be a couple grand lower once the sale is finalized. Customer walks away happy, thinking he got a great deal when he really just paid the average selling price or higher.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really the focus of the story.  The manufacturer gives the <em>dealer</em> incentives for reaching sales goals, these aren't customer facing objectives or promotions, and don't relate at all to car sales advertised on TV.</p>
<p>The episode is titled &quot;129 cars&quot;.  The dealership has to sell 129 cars in the month to meet the sales goal and get an $80,000 bonus from my the manufacturer, which will determine whether the dealership will be in the black for the month.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some elements of truth here but not many. My ex has been director of finance for an automobile group for over ten years, and she remarried another car guy, so that's all we talk about when we get together. </p>
<p>New car dealerships for Ford/Toyota/GM/Nissan etc. make next to no money on new cars. $100 over invoice was not uncommon, especially near month end, when bonuses and floor plan loans (FPL) were set. The FPL is a loan provided by the manufacturer to cover the cost of the cars on the lot. If the dealer doesn't reach a certain volume, his FPL will be reduced. Fewer cars available = fewer sales (odds are you won't have the right colour or mix of options, and some customers will walk rather than wait). Similarly, sales people bonuses get paid on cars sold first, and gross profit second, so the incentive to move those last few cars at next to no profit is maximized if your bonus needs two more units. </p>
<p>The money was made at the back end, in either add-on sales (extended warranty, rust proofing, etc.), service (80% of dealership profits, consistently across all dealerships she monitored), and used cars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on the multiple dealers owning the same brand thing: </p>
<p>The dealers have a name as well. They have the brand and another name on the signs generally. So, for example we have a Honda, nissan, and kia dealer in the same area owned by the same people right? So like there is a set of dealers in flordia, &quot;crown honda&quot;, &quot;crown nissan&quot; and &quot;crown kia&quot; they are all owned by the same people/group. Its an easy way to tell if they are owned by the same group.</p></div>		</li>
