<p>If it never collides with another particle and we ignore drag, it would oscillate forever to the same distance north and south of the equator, or same latitude.</p>

<p>No, the inclination of the orbit is perturbed by the oblateness of the planet. An orbit exactly at the plane of the equator is unstable. This is a big problem for geostationary satellites around earth, they use about 90% of their station-keeping propellants to maintain zero inclination. </p>
<p>Left to itself, a satellite in geostationary orbit will increase its orbit inclination at about 0.9 degrees per year. Sometimes satellite operators will stop performing inclination correcting maneuvers at a certain point in the satellite's lifetime. The orbit will be less useful, because earth antennas will have to track the satellite for orbit inclination, but the satellite lifetime can be drastically extended. </p>
<p>If you stop correcting for inclination early enough, the lifetime can be extended so much that it won't be limited by propellant supply, other units like batteries and solar panels will fail before the propellant runs out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I may have oversimplified this in my other post, the oblateness of the earth alone doesn't change the inclination. It's the combination of the gravitational attractions of the sun and the moon, plus the irregular distribution of masses inside the earth that cause this. This makes the perturbation periodic.</p>
<p>The inclination will grow up to something around 60 degrees, I don't remember exactly how much, and then go back to zero and start growing again. This whole period lasts decades, about 30 years.</p>
<p>In the case of the earth, the perturbation caused by the moon's gravitational attraction is the most important factor, and that's why I don't think a ring around the earth could be stable.</p></div>		</li>
