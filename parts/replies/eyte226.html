It is difficult to keep two flat sheets of foil in close proximity separated, but with crinkled foil only the ”peaks” are contact points.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's fascinating. I always thought it is crinkled because foil crinkled anyway. Had no idea it was intentionally done that way</p></div>		</li>

<p>If the budget is large enough you can have flat sheets, e.g. for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope" target="_blank">JWST</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very awesome. Any idea what the budget difference is?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not so much budget as it is because JWST needs the thermal barrier to operate long term as a fundamental part of the system, rather than short-term single use. Physically separating the insulation layers with structural material like that isn't just expensive, it's heavy and would be entirely pointless for most other cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add onto this, the polymer is not actually mylar but a polyimide called kapton. It is the most thermally stable polymer we know of, I believe. The aluminum coating on the inside of it reflects the solar radiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Didn't know that about polyimide's thermal stability, but it makes sense. I'd read an article about polyimide aerogels being tested for use in spacecraft heat shields and spacesuit insulation, so that makes sense.</p></div>		</li>
