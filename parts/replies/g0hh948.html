			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, provided you're using uncommon words. With dictionary searches, you just expand the base set (e.g. try &quot;aaa&quot; through &quot;aaz&quot; and then &quot;aaaardvark&quot;, &quot;aaapple&quot;, &quot;aabanana&quot;, etc. with common words equivalent to one brute forced character). So, while the words you chose are not very common, it wouldn't be very strong to have a password like &quot;This is not going to be a very very good password.&quot; That's the same length as yours, but those are all very common words, so it's still relatively easy to brute force.</p>
<p>Better would be unusual words, and even better still would be a mix of different languages (&quot;avec fromage means with cheese&quot;).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comment sounds plausible, but itâ€™s actually not as impactful as you might think. Length alone has more impact than moderately increasing the dictionary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends highly on the algorithm used and whether or not the attacker is attacking an already-stolen list of password hashes or if they are attacking a server that has sane attempt policies in place.  For most people, for most services, the only factors that <em>really</em> matter are that your password is unique (that is, you aren't using that same password for some other service), and that your password isn't just you putting some minor variation on whatever the most common pattern is.</p>
<p>The only algorithm for which your example passphrase is &quot;weak&quot; is an algorithm that is trying to construct grammatically correct English sentences using the 100 most common English words, and then throws in one uncommon word (&quot;password&quot;) somewhere.  Under that algorithm, yes, the example sentence you gave is analogous to adding uncommon characters to a common password, or using a common pattern with an uncommon word.  But nobody is <em>using</em> that algorithm to attack passwords because nobody is using that to <em>create</em> their passwords.</p>
<p>(Also, I put &quot;weak&quot; in scare quotes up there because that's still a relatively strong password even against attackers using that algorithm.  It's 2000x100^10.  That's a 25-digit number.  You can chop off <em>five</em> of those digits to represent the reduced complexity of having to conform to Proper English, but that still puts it in the 40th percentile.  True, it's not strong enough to resist a targeted attack, but most people don't need to worry about that - they just need their password to take longer to break than the attacker lets their algorithm run.  Which is usually &quot;not all that long&quot;.)</p>
<p>The real reason that using pass<em>phrases</em> instead of pass<em>words</em> is useful is that is much easier to increase length and introduce complexity (by adding proper nouns, nicknames, or slang) without having the users forget it.  The easier it is for the user to remember the password, the more likely they are to use a new one everywhere, and the more likely they are to <em>change</em> their passwords for important services more frequently than &quot;never&quot;.  Both of those are <em>at least</em> as important as making your password longer or increasing the dictionary size, but services are only capable of enforcing one of those, and they don't like it, so only security nerds ever really talk about it.</p></div>		</li>
