			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait why was I taught so fervently in school that vaccines are against viruses? Is it an urban myth that made itself into the classroom or is there some subtlety I'm missing?</p>
<p>Edit: thanks for all the answers! Yes, probably either me or my teacher made the false connection of 'viruses can mostly only be prevented through vaccines' ==&gt; 'vaccines are for viruses'. In fact thanks for also teaching me tetanus is a bacteria, I assumed through most of my life it was a virus because of the vaccine.</p></div>		</li>

<p>EDIT: A bit of an overgeneralization as others pointed out, antiviral treatments exist against certain viruses. Not nearly on par with antibiotics yet though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably the reason why vaccines are commonly associated with virus, despite the fact that it can also be used for bacteria.</p>
<p>Also, we technically have an antiviral medication for virus. It's not used frequently tho because virus use another cells to reproduce/replicate, which makes it hard to attack the virus itself without damaging the host cells.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;...the issue is that vaccines are pretty much our only <em>practical</em> tool against viruses, as antibiotics don't help against them, <em>and general-purpose antiviral drugs are garbage by comparison to antibiotics, with very limited effect and substantial side effects at high doses.</em> &quot;</p>
<p>Our best and most widely used general-purpose antivirals seem to have an effect that's barely statistically significant, whereas general-purpose antibiotics have almost completely eliminated mortality from dozens of diseases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are antivirals now too. But they are usually much more specific than antibiotics. HIV and HBV can be controlled with treatment and Hepatitis C can be cured.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it's because we often hear that antibiotics are against bacteria, not viruses, that we assume that vaccines are against viruses? And while it's true, it's only part of the story: vaccines prevents bacteriological infections too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Which is completely logical when you think about it. If vaccines are generally about stimulating the immune response to be able to take care of the threat itself, why wouldn't it be possible to do against bacterial threats? The immune system obviously has had to defend itself against both for millions of years.</p>
<p>That's not to say it couldn't be otherwise, but that would be my default assumption until proven otherwise.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are trials vaccinating against some common mutated proteins from cancers, and building up a tolerance to snake venom is often effectively vaccinating yourself against it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s less risky to vaccinate chickens. Even though vaccines are generally extremely safe, none are perfect. There is always a chance of a one-in-a-million allergic reaction or other side effect, so why not let the chickens take that risk instead of humans?</p>
<p>Also, we can force chickens to vaccinate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s the problem with vaccines: they’re too good. They’re so effective that people forget the disease ever was a problem, leading to questioning what the point of the vaccine is.</p>
<p>That’s not your fault! I’m sure a lot of people don’t know more than you do about anthrax.</p></div>		</li>
