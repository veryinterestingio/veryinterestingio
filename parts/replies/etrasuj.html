			<div class="markdown"><p>What visa? Russia? South East Asia? As said in this thread, for political reasons sometimes consulates and border agents get a bit annoying, but US passport is as good as a German one for travel. Although it's true, on average a German person is much more traveled, so they are kinda used to them everywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's all kinds of measurements of passport power, usually based on the number of countries you can get into without a visa or visa on arrival. Germany ranks slightly higher than the US at 187 vs 183 but Germany is also one of the best in Europe. Norway, UK, Belgium, and Ireland are also 183.</p></div>		</li>
