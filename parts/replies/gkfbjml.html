			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah.  We had a 100kw diesel generator at my work that idled for 20 minutes per week.  Once a year we brought in a load bank just to get it warm enough to stop wet stacking.  I bought my GTI (gas) just as the scandal was breaking and was thankful that I didn't have to deal with the hassle but I imagine the diesel is actually a great car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is! I have the 2017 Golf GT with the post diesel gate 2.0l diesel engine and its amazing, though I have had to run it a couple of times since lock down as I no longer commute, the DPF gets clogged up and needs regeneration</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can only imagine these smaller annoyances get worse if it gets cold enough outside where gelling might be a problem. Like it's 20F during the day and single digits at night right now and I leave for work at 5AM.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm in the market for a diesel pusher coach and am looking at a pre-egr mid 90's detroit series 60 mainly so I can avoid such issues.  Wife wants to pull a fifth wheel and I don't really want to because new diesel pickups are expensive to buy and expensive to keep operational.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>American diesels suck with def. Instead of building an engine around the system they bolted it on and it was terrible. Europe built it around def and they run awesome. I ran two sprinters past 300k miles and never had an issue with the def system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The big thing for diesels is you need to get the exhaust up to high temp to make sure the dpf doesn't get clogged. All you have to do to prevent it is just hard accelerate every now and again and it will usually burn it clean</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only 600f? My pickup needs between 1000 and 1300f to clean out the DPF. All DPFâ€™s require at least 932f for the soot to burn. Mine has a 9th fuel injector in the exhaust pipe and sprays diesel right into the exhaust to get it hot enough.</p></div>		</li>
