			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your questions. There's a group of demographers who have raised questions about the UN's forecasts. We report what they are saying throughout the book. No, we did not publish in peer reviewed journals, but we cite many articles that are published in peer reviewed journals. The science on this isn't settled, and that's what we report. For us, this was a debate that needed to be exposed to a wider audience, that's why we wrote the book. DB</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>John: Our thesis rests on two aspects. First, a group of dissident demographers is challenging the United Nations Population Division assumptions. Those assumptions place the planet's population above seven billion people by the end of the century. But other demographers, citing accelerating urbanization, believe the number will top out at nine billion by mid century and start to decline. We travelled to six continents, interviewing statisticians and demographers, but also young people from a university campus in Seoul to a slum in New Delhi, and we concluded that the dissident demographers are right. </p></div>		</li>
