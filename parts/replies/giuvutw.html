			<div class="markdown"><p>The oldest known trees are about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_trees" target="_blank">4900 years old</a>.  That said, there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrochronology" target="_blank">overlapping tree-ring records</a> dating back over 12,000 years in Germany, and over 8,000 years in Ireland and the US Pacific Northwest.  The carbon dates of the tree rings match the ages given by counting the tree rings.  But none of the individual trees are still living at that age.</p></div>		</li>
