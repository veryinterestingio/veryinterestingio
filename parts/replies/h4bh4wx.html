			<div class="markdown"><p>Great write up. </p>
<p>Goats, for instance, make their own Vitamin C, so these processes are not that far away evolutionary speaking.</p>
<p>Edit: In fact, most mammals do and we're just missing (or devolved) the last step in making Vitamin C.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's right, we and all of our closest relatives (apes) do not make vitamin C because of that small genetic change. We were able to get enough with our plant centered diets to compensate, given that foods especially fruits have plenty of it. </p>
<p>Carnivores and others must produce their own because they would not find much if any vitamin C in their diets in the wild.</p>
<p>Fun fact: Potatoes have a fair amount of vitamin C in them naturally. Many green leafy vegetables have it as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also fun fact, guinea pigs don’t make vitamin C, and we’re accidentally instrumental in discovering the cause of scurvy. If pretty much any other animal had been used in the elimination diet testing, we never would have linked citrus and scurvy as early as we did.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Either there's a typo here, or you're actually a guinea pig...</p>
<p>I think it warrants some testing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation, got it! It makes sense, that our bodies neglected vitamin production and used the available resources to „pursue other innovations“, as you say. But what are those? Or to ask as a 5 year old: Is that why we’re so smart today?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think &quot;persue other innovations&quot; is the wrong way to think about it. There's are many more wasteful things our bodies do that are still around, so why remove vitamin biosynthesis first?</p>
<p>It's worth remembering that evolution is pretty blind. What doesn't kill you doesn't necessarily make you stronger. Our ancestors lost the ability to synthesize a few key biochemicals, but they didn't die off because they could get it from diet. Now we are stuck needing those biochemicals, and we call them <em>vita</em>mins because they are non-nutritional chemicals that we need in order to live.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But even so, lower energy consumption is pretty valuable. In this case, it's likely it was a mutation that helped people survive and reproduce as they, at the least, would be slightly less likely to starve in scarce times.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Brains, thumbs, sweat glands.</p>
<p>Humans have large brains, capable of complex thought.  We can invent tools (like spears).</p>
<p>Humans have thumbs, to grip and use those tools.  Humans are bipedal (not quadrapedal), which also means we can use those thumbs while on the move </p>
<p>Humans have sweat glands (most mammals do not) to cool themselves during physical exertion.  This gives humans endurance.  </p>
<p>Animals may have faster burst-speed than humans, but can't maintain it for more than a few minutes before they have to stop and cool down.  Meanwhile, a human can jog and pursue for hours.  Eventually, they will catch up to the tired animal and jam a spear in it's chest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being pale might discourage you from spending time in harsh sun, but it's actually an advantage for the production of Vitamin D! Light skin more readily absorbs Vitamin D than dark skin because the pigmint in dark skin blocks some of the solar rays that initiate Vitamin D synthesis. People with darker skin who live in regions with low sun availability are encouraged to seek supplements for this reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are Vit D insufficient, especially in the developed countries. I for one had it checked and take some pills during the darker months and it makes a huge difference for my wellbeing.</p>
<p>I do not recommend taking some blindly. If you think you might lack Vit D, get a simple blood test done and talk it over with a doctor.</p></div>		</li>
