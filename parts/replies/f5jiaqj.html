			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. What makes it cheese is bacteria or molds, and what makes most things &quot;bad&quot; is also bacteria. In this case, what makes something &quot;bad&quot; makes cheese &quot;good&quot;.</p>
<p>This is not true with all cheeses though.</p>
<p>Storytime: Once I cut a slice of brie and subsequently lost it in the fridge. Months later I found it, and the white rind on the outside had formed on the wedge slice I cut out, sealing it like a solid cheese pacman. The rind was completely alive.</p>
<p>That white stuff on dry sausages is another form of penicilium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Swiss cheese ain't swiss cheese.</p>
<p>In fact in Switzerland nothing is branded swiss cheese, and funny enough no one really eats what you refer to as swiss cheese.</p>
<p>And most swiss cheeses don't have holes. The one that famously does is Appenzeller cheese and comes in a lot of tasty varieties, but none are &quot;swiss cheese&quot;.</p>
<p>Now of course I know what you meant and if everyone calls this particular (tasteless imo) cheese this moniker then it might as well be its name.</p>
<p>So yeah, bacteria farts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Much like beer, wine, or cider. Food going bad is essentially uncontrolled infection by bacteria. Controlled infection tends to prevent uncontrolled infections by removing much of the food source (sugar and the like) and changing the acidity, salinity, and hydration of the food.</p>
<p>And pretty much all food preservation is changing acidity, salinity, or removing sugars/water to make the food less vulnerable to bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. While they produce antibacterial stuff around themselves it's not effective enough or concentrated enough to do more than protect the fungus itself. Nor will it make it into the bloodstream. Or even exist for very long in the cheese since enzymes in the cheese will break them down. The power of the fungus is to create a layer of living cells that are highly bacteria resistant while not producing stuff that's toxic to you as a human.</p>
<p>Note however that ancient medicine used mold grown on bread to make antibacterial bandages. With these bandages it would be harder for bacteria to start growing on the bandage (or whatever is leaking from the wound) so it reduce the chance of infection (or lessen the severity of the infection).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stuff is kind of awesome really.  Have you ever noticed that shredded cheese like sharp cheddar will last a long time unless you touch it?  Our fingers seem to introduce the type of bad stuff that likes to grow on cheese.</p>
<p>That is my experience anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No as they are different molds for a start.  Just because something is of the penicillium genus doesn't mean it has antibacterial properties.</p>
<p>Its the same reason people who have deathly allergies to penicillin can eat brie and not die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No proper cheese  is made by raising the heat to a point that kills bacteria. </p>
<p>Cheddars, brie, camembert etc are all made between 32c &amp; 36c.  Some have a slight cooking of the curd process and the only ones that get slightly hot are mozzarella and haloumi.  And neither of those get to 100c.  Mozzarella is the hottest at \~60c.</p>
<p>Also mold ripened cheeses, such as brie, do not have the mold introduced to keep the cheesey center right, they are what make the cheese center what they are.  The white mold is what turns otherwise solid curd into the runny creamy awesomeness that is Brie.</p>
<p>Finally penicillium genus covers over 300 different types of mold and some of them produce mycotoxins which kill humans.  It wasn't picked to be a cheese mold because of it's antibacterial properties, it is generally accepted that it was a fluke as Penicillium Candidum tends to grow on sour dough bread and an accidental cross contamination occurred \~300ish years ago in France.  A person ate the contaminated cheese and said &quot;damn that's good!!!&quot;.  It's been used in cheese production for several hundred years prior to the medicinal uses of penicillin were discovered.</p></div>		</li>
