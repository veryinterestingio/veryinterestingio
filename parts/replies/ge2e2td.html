<p>The link should be in the article.</p>
<p>If you can't cure the debt effectively, you can't bank it for later either.</p>
<p>I'd have to dig for studies that support the idea because sleep medicine is so uncertain, but my understanding is that you sleep during the time your circadian rhythm wants you to sleep, for the full duration.  There are no tricks or techniques you can use to make up for sleep and too much or too little appears to be poor for your health long term.  (On top of that, some people are longer or shorter sleepers or have totally erratic rhythms which really complicates things and doesn't seem to be handled very well.  Probably related to so many people with a type of &quot;insomnia&quot;.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a big assumption that just because you can’t pay the debt doesn’t mean you can’t bank it. Drawing too heavily on the money metaphor is probably creating that bias. There are plenty of ways that could happen...more sleep on the outset could slow the process of tiring for example. It doesn’t have to work in reverse. Body’s are not machines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What would be the mechanism for this?</p>
<p>From the first paper, this seems most likely and has the most evidence for it: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet, the simplest scenario that needs to be considered is that sleep extension merely reduces the initial levels of sleep pressure at the beginning of sleep deprivation, resulting in subjects spending longer time in a “comfort zone” of reduced sleep pressure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you're not really &quot;banking sleep credits&quot; you are just delaying the clock that counts how much sleep you need. </p>
<p>Sleep is for healing, memory consolidation, and other processes. How can you bank healing and memories if the wounds and short-term memories have not even been formed yet?</p>
<p>I am a neuroscience researcher and would love to be proved wrong, but I highly highly doubt that you can bank memory consolidation processes that only occur during slow wave sleep -  before you even have new experiences to consolidate to long term memory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you're saying makes a lot of sense, but what if we're already in sleep debt so we all need to sleep more anyways and that's the mechanism for sleep credit (i.e., you're actually settling old sleep debt) ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very fair point and definitely partially true - but actually you can only pay off some sleep debt. Recent sleep debt is easier to pay off than sleep debt accrued over months or weeks - and it may be impossible to fully pay off sleep debt that has been accrued over years. </p>
<p>At some point the sleep debt becomes brain damage and at some later point too much brain damage cannot be repaired. </p>
<p><strong>As u/whatthefat once said:</strong>
For very short term sleep deprivations (a few days), the recovery of sleep debt is rapid. For chronic sleep restriction on the timescale of weeks to months, the recovery of sleep debt is much slower. On timescales of months to years or longer, we don't know whether chronic sleep restriction can be repaid or whether it causes more permanent damage that cannot be easily reversed.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Especially considering both of these studies have the control group sleeping only 7 hours of sleep per night. Based on what I know of sleep cycles, that’s a terrible amount of time to be sleeping. Our sleep cycles in periods of 90mins. You’re likely being woken up in the middle of your final REM cycle. Especially considering what a minuscule sample size this was, I’m much more likely to believe the control group is simply not getting enough sleep to begin with. So of course they’ll be the ones suffering when that deprivation gets more severe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radiolab had an episode on sleep where they talked to a sleep researcher about the latest theories, and he said that while the prevailing view was that sleep was like a bank account (just like the person you’re replying to claims), there was now evidence that it’s more like breathing. This is why Guinness Book of Records doesn’t allow people to record “longest without sleep” anymore. The guy who has it, and who set the record in his teens, now has severe insomnia in his old age, which they suspect is related to that episode.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The second article goes on to explore the opposite; they looked at the impact that various regular sleep habits had on periods restricted sleep. They found </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;...that the physiological mechanism(s) underlying chronic sleep debt undergo long-term (days/weeks) accommodative/adaptive changes.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, they are using the framework of <em>chronic</em> sleep debt to understand how it plays a role on shorter periods of sleep restriction. </p>
<p>Healthy sleep habits prior to periods of sleep restriction would be the &quot;banked sleep credits&quot; in this analogy, I think. </p>
<p>Being well slept with a week of good sleep behind you then you're gonna feel better than the person who just slept 5 hours a night for the past week, especially if they were to experience sleep restriction at the same time. I think the same could be said when comparing the quality of sleep between those individuals after a period of sleep restriction.</p>
<p>I do not believe &quot;banking sleep credits,&quot; is effective in communicating this.</p></div>		</li>
