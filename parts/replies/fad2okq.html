			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad went to a chiropractor for a while several years ago. His chiropractor had his son working there too and he was also a chiropractor. The son is about 5 years older than I am. After several sessions my dad started making comments about how there’s the nice young man about my age who is “already a doctor” and just giving me the impression he wished that I was a doctor and comparing me to this other guy. I had to explain to him that a chiropractor is not a “doctor” and if he had a well established business I’d probably be able scale that corporate ladder in no time too.  Thankfully he stopped, but it’s weird that people can go to these places and actually think they are medical professionals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What people also need to realise, this isnt the case for the whole world. In america they might be quacks but in Germany they do very well need training and a license. This can be safe, if done by a professional.</p>
<p>EDIT:Clarification</p>
<p>(exact job description translated from german so take with a grain of salt)</p>
<p>Chiropractician:
The title of a Chiropractician is not protected by law in Germany. Thus every alternative practitioner or doctor can give himself this title, even if he has not undergone extensive training.</p>
<p>Chiropractor:
Chiropractors (Master or Doctor of Chiropractic) have to absolve a full-time medical degree of four to six years (5000 hours).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't mean anything. In Germany we somehow have homeopathy paid by insurance companies as if it were in any way legitimate medicine. Germans tend to think we are reasonable and bullshit like that doesn't happen here. People are just deluded because it doesn't fit their world view that something so irrational could be allowed to happen in Germany with all those sensible laws we have. At least Americans know that the world is full of bullshit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife has chronic neck pain and we finally broke down and went to a chiropractor because our insurance covered it, and we figured, &quot;Why not try all options?&quot; Hoo, boy.</p>
<p>We walk in, and there's a tv playing some chiropractor-specific channel that kept talking about something like &quot;your body's innate wisdom and energy.&quot; Then we got a tour, including a brief history of chiropractic practice, including the story of how the founder popped a janitor's neck and restored his hearing. You know, because of all the auditory nerves and stuff that are in your neck. Next, we were taken to a room where a technician used a machine that measures &quot;tension&quot; and showed my wife a printed map of her back with a lot of red and black spots, qnd showed us before and after maps of her own back. Upon googling the machine she was using, we determined that it doesn't map tension. It was a real medical device, but has nothing to do with back health. </p>
<p>Finally, the chiropractor saw her, put her on a table, and told us that one of her legs was shorter than the other, showing me that her feet hung off the table at different lengths. He then &quot;adjusted&quot; her hips (I use quotes because that's their word, but he really did just move her hips.) and showed me that her legs were now the same length (Remember, we were there for neck pain.)</p>
<p>As we leave, they tried to schedule us a slot at one of their introductory seminars for their new patients. We booked a slot out of fear that we'd be locked in a basement and got the hell out of there. I can't remember a time I've been more skeeved out by a group of people.</p>
<p>EDIT: I didn't think I'd need to explain this, but my wife's legs aren't actually several inches apart in length, nor are her hips misaligned. He just positioned her on the table in such a way that one of her feet was farther down than the other, and had me &quot;observe&quot; her longer leg to build credibility when he &quot;fixed&quot; it 30 seconds later. I'm aware that such conditions exist, and they need much more than 30 seconds and bare hands to fix. I just assumed the rest of the story would've indicated that he was just a scientology-level scam artist.</p></div>		</li>
