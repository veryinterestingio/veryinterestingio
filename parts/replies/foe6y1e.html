			<div class="markdown"><p>Well this is mildly terrifying to read. So... the reason why I asked this question is because I, too, work in a warehouse and my feet are REALLY starting to kill me. I've only been working there for about 6 months. I'm in super good shape, very used to hiking/walking, and own a good pair of shoes. But yet, after a ten hour shift I've starting wincing every time I take a step. My feet always feel much better in the morning, and after a weekend I'm about as good as new BUT it has been scaring me that I'm possibly doing more damage to my feet than I think. The whole point of this question was to see what in my feet it might be that I'm damaging. This comment has got me really freaked out, but the good news it that I have a new job lined up next month so I should be done with that wretched concrete in a few more weeks.</p>
<p>I really hope your feet are completely healed up soon!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry to cause stress! I remember that exact feeling of wondering if I’m doing long term damage to my feet. I wholeheartedly believe that the way most warehouses seem to be run is absolutely terrible for the employees’ feet, and no matter how well you take care of your feet it’s just not healthy to stand on them on such terrible ground for so long. </p>
<p>Best of luck with your new job! Anywhere is better (for your feet, at least) than concrete warehouses, lol.</p></div>		</li>
