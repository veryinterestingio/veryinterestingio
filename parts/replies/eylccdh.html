			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're missing something here. You can get an XPS for $200 more than a Note 10. That's with an 8th gen I7. That laptop should be relevant and snappy for the next ~5 years. </p>
<p>If you want, you can get the newest version of the XPS laptop for exactly the same price as a Note 10. It has 4gb of memory and an i3. </p>
<p>There are a few reasons cell phones are more expensive: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They're smaller which requires more engineering and a more difficult manufacturing process. </p>
</li>
<li>Demand is high enough. People are willing to spend that kind of money on it. This is aided by cell phone contracts giving consumers &quot;discounts&quot; on phones.</li>
</ol>
<p>Gaming laptops can't really be compared to smartphones because they are a hyper-niche market.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You touched on a few important points here I didn't mention in my original post. Mainly, that the laptop and desktop markets have been waning for years while smartphone markets have been exploding (albeit leveling out recently). As a result, there's way more demand for new smartphones as opposed to new laptops, which means consumers are willing to spend more for a smartphone than they are for a laptop due to both generic supply and demand, and due to changing ways in which people use computing devices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's just demand though. As noted, cell phones require &quot;cutting edge&quot; engineering to maximize processing power, battery life, features, and disk space in a tiny space that has to be light, not have heat issues, have reasonable durability given how they are handled, and also put out a very high resolution for the screen size.</p>
<p>That means there is a huge cost for R&amp;D and innovation. Modern smartphones have been around for a bit more than a decade.</p>
<p>Laptops have been reasonably accessible since the 1980s, and widely accessible since the 1990s. they have been fairly well optimized by now and while there is SOME market for them being smaller and faster and lighter, the average laptop does not have the same engineering constraints that a phone does. The incremental R&amp;D costs are smaller.</p>
<p>Also, the smartphone market is mainly dominated by a small number of major players who are constantly in an arms race to get more market share. Apple is still about 40% of the market in the US and Samsung about 30%. There are a few other players internationally, but it's a small group. The arms race is not so heated in Laptops, particularly given that even among one brand, there are usually a plethora of laptops available to suit all needs and they are customizable.</p>
<p>As opposed to whether you want the premium or entry level iPhone, and then pick a colour and disk space, from most laptop manufacturers, there may be 6 different levels of model, where you can then customize 20 different features. So they don't have to out-tech each other in the same way, again saving costs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Smartphones have the added expectation of extreme portability. While you can get away with making a laptop an inch thicker and a couple pounds heavier with shitty battery life to get more performance out of it especially for power users that typically are gaming/doing high demand professional tasks while stationary, nobody wants to pay $3000 for a smartphone that's 1/2&quot; thick that lasts 4 hours to a charge just because it's 20% faster. Plus, laptops have the benefit of running applications designed for desktops as well - There's no demand for say, a phone awesome enough to run Final Cut Pro.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you gave me a customer base willing to spend $3000 on a 1/2&quot; thick phone with crappy battery and the resources of a huge cooperation to R&amp;D it, it wouldn't be 20% faster, it would be an Android/Windows 10 dual-booting Intel i7 with an NVidia Max-Q GPU and thunderbolt 3 docking capability and multiple i/o, and an additional laptop shell accessory to get a keyboard, mouse, and monitor with extra battery, and it would be my dream all in one machine. </p>
<p>$3,000 can go a LONG way for a single device if sold at large scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A decent part of that is increased display resolution in recent years. People don't want a 1920x1080 display on a $1500+ laptop. Which means that you need a better graphics card to be able to do the same things at say, 2880 x 1800 than you would at 1920x1080 - That's 2.5x the pixels. Even for say, a 15&quot; display. So instead of being able to get x performance at a mobile graphics card a couple steps down from top of the line, you're paying for a better display PLUS a top of the line graphics card (or a step down) just for the same performance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The funniest part is 1920x1080 is fine for 13/15&quot; laptops. Who gives a shit about 2.5/4k on a tiny display? Dumb dumbs who think buzzwords and higher numbers = better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>most intel chips would support even native 4k resolutions with no problems. intel hd graphics 4000 was able to support it back in 2012. Most Laptops, notebooks or any other mobile device won't have a dedicated Graphic chip installed due to the high energy consumtion and heat production. almost every CPU have graphic chips included to get the basic tasks incl. movies worked.</p></div>		</li>
