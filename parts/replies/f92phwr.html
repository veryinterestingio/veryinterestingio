			<div class="markdown"><p>Computer simulations. We run thousands of models with very slightly different initial conditions until we get a final state similar to what we see now.</p>
<p>Giants migrating inward are pretty common (see hot jovians) because of how they interact with the disk gas/dust. Migrating outward requires a large mass outward from that position, which is less common (but not necessarily rare).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Outward migration does not require a large mass further out. It just requires momentum transfer to be from one body to the body that is migrating outwards. This does not depend on where the body losing momentum is (it can even be the host star technically).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Could you clarify this? The way angular momentum is transported through the disk is quite unrelated to what material is accreted by giant planets; it actually sounds quite wrong from your rough summary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The solar wind is primarily a magnetic phenomenon. Charged particles aren't pushed, per se, as much as they are moved along magnetic field lines. My choice of terminology was focused on a general audience.</p>
<p>Protons and alpha particles are the most common charged particles to take part in the transfer of angular momentum outward from the source star.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be blunt about this, I think your explanation is just not very good. This description of particles collecting first on Jupiter, for one: I mean, any planetary core with sufficient mass will start accreting gas from the disk around it, and observationally we know they can do this quite some time before the disk is dissipated. There is no reason to have Jupiter form first (although it might well have).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this have to do with the law of angular momentum at all as well?</p>
<p>And since the Sun is helium, why isnâ€™t the suns helium being pushed away? Is the solar wind the helium from the sun?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Sun is mostly <em>hydrogen</em>, as is the solar wind.</p>
<p>And it's not pushed away for the same reason our atmosphere isn't - it's bound by the Sun's gravity. Only a very, very, <em>very</em> small amount (proportionally) of solar material actually gains enough energy to escape the Sun's gravity to create the solar wind.</p></div>		</li>
