			<div class="markdown"><p>While you may never hold a full conversation with either of them, cats also can learn a limited amount of words. Words my cats find important are: &quot;Crunchies&quot; Their Meow Mix dry cat food. &quot;Kitten Cat Food&quot; complex, but they know it's time for their canned cat food. And the winner of all words that they understand: &quot;TREATS!!!&quot; I say that word, they'll come out of hiding if they're on the block. Since they're indoor types, though, they'll come running when they hear it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There’s a documentary called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Know_That_Voice" target="_blank">I Know That Voice</a>” which was made by the guy that voices Bender from Futurama (and many other voices, John DiMaggio)</p>
<p>If you’re interested in voice actors and impressions, this is worth a watch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not that guy, but I do impressions myself for fun.  I can say that I enjoy doing animated character impressions more than people because they're more, well, animated.  I can do some celebrities, like Patrick Warburton and Johnny Cash, buy when you do an animated voice, people pick it up faster and are more likely to ask you to do it again.   I think it's because they're animated, so people don't tie it so closely to the look of the person.</p>
<p>I also want to say, regarding a gravelly voice, I would say avoid using spit, as it can be difficult to maintain.  Instead, mess with your glottus and your breathing.  It'll be more raspy than gravelly at first, but you'll be able to switch to it faster and maintain it regardless of what you ate or drank recently. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a way, animated voices themselves are impressions. A voice actor is deliberately changing the way they speak in order to create an artificially constructed voice. It makes sense that you'd be able to imitate an animated character's voice because you and the original VA are both doing an &quot;impression&quot; distinct from your normal voice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(to start, I'm not the guy you responded to, but I LOVE impressions and accents)</p>
<p>When it comes to impressions/characters/accents/different voices in general, it's honestly just a weird combination of things that get you into it. For me, I've just always been fascinated with how people spoke, and I ended up taking a number of courses on &quot;Diction for Classical Singers&quot; when I was in college and studying to be a classical singer, which I am not (well, not professionally). The main thing I picked up from those classes was that I could sound like I spoke a language if I was able to pronounce everything correctly. Plus, if I could link phrases, I'd <em>really</em> sound legit.</p>
<p>So that's what I did! But like, for everything!</p>
<p>Turns out what I was doing was basically just creating characters for every voice I ever came up with or wanted to copy. I hear Alan Tudyk as King Candy (and basically a more expressive Ed Wynn as the Mad Hatter, which he has credited his impression to), and I think &quot;man, wouldn't it be great to not just say quotes but be able to just internalize that character and speak as King Candy?&quot; Side note - yeah, it's pretty great.</p>
<p>Developing an impression or an accent or a speech affect that you can truly use is much more like examining a TON of speech from any one person and then trying to picture yourself <em>becoming</em> that person on a small scale, or at least becoming your own version of that person. A few years ago I could do a KILLER Mark Wahlberg, but only because I listened to a ton of his appearances and then a ton of imitators <em>trying</em> to replicate his accent (normally he's a little vanilla, but sometimes his Boston comes out, so you have to strike that balance)...so my personal &quot;Mark Wahlberg&quot; was an amalgamation of probably 15 different Wahlbergs, only 1 of which was the actual person I was trying to imitate. The part that made it a MW imitation was that I would only use it when I was talking about myself as MW and referencing movies or shows or musical groups I had been in. </p>
<p>Impersonation is also weird because you have to recognize your voice's limitations - not everyone can do a super deep voice, and not everyone can do a very high pitched voice - there are elements that are just really difficult to recreate no matter what voice you're listening to. That being said, you can go very far just imitating cadence and overall speech patterns. </p></div>		</li>
