			<div class="markdown"><p>That is pretty helpful answer. Brings another question: at my work I have a key that opens door to my office and about 10 other doors to labs we use BUT doent open any other office doors. Everyone has similar key which opens ONLY their office but ALL lab doors. How does this kind of key work?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The locks in a lot of commercial buildings have multiple shear lines, so more than one key can open them. The most common use is a &quot;master&quot; key, where every door in the building shares one bitting, used by maintenance staff and other people who need full access. But that key isn't widely distributed for obvious reasons - instead, each door has its own unique second bitting for the keys issued to most people. The pins line up in one way for maintenance, and in a different way for others.</p>
<p>Your example is less common, and I think a little trickier to set up. If the labs aren't super high-security they might simply omit certain pins from the locks on those doors. All the keys would be identical on the first 3 positions, for instance, which would be the only pins present in the shared lab doors. And then the remaining positions on the key would be used to differentiate the office doors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you compared your key to someone else's key, they'd probably be mostly similar with one small feature different. That small feature corresponds to a pin in your office's lock that's different than the pins in the other offices' locks. The labs, on the other hand, don't have that pin at all, it's just an empty chamber.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. You should be able to compare all of the keys and deduce a master key which works on all of the locks. There's a DEFCON presentation on YouTube which covers this pretty well. Obviously don't do this unless you want to get fired and/or have access to all the areas of the building.</p>
<p>I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVPSaKLKHd4" target="_blank">this</a> is the video.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can have different shear lines in a pin. So in a lock with two pins, there might be two shear lines on the first pin at height 1 and 2 and on the second pin the shear lines are at height 3 and 4.</p>
<p>Your office door has the first pin at height 1 and the second at height 3, so your key would be height 1 and 3 and can open both doors.</p>
<p>Your colleague's office door has the shear lines at height 2 and 4, so your key can't open the lock. Their key with the heights 2 and 4 can open the first door and their own, but not the door to your office.</p>
<p>It can get quite complicated to figure out where exactly to put the shear lines so everyone has just one key but can open every door they need without it being a high security risk though.</p></div>		</li>
