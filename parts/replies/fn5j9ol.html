			<div class="markdown"><p>Rum was mixed with water to make it less alcoholic - similar levels to the low alcohol beer they had - this is called &quot;grog.&quot;</p>
<p>Whether they had rum/grog or beer was mostly based on where they were sailing and what local supplies were available. Northern Europe like the UK was beer, since it used grain which is grown there. Rum requires sugar so was obtained from more tropical areas where sugar beets / sugar cane grows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact - the British Royal Navy stopped the rum ration in <strong>1970</strong>.  Each day a sailor would receive 71ml (about 3 shots) worth of rum diluted with another 2 parts water for a total of 213ml (3/8th an  imperial pint, or half an American pint - 4 fl oz) worth a f grog.  Officers would receive their ration neat (no added water).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats one.  The other reason is sailors would receive their entire pay for the journey upon goinf ashore, so you get a cooped up working man with basically no expenses walking into town with 30 days pay in cash.  You can probably guess where hes headed</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're going to get a lot of offhand answers, because Reddit really loves finding the &quot;real&quot; reason behind things, but no, probably not. Hard liquor is not a good source of hydration and they drank WAY more of it than had any practical purpose.</p>
<p>There were various rum rations offered at various times, and the trend was towards weaning the Navy off its most heavy inebriation, but at its greatest excess, the RN gave sailors an undiluted ration in one lump sum that would've been roughly equivalent to like eight modern shots or more. The beer was weaker, but imperial rum was STRONGER than the average modern well liquor. As best as I've ever been able to determine, they just got shitty wasted all the time because it was a horrible job and that was the only perk.</p></div>		</li>
