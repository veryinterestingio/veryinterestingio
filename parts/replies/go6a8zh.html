			<div class="markdown"><p>Less of a problem with something like pizza, because it's a pretty low amount of thermal mass.  (Think how easy it is to heat back up).  Contrast like a quart of water (soup), which has a ton of thermal mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pizza also has much higher surface area to volume ratio, making it cool faster. Unless they're putting it straight from the oven into the fridge, by the time it can be considered leftovers it's likely warm at best.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was in school my mom stayed up really late making a ton of soup, and since it was late she just put the whole pot in the fridge while it was still hot. I woke up the next morning and grabbed some milk for cereal and boy was I in for a surprise. Warm milk...mmm</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When we were kids we were going camping and my dad being a cheapskate didnt want to pay for ice for the cooler so he put two 9x13 baking pans full of cold tap water in the freezer. The next morning they had barely frozen but everything else in the freezer had thawed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it’s a pot of soup, I’d rather boil it with the lid on, let it cool without taking off the lid, and then putting it in the fridge. This will mostly sterilize it of many non-heat resistant spore-forming bacteria. Putting it into smaller containers will increase chances of cross contamination, leading to faster spoilage.</p></div>		</li>
