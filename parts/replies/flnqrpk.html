			<div class="markdown"><p>The first point is very, very important. If your image of a billionaire is someone swimming in a pool of cash in their backyard, you really have to correct it. Virtually all of their wealth is in equity, &quot;things&quot; they own. During a recession or a market correction, a lot of those things end up worth very little.</p>
<p>Worse, we all expect them to go back up in value eventually, so if the billionaire (who may not be a billionaire anymore because of the market tanking) goes and sell everything, when the market comes back up, they'll be much worse off.</p>
<p>Also always worth repeating: even when the market is going well, these billionaires can't really materialize all these billions. If Jeff Bezos went and sold 95% of his Amazon shares in an afternoon, Amazon's value would plummet, and the shares would be worth very little long before he's done selling even half of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, its not only the selling of the shares that can directly decrease value, but Owner and Management trades like this are publicly announced ahead of time, how many shares, what price etc. </p>
<p>An owner planning to sell shares tends to give investors the idea that the stock is about to go down due to poor business performance and the owner is trying to save some loss on stock value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also companies don't sit on money like you or O do. We may keep up months of cash in case something happens but a corporation does not really have that as a line item in the budget.</p>
<p>The relentless demand for growth demands that almost every dollar be leveraged to make more money. If cash is sitting around growth isn't happening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true. Apple has so much income they can't reinvest all of it so it sits on a hoard of gold like a dragon.</p>
<p>Not great, but not terrible.</p>
<p>edit: they also can't pay it out to shareholders because then it would have to be taxed and they don't want that in case the money can be reinvested without taxing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Companies like Microsoft or Apple have cash reserves because they don't immediately have somewhere good to put it.</p>
<p>Why did Microsoft spend <em>$2.5 billion</em> dollars on Minecraft? Because their expected return on that $2.5B is better with Minecraft than it is sitting as cash. Their cash reserves are over 100 billion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cash typically depreciates in value over time, so investing that cash maintains the value.</p>
<p>Still, smart companies maintain a healthy cash reserve. Most companies aren't smart companies. So, you have companies that live quarter to quarter, but any economic upset knocks them over.</p>
<p>From what I've seen from the many companies I've worked for, about 1 in 10 CEOs actually know what they're doing. 3 of the remaining 9 are at least smarty enough to keep things going. 6 in 10 are there because they're good at networking, bullshit and have family or political connections, but you wouldn't trust them to keep your dog alive while you were on vacation by themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Holding cash is a cost to a business. All business assets are covered by liabilities or equity. Liabilities require interest payments. Equity expects returns. Holding more cash means you're paying more interest or needing to generate larger returns to satisfy the equity stake.</p>
<p>For a publicly traded company it is extremely rare to have enough ownership interest willing to reduce risk appetite and forego returns by holding more cash. If they wanted safer investments they wouldn't be taking equity stakes in public companies.</p></div>		</li>
