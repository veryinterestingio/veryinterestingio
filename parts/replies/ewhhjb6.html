<p>Whereas, a butterfly, for example is more random...”hmmm this lantana looks nice, oh wait look at that penta!” </p>

<p>Do you have a source on this difference? It would be interesting for my own work...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be quite honest, I work at a butterfly conservatory and have informally visually studied this myself for the past 5 years. I see the bees and how they stay in the same group of flowers but butterflies seem to, for lack of better words, flutter about more from different flowers. Remember, female butterflies are on a mission to find their larval host plant. They are designed to localize a specific plant to lay their eggs on. So they will visit different flowers and plants until they find that host. So naturally, visiting different plants is more typical for a butterfly as they are not only sipping nectar but also seeking their host plant.</p>
<p>There is also a documentary on Netflix, Wings of Life that goes into this as well. I believe, it’s the same documentary that discusses the Tiger Swallowtail picking up pollen on her wings. I’ve read so many books I don’t remember exactly where I get specific bits of information, I have a bunch on my shelves I can recommend some good Butterfly literature if you’d like?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm a botanist, with a background in entomology, but I know nothing about lepidopterology(?) more flies, beetles and the like. Anyway, my new job has a side project that falls under botany broadly that deals with butterflies because of their close association with specific plant species is all. I think it's more because we have a couple of outside lepidoptera experts that we can lean on rather because it makes sense that we focus on butterflies specifically...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I too work with butterflies everyday. There’s actually mounting evidence that butterflies have innate flower color preference that is likely related to the color of their mates, so it isn’t quite as random as you make it out to be.</p></div>		</li>
