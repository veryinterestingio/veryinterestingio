<p>I wish I had the source, but research has shown that kids can learn to love foods they hate or have aversions to simply by them being on the table at many meals.  When my oldest was small, she went through this phase where she hated so many things.  Someone recommended this program to me based out of the UK, it was sort of a sticker-type thing, where my kid would list the foods she didn’t like, and then we put a sticker each time she just TRIED it (but she didn’t have to).  The research showed that in a low pressure environment, kids would gradually get used to smell, texture and taste after 10 times of just tasting it.  The experiment worked - if she hated cheese, by the tenth time, she would say while she didn’t prefer it, it wasn’t worth rejecting a whole meal just because cheese was in it.</p>
<p>Kids can model just what is in their surroundings in a low pressure way.  I can now say, my kid is 16, and there’s nothing from FOOD anymore that she won’t EAT; simply because we refused to stop making meals or severely modifying meals just because she didn’t like this or that.  Either she ate it, picked around it (ie if she didn’t like mushrooms) or she had toast instead.</p>
<p>More valuable to me from the entire process is that she really trusts me. When we are travelling and go to a restaurant, she will ask me to pick something out and say “what would I like?” (say if it’s a ethnic restaurant where she doesn’t know the names of things) because she trusts I will pick the item that has the most things that she likes.   It’s really been a give and take process, she tries things and I don’t force.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was force fed a boiled egg as a child and even as an adult 30 years later the smell of egg (boiled, scrambled, sunny-side-up) still makes me gag. I‘m fine with egg being an ingredient (like in pancakes) but if it’s overbearing the meal I literally can't eat it without feeling sick shortly after. </p>
<p>Wish my parents would’ve used your system of gradually introducing new foods to me without pressure. I got better over the years, I had an immense dislike for bell peppers, cheese, tomatoes and a lot of other stuff I eventually overcame by my own volition, but there are still a lot of things I would never cook or prepare on my own simply because I have a bad association with them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. My mom was a big believer in veggies and we ate mostly field peas, squash, Brussel sprouts, cabbage, broccoli and I never understood why others kids hated them. I grew up loving it and still do. But we didn't have a choice in the matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hated a lot of veggies growing up because my mom boiled the ever-loving shit out of them. As an adult, I was introduced to the world of roasting and sautéing veggies, and now I love a lot of stuff I used to hate. </p>
<p>And some stuff I just can’t explain. As a kid, I loved any combination of pasta and tomato sauce and cheese—ravioli, spaghetti, everything except lasagna. I had a burning hatred of lasagna and I still have no idea why. Now I love it. But kid me detested it.</p></div>		</li>
