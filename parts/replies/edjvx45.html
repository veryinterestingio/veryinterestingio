<p>(though there is a group of scientists in Florida who will disagree and present the comb jelly as their case, but that's a different discussion)</p>

<p>I would like to know more. Happen to know any reviews on this?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Briefly, if you construct a phylogeny of certain major animal phyla using whole genome sequences, comb jellies are a sister to all other animal phyla. This presents a problem with respect to neuronal and muscle cell types that has two obvious solutions. Either A) The last common ancestor of all animals had neurons and muscles, but cell types were lost in some lineages; or B) comb jellies evolved these cell types independently. This method of placing comb jellies into the phylogenetic tree is disputed.</p>
<p>No review jumped out at me, but here's a paper that shows how to get two completely different placements of these guys: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790313000298" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790313000298</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>EDIT: dman above gives a good account, I'd like to add to it with a 2017 paper:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982217314537" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982217314537" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982217314537</a></a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The paper itself gets into the weeds on which evolutionary models are used for the genome analysis but there's a good video that gives the low down. It's from the sponge-sister group at Bristol (they've got the more convincing evidence from my perspective).</p>
<p>EDIT2: This paper, also from 2017, might be the killing blow to the comb-jelly-first theory: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982217301999" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982217301999" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982217301999</a></a></p></div>		</li>
