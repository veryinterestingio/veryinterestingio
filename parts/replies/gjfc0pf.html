			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. Most solid state memory (like RAM or SSDs) is made by slapping together 4, 8, or 16 chips that actually store things together with 1 chip (the memory controller) that manages all the others. Sometimes companies will leave out some of the storage chips to make a cheaper version of a product without having to do much engineering. In SSDs, companies usually add a couple faster memory chips in order to make the drive more responsive. You'll occasionally see other numbers of storage chips, but making it a nice round number (1,2,4,8,16...) makes the engineering simpler.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is it. You sometimes see RAM or SSDs with unpopulated footprints for additional chips. They are only populated on the maximum capacity model.</p>
<p>In HDDs the lower capacity models are often made with fewer platters.</p></div>		</li>
