			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a common distribution method, but not quite the same. You could make a &quot;portable app&quot; (no installation required) that self update and download extra stuff as well.</p>
<p>Another common reason for a big installation process is that that application require a lot of 3. party software packages and since it can't be sure those are already installed it will re-install it all just in case (.NET DirectX, Microsoft C++ libraries etc. etc.). At least this was the norm in the CD-rom era, and some of it still linger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, I miss portable apps. At my last job I carried around a USB drive with a portable version of firefox, a password manager, and I think a couple of games on it so that I could use firefox at work (they only had IE at the time), have all my bookmarks no matter which computer I used, etc.</p>
<p>Then I joined the military and now I can't plug a USB drive into anything.</p></div>		</li>
