<p>I think you mean to hide the rotten taste as food begins to spoil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>watch the video. phytochemicals kill bacteria that spoil food. less bacteria, the slower is spoils.It would make no sense to mask the taste of rotten food, if you're going to get sick and die anyways... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are underestimating the human immune system. We can eat things much more tainted then we do and the reason spices were so expensive is because they were so rare. Not only are they rare but they are added at cooking time after any spoiling (simple organic break down as much as anything else).</p>
<p>While plants certainly can have chemical defences against microbes they tend to be specific for what ails plants, and we are not plants. We have our own defences for what ails us.</p>
<p>Also it's trivial to find examples of salting or smoking of meats, have you ever heard of spicing rooms or similar to preserve any type of food before it begins to spoil? What about a process like pickling which likewise preserves food?</p>
<p>Even if herbs were inert (and don't get me wrong, I think they have wonderful properties - don't burn the witch with her poultices) does anybody even bother to dry foods by coating them such as the drying effect of flour on chicken? Doesn't happen.</p>
<p>TLDR; Any antimicrobial properties are incidental.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's an untold variety of spices and some no doubt that chemical defences against pests. More likely carriers of the diseases such as flies rather than the microbes themselves.</p>
<p>The most common food preservative was salt which dries (cures) the meat but unlike pepper, it's not actually a spice.</p></div>		</li>
