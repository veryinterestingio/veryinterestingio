			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a preganancy that was referred to as a “partial molar” pregnancy — possible 1 egg + 2 spent. My baby lived until 10 weeks gestation and then died. It had 69 chromosomes - so likely scenario is that 2 sperm penetrated the egg at the exact same moment (or a sperm/ovum had double the chromosomes). The fetus looked 100% normal but would not have survived. There are instances where a few babies have made it to term but did not live long after birth. On a different note: It is possible to have a “molar” pregnancy that is where an egg and sperm unite BUT one has zero chromosomes. So you end up with out of control tumor-like cells with 23 chromosomes instead of 46 that multiply rapidly. The woman will appear to be pregnant and tests will come back as if she is, but with an ultrasound it will be determined that there is not a fetus. In the case of a full molar pregnancy, women actually have to go through a round of chemotherpy. If they do not, the cells (basically, cancer) will metastasize rapidly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my genetics class we learned about triploidy and tetraploidy, which can produce a fetus that is born alive but does not live long. Pictures and everything. I was shocked because much simpler chromosomal abnormalities are usually quickly nonviable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An incomplete mole.  69 chromosomes; can grow fetal parts (which is disturbing) but not a fetus, and requires a D&amp;C with a bit of an increased cancer risk to the woman.</p>
<p>Fertilizing an empty ovum gets you a complete mole.  Does not grow pieces but looks like a giant cluster of grapes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can also lead to a partial molar pregnancy. Does not lead to twins as someone else stated.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. This is when there are fraternal twins: 2 eggs fertilized by 2 sperm (could be from different males even) that then COMBINE shortly after fertilization. You have a normal baby that grows normally but has 2 different sets of DNA inside of them. Half of their body parts will have 1 set of DNA and the other half will have another set of DNA. They usually discover that this has happened when an adult gets a DNA test for their child and it comes back that it isn’t their child but their TWIN’s child ... a twin living inside them ;) </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cells keep calcium stored in the Endoplasmic reticulum mostly, there is also some in the mitochondria. When it’s released into the cytoplasm it can activate all kinds of calcium-dependent processes like the ovum situation or muscle contraction.</p>
