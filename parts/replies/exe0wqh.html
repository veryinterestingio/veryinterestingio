			<div class="markdown"><p>Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) use lactose as fuel, with the end result being a production of ATP and lactic acid. I'm not 100% sure how low the lactose levels drop to but ill see if I can find out for ya, although im fairly sure the levels will be low, as the LAB do a pretty good job of converting to lactic acid. :) but to my knowledge lactic acid should not illicit the same response as lactose in lactose intolerant people. Lactose intolerance is due to the lack of lactase in one's body, but the bacteria in cheese basically do that step for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no it will not, you need either low temp pasteurized or non pasteurized milk. some natural food stores do carry them though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Check that the milk is not ultra-pasteurized and you can actually get a very respectable end product from it  :) i have tried a few dozen times with grocery store milk (although i usually get raw milk from a local dairy) and the cheeses are quite good from stoe bought milk. As long as its not ultra pasteurized, the proteins will be denatured at that point. Also, if using raw milk, USDA recommends aging cheese for at least 60 days. And i totally follow that guideline to the day............ but really botulism is no joke, so age raw milk cheeses 60 days. :) if you have any questions, pm me and i can guide you in the right direction. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>could you clarify what others are saying here where 'sharpness' doesn't necessarily correlate with 'maturity'? - that you can have a young sharp cheese as well as a less sharp more aged variety?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah! So sharpness is sometimes referred to as the &quot;bite&quot; of the cheese. A sharp cheese usually has complexity and a tang or sour flavour, but not in an unpleasant way. However, that is not necessarily a mark of maturity. Some extremely mature cheeses are very mellow and nutty. This is mainly due to short chain fatty acid (SCFA) composition. A young &quot;sharp&quot; cheese has a lot of acidic compounds, think lemon/sour milk. While a very mature, mellow cheese has had the time for bacteria to break down those SCFA's into other less acidic compounds. :) now, you can also have a mature, sharp cheese that has retained those SCFA's and also has a well developed flavor. I hope that answers your question!</p></div>		</li>
