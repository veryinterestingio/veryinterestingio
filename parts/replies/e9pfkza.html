<p>Great question! Unfortunately that gets a <em>lot</em> more complicated. The answer I linked at the top of mine has a very good explanation of the nuclear chemistry involved, where the energy is stored and how it is released.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>It isn't actually released going in both directions. It's like a pendulum: it's only giving off energy as it moves <em>towards</em> the midpoint (iron). If you take a pendulum which is already at the midpoint and push it away – in either direction! – you have to put energy <em>in</em> to the system. So when heavier-than-iron elements are produced, either in a lab on Earth or in a star, it requires an enormous amount of energy, much of which is stored in the nucleus in the form of weak force potential. That potential energy can be released all at once, like in an atomic bomb, or more slowly, like in a nuclear reactor.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you go &quot;backwards&quot; away from iron towards lighter elements, you're still performing fission, but you need to apply an enormous amount of energy to the system (think: many many many nuclear bombs) just to get even a single step down the ladder towards hydrogen. You could, in theory, eventually get there, but there's no natural process which would achieve this. Also I'm not sure why you would want to.</p>
<p>It's only when you move <em>towards</em> iron – either via fusion of lighter elements, or fission of heavier ones – that you get a net release of energy.</p>

<p>Only if you move away from iron! One theory of the death of the universe, in the brief span of time when nuclear chemistry was well understood but before the expansion of the universe was discovered, was that everything would eventually fuse or decay down to iron, where you cannot gain any energy at all from either fission or fusion. Of course, now we know that spacetime itself is expanding too rapidly for this to ever happen, but it's a fun thing to think about if the philosophical end of the universe is your thing.</p>
<p>Iron is literally the very bottom of the valley between two hills, one of which (fusion) is much much taller than the other (fission).</p>
<p>As to where this energy comes from… That's sort of a more philosophical question, but the glib answer is &quot;the universe&quot;. The slightly less glib answer is that the Big Bang was a bit like a giant battery charger: it blew off an incomprehensible quantity of particulate matter that coalesced into hydrogen, which from a nuclear standpoint is the element with the highest energy potential. We (uh, mostly stars) have been progressively releasing that energy in the 13.3 billion years since, and there's still a <em>lot</em> of atomic energy left to release!</p>
<p>When the US detonated the first fission bomb in New Mexico, they were releasing energy which had been stored in the form of a (much) heavier-than-iron element (mostly uranium) by an exploding star of eons past. When that same military detonated the first fusion bomb just a few years later at Enewetak Atol, they were releasing energy which had been stored in the form of a (much) lighter-than-iron element (hydrogen) <em>by the Big Bang</em>. Cutting out the middle man, as it were.</p>
<p>It would be kind of cool if it weren't so horrifying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The energy isn't released as pure light and there is loss if you went back and forth, for example the release of alpha particles which are just really freaking energetic helium atoms. If you were to capture all the energy released and all the particles released you could theoretically jam them back together into the original atom, but you'd have nothing left. For example, if uranium breaks down into barium and krypton then you could slam them back together through fusion, but you'd gain no energy.</p>
<p>TLDR: Just like regular physics, everything released can be used to place things back as they were. Energy cannot be created or destroyed.</p></div>		</li>
