			<div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: Mixing water and salt minimizes energy, so the system tries to do that.  Everything in general moves towards having less free energy.</p>
<p>Not ELI5: It changes the chemical potential; the solute flows to minimize chemical potential.  So the water is observed to move towards locations with higher salt concentrations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why does it minimize chemical potentials. You would think that there would be a big entropic barrier due to the fact that the water molecules have to order themselves around the salt, the same reason that polar and non polar don’t mix. On this topic I am also confused why water would move to higher sucrose solutions leading to osmotic pressure for the same reasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water will pass through a permeable barrier, like a cell membrane, to balance out the amount of solutes that can't pass through on each side of the barrier. If you add a lot of salt to one side, it will force the water through the membrane to do so. </p>
<p>Essentially, if water is free to pass through the barrier, it takes more energy to go from high salt to low salt and will tend to stay on the high salt side. Once the concentrations are equal, the water will no longer be attracted to one side or the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All living things need salts to perform the processes that give them energy. They all have small amounts of salts in them.</p>
<p>Water likes to be &quot;balanced&quot; aka, if you have two rooms next to each other with a door, and one room is filled with water, the water will flow to the other room when you open the door. Adding salt basically &quot;opens the door&quot; for all the water. The water naturally wants to go to the saltier section to even out the saltiness and preserve balance. Water is a very small molecule so it can squeeze in and out of cells pretty easily.</p>
<p>Not only does the salt take away the water the bacteria the would have otherwise used to move around and eat, but the salt can actually kill some of the bacteria by making it too salty for them to function.</p></div>		</li>
