			<div class="markdown"><p>That light is composed of many different frequencies of light. “White” light isn’t actually a real thing. That’s just our brain’s interpretation of seeing many colors across the visible spectrum. An incandescent bulb shines red photons, blue photons, green, orange, actually a stupidly high number of different precise colors. </p>
<p>Objects respond to different frequencies of light differently. So some will absorb certain frequencies (which heats up the object) and reflect the other ones. It’s a subtractive process.</p>
<p>Shine a white light (composed of all colors) on a surface that absorbs all colors except a specific shade of red, and that object will appear that kind of red when you shine a white light on it. The few photons that are the right color present in the white light get reflected.</p>
<p>But if you shine pure orange on it, it will look black. The frequency of light it reflects isn’t present, so this (fairly unrealistic) object isn’t reflecting anything.</p>
<p>Edit: I wrote a comment about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/mkdcz1/the_influence_of_color_on_heat_absorption/gtfu03k/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf" target="_blank">how we see color</a> the other day, and also linked in that comment is another comment about color stuff</p>
<p>Edit2: my comment is intended to head off any confusion about the “same” white light appearing to reflect as different colors when different objects are placed in the light. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/mm54hr/eli5_what_are_colors_on_an_atomic_level_what/gtrc4au/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf" target="_blank">this comment</a> explains why different frequencies of light (colors) behave differently when encountering different materials — why things are different colors. It’s very science.</p>
<p>But I’ll include my own ELI5 addendum for the last comment I linked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think one thing we can add that will help them understand is that electrons are what light “hits” on a molecule. It’s an excitation of the electromagnetic field, so anything with charge can be hit by light. Since the charge extends throughout space, it doesn’t have to be perfectly aimed at an elusive electron in order to interact with it. When electrons get hit by light, they will react mostly depending on how (or if) that light changes its position within the orbitals. Light of higher frequencies has more energy, and slightly different energy amounts can drastically change what happens to the electron (because physics).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is happening at the atomic level to only reflect certain frequencies. Is there a photon bouncing off of electrons? I don't think that's correct but what about that specific arrangement of sub atomic particles reflects?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Different atoms have different energy levels their electrons can be at, and those levels can vary depending on what kind of molecule they're part of. But they can only be at EXACTLY those levels, and not in between.</p>
<p>When light strikes the electrons on a molecule, the electron attempts to absorb it. If the light has the right energy to send the electron to a higher state, it will. The extra energy becomes heat, but the electron keeps just enough to put it at the next energy level. But things WANT to be at the lowest energy level possible, so eventually, the electron falls back down, meaning it has to get rid of that energy. To do this, it emits light. The difference between those energy states is equal to the energy in the light, which means the light from that drop in energy will always be a particular color.</p>
<p>The red cloth's dye molecules have an energy drop that corresponds with a light wavelength of about 650, while the green cloth has an energy drop that corresponds with a light wavelength of about 540.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good explanation, though I would like to add and slightly correct (to the best of my knowledge, please correct me if I am wrong). Like you said, when a molecule absorbes light (energy) of a certain wavelength some of its electrons are elevated to higher energy levels and the molecule is in an excited state. To return from an excited state to the electronic ground state (starting point), the molecule has to loose or convert the energy it absorbed. It can do so in different ways: increasing vibration frequency of its bonds, increasing speed of rotation around certain axis of symmetry, colliding with other molecules and thereby increase the translational energy of those (which translates to a increase in temperature of the system) or - as you pointed out - emitting light of a different frequency. To my knowledge the first three processes I mentioned are more common than light emission, which depending on the exact process, is called luminescence or phosphorescence.</p>
<p>The color of most objects stems from the fact that they absorb a certain wavelength spectrum shone on them. What we see as color are the wavelengths they reflect, because they don‘t have an energy level difference that corresponds to those wavelengths. Most leaves are green, because they contain chlorophyll, which absorbs the blue part and the red part of the visible spectrum (lamps used for growing are often purple in color). The part of the spectrum that chlorophyll doesn‘t absorb is green, which we see as the color reflected.</p>
<p>Edit: The process of molecules absorbing energy from light and turning it into vibrational, rotational and translational energy is the principle at work in green house gases (see thermodynamic degrees of freedom for gases). The more atoms and bonds a molecule has that it can vibrate or rotate around, the more effective it is in turning the absorbed energy of the light into other forms of energy that result in an increase of temperature: CO2 (3 atoms, 2 bonds) is a worse greenhouse gas than N2 or O2 (2 atoms one bond), but per molecule CO2 two is less effective in warming the atmosphere than methane (CH4, 5 atoms, 4 bonds).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth including that colors can be produced another way too, via film interference, diffraction grating, scattering and photonic crystals, essentially via light scattering caused by micro-structures on the surface of the material.</p>
<p>These are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_coloration" target="_blank">structural colors</a> and making color this way is something that insects and birds take advantage of.</p>
<p>Many bird feathers are actually more of a brownish color, but they use an optical trick to make bright colors.</p>
<p>The Jiyu Sun, et al 2013 paper <em><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255772388_Structural_coloration_in_nature" target="_blank">Structural coloration in nature</a></em> is a good overview of all this.</p></div>		</li>
