			<div class="markdown"><p>Try looking at birds with one eye and then the other. Many otherwise “boring” brown birds are very elaborate in UV. This is because birds can see in UV and a lot of their mating attraction markings are only visible in it</p></div>		</li>

<p>I’m guessing the lens absorbs quite a lot of light at that spectrum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is correct.<br />
The lower limit on what colors most people can see is set by the fact that the lens absorbs very strongly below a wavelength of about 450nm.<br />
The goo inside your eye (vitreous humours) absorbs everything below about 300nm.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are stories floating around that the British in WWII recruited guys that had cataract surgery because they could see UV, which allowed them to spot U-boats using UV signal lights, or to signal each other with similar lamps.<br />
But I've also heard those stories were designed to provide cover for the British code-breaking work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never had anything removed from my eyes, but I can still see the deep purple from UV lights. Maybe my eyes have just never had the right filters or whatever?</p>
<p>I've always mourned that cameras could never take a picture of purple that actually looked purple to me, especially when it's flowers which always have an incredibly vibrant purple that I've never seen a screen reproduce.</p>
<p>Now I'm wondering if it's just that I can see UV light.</p></div>		</li>
