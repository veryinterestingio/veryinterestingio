			<div class="markdown"><p>So in other words, this thing is a real life GIF.<br />
It’s constantly changing, but it’s changing in a fixed pattern that repeats, and if you overlap all of the “frames,“ you get a crystalline pattern.<br />
If this is accurate, this is the best ELI5 I’ve seen for this so far, because I was honestly really confused by most of the explanations, and this is the first one that makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but it wouldn't always be a perfect gif because crystals have impurities and structural changes with environmental factors. The same thing works here, where if the environment changed, they're going to also react.</p>
<p>These time crystals are basically a quantum gas (ytterbium ions or diamonds with a large amount of defects, which are basically super reactive electrons) manipulated by an external source to shift around in these repeating patterns. The whole system works uniformly and repeats in predictable ways, which is what was theorized when time crystals were first proposed.</p>
<p>Yea, it's basically suspended animation gifs with subatomic parts.</p></div>		</li>
