			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad you said this. I was discussing this today with a friend. It just seems so fucking unlikely that THIS is the outcome. That we are able to truly hypothesize what we fundamentally are. That surely is not even remotely the most likely outcome from what we perceive as just chaos and chance</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might like to read up on the so called anthropic principle. It basically states, that only in universes where everything perfectly matches the capability of supporting conscious life, will produce such life which will be able to reflect on itself.
See it like that, it wasn't by a totally unbelievable, unlikely chance that you where born here and now in this seemingly perfect universe to think about that but it had to be &quot;here&quot; because everywhere else it just wouldnt have been possible.
At least thats what answers these types of questions for me. Not everyone likes it and agrees with that though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. May i pick your brains briefly. So in your opinion, do you think that it's plausable we may be part of something bigger. by which i mean, are you open to the possibility that this incredible framework is somehow deliberate? I don't mean it as in do you believe in the bible etc. but more that the constructs of time and space are so intricate, do you ever entertain the possibility that these aren't accidental</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is rather as if you imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, 'This is an interesting world I find myself in — an interesting hole I find myself in — fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!' - Douglas Adams</p>

<p>It's pretty amazing. And it's probably not the most <em>likely</em> outcome for any given planet that forms in the universe, but I am waiting (or rather, hoping) for the day that we discover a world out there that at least has a rudimentary form of life on it. I'm not holding my breath or anything, but it's honestly the number one question I'd want answered that I think <em>can</em> be answered. Casually learning about evolution over the years has given me a feeling that it can happen virtually anywhere. It just needs to be in a place that is a little less...chaotic...than most places in the universe. But planets do this great thing where they form atmospheres, warm things up on their surfaces, and create gravity that collects fluids into various areas, allowing entirely alien worlds to chemically interact in different ways than our own. It's possible our world is one of many that had a handful of conditions randomly fall into place, and the sheer <em>number</em> of other planets out there gives me some semblance of a feeling that it has happened countless other times too.</p>
<p>Or, I could be wrong and there are countless great filters that prevented nearly every one of them from ever happening, or this could be a simulation, or my brain could be in a vat and the real universe is nothing like its been presented to me. Either way, I'm here and it's not half bad. I give the universe 4 out of 5 stars.</p></div>		</li>
