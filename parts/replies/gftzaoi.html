<p>If I want to buy something, I can look at different models to find what is in my ideal price range and then look around at different sellers to find the best deal.</p>
<p>When you have fewer options on what to buy and who to buy it from, you have to start negotiating in the moment if you want to get the best possible deal because comparison shopping isnâ€™t a viable alternative.</p></div>		</li>
