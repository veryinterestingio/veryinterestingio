			<div class="markdown"><p>Your hall of mirrors answer is exactly what OP is asking though since that's how you slow down light. When scientists say that they &quot;slowed&quot; light down to 38mph it doesn't mean the photons are actually moving at 38mph. Light is incapable of traveling at any speed other than light speed. It means the light is bouncing around inside the material so much that when you take the total displacement over total time it ends up being 38pmh.</p></div>		</li>
