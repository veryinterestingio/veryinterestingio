			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you have to be careful in what you understand as 'recognising faces'.  I don't see how this can be separated from recognising any other 3D object.  There are brain processes that can 'rotate' memories of objects in order to recognise them from different angles and perspectives.   In these tests only pictures of faces were used, not as a part of the complete body.  So animals were still only recognising objects (i.e pictures of a face from different angles), not 'faces' as a part of a person.  The animals would probably not know that these images were of people. My hypothesis is that if the real person turned up the animals would not recognise their face.</p></div>		</li>
