			<div class="markdown"><p>Living close to them? No. Standing directly in front of the dish? Depends on the strength of the antenna, but probably yes. The most powerful broadcasting antennas can be like microwaving your entire body up close, and can burn you.</p>
<p>Microwaves aren't ionizing radiation (aka, cancer/radiation poisoning, etc.). They're basically heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve read several accounts from B.A.S.E. Jumpers (those lunatics that jump off of structures with a parachute), that when they climb microwave towers they can definitely feel themselves heating up  uncomfortably while standing near the dishes. But it goes away as soon as they jump, and they keep doing it over and over without any apparent ill effect (from the microwaves, it seems like their adrenaline addiction eventually results in ill effects, but that’s tied more to gravity than electromagnetic radiation).</p></div>		</li>

<p>No... Most of the cellular radiation you get, you get from your phone. And if you live far from a cell tower, your phone needs to increase it's power. Meaning the closer you live to a tower, the less radiation you get.</p>
<p>But if you are going to worry about cellular radiation, you first need to move under ground. There is a star in the sky that literally causes millions of cases of cancer, and kills thousands of people, <em>every single year</em>. If you are not going to hide from that, there is no reason to hide from any technology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even with an infinitely tight focus, wifi would probably not be able to cause real burns to people. This is actually a really common misconception that you can of focus light to an arbitrary degree from a low energy source.
