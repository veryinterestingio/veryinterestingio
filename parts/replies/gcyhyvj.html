			<div class="markdown"><p>In order to prevent frequently written areas in the drive from going bad before less-frequently used areas do, SSDs periodically re-arrange all the data stored throughout the drive.  This is called wear levelling.  The drive firmware stores a value that keeps track of how many wear levelling cycles have been run, which can be read by specialised programs like <a href="https://crystalmark.info/en/software/crystaldiskinfo/" target="_blank">CrystalDiskInfo</a> in order to get an idea of how much time the drive has left before failure.</p>
<p>Personally, I have a 1 year old 1TB SSD on my desktop which Crystal reports has 98% life remaining, with about 2,000 hours of time (cumulative) powered on.</p>
<p>Note that this tool is for PC SSDs only, I'm not familiar with mobile or embedded drives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a small correction -- the Wear Leveling actually happens all the time when you're writing. </p>
<p>In HDDs you usually (well, you prefer to) write linearly.</p>
<p>In SSDs, any write will usually be &quot;wear leveled&quot; across the drive.</p>
<p>That's one of the reason that bigger SSDs are usually faster -- ie: same family drive, the 960GB one will usually be faster than the 480GB one by a small margin, at least, because it distributes the writes across more cells at the same time.</p></div>		</li>
