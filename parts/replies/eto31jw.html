<p>There is a mesh barrier between the lower and upper levels that the queen is too big to fit through, so she can’t lay eggs in them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes.  Many of us keepers don't use queen excluders for a variety of reasons, including premature worker death and slower comb building.  Typically, if you're running a big enough box, the queen won't come up to the honey boxes (supers) anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically when you give bees a frame to build on, there's just a sheet of hexagon pattern cells in the middle (called &quot;foundation&quot;) and the bees use that pattern to fill out the honeycomb themselves.  That foundation can be either plastic or beeswax, but the actual honey comb is produced by the bees.</p>
<p>That said, there IS synthetic comb, but it's not used for honey.  Rather, it's for pest control.</p></div>		</li>
