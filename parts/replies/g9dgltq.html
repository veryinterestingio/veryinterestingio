			<div class="markdown"><p>Heat seekers are 100% passive. They only hunt by tracking your heat emissions, which is why they're so dangerous.</p>
<p>The good news is, infrared radiation doesn't propagate over the horizon like radio frequencies do, so IR missiles are basically limited to short range with a line of sight.</p>
<p>Also, rocket motor exhaust has a very distinct heat signature. The right sensors can pick up that signature and alert the pilot that somebody nearby has shot a missile, and where the signal is coming from.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is where that thing you see in movies comes from where pilots make a radio call while firing missiles. Its to tell their wingmen and others in the area that any launch noted by the missile warning receiver can be attributed to them. Just so happens that it sounds kinda cool.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The defense against IR missiles exist. &quot;ultraviolet signature&quot; leads me to believe it detects the explosive lights coming out from the missile as it is launched.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's correct; UV systems are more common on older systems because you can use much less advanced computers and sensors - pretty much any flash of UV that isn't the sun can be assumed to be a missile launch, although you lose the ability to track the missile after launch.</p>
<p>Newer systems use IR sensors and more complicated image processing to look for heat signatures that exhibit various signs (motion relative to the ground, the type of path taken, the brightness, etc). This allows them to track the missiles, with some newer systems even being able to determine whether a pilot's jet is the target, or if the missile is headed for someone else. Some of these newer systems can even be used to track aircraft and surface vehicles too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Detects the plume. Combination of energy from the combustion of the solid fuel from the missile booster, and the backblast from the launch. Almost all manpads (manportable air defense systems, i.e. shoulder-fired ir seeking missiles) have two phases: an initial booster to get the missile out of the canister, which is hella bright, and then a sustainer, that has a much lower impulse to get the missile on an appropriate path to intercept the aircraft. See the attached video for boost/sustainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/q0nuhI05QyA" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/q0nuhI05QyA</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the target jets don't get a warning the same <strong>instant they are locked</strong>?</p>
<p>They get the warning only when the missile is finally moving in the range of the recieving radar. It could've also been launched several minutes ago, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, the thing is, an RWR can pick up any radar signal. If an enemy fighter is out there and is just using their radar to search, the RWR can still detect that, and the pilot will see hostile radar spikes on his scope. And when a radar &quot;locks&quot; on something, instead of sweeping back and forth, the radar is essentially staring right at it's target continuously bouncing energy off of it. So the pilot can also tell the difference between a radar in search mode, and a radar in &quot;I'm getting ready to fuck you up&quot; mode.</p>
<p>Even better, a bounced radar signal has to travel all the way back to the radar to provide a return. This means an RWR can detect a search radar WELL beyond the effective detection range of that radar.</p>
<p>Edit: so essentially in a modern airspace, turning your radar on is basically putting a giant neon sign up saying &quot;Hello world, here I am!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I see! So is that why (at least in the movies) the warning is an intermittent beep (picking up the sweeps), and then when the missile is looking right at them it goes berserk, cause it knows it's being looked at?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So this being the case, why don't planes carry a couple of (small) rear-pointing, radar-guided air-to-air missiles to deal with pursuers? If nothing else, these would force the pursuer to turn off their radar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP. I think it would depend on the type of targeting system. Fire and forget, I think it would be when the missile is fired. But for lock, then fire, it would probably be when the locking occurs. That logic would follow when the radio waves would be sent out</p></div>		</li>
