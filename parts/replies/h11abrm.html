			<div class="markdown"><p>It can vary by jurisdiction, but what’s far more likely to be admitted in court is <em>your statements/admissions while being questioned by the polygraph administrator</em>, and not the <em>administrator’s subjective impression of your truthfulness</em>.</p>
<p>In other words, if you’re under investigation, agreeing to take a polygraph can only hurt you, it can never help you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. Police rarely use polygraph tests when they’re actually unsure about innocence. 99% of the time they’ll only spring for the expense of a polygraph machine and technician when they’re already convinced they have the right guy. Then they’ll do the test, glance at the results, tell the suspect they failed, and try to get a confession.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, they should never have been used in a professional or law setting, just like the implicit association test. They are just fun sci-fi tech</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, much of what is measured in polygraph technology is scientific. The technology is used to this day in sleep disorder clinics to diagnose sleep disorders. It's called polysomnography and it adds in measurements of brain waves, along with the other factors measured in the polygraph.</p>
<p>The problem with the polygraph is not that it does not work and produce accurate data. The problem is that the interpretation of the results as to truthfulness is unreliable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, I shouldn't have called them Sci fi tech lol, the iat is not fun, and the polygraph like you said is a very useful instrument, just not as it applies to the justice system.</p></div>		</li>
