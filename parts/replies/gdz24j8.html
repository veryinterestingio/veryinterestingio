			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. That response could be about any disease, there was nothing specific in the response to OP’s question. If he dove into brake failure and the different causes of it, then maybe. It’s a cute example, but that’s it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the point. Cancer isn't a disease. It's a way of categorizing diseases. In the same way that Viral Infections or Bacterial Infections are categorizations. Going in to detail about brake lights would be akin to describing a specific cancer, or specific viral infection.</p>
<p>Cancer just means a dna mutation is fucking you up (edit: by growing abnormally). It doesn't specify which dna strand, in what cell, in what body part. Just like how viral infections are just a virus fucking you up. You don't even know <em>how</em> its fucking you up or the specific virus. And the more details you figure out, the more specific it is to the case you're looking at, and the less relevant it is to the study of cancer/viral infections as a whole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's kind the point though. Cancer is a group of diseases and saying there's a sole cure for cancer as saying we have one sole cure for bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really...</p>
<p>Cancers are different for lots of reasons. Some affect different types of cells/tissue. Some are different mutations in the DNA. Sometimes it’s about specific cells growing in the wrong part of your body.</p>
<p>The thing they have in common is that cancer is always about uncontrolled cell growth... cells divide and divide and divide and spread into your body.</p>
<p>Here’s a good explainer: <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/what-is-cancer" target="_blank">https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/what-is-cancer</a></p>
<p>To your question, problems with the cells organelles can cause cancer or a range of other conditions.</p>
<p>For example: to take everyone’s favourite, the mitochondria, a malfunction might cause diabetes, cancer, muscular dystrophy or Alzheimer’s. <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15612-mitochondrial-diseases" target="_blank">(sauce)</a></p>
<p>Or problems with the ribosomes, where proteins are made, could cause anything from anaemia and blood conditions to serious physical deformities to cancer. <a href="https://dmm.biologists.org/content/8/9/1013" target="_blank">(sauce)</a></p>
<p>So yes - cancers can be caused by malfunctions in different parts of the cell. That’s not the main difference between most cancers though. And malfunction of the organelles can cause issues in lots of different ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, cancers are cells that become autonomous from the body. The cells themselves are alive and well, they do so well in fact they steal and disrupt your other cells which eventually causes your death.</p>
<p>Basically, if the organelles where broken the cell wouldn't function very well. Cancer cells on the other hand are extremely good at being alive. They just stay alive to the detriment of the rest of your body.</p>
<p>There are genetic diseases that cause disfunctional organelles, but those people generally don't live very long.</p></div>		</li>
