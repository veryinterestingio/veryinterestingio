			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you mean by monochrome? If you put a bunch of snow on a red floor, it’ll still look white because very little of the light is making it all the way to the floor and then all the way back. If you shine a red light on it, you will get a red effect.</p>
<p>Basically, snow is so good at scattering light that the surroundings matter much less than what kind of light you shine on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Snow is ice, so yes, each individual snow flake is transparent. But each one bends light in its own accord, so the light that reaches your eye is a mixture of all colors but without defined shape: white, imageless white.</p>
<p>The same happens with glass dust, for example. If you fill a jar with molten glass and let it solidify, you'll get a transparent glass block (this is the equivalent to a block of ice). But if you fill it with glass dust you won't be able to see through it, it's going to be white and opaque (equivalent to snow).</p>
<p>Edit: This, as the previous user said, has to do with each phase having different refraction coefficients (aka how much it bends light); a pencil inside a glass of water looks deformed because of this bending. The problem is that, if you have thousands of different bendings altogether (like in a pile of snow) the light arrives so mixed that it doesn't conserve the image, only the light itself. That's why it's white (all wavelengths together).</p>
<p>This can be seen everywhere: gaseous water is transparent, but vapor are tiny droplets suspended in air, and that's why clouds are <em>seen</em> above an altitute, sometimes very abruptly: above that altitude gaseous water condensates and scatters light. Most plastics are transparent, but most have inorganic particles or crystals inside that form another phase and scatter light and make them opaque. A clean glass edge is transparent, but usually those edges are rough and each roughness scatters light in a different angle, making it opaque (here another fenomenon also takes place, but let's leave diffraction for another day xD)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Whereas, if the refractive index of both materials is the same, there's no such effect. That's how you get those polymer balls that are invisible in water.</p>

<p>translucent - Transmitting light but causing sufficient diffusion to prevent perception of distinct images.</p>
<p>transparent - Capable of transmitting light so that objects or images can be seen as if there were no intervening material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it not be due to light scattering as a wavefront is bent in multiple different directions rather than simply being bent multiple times? If you stack hundreds of panes of glass together they are still transparent despite introducing more and more barriers that cause refraction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/czoxtr/white_hair_is_actually_transparent_taken_with_a/" target="_blank">photo</a> suggests that white hair is indeed transparent to visible light. And then, yes, a similar logic applies. </p>
<p>Aperiodic arrangements of transparent micro-materials will tend to scatter light when the particles themselves differ in geometry - unless the arrangement is highly packaged such that the distance between particles is not on the order of the wavelength of incident light such as in solid glass. </p>
<p>In the case of hair, the surface is fairly coarse and the hairs themselves are spread out in space, so I'd expect a good deal of scattering and thus opaqueness. Maybe a taut bundle would appear somewhat more translucent.</p></div>		</li>
