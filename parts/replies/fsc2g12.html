			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's true that brighter, louder voices cut better via primitive recording equipment. However, I suspect that style was also a vestige of the pre-microphone era; those kinds of voices carry better across a crowded hall with no amplification at all. It's part of the same transition we see in mid-20th century cinema, from theatre actors with a big, loud style, to the more naturalistic actors like Brando, whose sound was often much smaller, because it could be picked up by soundstage mics in a way that it could never be perceived in a theatre.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are spot on. Early movies had actors that were almost painted white with makeup. Seen today, it looks silly, but they were struggling to make the technology of the time work. Theater provided ample examples of makeup. Those early cameras were hand cranked, and it was seen as the job of the cameraman to vary the speed to emphasize the actions in the story. When we see this today, it looks goofy. But in the days of no-fx, making something that ‘looks photographic go faster than real life’ was probably very exciting!  Today, to our eyes, it looks quaint.</p>
<p>When we are shown, in media, an actor-on-the-stage trope, the actor is always shown zoomed in center frame, looking like they are being obvious, overly loud and gesturing wildly. Weirdly, looking at an actor from that range, from a viewpoint that no one in the theatre would see, means that the actor might actually be doing their job, if seen from a theatre seat. If I remember correctly, there was an idea that you had to be a very good and powerful actor to play to large houses. A “good” actor could broadcast his performance all the way to the cheap seats. </p>
<p>I also remember that many silent-era actors couldn’t make the transition to talking movies. They spent years making movies where they had no sound on set at all. Why change now? But the introduction of talkies quickly killed silent films. So people were acting in such a way that they were able to carry the whole story without sound and now are expected to change overnight? Films quickly changed. The actors changed their style to adapt to the new technology. Now, as an actor, you needed to have a good voice too. As recorded by microphones. It also helped to have a strong profile, for the close-ups. </p>
<p>Honestly, you don’t need to go very far back to find a time when... movie actors did movies. Tv actors did tv. Theater actors did stage. And nobody “did it all” for the most part.(probably a few, but not many.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading somewhere that Vera Lynn was especially popular during the Second World War because her voice cut through static and sounded good even on cheap radios or crystal sets. Any idea what it would be about her voice that made it suitable for that kind of broadcast? Would that be similar to what you’re describing here?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One misunderstanding I find common is that the engineers involved were “bad” and couldn’t capture the recordings in a high quality way. Look, if you were a radio engineer, you were given specifications that your broadcast had to meet to be sent and received. Those were set numbers. Your audio had a certain range to work in, in the radio wavelength. You took what was given in recordings or live audio and you made it fit into that space, capturing and delivering the best you could. This was given the assumptions of what the receiving equipment of the day might be. When there was very low bandwidths of audio available, the “best” sound you could get was to capture the middle part of the audio spectrum. The extremes of pitch, both high and low, are more challenging to both capture and reproduce. Many radios of early eras had one speaker about 1 1/2 inches across to play to a whole living room of people! Midrange audio contains the largest amount of musical audio, most vocal tones, so was what was most concentrated on in early audio. In those early days, no one listening could play your “bass drop”, as the tiny speaker would just self-destruct attempting to do so? So they started out with the important midpoint of the audio range kinda in the mid, but maybe just a bit higher than mid. Recording a violin or a flute was often a test early on. So recordings from that era sounds nasally and thin, but they were getting a fairly good representation of the source audio. Given their limitations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, on the contrary, lots of those engineers were top notch expressly because they were able to get usable sound with the tech available at the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting chapter in history! The sound quality of FM opened up a new world in pop music radio. And since it was so new in the 60s - early 70s, it was a blank slate for experimentation, whereas AM stayed a bastion for established formats. Then of course it moved on to being a wasteland of talk radio.</p></div>		</li>
