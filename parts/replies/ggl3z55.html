<p>In general, it would normally be considered to be advantageous for a virus to become more contagious and less deadly, but remember that covid isn't <em>that</em> deadly for most people, and there's a large degree of a- and presymptomatic transmission, and a decent period of time between infection and hospitalisation, so the selection pressure to reduce lethality isn't going to be really high.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That point about selection pressure, and the peak of infectiousness coming in the presymptomatic phase is pretty important, and well put. Am I right in saying that while SARS was far more deadly, the peak viral shedding from it happened a few days AFTER the onset of severe symptoms? That's a pretty crucial difference to how mutations will spread, and whether they get less deadly as they get more infectious</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mutations are random.</p>
<p>A random mutation that makes the virus more contagious will likely proliferate.</p>
<p>A random mutation that makes the virus less deadly <em>might</em> proliferate, but since this one is capable of spreading before the onset of symptoms, and isn't likely to incapacitate or kill until over a week later, we can imagine changes that impact the late stages of the disease that don't have much impact on transmission rate.</p>
<p>And it's also possible to have the reverse: a mutation that increases the transmission rate without impacting the severity of the disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no, they're both as deadly as they can get away with. If both are contagious, but one is more deadly, both populations can exist perpetually as long as neither is deadly enough to completely wipe out the supply of fresh hosts for the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have also heard that there is a trend over time of virus's and bacteria eventually evolving to a point of harmless coexistence as killing its host isn't in its interest, is this a reliable thing or could the flu (already human adapted) randomly become deadly to the healthy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This *can* be true, but not always. With viruses, natural selection results in strains that have more opportunities to spread, as a survivor who has immunity afterwards will not contract a less-spreadable strain subsequently.</p>
<p>The reason that a virus that kills its host at a high rate is typically at a evolutionary disadvantage is twofold: first, a dead host is (usually) no longer able to infect others, and secondly - specific to human-adapted viruses - a more-deadly human virus would result in greater efforts to limit its spread. One can argue that's not happening in this case, but imagine how many cases and deaths we would have if the people that *are* taking precautions weren't doing so, or if we hadn't put so many resources into developing a vaccine in record time. And trust me, if COVID-19 had a 10% death rate vs \~1%, we'd be locking ourselves down a *lot* more.</p>
<p>That said, SARS-CoV-2 has a huge evolutionary advantage in that it is transmissible by an asymptomatic host, unlike most other potentially-fatal infections, which means that infected hosts have far more opportunities to pass the virus to others before getting sick and (presumably) isolating themselves. HIV has the same advantage, but on the order of years, not days, which is why testing is so critical in the effort to keep it from spreading further.</p>
<p>P.S. The <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-i/1918-flu-pandemic" target="_blank">1918 &quot;Spanish Flu&quot; pandemic</a> is an example of exactly what you ask - an influenza mutation that made the virus extremely deadly vs its ancestors. Eventually its spread was limited by public health measures (including, yes, public mask wearing), and it mutated again into a far less dangerous strain.</p></div>		</li>
