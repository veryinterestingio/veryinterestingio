			<div class="markdown"><p>If it happens naturally, then in principle, yes. Ice on Earth is considered a rock (or, well, a mineral and rock by the same name). But in astronomy and planetary geology &quot;rock&quot; is sometimes used to refer to primarily silicate material, to distinguish it from metal and volatiles (materials with a low melting temperature)</p></div>		</li>

<p>In general, anything that naturally forms will at some point become so heavy that it starts forming an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. This causes a progress where most of the planet's mass ends up being hydrogen and helium, which turns it into an ice giant (like Uranus and Neptunus) or a gas giant (like Jupiter).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To elaborate a bit: Technically I don't see anything that entirely excludes the possibility of something like a huge iron &quot;core&quot; only planet from being able to exist. It is however extremely unlikely that such a thing could ever form, given the high percentage of hydrogen and helium in the universe, and the processes in which planets are usually formed.</p>
<p>So it is a matter the planet forming processes and the available materials for it causing it to be extremely unlikely for something like that to ever form, rather than a mechanic that causes such a theoretical planet from existing in a stable state.</p></div>		</li>
