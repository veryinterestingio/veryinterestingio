<p>This is why fog lights are mounted higher or lower than the normal headlights. The light reflected back from the fog is not as direct.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adding on to this:</p>
<p><em>Never</em> use your high beams in fog. You just end up blasting yourself in the face.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow! Thanks for explaining. Also props to OP for asking this, I have experienced this too but never questioned it. I thought as the vehicle moves ahead, it clears the fog behind it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cars driving do clear fog. It's why the highways can be a strip without fog when there busy. But this is the heat off the cars and road help clearing the fog. One car makes no real difference but loads of cars driving at speed can</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think that would occur, as any air drawn in behind the car is also going to be filled with fog.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s exactly why. That’s why people spend money on fog lights.</p>
<p>The rear of a car is lit with red light at a lower intensity or external light, so there is less obscuring glare off of the fog particles. </p>
<p>Another demo you can do is look through a dusty window and then shine a light at it to light up the dust.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except what he was saying is : when you are outside for you can't see inside it, but when you're inside you can see around you. Which is for a completely different reason (illusion because when you are inside you see 200m round you but when you are outside these same 200m seem like nothing and you don't count them as &quot;fog&quot; since you can see through them)</p>
<p>And despite you being right in what you say, you didn't answer op's question at all</p></div>		</li>
