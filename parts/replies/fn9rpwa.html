			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a bit different thing. The stomach and the rest of your intestines definitely do have pain receptors. However, the pain from these visceral pain receptors is unable to be well localized by the brain. The brain interprets it as coming from a certain general area, it is not &quot;borrowing' pain receptors from other areas. As others have pointed out, headaches come from other things in the head, not the brain, which doesn't have pain receptors at all.</p></div>		</li>
