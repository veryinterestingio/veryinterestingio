<p>The general argument is that there would have to be a place where the two meet, and we would be able to see the annihilation effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is solar wind, which are a constant stream of dust and elementary particles which have escaped the solar gravity well, blown off by solar radiation. From an antistar, these would be antimatter. Over vast distances some of these particles will hit particles from other solar bodies, and if those are of ordinary matter, there would be an annihilation which releases light. A single pixel on a telescope camera covers a HUGE volume of space, and there would be enough of these tiny light emissions to show up clearly in the image like a halo around the antistar or antigalaxy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As much sense as that makes, space is also <em>vast</em>. Couldn’t it be possible that entire galaxies or some such are antimatter, and they interact with matter galaxies rarely enough that we haven’t observed it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But to maintain symmetry, that would mean half of all galaxies are matter and half are anti-matter. If that were true, I really don’t think it would be rare enough for it not to be observed.</p>
<p>If the numbers are skewed enough that it is rare, then you’re back to having an imbalance and the problem isn’t really solved.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And should it be on the very edge of the universe, it would be possible to contain at least as much matter as that within the observable universe due to the outside of the sphere / circle / shape having a larger space between objects? (i.e. more dense closer to the “centre”)</p></div>		</li>

<p>No. There can't be such place. At the point of big bang everything was in a single point and this point expands now into the known universe. This means that the distance between you matter and anti-matter parts would be arbitrarily small at certain point in time, and so would be our distance to the place where they interact. We can see the Cosmic-Microwave-Background, and we would also see there such interactions, if they were present as such a localized phenomena.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If they did exist in our observable universe, they likely would have collided with matter based galaxies, and the explosive effects would far exceed the light show put on by the most brilliant quasars. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What explosive effect? Collision between stars is extremely rare in galaxy collisions. </p>
<p>And a black hole wouldn't care if the black hole it was merging with was made up of anti matter.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as an anti-matter black hole. That property loses all meaning beneath the event horizon.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Objects in those galaxies radiate cosmic rays, which we can observe on Earth (indirectly, through interactions in the atmosphere) and in orbit (directly: see the PAMELA and AMS-02 experiments). The vast majority of the cosmic rays are protons, rather than antiprotons, and electrons, rather than antielectrons.</p>
<p>It's an experimental fact that there's far more matter than antimatter in the universe, and this fact also fits well with highly successful Big Bang models.</p>
<p>Now <em>why</em> there's so much more matter than antimatter is an interesting question, and as others have pointed out, there are promising leads but no one really knows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because our whole universe is an anti-matter source for an advanced civilization outside our universe. Universe creates matter and anti-matter in equal amounts, but antimatter is taken out for whatever use they have for it. Our universe might be something analogous to an uranium atom which undergoes alpha decay to form thorium.</p></div>		</li>
