			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to note (unless I am sorely mistaken) that pretty much every measure shorter than a &quot;day&quot; is essentially arbitrary.</p>
<p>A year is based on the time of the Earth around the sun; a month is the moon around the earth; a day is the rotation of the earth.</p>
<p>Everything smaller than that is &quot;how many segments do we want?&quot;</p>
<p>An hour was an arbitrary division of the day into 24 segments apparently created by the ancient Egyptians.</p>
<p>From there, we ultimately arbitrarily divided hours into 60 minutes, and those into 60 seconds.</p>
<p>According to the internet, Galileo's work on pendulums and realising they swing at a constant rate led to clocks that were accurate enough to record minutes, and later seconds.</p>
<p>I would have to imagine that there was a great deal of trial and error involved - figuring out the size of pendulum and the distance it would have to swing to get a result that matched the turning of the Earth. It took many years to refine accuracy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the 24 and 60 things aren't <em>completely</em> arbitrary. They're numbers that can be cleanly and easily divided into halves, thirds, quarters, etc. which is convenient for many reasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, just make the distance of the weight from the pivot point adjustable to be able to tune, and even fine tune to an incredible degree of accuracy, your pendulum swing rate. You can even make your pendulum solid and just add a small but massive sliding weight to the back side to tune it perfectly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Here you are contradicting yourself ;-)</p>
<p>The swing frequency of pendulum only depends on the length. Period. [As long as you keep the swing relatively short and not like half-circle]</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would have been practical to count seconds with a simple pendulum if you just wanted an early &quot;stopwatch&quot; rather than a clock. I don't think the second was really used as a unit before mechanical clocks, though.</p>
<p>I'm speculating, but I expect that if there was a need to measure short periods of time, it was done with a pendulum of whichever length was convenient, without caring much about what fraction of a day it was. When your town's standard units of length and weight were effectively &quot;the length of that stick&quot; and &quot;the weight of that rock&quot;, the obvious unit of time is &quot;a pendulum as long as that stick&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Watches use a sprung oscillating weight which works more or less like a pendulum. It ticks a lot faster, but that's easy to compensate for with gears. So it reduces to the same problem of finding the correct gear ratios.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, but the question is about how mechanisms are informed about the definition of a second. it's one thing for a second to be a well defined unit of time. it's a different thing to communicate that measurement to a mechanism. the pendulum is the thing that translates what a second is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They have springs. You wind the spring up and it pushes back out on the watch mechanism at a reasonably constant force. You then translate that to movements of the hands.</p></div>		</li>
