			<div class="markdown"><p>The reality is that patients and doctors do not know the precise time for every patient when they should stop. Instead, studies are frequently done on the outcomes of Duration X vs Duration Y. Whichever duration has better outcomes is the one that is recommended. </p>
<p>Of course every person, and every infection, is unique, so someone could probably get away with Durations A, B, C, but it's hard to know who is who and which is which. Simply feeling better has not been reliably shown across studies to be an effective endpoint. Some people have high pain tolerance and &quot;feel better&quot; even when they are still infected. For these reasons, doctors ask patients to complete the regimen using the time that has been demonstrated to be effective to reduce the necessity of guessing on either the Doctor or the Patient's part. Some people are likely over-treated but seldom is anyone undertreated, which, in most cases, is more immediately harmful.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I would go as far as to say that nearly everyone is over-treated.</p>
<p>If there's any kind of distribution of required treatment duration, that difference in harm means that you want to get a vast marjority of people sufficiently treated.  At least 95%, probably more like 4 or 5 sigma's worth.  Conversely, that means that more than 99% of people are taking more antibiotics than they need, just because there's no (reasonable) way to know if they're in the 1% that <em>does</em> need the extra doses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first paper suggests that given how awful people are at taking daily TB pills for 9 months, it is better to give them different IV drugs in a clinical setting for 3 months so the patients at least get a valid course of treatment.</p>
<p>Seems more like a research paper that agrees that not taking drugs correctly for &gt;6 months was a problem and is exploring ways to work around the high non-compliance risk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LTBI is entirely different though and that's what these studies reference. I've never seen a study saying TB disease can be cured at substantial rates in less than 6 months.</p>
<p>Edit: I see how my wording was confusing... Should have said disease instead of infection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anyone who has had C. Diff will have their opinion on overuse of antibiotics changed forever. As a doctor I used to be asked fairly often by friends and family to prescribe them antibiotics, most often for what I was sure was a viral syndrome. Unless it was absolutely indicated I would refuse and instead give them a speech about how overuse of antibiotics can be very dangerous for them and the future of society. And to always limit their use to when they are absolutely clinically indicated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Clostridium difficile colitis most commonly occurs after using antibiotics, by disrupting the microbiome. Many people carry (or are exposed to) the Clostridium spores but do not get C. diff because the normal flora of the gut keep the Clostridium in check, in ecological balance. C. diff is very resistant to many (most) antibiotics and so general use of antibiotics will affect the normal gut bacteria disproportionately, leaving the C. diff to emerge and take over. So using antibiotics puts you at risk for getting C. diff. Some of the hypervirulent strains like NAP1/B1/027 have a mortality rate of up to 10% depending on age, so itâ€™s a very serious illness.</p></div>		</li>
