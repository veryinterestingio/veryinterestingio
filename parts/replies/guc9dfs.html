			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess perhaps I worded it wrong. I’m not trying to say that mutations occur faster in the spike proteins, but from what I’ve been learning, it appears that the spike proteins variate a lot between different strains (due to the mutations that can occur in them potentially being evolutionary rewarding as you say, since that’s the protein that attaches to the cell’s receptors). But the nucleocapsids seem to stay largely the same between different strains, which would mean that a single vaccine could target more strains of the virus. Correct me if that’s wrong.
I definitely understand the part about the spike proteins being the usual target site since they are found on the outer part of the virus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify as I understand it (and this is very much a layman’s understanding) it’s not so much that we would be changing the speed at which a part of a viruses code mutates (although as I understand it some types of various things have accelerated mutation rates) it’s more we are shifting what mutations become successful.</p>
<p>We have a need to ascribe an order to processes we can see. Which leads to a natural assumption that the evolutionary process is somehow targeted to make a better organism when it really isn’t. It’s less a process and more the natural result of life. The traits that make an organism more survivable get past on because the organism survives.</p>
<p>So in this example there is an evolutionary “reward” for versions of the virus that happen to mutate the spike protein to something our body doesn’t recognize. The rest of it likely doesn’t change but the part we trained our body to recognize did. So all those that happened to have a mutation in the nucleocapsids still died due to our immune system. However, the ones that happened to randomly mutate their spike protein survived to reproduce and create more versions with that mutation. </p>
<p>If we switch to all stuff that targets the nucleocapsids all you do is naturally shift the evolutionary pressures involved. Instead of spike mutations being what happens to allow a virus to survive and reproduce because our bodies don’t recognize what they have been trained to look for it simply becomes the nucleocapsid mutations that happen to survive to reproduce.</p></div>		</li>

<p>True, but again, its worth noting that the idea of a strain is different in the viral world. There's no sexual reproduction, so instead strains are normally defined by groups of viruses that our immune system recognizes as the same. So a strain of SARS-CoV-2 becomes a group that has a change in the spike protein.</p>
<p>We generally don't classify changes as new strains unless it modifies the immune response.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>At least some portions of the nucleocapsid, yes. Due to requirements to keep the virus functionally intact, some portions just can't change all that much. However, those portions may or may not be exposed in a way that your body can actually use.</p>
<p>And now, I want to be clear that there are a lot of people with better/newer information than I have on this, but from what I've heard in the past, attempts to create vaccines around nucleocapsid proteins have been made. The issue was that they just weren't as effective as other existing vaccines. </p>
<p>This might just be a case where trial and error or maybe some deep analysis can find a better target. I'd like to hope so. But it will take more time, and even then, it usually means that we can vaccinate against a viral species and its variants, not an entire viral group (note: that's still a really good achievement).</p></div>		</li>

<p>But also potentially a dead-end.  Mutation is random, and the spike protein is effectively the tool the virus uses to get into your cells.  If it changes too much, it doesn't work.</p></div>		</li>
