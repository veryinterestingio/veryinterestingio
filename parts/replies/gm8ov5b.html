			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep but the way it funnels can alter the sound in a way that we perceive a direction beyond left and right.</p>
<p>For audio synthesizing surround from just a left and right channel, it just does the alterations the funneling would have done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why your ears have such a funny shape. When sound comes from the back, it bounces around the outside of your ear before going in. When it comes from the front, it bounces around the ear too, but in different ways. These subtle differences make the sound just a tiny bit different when it comes from the front as when it comes from the back. It's very very subtle, but your brain is really good at figuring it out. You won't be able to tell the difference in the &quot;sound&quot;, but you can tell because you <em>feel</em> whether the sound is coming from the front or the back.</p>
<p>I'm not leaving a top level reply because I don't know how this works with headphones. Everyone has differently shaped ears and your brain knows how <em>your</em> ears work. I don't know how you replicate that with stereo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. This is also why “artificial ear” recording is so difficult. Our brains are extremely particular about the shape of the outer ear. They’re only accustomed to synthesizing these cues from two specific ears and a different set of micro-cues are not going to be as useful.</p>
<p>To make a perfect binaural recording, you’d ideally want the artificial ears to be modeled after your own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So we just need to 3d-scan everyone's ears... And everyone gets their own unique encoding algorithm that's applied to every 3d audio piece they download.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds will reach both ears, regardless of which ear the source is closer to. But the distance and placement of the source will mean that the timing and loudness of the sound reaching each ear will be very slightly different. Your brain can use the differences in how something sounds from each ear to locate the position of the source in space. It’s similar to the way that your brain uses the slightly different images seen by each eye to create a merged image with depth information that makes things look 3D.</p>
<p>This is also why people and animals will often cock their heads when trying to listen to something. Changing the orientation of your ears helps provide additional information that can be used to locate the source.</p>
<p>Edit: And to answer the OP’s question, by varying the volume and timing of the audio being directed to each ear in a pair of headphones, you can make the sound feel like it is coming from different locations in space. This is easiest to achieve by having two microphones place approximately ear distance apart recording the same sounds and then using the recording from each microphone for the sound channel directed to the corresponding ear.</p></div>		</li>
