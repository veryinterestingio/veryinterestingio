			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I have heard, it is because political opponents could try to get a judge to charge a president with just about anything to lay out a court summons, which could tie the president up in court prenty much indefinitely. So exiting office is necessary before prosecution. It just isn't realistic to have them be open to an attack like that I guess.</p>
<p>The whole, &quot;president being head of the executive branch, means that he is king of law&quot; is patently wrong. I don't know why people are believing that above comment. Our system has checks and balances, which is likely why impeachment has to occur before prosecution.</p></div>		</li>
