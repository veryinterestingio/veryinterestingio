<p>I am drawing a blank on the terms and meanings but we get a yearly short summary of thus.</p>
<p>Curezntly rhe facility of toyota I work at is undergoing a lot of Kaizen sessions to improve customer service for the material handling side of the group.</p>
<p>Our goal is to distribut the ordered units within 14 days after being manufactured.
Currently we are at 20 for our facility.</p>
<p>The awesome part is that this is being done on a full European scale instead of a single facility.</p>
<p>And experience this first hand almost daily makes me actually proud of working there.</p></div>		</li>
