			<div class="markdown"><p>The Lagrange points are pretty interesting. If you start reading hard science fiction books, you'll notice that sometimes the ships orbit this points rather than just go into orbit around a planet, either for concealment purposes or to get a bigger overview of the planet at hand.</p>
<p>Depending on which Lagrange point, a body can stay there in stationkeeping either with negligible power, or some power to keep at that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth mentioning Larange points aren't stable orbits, and require station keeping fuel burns in order to stay there, which means anything you put there is gonna have a finite time. Granted, ALL satellites being put into any orbital regime for a specific task will require station keeping in order to be able to perform their task, but the Larange points require a lot more finesse. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>l4 and l5 are conditionally stable and are stable for the earth-moon relationship. The chinese put their relay on l2 though, so your assertion of station keeping is still correct for the chinese satellite </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on, the cowherd and the weaver maiden are a pair of forlorn lovers, whose love was forbidden. They are separated by the Milky Way (银河) and can only meet annually when the bridge of swallows is formed. Qixi Festival is thus the Chinese Valentine's Day.</p></div>		</li>
