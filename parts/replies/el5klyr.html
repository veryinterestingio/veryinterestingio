<p>&quot;However if consumers stop buying plastics then manufacturers will notice that plastic products aren’t turning profits and will in turn switch to materials that consumers are willing to buy.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This may have been true a hundred years ago when we had actual competition and economies of scale that made sense to an ordinary person. We've far outgrown that world. A hundred years ago, markets were smaller, there were many more companies, there was real competition, and it was possible for individual consumer choices to influence companies. But over the last century there has been so much conglomeration and consolidation that individual consumers don't even remotely have the capability to influence multi-national mega-conglomerate companies. They're not just companies anymore, they're systemic, structural entities baked into our economic system. </p>
<p>Individual consumer choices <em>will never</em> solve this problem. Coca Cola sells 1.9 billion servings of Coke products <em>a day.</em> A <strong>day.</strong> And that's just one company. You will never, ever, <em>ever,</em> <strong>ever</strong> in a million years get enough people to boycott the world's beverage companies to make them take enough of a loss to change their business practices. Even if you convinced 10 million Americans to give up plastic tomorrow, it won't make a difference.</p>
<p>We are facing a structural, systemic failure of our the free market. Only a structural, systemic solution can solve it. This is why we have governments and why we need governments that aren't run &quot;as a business,&quot; that don't look to profit motive, but that exist to make good long-term calls. This is the same reason we have anti-trust laws and a commonly-shared belief, even among right-wing economists, that unregulated, unfettered monopolies are actually bad for the economy and our communities, even though monopolies arise out of unregulated capitalism.</p>
<p>This is the exact same reason that over 2/3rds of major advancements in US medical treatments and technology come out of government-funded research, <em>not</em> private enterprise. This is a very similar line of thinking as to why individual employees will never be able to negotiate effectively on their behalf when dealing with multi-national mega-conglomerates like Xfinity and we need strong unions that can help leverage collective action and consumer protection bureau's to hold megacorporations accountable for violating the law and cheating their customers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer and reminds me of the commercial farming industry. Like how people say we should all go vegan. In reality that will never work unless everybody goes vegan which is unrealistic (no matter how bad pekoe make other people feel about the issue), it’ll never happen. It’s actually a problem in the regulation of farming and the companies paying off the government to run inhumane farms. This is similar to coke because even tho we know as consumers that it’s bad practice, it’s too big of a giant to take down by us individually. I personally think it should be the governments responsibility to not just see dollar signs but to put these bad practices to rest. We shouldn’t feel bad or guilty for these companies bad practices or be expected to fix it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all vegans are consequentialist. I reckon most aren’t. They simply find it morally unpalatable to support or benefit from the animal industry.  </p>
<p>And the idea that you as an individual don’t have any obligation to the greater good, because you believe the government should ultimately be in charge, is just lazy. That’s like saying you shouldn’t feel bad for not being charitable because the government is supposed to run all charities. Clearly you don’t think this way. Regardless, the world would undeniably be a better place if we held individuals to higher standards. And this is coming from someone who isn’t vegan, but is trying, and not making excuses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd think some companies would jump on it just to claim the moral high ground and try to demonize their competitors. Surely somebody would have thought that was a better long term strategy.</p></div>		</li>
