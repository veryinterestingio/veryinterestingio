			<div class="markdown"><p>Alex is spot on although I think the record-breakers are from captivity. I think the   heaviest wild cats that have been reliably measured (e.g. when captured by scientists) are tigers from Nepal and India although wild Amur or Siberian tigers are very close. And so is the lion! Although the record goes to the tiger by a whisker, the largest lions and the largest tigers are very, very close in size.</p></div>		</li>
