			<div class="markdown"><p>It's going to be impossible to tell right now because any situation where someone develops symptoms again will be explained as reactivation rather than reinfection, but there indeed have been a few stories to hit the news of someone who recovered completely months ago and developing symptoms after exposure. In short those 11 million cases are way too early to be noteworthy if there was reinfection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also that disturbing report that the virus mutated in March in the USA. And that mutated version accounts for the majority of current infections. We have no idea what triggered the mutation, but it seems highly unlikely that it will never mutate again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Viruses mutate all the time - they don't need a special trigger, it's just a natural process. </p>
<p>What seems to be the case with this virus is that a critical protein, the &quot;spike&quot; protein, which is required for infecting cells, is not significantly changing through mutation. This is probably because it works so well. It's like a key that fits perfectly in a lock. </p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, mutation is a concern. But so far, it seems like the spike protein is both critical for the virus and its achilles heel. That's what most of the vaccines are targeting. They latest mutation apparently allows for many more spike proteins on the virus surface making it far more infectious but still vulnerable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could probably tell if it was reinfection vs reactivation right? </p>
<p>Just sequence the viral RNA of the new particle and compare it to the old one. Considering the virus is likely clonal within each infection, you'd probably see a recognizable viral RNA difference between the two different infections no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good point that it's technically possible, but realistically speaking, most doctors aren't going to try comparing samples from different points in your illness (if the old one is still even accessible), and most likely you'll just be presumed to have lingering symptoms.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hold on. You do not know that immunity will be permanent. Nobody knows this. Experience with other coronaviruses does not support this statement. Most expert immunology opinion is that it's unlikely to be 'never'. And we don't know about being mild, either.</p>

<p>As u/0wlfather
pointed out, just because we don't detect antibodies in the blood doesn't mean you aren't immune.</p>

<p>And just because we DO detect antibodies does NOT mean you ARE immune. Nobody knows this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the 11 million+ cases so far of COVID there has not been a single documented case of reinfection. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Irrelevant. The only data we have is for less than 6 months. It says nothing about being permanent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nor have there been documented cases of reinfection with SARS or MERS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not really relevant as there have been so few cases. It means the chance of infection is very very low, never mind re-infection.</p>
<p>Am also an MD though one who abhors false confidence.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Please reread my statement. You seem to be suggesting most immunology experts think it is likely you will get reinfected with covid, once you have recovered. Is this your position?</p></div>		</li>

<p>He threw in a massive amount of &quot;likely's&quot; to account for just what you're saying and the fact that nobody knows anything for certain at the moment. I think his point still stands, namely that it's likely that this RNA virus acts like most other RNA viruses in terms of basic immunologic behavior, we have no reason to think otherwise until proven. He's purposefully removed most of the certainty in his statement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know he said 'likely', that's exactly what I take issue with. There is no 'likely' here. Previous coronavirus studies have found immunity lasting 1-2 years. Even then, we have NO idea what the situation is with this virus.</p>
<p>Stating it as 'likely' is unsupported by the available evidence. There's an awful lot we don't know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey,</p>
<p>Do you know how long of exposure is necessary to get the virus? I read a post and someone said that it's not likely to contract the virus if exposure is short. The post seemed to be saying that there is a threshold of exposures and that a few droplets outside aren't going to get you sick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can get it even with short/minimal exposure. There's no magic number. It just becomes increasingly more risky the longer and closer the exposure is. </p>
<p>If your are living with an infected spouse, sleeping with them, kissing and hugging then, that would be maximal risk.</p>
<p>Walking past an infected, masked person, while outside, that would be minimal risk but it's still possible.</p></div>		</li>
