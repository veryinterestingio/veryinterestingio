<p>Back when I worked with OSHA we were facing (and most likely still are) issues like this with fraking and hair salons.</p>
<p>Both industries use chemicals that we know are dangerous, and both industries change their chemical formulas faster than the government can complete the studies that would allow a court case.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even so...why not continue the studies when the ingredients were known. Once a previous product was proven dangerous, then couldn't the company still be in hot water? couldn't said company also have their current formulas put on hold once they were caught?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd have to prove that they knew at the time they were using them that the chemicals were dangerous. Otherwise a study proving that they're dangerous <em>now</em> after they've already moved on just gets a &quot;oh, we didn't know; we don't use those anymore&quot; response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And in the meantime, the seller makes enough money that it's worth the potential costs of getting caught, because they'll either not have to cover the costs of fixing the problem they created at all, or the amount they'll be fined will just be seen as &quot;the cost of doing business&quot; given the value they produced set against it. </p>
