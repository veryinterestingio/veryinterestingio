			<div class="markdown"><p>That cold bedside manner is part of what drives people to alternative medicines. While most alternatives are completely useless, the people who administer the &quot;treatments&quot; take the time to listen to the patients and acknowledge their pain.  The treatment itself may be no better than a placebo but the patient still recovers because of how powerful the placebo effect can be.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It took three years for me to be diagnosed with ovarian cysts because doctors (OB/GYN's included) kept passing off the excrutiating pain and blood as &quot;just my period,&quot; even when I wasn't on it. It got to the point where my ex started accusing me of faking it and being over dramatic every time I doubled over, crying in pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was part of the point of that study. I think the exact phrasing was, &quot;This is a sugar pill but you may feel better after you take it.&quot;</p>
<p>I've also read that the type of placebo makes a difference. Pills work very well. Injections work better they obviously have risks that sugar pills don't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bit of a tangent, but is it really unethical to not tell people precisely that it's a placebo? If we gave them a specific name that isn't just &quot;placebo&quot;, couldn't we tell them indirectly to allow it the full effect?</p>
<p>It's a stretch to say this, but choosing to not provide optimal treatment seems unethical too. If our rules about ethics are holding us back back from actually doing the right thing then that defeats the purpose. It's a slippery slope and all whenever you prioritize the greater good though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you highlight about it being unethical to not treat people if placebo does indeed work is part of the debate. I'm not a doctor or anything, so I'm not that up-to-date on the latest in medical ethics. But basically, because of the checkered history of medical research and &quot;medical&quot; practitioners (who just lied about their products), most doctors aren't super keen to treat patients with things they don't fully disclose. </p>
<p>Then there's the legal side, right. It's going to be way easier to sue your doctor for giving you &quot;fake&quot; medicine that didn't help than to sue your doctor for giving you real medicine that unfortunately didn't work for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure but I don't think so.</p>
<p>As far as I know, &quot;placebo&quot; just describes how it works, not how well it works.</p>
<p>I remember reading somewhere that the placebo effect is also culturally dependent.</p>
<p>If you're from a culture that attributes great healing powers to the local tree spirit you're likely to get a big placebo effect from therapies that invoke the tree spirit. If you're from a culture that expects healing powers from machines that go &quot;beep&quot; then you're likely to get a good placebo effect from such machines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stress related issues can be cured with placebos because the placebo reduces the stress enough for the adverse effects of stress to go away. </p>
<p>I tricked my sister into doing breathing exercises to reduce her blood pressure by &quot;teaching her to attune a hematite crystal to her energy by meditating three times a day&quot;. She believed in crystals but wouldn't listen to the GP so I ran with it.   The reduction in blood pressure allowed her to get better so in this case the placebo &quot;cured&quot; her.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Placebos are great. I'm not a bath guy myself but I'm a martial artist. So for my money Tiger Balm is one of the best placebos you can get.</p>
<p>I know that it doesn't actually make it through the skin but damn if it doesn't make sore muscles and bruises feel better.</p></div>		</li>
