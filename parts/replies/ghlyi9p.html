			<div class="markdown"><p>It is well known, but as usual it’s been widely misunderstood in the media and confused the public. Coronaviruses have a low mutation rate <em>for RNA viruses</em>, but that mutation rate is still thousands of times higher than that of double-stranded DNA (you, plants, bacteria, herpesviruses, etc etc) - it’s just roughly ten-fold lower than, say, influenza viruses. See for example Table 1 in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5075021/" target="_blank">Mechanisms of viral mutation</a>.</p></div>		</li>
