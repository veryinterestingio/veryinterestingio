			<div class="markdown"><p>Unlike most pharmaceuticals which are made using simple chemical synthesis, most vaccines are produced through either <em>in vivo</em> or <em>in vitro</em> processes using living organisms. As such they are often grown, most commonly using chicken eggs, in labs specifically configured for this and assumed to be completely contaminated with whatever organism the vaccine is to inoculate against. </p>
<p>Here's an interesting article about why vaccine production costs so much.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe not the right person to ask but i need to get it out of my head.</p>
<p>Do i need to use some sort of sanitizer on my phone?</p>
<p>As in, i know bacteria and viruses like to stay on our phones cause we touch them way too much, so i was curious if it was necessary to use some alcohol-based hand sanitizer on it every once in a while or just on my hands everytime i wanna eat or gonna touch my face.</p>
<p>Edit. My phone is composed of materials that are not attacked by alcohols and it is waterproof so no problem about that</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. If you're looking to see which antigens are strongly immunogenic you can do in vitro testing with purified antigen, for example, use a line of cells expressing pattern recognition receptors, like TLRs, which will produce a read out (usually interleukin molecules of some kind, I.e. the cell lines I used produced IL-8 when stimulated). You can also vaccinate mice with your vaccine prep to generate immune serum containing antibodies to all the immunogenic antigens in your vaccine preparation. You can use purified antigen again for an ELISA i.e. treat your ELISA plate with protein A (which is also in your vaccine as a conjugated, purified or subunit antigen, or is expressed on a whole cell antigen, so intact bacteria or virus etc), then treat that with your immune sera. Then you use a secondary antibody that can recognise any primary antibody (antibody in your immune sera) attached to protein A. Doing it this way you can test a whole panel of antigens for immunogenicity relatively quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually in some cases, you do inject the whole virus. You might be thinking of purified protein vaccines when  you talk about DNA, as this process can involve putting that DNA into an expression system to generate lots of the same  - expressing proteins like this is often done using E. coli and then the protein is purified out. I'm not entirely sure if this is used for human vaccines as I've only worked in a whole-cell setting, so the pathogen was included in the vaccine whole. When the pathogen is included whole, it can be either live attenuated or inactivated/killed. For viruses, live attenuation involves a process called  passaging - this means the virus is grown repeatedly under conditions that make it adapt to non-human conditions i.e. the flu virus can be grown in eggs and after enough passages, it's adapted to growing in the environment of the egg, but replicates poorly in the body and doesn't cause disease. </p>
<p>Clinical trials also aren't a matter of proving a vaccine probably works. They have to be shown to work in animals before they get anywhere near a clinical trial. This is when they're tested for safety i.e. adverse reactions, but after animal testing you should have a fairly good idea about what to expect. You also don't have to wait for an outbreak of disease for a trialled and approved vaccine to be available. Vaccines aim to prevent illness so if it works, it'll be made available and may be included in childhood vaccination schedules if it's against a common illness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>E.coli is used in some human virus production. For the product I help make we use yeast though. Just depends on how well the protein will express in different hosts (codon optimization too I'm sure).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any clue as to the approach they take when testing people? They start with what Iâ€™d assume to be smaller rodents such as rats, as seen in all the movies. Then move their way up to humans? Or am I mistaken?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It differs for each system. For flu, it goes inbred mice (i.e., genetically identical), then outbred mice, then large rodents (e.g., ferrets or rabbits), then primates, then 3 phases of human clinical trials. Each successive clinical trial is composed of more subjects than the previous. However, we also share our animal facility with researchers studying leishmaniasis, and they do not do large rodents because I think these animals are not affected by this disease. So it just depends on the pathogen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's correct, generally the safety and efficacy would first be tested in an animal model. The animal chosen can depend on the type of virus, they will choose the animal that will most closely represent the disease as it manifests in humans and best predict the response in humans. After testing in animals the company would then design a phase I clinical trial which would be approved by the FDA or one of the competent authorities in Europe to go ahead. The phase I clinical trial will have a small number of people and a tight inclusion criteria i.e. only healthy individuals of a certain age can participate. The aim of a phase I trial is to see if the vaccine is safe. If this is successfully demonstrated, the FDA/ a competent authority in Europe will approve a phase II clinical trial which has a broader inclusion criteria and a higher number of participants. Again the main goal of a phase II trial is to determine safety of the product but this time in a larger, more varied population. If this trial is a success the company may proceed to a stage III clinical trial, again, pending approval from the regulatory bodies. The phase III clinical trials have very broad inclusion criteria and the most participants of all the phases. The aim of a stage III trail is to determine the efficacy and safety of the vaccine. </p>
<p>If stage III trials are successful and the company proves the the vaccine is safe and effective in a large, varied population, the company may then submit an application for authorisation of the vaccine (i.e. to put the vaccine on the market). The data from the clinical and animal trials is again reviewed during this process. The benefit of taking the vaccine must be significantly greater than the risk of getting the disease it protects against. Other things are also extensively assessed during this process such as the manufacturing processes used, down to the layout of the manufacturing facility and the type of filters used to ensure proper circulation and sterility in the rooms where the vaccine is being manufactured.</p>
<p>As far as I know the process of determining safety through clinical trials is especially lengthy for vaccines. And of course that's not the end of the process! Any adverse reactions are monitored throughout the life cycle of the vaccine even after its put on the market. The product may be withdrawn by the regulatory body if evidence suggests its unsafe and the initial risk/benefit balance that was determined through the clinical trials is actually different in the &quot;real&quot; population.</p>
<p>Edit: sorry about the lengthy post. Came back here to say the WHO has an excellent resource if you would like to learn more about the different types of vaccines, how they are developed and regulated -

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, they work their way up from animals to small trials to larger trials. It graduates up from the least risk to humans to the most, building information as they go.</p></div>		</li>
