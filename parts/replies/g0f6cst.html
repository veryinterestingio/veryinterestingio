<p>And of course the DeLorean had to hit 88.  Rather than change the script, they had to do some customization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>85mph, that was the mandated top speed for quite some time.  Even if your car could, &quot;bury the needle&quot;, it was only allowed to show up to 85mph in the USA.  Funnily enough, that was a catch phrase for sports car owners in the 1990s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm 85mph. I imported a 1980s Japanese car from the US to Germany last year.</p>
<p>As i was driving home on the Autobahn with it, i obviously put it to the test. Sadly the pin for resetting the trip-meter is directly at 85mph in the way, so i don't know if it would do a full circle back to zero without it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most cars can’t go to maximum revs in their top gear. I made it to 7000 in mine in 6th gear, I had 2000more to go but because of aerodynamic forces my car wouldn’t go faster. Most can’t top out because of a lack of power. </p>
<p>Many also have a speed governor. I think many German cars are limited to 155. If you read sports cars specs, it’ll say “electronically limited to...”. That’s not to say all German cars. Basically the computer feeds the engine fuel every other cycle when you hit a certain speed. It’s pretty scary when you don’t expect it. </p>
<p>Also, I haven’t done any of that in over a decade. Once was enough.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Interestingly, it was not mandated by the government. It was sort of a &quot;gentlemen agreement&quot;, just like how every Japanese cars in the 90s made 276 HP or less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Has nothing to do with government and more with insurance. All cars need to have 3rd party liability insurance in germany - usually 100 million €. Those insurance rates are heavily influenced by the top speed and power of the car. Above 250 km/h those not only rise but skyrocket like there is no tomorrow.</p>
<p>e.g. BMW 450 - 250 km/h around 1300€ per year, unlocked/Alpina &gt;3000. There are also special tires for above 250 - remember that every part in the EU NEEDS to be approved. </p>
<p>The real sports car manufacturers like ferrari simply do not care and assume that you have the mony for the car then for the other costs as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find it interesting that the Germans limit to 155 mph but the Italians say 'Meh, knock your socks off.' My Italian car's speedo goes upto 330kph and gets most of the way there. Its not like that happens often but it's nice to know how fast you're goingvwhen its not obvious and you can be quick.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Supposedly my new car has a 167mph limit but I haven't got the chance to go past 90 in it. My old car cruised at 110. 130 was guzzling alot of fuel n just to unsafe. I stick to 80-85 and 85+ for passing n getting away from distracted drivers.</p></div>		</li>
