			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah over here in Britain you don’t have to do your own taxes unless you’re self-employed or own a business. For everyone in normal jobs you just have it taken out of your pay and get a summary at the end of the year. It’s ridiculous the hoops Americans have to jump through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same with The Netherlands. Don't have stocks? Don't have a business? Don't have 4 employed partners or 25 adult children living at home? Ok, in that case, you don't have to pay anything extra!</p>
<p>edit: of course I meant that all taxes are already paid throughout the year and that, on tax day, it will say you don't have to pay anything on top of it :P haha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not 100% accurate, you're still forced to fill it in. It's just that everything is pre-filled, meaning if you have nothing weird going on you can just hit next,next,skip,skip,save. But it's still recommended to check everything with payslips.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an American living in the Netherlands.  My Dutch taxes take me about 30 minutes to do, and that's mostly because I cross-check every number, and also because I look stuff up to verify if I'm translating it correctly.  My American taxes (of which I owe nothing since I pay taxes in NL) take me a few hours.  My Dutch taxes are submitted online.  My American taxes still have to be mailed in.  :(.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  I literally stopped self-employment just before IR35.  As a mathematician, any kind of non-trivial tax law is ridiculously complex and inadequately described.  Just one box on the self-employed forms can be so ridiculous that you can spend a week looking up what you can and can't claim in that box, and how much, and what evidence is required.  </p>
<p>Sure, you can hand it over to an accountant but they only know it because they deal with so many people that they see the rejections, corrections, etc. and learn from filing thousands of returns.  The fact is that most of the taxation categories, exclusions, calculations, etc. are inscrutably complicated and often inconsistent in their application.  It really doesn't matter how much you ask for clarification in advance, either, HMRC basically are useless at trying to give you a definitive answer.</p>
<p>I used to just add up my income, put it in the income box, and deliberately not claim for travel, etc. because it just wasn't worth the time and effort and the risk of going wrong.  That made everything simpler and meant that I overestimated the amount of tax due at worst, so I shouldn't ever really have had a problem.</p>
<p>Still, in one year the HMRC decided that they'd extrapolate my earnings, apply some form of unrealistic exponential growth, inform me that they expected me to make some multiple of my previous income for the next year, wanted me to pre-pay that tax in advance, and would accept no evidence whatsoever to the contrary.  I was a consultant with 6 regular customers.  Those customers hadn't changed in years.  Prices had only risen by inflation, pretty much.  I wasn't about to change the prices or customers.  I had no time to take on new customers.  So my income was plateaued, predictable and provable.  They didn't give a shit.  They made me pay thousands in tax on account for the next year &quot;but they'd give it back if they were wrong&quot;.  Oh, by the way, you must pay that now or go to jail.  That meant scrambling for a hugely unexpected tax bill, in advance, that was way out of proportion to what I'd normally pay.</p>
<p>Guess what.  They were wrong.  And they merely refund the error, they don't provide interest on that money that they took from me for all the time until they were convinced that they were in error (which took over 2 years).</p>
<p>At that point, IR35 was about to come in and complicate matters even further, so I stopped being self-employed.  If I was to do it again, I'd just buy into an umbrella company like everyone else does now.  No way I want to deal with that stuff again.  The average person literally stands no chance of getting their return right, or being dealt with fairly.</p>
<p>So now the HMRC are clamping down on umbrella companies.</p>
<p>I deal with the finance/payroll systems at work, so I work closely with the people who have to do it for a living.  They all just push the figures into software and then HMRC applies what it thinks it should as a tax code.  They just changed my colleague's one without warning, because 2 years ago they gave him an unprompted, un-asked-for, out of the blue rebate on his tax.  He queried it at the time and they said that because of an error, he was due a rebate that he hadn't asked for.  Today they have now told him that was an error on their part so he needs to pay thousands back to them, and they want it now.  So they changed his tax code to recoup it, and he found out because his salary was less this month.</p>
<p>It's a mess, and it's designed so you can't predict the tax, mainly because they can't even give you a definitive answer about how much you owe themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My favourite was when our company was bought but somehow didn't inform HMRC in the correct manner so HMRC decided everyone had two such salaries and must therefore start paying the extra tax they had been not paying to date. First we knew was a new tax code and a lower pay check... well done everyone :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got my SA wrong one year. </p>
<p>The previous year I owed about £500 and I elected to pay it in my tax code. I forgot about that and couldn't find my tax code notice so I filled in £0 for the tax paid this year for a previous year. This meant that they owed me about £300 which they paid within a week. </p>
<p>Two weeks later they told me that I'd filled in that value incorrectly so I owed them £500 plus 10 months interest despite only having the money 2 weeks. This is because you technically pay your SA tax payment late as you only need to file it in January but the tax that you're paying is for the year ending the previous April.</p>
<p>Why do they ask you information that they already know?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regular jobs do just take it out of your paycheck. Most of the hoop jumping is filing for tax credits and exemptions. As long as you don't claim an excess number of exemptions on your employee withholding form you usually break even or get some money back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the main issue is regarding how difficult it's made to know your deductibles etc. In the Netherlands everything from travel expenses to tax benefits gets auto-filled by a government privided form. Extra deductibles are clearly stated and explained without having to resort to third party software or expansive knowledge on the subject.</p></div>		</li>
