			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but the improved grip in that case is not due to increased friction via water, but rather increased friction due to the &quot;pruning&quot; of the hands (increased surface area? I assume)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with Neusch22, the 'slightly better grip' is your skin's reaction (pruning), not because of moisture itself. More of a damn this moisture is making things slippery, I gotta prune up.</p>
<p>I use chalk when I climb rocks on walls, for more dryness / to counter sweat on my hands. Pretty sure moisture is no good for grip otherwise I would be using water when I climb rocks on walls instead considering water is cheaper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The one thing I use water for grip for is a little bit on the (suede?) bottom of ballet technique shoes, which helps them grip marley floors. Not so wet that there is actual water dripping off or anything though. Not exactly sure why that makes it less slippery though...</p></div>		</li>
