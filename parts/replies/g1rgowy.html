			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many aspects of neural function that are generally modeled as random processes, e.g neurotransmitter  vesicle release rates, which could be a good basis for randomness. (Computer RNGs are usually similar, you &quot;seed&quot; a pseudo-random function with entropy from a chaotic process, even mouse movements can be used. And we can prove that, up to a limit, pseudorandom numbers are indistinguishable from true random numbers)</p>
<p>And neural firing patterns always have a huge amount of random noise anyway, although the extent to which that &quot;noise&quot; is just due to computation we don't understand is an open question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By that logic nothing is truly random and the entire universe is a unbreakable chain of causal events stretching back to the Big Bang.  Did you truly decide what to have for breakfast this morning?</p>
<p>Pragmatically, lots of mechanisms (deck of cards, dice, computer, etc) can produce a suitable pseudo RNG.  Certainly a biological neural circuit can act as a “good enough” RNG to aid a fly by adding variation to its grid search for food and mates.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Exactly my point. Do you think it's that absurd?</p>
<p>Anyway, yeah, I don't doubt &quot;pseudo-RNG&quot; is good enough, was just wondering if it's pseudo, or actual randomness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that something can have an element randomness but not be suitable for cryptography, because it's not an RNG (random <em>number</em> generator). In nature you can find countless examples of things which consistently do x 99% of the time, then spuriously do y. Or maybe it does x 99 times in a row, then y 95. These would be terrible for cryptography, or anything else which needs a result that contains no discernible pattern.</p>
<p>As I understand it this is how pathways within the brain (and neural nets for that matter) work. Weights are adjusted affecting how likely a certain pathway is to be taken. And using this all manner of outputs can be generated, including some pretty random stuff. Though again, the outputs wouldn't work as an RNG. Not an expert though, just a lowly programmer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And regarding gnats (which seem a bit more chaotic in their flight than flies) if you've ever stood in a field during the summer you've probably had gnats swarm your head, or seen other people with gnats swarming their head. If you lift your arm and make your hand the highest point on your body, they'll go there instead.</p>
<p>Looked into it a while ago, and it's primarily because of the body heat and sweat/body oils attracting the gnats. Using any fruity scented shampoos will probably end up attracting more. There are even (aptly named) &quot;eye gnats&quot; that are known to specifically be attracted to fluid secreted from our eyes, which explains a lot of the &quot;head-hovering&quot; behavior. </p>
<p>It's ultimately for exactly those goals you mentioned. The smells means a possibility of food, and the moisture/heat means a possible place to lay eggs. The gnats just want to eat and have sex on your face. I suspect the same motivators drive the majority of a fly's pseudo-random flight behaviors.</p>
<p>And as a bonus gnat fact, they're pretty benign (just annoying) but have been known to cause/transmit conjunctivitis and pink eye after flying into people's eyes.</p>
<p>Not a gnat scientist, just a person who had to deal with gnats daily for a few summers.</p></div>		</li>
