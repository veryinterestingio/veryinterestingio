			<div class="markdown"><p>One extra note for readers: there's more than one type of melanin! Pheomelanin is reddish-yellow and is responsible for blonde and red hair (more pheomelanin = redder). Eumelanin is brown-black (more eumelanin = blacker). There's other types, like neuromelanin in the brain, but those two are the most common.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No pigment = blue, based solely of how light scatters on the iris. Pheomelanin = yellow, which mixes with the blue to produce green or hazel eyes. Eumelanin makes brown eyes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could be wrong but Im pretty sure pheomelanin is responsible for green eyes when its not very dense. Also that some people do have orange eyes contrary to the post. True amber isnt very common but Id say it classifies as orange.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen true amber eyes on two people. It literally looks like its namesake, amber (the gem) They weren't a coppery borderline hazel brown, but a vivid yellow-orange color which really contrasted with the limbal rings and flecks of black. <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b8/e4/c5/b8e4c5ad0e1cb61583b3774c4fde8cf3.jpg" target="_blank">It was quite literally like this CGI</a></p>
<p>Both of their eyes were absolutely mesmerizing, it was like looking into a portal into another dimension.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a few minor additions:</p>
<p>In mammals, melanin and related pigments only cause colors on the spectrum of black, brown, red, yellow and in total absence, white. Mammals have no blue or green pigments.</p>
<p>In the case of humans, eye color is due to several factors including the presence or absence of pigments and mutations of various genes that control the proteins that make up the stroma of the iris. Depending on the mutation, light is scattered differently by the three-dimensional structure of these proteins, in a process called Tyndall Scattering, similar to Raleigh Scattering, (ie why the sky appears blue) but not the same. Because this is a phenomenon dependant on the way light interacts with the physical structure of the stroma, blue, green, and grey eyes can seem to change colors depending on the amount and direction of light.</p>
<p>Blue irises have very little melanin, and a specific mutation of protein structure that scatters blue light, so they appear blue. Green eyes have a little yellow pigment, and a specific structural mutation. Likewise grey eyes have a structural mutation and a little brown and yellow pigment. Hazel eyes have the green mutation with a little brown pigment. Amber eyes have a little yellowish pigment, but no structural mutation. Brown eyes have varying amounts of brown pigment and no structural mutation. And finally red albino eyes have no melanin, but also lack the blue structural mutation of blue eyes, and appear red because of the blood vessels in the eyes.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neato! I was wondering about colour changing bit, mine don't do it much but my biological sister's eyes did vary a lot. But maybe she just had more variation in the clothes she wore. </p>
<p>What about colour changes over time? My mom's eyes were more blue when she was younger, but now they're definitely more grey.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In humans melanin production actually takes several years to get going. That's why many light skinned babies might have light hair at first, but it darkens over time. They actually have the mutation for more melanin (darker hair color), it just takes a while for the melanin-producing cells to fully appear.</p>
<p>Same with eye color. A baby might be born with both the melanin mutation and the &quot;blue&quot; structural protein mutation of the stroma, and since there is little melanin after birth, the irises appear blue. As the the baby grows up and melanin production ramps up, the eyes can then change color to darker blue, grey or even brown  because pigment-producing cells finally develop.</p>
<p>There is also heterochromia, when you have two different eye colors, but that's due to a number of additional mutations. But for acquired heterochromia, eye injuries or head trauma (like in the case of David Bowie) can lead to foreign bodies or tiny iron deposits from blood to cause the previously blue eye, to now appear brown.</p></div>		</li>

<p>ok that sounds bad but its not meant that way.  people from very homogenous societies often have theses changes because the parents are genetically close, but not close in brother/sister fashion, more from the same area close.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the explanation, it makes so much sense!</p>
<p>I saw men with violet eyes twice in 50 years. The sight is surreal. Based on your explanation, it looks like they have the blue-scattering mutation, but no other pigment at all? They were not albino though, I'm pretty sure I'd have remembered that. Both had mid-brown hair and fairly normal skin colour. Could the albinism be in the eyes only?</p></div>		</li>
