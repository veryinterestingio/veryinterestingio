			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair question!  The most commonly given explanation I've seen is that moths use celestial objects (such as the moon) as landmarks for navigational purposes, and get confused since artificial lights can easily be as bright or brighter.  This reasoning seems to be favoured by Mike Saunders at Penn State (<a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/141283/2008/10/20/research/probing-question-why-are-moths-attracted-light" target="_blank">source</a>), who also mentions that this explains why moths tend to circle lights rather than directly fly into them (which seems reasonably sensible, since presumably they are trying to navigate by keeping the normally &quot;stationary&quot; moon at a fixed angle).  There has been some research which backs this up, such as <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003347279900150" target="_blank">Sotthbandhu and Baker 1979</a> and also (the same) <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347287802142" target="_blank">Baker 1987</a>, which demonstrated that at least some moths are sensitive to magnetic fields in addition to using visual navigation.  For a slightly more recent and broad synthesis of this topic, <a href="https://www.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physiol.00046.2015" target="_blank">Warrant and Dacke 2016</a> looks pretty good too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think anyone's 100% sure on why they follow light. BUT the best explanation I've seen is that the moths navigate by the light of the moon. They mostly just fly towards the moon all night. This can help them cover a lot of ground in a night looking for food/mates/etc. but because the moon moves slowly in the sky this ultimately means the moth flies a big looping path that takes them more-or-less back to where they started come morning. </p>
<p>A light bulb throws a wrench in the works. Unlike the moon, the moth can actually reach the light bulb and collide with it. They either land on it and seems to be dazed, or the fly tight orbits around the light as they miss the bulb and turn back trying to line up a flight path.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do they actually fly <em>towards</em> the moon? Wouldn't one get the same observed behavior if they just pick a random angle relative to the moon and fly in that direction? If the angle is &lt; 90° away from the light source then the moth will end up flying in a spiral towards it, which I think matches what we see pretty well. If it picks an angle &gt; 90° away from it then it will move in a spiral <em>away</em> from the light source, which we would not notice since it wouldn't get close enough to the light.</p>
<p>Edit: I found this in <a href="http://zoo.unibas.ch/ebert/publications/papers/01_papers/2009_Altermatt_EntomolExApp.pdf" target="_blank">one of the references for the paper in question</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The two most plausible adaptive theories for the flight-to-light behavior are the <strong>light compass theory</strong> (Buddenbrook, 1937; Sotthibandhu &amp; Baker, 1979; Baker, 1987) and the open space theory (Mazochin-Porshnyakov, 1960, 1965).
The <strong>light compass theory</strong> states that nocturnal insects use celestial light sources,  such as the moon, for orientation. The moths adjust their flight direction in fixed angles relative to the moon in order to fly in a straight line. Because of the moons’ large distance from earth, the emitted light rays are about parallel. In contrast, light rays emitted from an artificial light source close to the observer are divergent. Approaching insects erroneously take them as parallel and orient their flight direction constantly in the same angle to the light rays. Thereby they circle spirally around the artificial light source and approach it.
The <strong>open space theory</strong> assumes that nocturnal insects fly to open space, which is suitable for their activities. Open space such as clearings in or boarders of a forest is brighter at night due to moon or starlight. The theory states that insects fly straight to artificial light sources and erroneously take it as open space.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mechanism I described corresponds to the light compass hypothesis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't that they fly toward the moon or the sun, but that they use those light sources as a navigational marker. If their intended direction of travel involves keeping <em>source of light</em> on their 2 O'clock, then they will circle a light and spiral inwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually super interesting, like, that means that in heavily light polluted areas, the insects less attached to artificial light are the ones surviving and mating and having offspring.</p>
<p>It makes sense too, since spiders are also more likely to build their webs around a light source, since it basically guarantees them a steady food source.</p>
<p>I noticed on my porch, the spiders that hang out used to just plop their webs down at any convenient corner, but after some months, almost all the ones on our porch are parked around the light, and they have gotten huuuge!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have noticed nighthawks circling light fixtures, vacuuming up bugs. Whether this is learned adaptation or becoming genetic is impossible to tell. Birds are pretty smart, likely they are learning it from other birds.</p></div>		</li>
