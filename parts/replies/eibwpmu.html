			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how young and to what extent you mean drinking, but theoretically alcohol could have some impact on height, although genetics play a far larger role. Muscle-wise it depends on what you mean by fully developed... Puberty is essentially the stage at which boys can begin putting on muscle, but to what extent they have muscles can be influenced well into adulthood based on diet and training.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think u/coralto was asking: if alcohol inhibits the release of testosterone, and testosterone is important to pubescent boys' bodily development, does that mean drinking can cause boys to stay permanently underdeveloped - not in the muscular sense, but in the bodily sexual maturation sense? As in, your body didn't get enough testosterone in those critical years, so now you're kinda screwed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As time went on and my addiction got more serious, I stopped eating very much and became fairly malnourished, and this led to my losing weight.</p></div>		</li>
