<p>so if it just went in order it would have it's electron configuration as 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 2d^2</p>

<p>There is no 2d subshell, 3d is the lowest of the d-subshells. Therefore this example would fill 3s^2 instead </p>

<p>Is that begging the question &quot;why is there a 3d subshell, but no 2d?&quot;?.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Each principal quantum number (n) increase adds another &quot;type&quot; of subshell. So n=1 only has s orbitals. n=2 has s and p orbitals. n=3 has s, p, and d orbitals. n=4 has s, p, d, and f orbitals. There are higher energy levels but no orbitals past f are filled naturally. The reason we have 3d orbitals filling up after 4s orbitals, for example, is because usually it is more energetically favorable to fill up the 4s orbitals first. I.e. they're at a lower energy level overall even though the principal quantum number is higher.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you know how I said there are these other quantum numbers which can only be in certain ranges? That's basically what determines what subshells are allowed. There is no 2d subshell because the quantum numbers don't stretch that far when n is equal to 2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>For example it's more favourable to have a full higher subshell than a half full lower one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's true, but it turns out that an EXACTLY half-full shell is generally slightly favored over slightly less or slightly more full.  Chromium is a good example with [Ar] 3d^(5) 4s^(1).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's the interesting thing. All of the subshell-filling rules are good as a rule of thumb but they break down as the orbitals get larger and more complex. You'll see many <a href="https://www.chemguide.co.uk/atoms/properties/3d4sproblem.html" target="_blank">transition elements that fill their subshells in a slightly odd order</a> because the energies between one &quot;slot&quot; and another are so close. In fact, the environment can affect which one fills over the other - adding in a magnetic field, changing ligands, or other environmental factors can change how the subshells fill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed.  I can't find it right now, but I know I've read speculation (since this isn't yet testable) that the shell concept itself is starting to break down as we reach Oganesson (element 118) and beyond.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how many electrons, or more like what the n of a given element should be, to theoretically fill any given layer with more then 18 electrons?</p>
<p>Absurd hard math question ;)? But seriously, I did remember that I did calculated electron energy on subshells somewhere sometime long ago, but it does seem beyond what I can do at the moment unfortunately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are examples, someone's already given you platinum and there'll be a bunch of others, but in general you'd have to do the maths and it's not easy maths. There's a lot of interplay between the various effects and it's the sort of thing you throw at a supercomputer for a while.</p></div>		</li>
