			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer. Adult shampoo should be acidic (low pH) in order to close the cuticle. If you use a baby shampoo which is higher pH, it won't clean as well and it'll leave your hair static-y and prone to breakage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all true, and well known to fiber artists. </p>
<p>Wool (hair of sheep) becomes soft, full of body and less itchy when washed and rinsed in acidulated water. The cuticles relax and lie parallel to the length of the yarn. </p>
<p>Sweaters washed in plain water are prickly—because the pointy cuticles stand up and point outward—ready to skewer delicate skin. Just like frizzy hair, the yarn will be rough and unmanageable.</p></div>		</li>
