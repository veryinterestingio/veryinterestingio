			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: one of the main causes of death in elephants is dental deterioration. They get six sets of teeth in their lifetime, and when the last one wears out (typically at age 60-70) they're done. It's been said that we don't really know how long elephants <em>could</em> live if their teeth didn't give in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sooo... having veterinary dentist for Elephants would decrease their death rate? At least by old age.</p>
<p>Maybe also make a big hubbub about &quot;poisoning&quot; elephants with substances that don't do anything to them, but reverse the positive effects of the &quot;traditional&quot; medicines. There would still be a problem of poaching for the niceness of the ivory, but systematically take the true tusks, and substitute those with something that doesn't harm the animal and does not look nice at all...</p>
<p>Probably too big of an undertaking, but a man can dream. Also destroy the taken ivory, just to spite the trade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is done with rhino horns in some places. They sedate the rhino and cut the horn way down so that they are no longer considered valuable to poachers. I'm not sure on the practicalities of doing the same thing with elephants.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Some places do this, too. Kenya is best known for it - they pile tonnes of ivory up in pyramids and set it on fire. It's a powerful message but quite heartbreaking when you think of the elephants behind it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You missed the point entirely.  The point is that it's not about humans keeping healthy teeth until they are 60, it's that very few other mammals with teeth like ours live until 60, most don't live to be 20.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've recently found out about a guy who has lived his entire life in the Vietnamese jungles with his father. Let me tell you, he has absolutely horrendous teeth. I highly doubt he would be having such a bad dental health even living in civilization, eating sugary meals and never brushing his teeth. So my question is, what the hell caused it? Were all of our ancestors teeth like that?</p>
<p>EDIT: Here is a link of the guy I was talking about.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bacteria and ingesting a lot of sugar.  He was eating fruits as a primary source of diet according to the article.  He would most likely still have the same dental health eating a high sugar diet without brushing his teeth.  My brother's teeth are almost just as bad because he had poor oral hygiene as a child because he refused to brush his teeth.  </p>

<p>If you actually look at a skull of a caveman prior to agriculture becoming a thing, you would notice that the teeth are in near-perfect condition.   If you look at the teeth of a person when people started farming and cooking their food, then you begin to see cavities and gum disease popping up.  Oral hygiene was also a thing back then.  Sticks were used to pick in-between the teeth and toothbrushes   </p>
