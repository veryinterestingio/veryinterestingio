IIRC, when Greeceâ€™s economy was struggling in 2013, part of the issue related to Greece still allowing bearer bonds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Registration is different from payable to bearer. Registration involves telling the issuer who the owner is before negotiation. You don't have to register a check, but it is not payable to bearer. It is payable to the payee, and the payee has to indorse the check for it to be payable to someone else.</p></div>		</li>
