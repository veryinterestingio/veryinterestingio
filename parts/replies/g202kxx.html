			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually not. The International Maritime Organization says “International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea: “A master of a ship at sea, which is in a position to be able to provide assistance on receiving a signal from any source that persons are in distress at sea, is bound to proceed with all speed to their assistance.”</p>
<p>The Coast Guards and Navy’s of the world also put life above rescue costs. Don’t expect them to help you take any property home. If they come to get you you’re leaving with the clothes on your back and a passport, if you have one. You may be responsible for the costs of removing your vessel if it’s in an environmentally sensitive area. That would be up to the country you ship wrecked in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That said, I believe the USCG has sued people for expenses if they had to rescue people due to gross negligence- like intentionally sailing into a hurricane for the lulz (yeah, some people are that dumb).</p>
<p>EDIT: TIL the USCG is more tolerant of stupidity than I am.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FWIW, the <em>second</em> time they rescued a particular Florida Man who'd been <a href="https://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2016/04/25/a-florida-man-was-rescued-and-fined-140k-after-trying-to-ride-a-bubble-to-the-bahamas" target="_blank">attempting to ride a giant hamster ball to the Bahamas</a>, they warned him if he tried a third time he'd be arrested and fined. But they're pretty tolerant of 1-time errors in judgement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only time I've heard of the USCG recouping costs was due to a hoax. They will cover the costs of a rescue even if sailing in to a hurricane. A replica of the HMS Bounty sank during Hurricane Sandy when the Captain thought he could get far enough offshore. There was a civil lawsuit by the family of a crew member who died but no mention of recouping the rescue costs.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely relevant but vaguely related.  I watched a British TV show the other day with a young kid (16/17) who climbed a coastal rock formation, slipped and broke his leg with the tide coming in.  Ended up with the air ambulance coming out and then the coastguard helicopter was needed to rescue him.  </p>
<p>He wasn't charged but he vowed to do charity events until he'd raised the money several thousand £s his rescue cost</p></div>		</li>
