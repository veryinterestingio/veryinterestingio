			<div class="markdown"><p>I had probably less than 5 headaches in my life - then I met my wife. She's had them so bad she has been on the ground, sobbing, asking me to 'knock her out', swearing she won't tell a soul, hovering over the toilet wanting to puke.</p>
<p>Now that I'm getting older, I get migraines sometimes - but they're a walk int he park comparatively. My heart breaks for you folks who get them to the point of debilitation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can relate to your wife.  I've picked my spot to end it many times.  Let, I found a great therapist who put me onto Eastern medicine, ie. yoga and Tai chi.  The pain stays but my mind is much stronger.  I hope your wife finds relief soon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had these too some time back. Even Ipobrufen wasn't working. I took so many, my pee turned black, then I stopped taking them., But I totally relate with the desire to be knocked out when the pain persists. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't get headaches often...but when I do, it's just like ur wife. I feel dizzy, sick and like my head is gonna explode all at the same time! I find getting in a cold shower helps me a little, then I go right to bed and struggle to fall asleep because of how much pain im in. When I wake up it's always gone. Luckily this only happens maybe 3 times a year. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to get one once a month, and it would be random at anytime, mostly in the morning when I woke up though, but in the last 2 years I stopped getting them as frequently and overall I feel better but it just makes that migraine feel even worse when I get cause I have no tolerance</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I ask a somewhat related question? Why do neurologists' offices always use fluorescent lighting with weak covers if people with epilepsy and migraines are sensitive to them? It seems counterintuitive. I usually leave my neuro's office with a budding migraine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>once I was looking in the mirror feeling fine, then looked into the bright lamp to my left, in about 10 seconds my entire peripheral vision goes blurry, fast forward 10 minutes im feeling slightly sick and a tinge of headache, I put it down to dehydration, in half a hour im in a full blown migraine, can't look at light, can barely stand, can't focus or think, only thing I could do was shower to create steam cause heat and steam on my skin makes my migraine better, but alas like all migrants I ended up emptying it up, but yeah I had my worse migraine ever cause I loose into a lamp</p></div>		</li>
