			<div class="markdown"><p>Even on a rogue planet it wouldn't happen. In the ideal gas model, each molecule of gas is essentially unaware of the other gas molecules around it. Real gasses aren't exactly ideal, but they're pretty close. One of the consequences of this is that different types of gasses readily mix, and do not separate on their own.</p>
<p>Gravity causes gas molecules to spend more time lower to the ground. In aggregate, for an atmosphere consisting of a single gas this results in the density decreasing exponentially with altitude (with some math you can show that this is the lowest energy state). The rate of this exponential function depends on the atomic weight of the gas. When you have an atmosphere containing a mixture of gasses, then because of the ideal gas property the density of each gas is the same exponential curve, as if the other gasses did not exist. Since each gas has a different exponential curve you can get a partial separation, where lighter gasses are relatively more common at higher altitudes and denser gasses relatively more common at low altitudes. However all gasses will still be found at all altitudes, and all gasses will be more abundant in an absolute sense at low altitudes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, I know some amount of stuff about ideal gas and this rings true. But that would also mean that light gases such as hydrogen and helium would not climb to the top of the atmosphere and be skimmed off by solar wind as soon as they are released. However, we're having a sort of Helium crisis because of this very phenomenon. We have a finited amount of helium on earth, and everyone we use it for party balloons or silly voices, it's like venting it into space.</p>
<p>Are you saying that I've been lied to?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gasses above a certain atmosphere do get skimmed off. Because helium is very light, it much more easily rises to the top of the atmosphere. This is why, after billions of years of this process, there is very little helium on Earth. The important thing is that this is not because the heavier gasses force it to the top, even if there were no other gasses on Earth helium would still dissipate at the same rate due to solar winds in the upper atmosphere. Other gasses also dissipate in the same manner, it just takes much much longer, to the point that it is a negligible process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some do. CO2 snows off at space temp. But not hydrogen and helium and a bunch others. Those would stay in the atmosphere and, unless I'm mistaken, stratify by order of mass density.</p>
<p>Edit: I <em>was</em> mistaken. Gases don't stratify. The remaining gases would mix.</p></div>		</li>
