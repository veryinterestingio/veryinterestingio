			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. However, interestingly, a bone marrow graft for something like leukaemia from an identical twin is practically useless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you elaborate? </p>
<p>I thought a bone marrow graft is more about replacing the immune system after it’s been destroyed with radiation. </p>
<p>In fact, autologous bone marrow transplants (“stem cell transplants”) are a treatment for leukemia in some cases, although it’s hard to remove all the cancer cells. An identical twin without cancer would solve this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes - this is called a syngeneic transplant when the donor is the recipient's identical twin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A transplant from an identical twin causes no graft versus host disease. That could be good, except the goal of most transplants is something called the graft versus leukemia affect. The idea is that the donor's cells attack the cancer. You don't get this with an identical twin transplant, so it doesn't really treat the cancer very well. As such, these transplants are not done.</p>
<p>However, there are cases when an identical twin transplants are done. This is in the case of someone needing a transplant for non-cancer reasons. Sometimes people's bone marrow just stops working for unclear reasons that are not inherited. In this case, you just want to fix the bone marrow and don't want a graft versus leukemia effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Donor lymphocyte infusion can theoretically be done from any donor, provided the lymphocytes are alive. Heavily simplifying, one could say a lymphocyte donation is a highly purified and manipulated blood donation. That being said, I am not familiar with any occurrences of lymphocytes being harvested upon death. For one, a lymphocyte transfusion requires a pretty extensive evaluation to minimize the risk of graft v host disease. Practically speaking, that is much easier to do when the donor is, well, alive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can only get donor lymphocyte infusion from the person who donated their stem cells. If you received donor lymphocytes from someone unrelated who didn't donate the stem cells (dead or alive), you'd develop a devastating disease called graft versus host disease when their lymphocytes would attack your body.</p></div>		</li>
