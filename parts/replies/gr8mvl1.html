<p>when you study the mathematics that physics is built upon, it treats time exactly like a 4th dimension of space</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That isn't true. They are closely related in relativity (in that everything has a constant velocity that is divided in some proportion between time and space), but in general time is treated differently than space in physics. That's why our familiar spacetime model is called &quot;3+1 dimensions&quot; and not simply &quot;4 dimensions&quot;. Time <em>isn't</em> just another spatial dimension.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you have any good sources to read on the topic to (even if not find an answer) at least gain a better understanding on the topic. It's a question that's been on my mind for a while</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PBS Space Time put out a number of videos recently about the nature of time and why it seems special amongst the dimensions. At a certain point questions about time are more philosophical than scientific but the videos should give you a better understanding of the scientific side of it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two fun reads are &quot;The Timemachine&quot; by H.G. Wells which is an early science fiction novel depicting a mechanical understanding of time, basically the development of a time &quot;car&quot; that moves in time like a Subaru moves in space. </p>
<p>&quot;Flatland&quot; by Edwin Abbott is another fun short read that it's a sort of nerdy short story that tries to explain the concepts of experiencing life in various dimensions.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe" target="_blank">With regards to entropy I suggest you go down a wiki-rabbit-hole with this -</a></p></div>		</li>
