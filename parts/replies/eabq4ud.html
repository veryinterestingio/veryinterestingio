			<div class="markdown"><p>It looks like there were a couple of species that were semi-domesticated, or at least kept by people that went extinct. The Arabian Ostrich and the Bubal Hartebeest are the only two examples I can really find. Otherwise, it looks like the Fuegian dog is the only real example of an species that was fully domesticated and went extinct.</p></div>		</li>

The dogs were kept on an island separate from the other type of hunting/companion dog and farmed for their fur, which was weaved into blankets. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's definitely an extinct species, as modern cattle are considered to be a separate species. Kinda interesting. Domesticated aurochs became cows over thousands of years. Wild aurochs died out. So idk if that would count for the purposes of this post.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, the Fuegian <em>peoples</em> were genocided in only 80 years after meeting whites, so the domesticated Fuegian fox's disappearance was largely an extension of that.</p></div>		</li>
