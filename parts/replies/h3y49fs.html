<p>Which it wont be : the salinity disruption of the Atlantic conveyor current that warms europe will shut down the conditions that perpetuate it.</p>
<p>So, paradoxically, global warming will bring Moscow levels of cold winters to the coast of western europe.</p>
<p>Nice mathematical theory, but tenuous connection to the reality of the situation. ðŸ˜‰</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wrote a paper on climate change a while back. Specifically climate change denial, or more accurately, anthropogenic climate change denial. </p>
<p>One of the few academic sources I could find against anthropogenic climate change said that there is a proposed feedback loop between oceanic and atmospheric CO2. The idea is as following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Earth has CO2 in atmosphere that captures heat</li>
<li>Heat in atmosphere raises temperature of ocean</li>
<li>Higher ocean temp means more CO2 off gassing</li>
<li>More off gassing means more atmospheric CO2</li>
<li>Cycle repeats in feedback</li>
</ul>
<p>While this approach fails to address why we haven't seen this feedback in the past, it also fails to account for the partial pressure of CO2 in the atmosphere. If the partial pressure of CO2 in the atmosphere increases, it will increase ocean acidification as CO2 is dissolved into the ocean. The fact of the matter is, the huge atmospheric concentration of CO2 is dissolving into the ocean faster than the ocean is warming, meaning acidification is happening faster than off gassing (of course this is a simplification).</p>
<p>At the detriment of our marine life, the ocean is probably one of the best carbon sinks this planet has. Maybe if there were some other mechanism driving global warming, and not the same CO2 that is being dissolved into the ocean, then the increase in ocean temperatures might decrease ocean acidification. But as it stands, we are not only choking the planet in greenhouse gasses, we are also acidifying our oceans with the same act.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heh I have a question about Climate Change and the denial. The Unitedâ€™s States have cut the green house gases by quite a bit. I would say in the last 20 years, has there been an improvement? It seems it was changing to the worst. Is what mankind (my mistake humankind) doing not working? We doing it wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CO2 is accidic. When air with CO2 has contact with the ocean, it becomes carbonated like you have carbonated drinks. Those are acidic and so is that water that came.in contact with the air containing (more) CO2. This is only a general explanation, I'm sure some can give a far better explanation</p></div>		</li>
