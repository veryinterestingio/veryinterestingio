<p>In fact a helicopter HAS landed and taken off again from the summit of Everest:

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read an article basically complaining that the challenge of Everest is being ruined by private helicopter rescue services popping up in the area. I doubt they can rescue someone from the summit yet, but certain machines can now reach altitudes that were pretty recently impossible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. In my language fluid and thin is only used for liquids. The only gas where you say thin is when talking about air in a non scientific context.</p></div>		</li>
