<p>But that doesn't mean chameleons don't also use it for camouflage. It's not like they have no filter and they're just a permanent walking billboard flashing their moods even when there's no one to talk to. Some chameleons even adjust their colour to better evade specific predators. Ie. birds and mammals see differently and these chameleons will shift to hide better in the colour spectrum of a nearby predator.</p>
<p>And colour shifting for heat management is also chameleons do often. Darker colours for more heat absorption and lighter colours to reflect heat.</p>
<p>As for the octopus, it's already been demonstrated that octopuses and cuttlefish make mistakes in their colour reproduction when tricked. When faced with bright contrasting colours that look the same in grayscale due to similar colour intensity, octopuses don't differentiate and turn a single flat shade rather than a pattern. The pattern is effectively invisible to them.</p>
<p>And even though they have full control over their colours, they sometimes involuntarily shift colour as well. Cuttlefish often flash distinct colours and patterns when they catch prey. As far as we can tell, it's an involuntarily emotional outburst. Something like happiness over catching food briefly interfering with their ability to stay hidden.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have owned many many chameleons and I have seen both many many times.</p>
<p>I lived in Africa, in different countries, for 18 years, and have kept about 40 chameleons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Octopi have only one type of light receptor in their eye, so they are indeed colorblind, but it is theoretised that their extremely wide and oddly shaped pupils may maximize an effect called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration" target="_blank">chromatic abberation</a>, giving them a way to actually obtain information about color with only one type of receptor. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>While “octopi” has become popular in modern usage, it’s wrong. The letter “i” as a suffix to indicate a plural noun only applies to words with Latin roots, like “<a href="https://www.grammar-monster.com/plurals/plural_of_cactus.htm" target="_blank">cacti” for more than one cactus.</a> But <a href="https://qz.com/1095491/humans-had-to-evolve-to-acknowledge-octopus-consciousness/" target="_blank">octopus is derived from Greek</a>, so the proper pluralization in this case <a href="https://scrabble.wonderhowto.com/news/octopus-conundrum-octopuses-vs-octopi-vs-octopodes-0123668/" target="_blank">would be “odes”</a> if it was ever used. However, this particular word happens to employ a classic English formulation, and affixing a simple “es” at the end of octopus will do, according to <a href="https://stevenpinker.com/publications/words-and-rules" target="_blank">grammar experts</a>.</p>
