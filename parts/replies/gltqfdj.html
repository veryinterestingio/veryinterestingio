			<div class="markdown"><p>This is both a policy and a science question.</p>
<p>The WHO and other international health-related humanitarian agencies have an incentive to get vaccines to everyone, as unvaccinated populations will become reservoirs for COVID (and eventually, mutant strains that will be resistant to the current vaccines that are available).</p>
<p>Here's the sad truth about North Korea; North Korea is notorious for abusing humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>(I've said this almost-verbatim on other threads but I'll say it again here.)</p>
<p>During the 1990s North Korean Famine, NK hoarded humanitarian aid for &quot;Core&quot; and &quot;Favored Classes&quot; (regime-loyalists) and withheld it from &quot;Wavering&quot; and &quot;Hostile Classes&quot; (everyone the Kim Regime designated as &quot;disloyal&quot; or &quot;undesirable&quot;).</p>
<p>They even went so far as to deny access to regions with large &quot;Wavering&quot;/&quot;Hostile&quot; populations to foreign humanitarian workers.</p>
<p>For more details, read &quot;Famine in North Korea&quot; by Steph Haggard and Marcus Noland, which is the definitive history of that period and the destructive policies that led to it.</p>
<p>There has been no sign of contrition at all from the Kim Regime for its behavior during that period nor any significant sign that it has changed its ways for the better (as far as I know).</p>
<p>North Korea is very likely to receive free vaccines (most likely from foreign aid donors, especially <em>South</em> Korea as part of its current peace and reconciliation effort).</p>
<p>However, it's very likely NK will hoard it for its &quot;Core&quot;/&quot;Favored&quot; population and deny it to its most marginalized and vulnerable population again (just like they have with past humanitarian efforts). If that is the case, that population will become a reservoir for COVID and for future mutant variants.</p>
<p>If new vaccines can't be developed for those variants, it may (grotesquely) become necessary to <em>assist</em> the Kim Regime in isolating and containing that population of North Koreans (even more so than they already are).</p>
<p>That is the grim and perverse reality of COVID in North Korea. I honestly can't see a positive outcome to this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>North Korea is extremely isolated, with citizens requiring a special permit just to travel to a different city. The totalitarian system makes it incredibly easy to isolate people, and you don't need to worry about the economic effects or accidentally starving an entire town once you ignore that pesky &quot;human rights&quot; thing. I think that the NK claim that there's zero cases might actually be accurate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not as much as one may think. As a BR Myers has said, <em>&quot;Pure coercion is not only a huge technological challenge for a state to engage in. Economically, it's also an enormous burden. North Korea simply doesn't have the money for it.&quot;</em></p>
<p><a href="https://keia.org/podcasts/rebroadcast-the-cleanest-race-an-interview-with-author-b-r-myers/" target="_blank">https://keia.org/podcasts/rebroadcast-the-cleanest-race-an-interview-with-author-b-r-myers/</a></p>
<p>A massive Orwellian police state does not come cheap. Police and border guards need to be <em>paid,</em> and prison camps need to be <em>paid-for.</em></p>
<p>But the regime spends so much money on the military and on luxury goods for the leadership that there's barely any money left for the police and border guards afterwards.</p>
<p>As a result, they're very easy to bribe (as they're often as poor and hungry as ordinary North Koreans are). They often let people sneak across the border into China for a cut of the food and money they bring back.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/7_ArWCRXH8Y" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/7_ArWCRXH8Y</a></p>
<p>(I've seen videos of North Korean soldiers helping people cross the border into China and covering their tracks afterwards.)</p>
<p>Simply put, North Korea cannot police its people to same extent that it used to for the exact same reason it cannot provide for them either; they broke.</p>
<p>While this is good in <em>some</em> ways (it means the Kim Regime can no longer repress its people as brutally as it used to), it also means they lack the capacity to enforce a strict quarantine. </p>
<p>It makes sense to think North Korea might actually be COVID-free if they actually were able to keep their country on lockdown as thoroughly as they are often perceived. But that's simply not what NK is like anymore; North Korea hasn't been able to maintain &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; (in the political/economic sense of that word) for decades.</p>
<p>Either way, there are serious moral and ethical questions to helping a regime like North Korea's battle COVID. There's little guarantee that the regime will allow help to reach NK's neediest and most vulnerable citizens, and giving straight direct assistance to the North Korean state could make NKs health/medical inequality even worse.</p>
<p>(It often has.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not it's a moral question.  The one that no one is asking is why is the vaccine the intellectual property of a couple of pharmaceutical companies when the whole world helped pay for its research.  We can look down on nk all we want but the fact that this vaccine is not public domain and being produced for the people that already paid for it is the real travesty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure I'm even allowed to post a top level comment, but my background educationally is Political Science, with a specialty in East Asian Politics (and Early American Political Theory!)</p>
<p>Anyway, to hijack your comment the answer to the original question is basically, &quot;we don't know.&quot;</p>
<p>DRPK will likely be able to secure doses of the Russian vaccine, or Chinese versions of the vaccines, or eventually even international doses through these proxies over time.</p>
<p>I have no medical training at all, but I would guess that COVID19 isn't really that bad in DPRK simply due to the lack of... anything. There aren't clubs, there aren't big tourist destinations. People die all the time anyway, so this is just one more thing. I imagine people tend to stay away from each other and wear marks in rural DPRK like we see in parts of China...</p>
<p>edit: North Koreans may also be the test subjects for certain, 'home brew' vaccines. Really wouldn't surprise me if China or Russia weren't using DPRK migrants for this purpose. Lots of YT videos on the types of camps like this that exist.</p>
<p>e2: there very much may be precautions going on in country where markets are more spread out, etc. I'm not at all trying to suggest COVID hasn't worked it's way through their society but I would suspect (if I had to bet, horrible thing to say) it wouldn't be as endemic as cities like NY, Paris, etc., simply because there are less cities, and less bars, restaurants, etc. In the end this will be a semi-unstudiable subject, I suppose. People will be given drugs, and may have already been given drugs. Over time as the pandemic is contained internationally it will be interesting to see if COVID remains persistent in countries like DPRK (or Burma, East Timor, etc.) or whether it will remain in vectors in more industrialized countries like China, Brazil, or the US.</p></div>		</li>
