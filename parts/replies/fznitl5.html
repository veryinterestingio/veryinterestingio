			<div class="markdown"><p>Not being predetermined as weaker but instead it makes the plate weaker as it moves over the plume.</p>
<p>It uses a weakness to make it to the surface and releases pressure then once the plate moves far enough that it can’t exploit that weakness anymore it slowly builds up pressure again until it fractures the plate creating a weakness and releases the pressure once more.</p></div>		</li>
