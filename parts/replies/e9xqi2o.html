			<div class="markdown"><p>This is totally wrong. The word colloid describes a suspension of mutually insoluble things.  It can be a liquid/liquid or a solid/liquid and can have any viscosity. Milk, for example, is a colloid with low viscosity.  So the term colloid is incorrectly used in your definition. The correct answer to OPs question is that there really isn't a singular definition for when viscosity is high enough to be a solid. For example, window glass seems pretty damn solid, but does have a measurable viscosity (it's very very high).  A better definition of solid vs fluid is when there is an observable discontinuity in something like a phase transition.  There isn't a continuum of viscosity as ice melts (it is either a solid or a liquid a given point) so we can confidently describe when it is each phase.  For complex mixtures like peanut butter, there are likely different components with different transition temperatures, so it won't be as &quot;sharp&quot; of a transition. But at some point, the continuous phase (the fat) will soften enough and it will start to look more liquid.  </p>
