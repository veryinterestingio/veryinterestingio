<p>One of the challenges is dealing with burnout. Let's face it, done right fitness is exertion ... exertion takes effort.</p>
<p>Cumpulsive folk [with their own set of issues] seem to cope.</p>
<p>For us mortals it's important to mix it up, cycling, running, swimming, gym...cycling/running different routes, terrains, surfaces...alone and with companion.</p>
<p>My passion is cycling. I have three different bikes with different geometries. I cycle roads, lanes, paths, and tracks ... blacktop, gravel, dirt ... mountains, flats, streamsides. </p>
<p>Even at that I get to the &quot;BUGGER THIS!&quot; point and have to do something different. </p>
<p>At 70, one [of two] of my biggest live lessons is &quot;Move Or Die&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>48 and have had ADHD all my life, only diagnosed in my late 20s. Have tried drugs on and off but never stay on them.. they only help so much in my opinion.  It has mellowed as I've gotten older, and while it's still a pain in the ass I basically have many hobbies going that I can bounce between when one starts to get dull and I need to put it on the back burner for a while.  Exercise helps a lot.  I got into bodybuilding, boxing/heavy cardio and it's really made a difference that is hard to exactly pin down but... for example before I would pass by something that needed to be done, and was likely easy to do but instead would just &quot;Meh, I'll do it later...&quot; Now I'm the type to stop and do what needs to be done right then.  Crappy example, but again it's hard to pin it down. I suspect the exercise has altered my brain structure away from sedentary infront of a PC most of the time to being highly active.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m 35 and my ADD is so bad. I hope mine mellows as I get older. I should try working out. It’s just hard to find time with managing a household. I used to play video games. It made me so happy. But I’ve found that I find it boring now. Which semi breaks my heart because I used to be good at them. So now I have a million different hobbies; sewing, gardening, aquariums, etc etc that I get into too many and can’t manage them all. It’s just cruddy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I'm in my early 20s and I exercise frequently. It didn't do fuck all for my ADHD lol. I literally have to swallow many different supplements (Lion's Mane, L-Theanine, Caffeine, Creatine, etc.) just so I can start my workout and finish it till the end. I still can't concentrate on anything for more than 5 minutes, and the pomodoro technique has been completely useless for me. Even when anxiety takes over, I do the reverse - I study for 5 mintues, and fuck around for 25 minutes. And repeat... </p>
<p>That being said, I have been diagnosed with OCD, Aspergers and Anxiety but never ADHD. I still have an extremely strong feeling that I have it. I just relate to so many of the symptoms, even though I have been told by a psych that I don't have ADHD &quot;because it's normal to not be concentrated on things that don't interest you&quot;. Luckily, I have an appointment with a psychiatrist next month so hopefully I can finally find the right medication, treatment or whatever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah I've been able to get back into gaming a little :) I just cant go on the week long stimulant-fueled gaming bender, which is really a good thing. But I sometimes miss those lol</p>
<p>When I was first recovering, playing Ni no Kuni for the first time really brought me back from the brink and gave me hope that I could enjoy gaming again in a more healthy way. </p>
<p>It's not a &quot;find the right game&quot; thing though. Anhedonia 100% a function of my recovery from abusing stimulants, and also one way I experience my depression.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stay strong brother, it gets better in time. I went through the same thing with amphetamines and games (league was my kryptonite). Got off them two years ago after experiencing heart palpitations and was worried I'd developed hobbies that I only enjoyed on stimulants. That was false, but it did take me a few months to get over the numbness. </p>
<p>I definitely get less random stuff done now and go through cycles of having my shit together and then letting myself go, but I don't regret getting off of stims (even if I crave the feeling from time to time).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might be worth talking to your doctor about taking a break :/ I remember feeling exactly like you did, afraid to stop because I was so dysfunctional without it.</p>
<p>What I can tell you is you'll never quite be as focused or engaged with things like gaming ever again, but if you ever felt like before you started stims, you were somehow more in touch with your emotions and childhood memories and feelings of nostalgia, that's what came back for me, and while it isnt as short term awesome feelgood immediate gratification, it feels good in a slower more rewarding way.</p>
<p>Dont get me wrong cus I still crave it all the time and wonder if I'd be better off with the meds as long as I used as prescribed. But idk</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh hi, are you me?</p>
<p>I feel like a part of this is I'm really really good at learning the basics of stuff, and just kinda average at anything beyond that. So everything has basically a 90° bend in the learning curve. My suggestion is pick something that you can practically see yourself doing long term and stick with getting good at that, even though it's gonna suck for a bit. You'll have time to go back to other things later.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I like videogames, but I'm unable to play a videogame more than 100h, for me it's  unimaginable to play something for 1000h or 2000h like some people do.</p>
<p>The same applies to my work field. I love to do new stuff, but when working on something for a lot of month, I usually get tired of it very quickly.</p></div>		</li>
