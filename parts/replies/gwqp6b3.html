			<div class="markdown"><p>My cat did something like that. He was always terrified of going out side but he was getting old and sick. One day, towards the end, he ran past me outside and stopped on the porch. I put my stuff down and when I went back to the door he by the wood line, about 300 feet away. I called to him and he just stood there looking at me. I went and got him and thought he must know itâ€™s time to go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my experience cats will <em>absolutely</em> do this.</p>
<p>I've had four <strong>very</strong> old cats (all indoor/outdoor) disappear when they were nearly dead.</p>
<p>Was only able to put one down, though I'm not certain it was a better end of life than those that chose to wander off and die...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happened with my Springer Spaniel right before she died of cancer. But instead of completely disappearing we found her. In complete contrast to her normal affectionate and attention-loving nature, she retreated deeper into her hiding place when we found her and did everything she could to avoid us. All the while shaking like she was terrified. I've heard it suggested that dogs do this before they die because their pack-mates are so loyal they might stay near the body to the point of endangering themselves. So dying dogs attempt to hide from anyone they care about so as not to harm them by dying.</p></div>		</li>
