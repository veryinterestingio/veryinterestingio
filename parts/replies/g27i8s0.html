These vast quantities of water ice are somewhat easy to detect with current facilities. Still, the detection of lower abundances would depend on several factors, including the object's distance, excitation mechanisms, and other factors. We even use different techniques to observe these different mechanisms. Did you know that ground and space-based observatories have allowed us to better understand the composition of atmospheres and surfaces of planets, moons, and other icy bodies? Still, if your kid's backyard pool would be on one of Jupiter's moons, we would likely not detect it from Earth-bound telescopes. But hey! <a href="https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/news/nasa-scientists-confirm-water-vapor-on-europa/" target="_blank">We were able to detect enough water</a> releasing from Europa (5,202 pounds, or 2,360 kilograms, per second) to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool within minutes ;) - Lucas</p></div>		</li>
