			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that there isn't money in it, but bringing a new drug to market can take 10 years of development (unless you're a COVID-19 vaccine, of course), with an average upfront cost of <a href="http://phrma-docs.phrma.org/sites/default/files/pdf/rd_brochure_022307.pdf" target="_blank">$2.6 billion</a>. Promising investigational drugs, including anti-cancer therapies, are abandoned all the time for this reason.</p>
<p>Obviously there are reasons for the extreme prudence due to incidents like thalidomide, but the pharma industry is very much hamstrung by regulation which has resulted in pharma companies preferring to jack up prices on their existing product lines rather than develop new ones. We've also seen the public almost lose their minds over a negligible number of blood clots from the COVID-19 vaccine, so a lot of companies simply don't want the PR hit if a trial goes wrong. Many modern drugs, including Aspirin, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/07/no-refills/308133/" target="_blank">probably would not pass today's regulatory hurdles</a>.</p></div>		</li>

Assuming companies aren't selling bunk product (always possible with expensive research chem), it doesn't seem to work that well in humans.</p>
<p>Bodybuilder Bostin Loyd also claims it put him in stage 5 kidney failure (though I'm somewhat skeptical it was the whole cause, steroids aren't great for your kidneys either)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>EDIT: The point was also that there is evidence that the body has a regulatory mechanism to determine where fat is burned, it's not random. I'm not arguing that it should be an exogenous drug.</p>
<p>Almost everything you see on those sites is of poor quality or outright fake. Not saying someone couldn't make it, because making peptides with rDNA or even <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2017/automated-manufacturing-fast-peptide-synthesis-drugs-0227" target="_blank">a machine</a> is very possible now, but I highly doubt a non-CGMP/FDA approved site would sell high quality peptide drugs OTC at anything close to affordable prices. There's a lot of RnD associated with getting proper syntheses pipelines set up; even if they're trying to make a legit product, I doubt they're assaying for quality. Misfolded proteins can also make people very sick. And as you mentioned, I'd take health pointers from heavy AAS users as a grain of salt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for actually addressing the question. OP asked how the body decides, not what the result of that decision is. Most of the replies here seem to be answering something else.</p></div>		</li>
