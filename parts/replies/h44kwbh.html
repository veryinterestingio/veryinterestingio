			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this! I had a look in the Dermatone chart and a lot makes sense. I think at least the one I'm having is due to many years of poor posture. I will definitely study it up, very interesting to know the workings of your own body</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll also add to his response as a PT, that RSIs usually involve tendons and ligaments - tissues that take a longer time to recover from exercise and activity than muscles do. Recent studies are showing that after tendons and ligaments experience resistance exercises, they'll actually degrade for about 24-36 hours, then rebuild between 36-72 hours.</p>
<p>Repetitive injuries tend to occur because these tissues aren't given enough time to recover and strengthen before being exposed to the repetitive stress again - leading to pain, and degeneration.</p>
<p>Muscles on the other hand recover, generally, within 24-48 hours, and can adapt to recover quicker than that given the right build up and adaptation times.</p>
<p>&quot;Poor&quot; mechanics more centrally, i.e. weaknesses from the core, spine, and hips can, and often do contribute to the build up of RSIs, because poor mechanics do overload these tissues, creating the above problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on the person. Strength work is clearly important, but trying to reduce the spinal restriction and making sure your neck and back postures improve during the day should also be placed along side it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I asked a chiropractor years ago if repetitive use injuries are from muscle imbalances, he seemed to agree with the idea, meaning that if you can deadlift a car but can only do a couple situps your going to be in trouble. There's also the thing in the weight lifting community that if you want to bench more you need to work on your back strength. Everything works together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with almost everything here except for the concept of dermatomes.  Dermatomes are controlling sensory input for those areas not motor function or movement. So to say elbows, wrists, hands and forearms hurt due to that I believe is wrong.
If you want to say a herniated disc in the cervical spine is to blame then that makes more sense for any arm pain. Or maybe even a nerve entrapment in the brachial plexus or thoracic outlet syndrome.
All in all this answer is the closest though.</p></div>		</li>
