This leads to <a href="http://www.biologydiscussion.com/blood/blood-circulation-time/blood-circulation-time-definition-and-importance-humans-biology/81635" target="_blank">Blood Circulation Time</a>, which depends on where your your start and end points are.  So I guess you could use naloxone effect onset to measure nose-to-brain circulation time!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes â€” <em>nearly</em> instant, think within 60 seconds max for it to take effect and be noticeable. This also depends on dosing though, as some patients will need higher amounts.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's something important to say for anyone who knows an addict and may be reading this. Get some naloxone from the pharmacy (some places even offer courses for certification), and if someone ODs, keep hitting them with naloxone until they wake up. Sometimes one, or even two, three doses aren't enough.</p></div>		</li>
