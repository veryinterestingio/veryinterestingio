			<div class="markdown"><p>So you know how elements absorb different wavelengths of light? So when you look at the spectrum of light from a star you observe black lines at set frequencies which correspond to some element. Well, since the star is spinning one side of the star is moving towards us and the other is moving away. This causes the absorption line to be Doppler shifted (if you have heard of red shift then this is the same idea) in the frequency spectrum. It essentially broadens the absorption line and from this we can estimate the rotation rate (caveat is we do not know the inclination and so we have a factor of sin i in there. The observers of this object have reduced this error, not sure exactly how but my guess the presence of the disc has been used)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So cool. Thank you.</p>
<p>It’s so amazing to me how far science has come in so short a time.</p>
<p>Like Galileo was almost killed for saying the earth revolves around the sun, not that long ago!</p>
<p>And now we can tell how fast a random distant star is spinning by looking at the wavelengths of light. </p>
<p>Science is awesome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can also measure periodic change in brightness from stars due to sunspots traveling over the near face of stars. This method isn't as dependant on the sin i term, just the amplitude of signal reduces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doppler effect. If you look at a spectral line then if it was stationary then that line would be very narrow (typically). If you start rotating that star, then that line would get wider and wider due to the side going away from you shifting the light ever so slightly to longer wavelengths, and the side coming towards you shifting the light to shorter wavelengths. So if you look at the whole star at once (which we typically do, hence your “point of light” statement) then we see a broadened line. How broad it is can tell us how fast it’s spinning, because... physics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stars aren’t uniform, so each angle of viewing a star produces a unique spectrum of light. Waiting for the original spectrum comes around again measures one rotation.</p>
<p>Edit: u/teejermiester does a better job of explaining below. While the spectra can change during a rotation, the rotational speed is calculated by measuring the Doppler shift in the ends of the spectrum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. The spectrum of a star will be fairly uniform when spin is accounted for.</p>
<p>Objects that are moving away from us are redshifted, and the spectra of objects that are moving towards us will be blueshifted. If you look at either end of a star, one side will be redshifted by some amount and the other side will be blueshifted by some amount. Comparing these values with the radius of the star lets you find how quickly it is rotating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you certain? Everyone else is saying they measured the doppler shift &quot;band,&quot; which would match the fact that we have an edge velocity instead of a rotation frequency, which is what your method suggests.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Welcome to astrophysics. We dont mess about with our naming conventions!</p>
<p>Black hole - its black and its kinda like a hole</p>
<p>Pulsar - produces a pulsing signal</p>
<p>Massive fails - stars that should have gone supernova but dont quite do it</p>
<p>FLOPS - free floating planets (rogue planets)</p>
<p>Hot Jupiter - its like jupiter but close to its star.. so its kinda hot</p>
<p>Hot Neptune... Hot Super earth... </p>
<p>Super Earth - a big earth</p>
<p>edit - I should have really also added that it is not actually called Very Fast Turning Star. Credit to /u/Dr_Bombinator for highlighting this!</p>
<p>&quot;The name VFTS102 refers to the VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey made using the Fibre Large Array Multi Element Spectrograph (FLAMES) on ESO’s Very Large Telescope.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Saturn is the most oblate</p>

<p>to add to this, Saturn is 60,000km around the equator and 54,000km around the polars.</p>
<p>i.e. its 'height' is 90% its 'width'. Earth's ratio is 99.7%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually much more oblate than I would have assumed. Is that directly because of it's rotational velocity or is it because of it's rings and moons pulling on it?</p></div>		</li>
