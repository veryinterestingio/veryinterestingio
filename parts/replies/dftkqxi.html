			<div class="markdown"><p>I first heard about this shortly after they found the surviving population on Ball's Pyramid, every couple years I come across an update like this, and it never ceases to be fascinating.</p>
<p>There's just so many interesting angles to take in.  Ball's Pyramid itself seems like something straight out of fiction. Then you have this one bush hosting the entire surviving population of giant these insects, and the intrepid scientists scaling the pyramid in the dark too try to find them. Then you have the bush narrowly avoiding destruction via rockslide while a plan is being hashed out. Then you have the actual captive breeding program which at first seemed to be in real trouble before becoming a fairly significant success. And the story's still not over.  Will there be a rat eradication/insect reintroduction program on Lord Howe Island?  By the next time I stumble across this story, maybe we'll know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you're reading above is about 5+ years old, there is actually a 2016 article on the rat eradication plan <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/09/trouble-in-paradise-lord-howe-island-divided-over-plan-to-exterminate-rats" target="_blank">here</a>. It looks like it still hasn't happened, but a referendum voted on by the villagers shows 48% against. The article has quite a bit of information about both sides of the debate, and it seems both sides have reasonable concerns. One quote from the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will be the first permanently populated island that will have this treatment. The very first. Weâ€™ll be the guinea pigs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The treatment referred to above is to airdrop 42 tons of poisoned cereal across the whole island.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question: Has anyone actually gone back to Ball's Pyramid and maybe, planted some more bushes? Seems foolish to allow the only non-captive population of these insects to be in a position where they could be wiped out by a stray rock (especially since they thought it had already happened at one point).</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;She went from being on her back curled up in my hand, almost as good as dead, to being up and walking around within a couple of hours.&quot;</p>
<p>Pretty amazing. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if it is so long because it ends up stretching itself so much to get through such a tiny hole. You'd have thought evolution would have done better than that struggle, what's with the sticky shit aswell? Aren't most birthing fluids about ease of passing and getting out? Bizarre. Fascinating but bizarre. </p></div>		</li>

<p>We need to stamp out this misconception that evolution is in any way &quot;directed&quot; towards &quot;improvement&quot;, or that it has an inherent teleological drive. It doesn't. </p>
<p>Random mutations that cause phenotypic differences are acted upon by selection pressures. Those mutations which contribute to increased fitness are generally selected for. Those that aren't, are selected against. This does not, however, mean that maladaptations will disappear or that the most optimal adaptations will (1) be present or (2) be ubiquitous.</p>
<p>Biology is massively imperfect. We need to understand this.</p></div>		</li>

We're now aware of two living species right now.  Several other Lazarus taxons have similar stories.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The coelacanth has survived relatively unchanged since the end Cretaceous extinction event. Mammals hadn't even become the dominant class when Coelacanths evolved. </p>
<p>Humans weren't even close to evolving.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>It truly is. <a href="http://www.dinofish.com/discoa.htm" target="_blank">The actual story of the discovery is mind boggling as well</a>. It was pure blind luck favoring the prepared mind. Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer was invited to take whatever she wished from the by-catch of the Fishing trawler &quot;Nerine&quot; once it was at dock. And under a bunch of rather mudane stuff she found this jaw-dropping huge silver &amp; lavander fish which just looked weird &amp; striking. She took it away to the lab, and found that it <em>really looked a lot</em> like our ancestral group of fish, believed to have been extinct for a few hundred million years ... </p></div>		</li>
