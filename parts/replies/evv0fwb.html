			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what happened to me. Dad's side has tiny jaws, mom's side has large-ish teeth. </p>
<p>Half of their kids have <em>perfect</em> teeth. The other half, myself included, would have eventually wound up in excruciating pain from years of biting on misaligned teeth. I had extensive orthodontic work. My brother did not. He's only 30 and has already developed jaw arthritis and a cracked tooth.</p>
<p>He and I even had crooked baby teeth. Not enough jaw for <em>baby</em> teeth. There was never any hope for us lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I was wondering. I understand the science of how teeth can become crooked from child to adult but it always made me wonder how the human body is genetically programmed for this sort of situation. It led me to wondering if our ancient, prehistoric ancestors had the same problems. It made me think that if you were a hunter-gather who would have needed a fairly healthy mouthful of good straight teeth, it would make life harder if not impossible if you had crooked teeth. </p>
<p>Now I'm wondering how the changes in our behaviour as a civilization has affected how our teeth grow over the past 10-20,000 years. </p>
<p>Did people have crooked teeth as hunter-gatherers? How about when people lived during the agricultural revolution? When we started living in cities? 2,000 years ago during the time of Christ/Romans? 1,000 years ago when food was still fairly simple? 100 years ago when we started highly processing food? </p>
<p>The biggest change in all of this was not our genetics because that takes hundreds or thousands of years to change .... the biggest change was in our society and civilization. We changed our world, our bodies stayed the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have a source for this info? I've never heard of jaws getting wider based on your diet as a child. </p>
<p>Evolution of humans has seen a narrowing of the jaw, which is likely due to a shift in diet to cooked foods, then to domesticated foods. However, I haven't heard of this happening in the lifespan of a person. </p>
<p>The bone of the jaw can become more thick if you have bad bruxism or have Ortho treatment, which can lead to formation of buccal exostoses. That's all I've heard tbh.</p></div>		</li>
