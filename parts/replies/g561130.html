			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the exception is for those of us who suffer from &quot;sleep maintenance insomnia.&quot; I'm an early riser and a morning person, but sometimes it can happen to a fault: I'll actually wake up at like 4 am (after going to bed at 10 pm) and feeling great, really just disappointed that I'm actually meant to continue sleeping (as I'd rather be on my morning bike ride and eating my beloved bagel!). But if I actually accepted that and did indeed begin my day at 4 am, I'd end up feeling like shit and underslept (very different feeling than &quot;tired&quot;) all day. Much better to try to go back to sleep and get an additional sleep cycle in and wake up at 6 am or so.</p></div>		</li>
