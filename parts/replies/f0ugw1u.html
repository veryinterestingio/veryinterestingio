			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not a &quot;solved problem&quot;. It's a huge problem with huge amount's of infrastructure required. Not to mention it's a global problem with no global standard. If US companies were to suddenly block &quot;unverified callerID&quot; you'd basically prevent all US phones from calling outside the US or receiving calls from outside the US.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't have to block unverified caller ID, they just have to mark those calls as unverified calls originating outside the US. If you're a legitimate company calling across borders, you can sign your own caller ID. </p>
<p>Endpoints aside, the infrastructure already exists, in support of TLS.</p>
<p>Give the telephone companies a one year grace period, after which they're liable for the 300 dollar fine for robocalls they can't track upstream. Magically the problem will disappear.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes you could attach a TLS certificate to every phone number, but now you need to build a system that handles that, replacing infrastructure country wide. They'll take that 300 dollar fine per call as it'll be cheaper than replacing literally everything they've installed in the past several decades.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Frankly I would love that option. I would never use my phone to call outside of the US, id use an app. And I never receive calls from outside the US. Iâ€™m guessing there are more people like me, than different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm confused, if its a money issue, why aren't companies promoting that they can trace calls and block them as a service?  I bet some people would jump on this, I'd happily switch over to a company that does this instead of just letting it run rampant.  And if they want money, I could see myself paying a small fee to have numbers traced and blocked.  It seems the telcoms are simply lazy or uncreative when they could be making money off something people really want</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue is that both ends have to be covered for it to work, being able to check a signature doesn't help if you still get unsigned calls from legitimate sources.</p></div>		</li>
