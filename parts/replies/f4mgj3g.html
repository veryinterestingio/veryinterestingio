			<div class="markdown"><p>The first space walls were done quickly, and the astronauts became exhausted (not an easy feat given their fitness). The slow approach developed out of that. There's a great documentary, that covers that and a lot of things like it. I'm pretty sure this is the one, I haven't watched it in about a decade.

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer. Some science museums have a demo arm or something where you can stick your arm in it and it pressurizes. It is hard as hell to move that thing around.</p></div>		</li>
