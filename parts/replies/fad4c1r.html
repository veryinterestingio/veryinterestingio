			<div class="markdown"><p>Short term consequences were minimal. He didn't even know it was broken. He went to the doctor for neck pain and they found a cracked vertebra, which was attributed to the chiropractor because he had sustained no trauma and the timing fit. </p>
<p>The long term consequences have been devastating. Despite having spent 56 years as a construction worker and upstanding citizen, he became a degenerate opiate addict. I remember him as one of the strongest people I ever knew. He's a shell of his former self.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really sad. My dad broke his back at 16 and then did construction for 30 years. His back is absolutely wrecked, the worse case any of the doctors and surgeons he's consulted with have ever seen. 24/7 pain for the last 6 years or so. Hes been strong though and although he takes opiates when the pain is too much, addiction has not gotten him.  Recently getting his medical marijuana card has helped tremendously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad also has spent the last 40+ years in the construction industry, and his neck is an absolute wreck. I’ve been thankful that he’s tough as nails and doesn’t take opiates, but I’m extra thankful now.    </p>
<p>I’m sorry for your father, opiates are the devil.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This shit happens too regularly for people to say &quot;let them die&quot; when it comes to using Narcan on overdose victims. My dad broke his back twice in the coal mines of WV, and he became an addict. Luckily we were too poor and the medicine wasn't really available in our area in the 80s, so he had to settle for extreme amount of alcohol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all are bad. I started having lower back pain and pain in my leg. Went to the chiro after trying my stuff for a pulled muscle that didn't work. Found out my hips were out of alignment on xray. 4 months later the pain is gone and I go once a month to keep things aligned. Should likely be able to drop to 4-6 weeks. Know what a regular doctor would have done? Referred me to a chiropractor hopefully because no fucking way back surgery would have a better choice.</p></div>		</li>
