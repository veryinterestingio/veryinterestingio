<p>There have been studies utilising what’s called geometric framework analysis which show that humans eat to satisfy their protein requirement - so you will keep on eating until you have the protein your body needs, regardless of the carbohydrates and fats (and hence energy) that come with it.</p>

<p>I'm going to paraphrase what some IFBB Bodybuilder said, &quot;Have you ever heard somebody say 'OMG I can't believe that I binged and ate 18 chicken breasts?' No. Your body tells you to stop eating once you've had enough protein.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And here I thought it was because protein sources don't spike your blood sugar like other foods. I have binged on nuts before, but usually feel pretty full afterwards and the rest of my day is usually pretty healthy if I ate 500 calories worth of nuts.</p>
<p>To be fair tho, you also don't hear people talking about how they binged and ate excessive amounts of fruits or vegetables (18 apples, or 18 heads of lettuce, etc) My thought is that it could be more around how processed the food is, and that unprocessed foods are better at signaling to your body when you've had enough.</p>
<p>Edit: I stand corrected, everyone apparently eats 5 lbs of fruit or vegetables once they get started.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since an average adult male's protein requirement is around 56 grams per day, are you saying if someone eats roughly 200 calories of protein they won't be hungry for 24 hours? That seems completely at odds with what we see people doing. They don't just eat a single meal and then not be hungry for an entire day.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-protein-per-day" target="_blank">This website</a> also says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The DRI (Dietary Reference Intake) is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, or 0.36 grams per pound.</p>
<p>This amounts to:</p>
<p>*56 grams per day for the average sedentary man.</p>
<p>*46 grams per day for the average sedentary woman.</p>

<p>It then says that amount is minimum not optimal, but there is a source for the number used by Nayr747.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Literally every countries' nutrition recommendations say that. That's also the highest RDI. If you're a woman, a kid, etc it's let than that. Companies have really been effective at marketing tons of protein to people to make a buck off their ignorance of nutrition. If you're working out you'd need more, but for the average person you actually don't need much protein.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No</p>
<p>If all you ate was 56g of protein, your body would probably use it for energy, so you wouldn’t be meeting your protein requirement. I get this seems like you are eating to fill your energy requirement (which you do) but hitting that energy requirement doesn’t stop you eating more, whereas hitting the protein requirement probably will.</p>
<p>If you ate a single meal with carbs and fat and 56 g of protein, your body most likely wouldn’t utilise all of it (the limit is generally recognised as 25-35g of protein per meal).</p>
<p>And I honestly consider that the survival threshold for protein consumption - if you engage in physical activity of almost any sort, or want some healthy muscle mass, I would suggest at least doubling that (if not limited by any health conditions)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're lifting weights of course you'll need more. But if you're not then excess protein won't just build muscle on its own. It will be converted to body fat. And since protein has the exact same calories as sugar it's not exactly a good thing to eat too much of it if you're not exercising.</p></div>		</li>
