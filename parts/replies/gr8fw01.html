			<div class="markdown"><p>The other thing was that bikes from that era had &quot;tires&quot; that were just a strip of leather attached to an iron hoop. The ride on a conventional bike so equipped was rather harsh, leading to early attempts being nicknamed &quot;bone shakers&quot;.  A large diameter wheel could flex and could ride over minor imperfections leading to a ride that was at least somewhat comfortable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you explain more about the big wheel design? I get the part where it goes further per rotation, but I can only imagine it works take a ton more work to make it rotate since it's so big. I would think a smaller wheel would take less energy and be more comfortable</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's too big yes, but if you had a modern bike that was direct drive it would be way too slow.  Useful if you need to bike up a 45 degree incline, but not much else.  The wheel size was a reasonable balance between speed and power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern fixed-gear bikes use a large, 44-tooth chainwheel on the pedal crank, driving a small, 16-tooth sprocket. With this sprocket ratio, one complete revolution of the pedals turns the wheel 2.75 times. </p>
<p>Typical tires are 70cm diameter, which is ~220cm circumference.  220cm * 2.75 = 605cm of travel per revolution of the pedals.  </p>
<p>If we enlarge the wheel to 605cm circumference and attach the pedals directly to the wheel instead of through a chain, one rotation of the pedals would give us 605cm of travel.</p>
<p>That 605cm-circumference wheel would be about 192cm in diameter; about 6.25 feet. </p>
<p><strong>tl;dr: A modern fixed-gear bike is roughly the equivalent of a penny-farthing with a 6'3&quot; drive wheel.</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer imo. Bicycle gearing is more about gear inches, than simple ratios. With a modern bike, you’re using the formula (teethFrontRing/teethRearCog)wheelDiameter = Value. On a penny farthing, you remove the gears, so it’s just wheelDiameter = Value</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the big wheel thing is also for ergonomics. I don't know anything about the history of penny farthing bicycles, but I assume either nobody had thought of a sprocket and chain design, or maybe it would make the bikes too complicated/expensive. but if direct drive is a given, then the big wheel makes the most sense ergonomically. The radius of the big wheel is only a little shorter than the rider's inseam so that they could comfortably extend their leg to the longest part of the pedal's travel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did a quick google and the chain and sprocket as we know it was invented around the same time as the penny farthing. So they might have simply not been that common.</p>
<p>My real guess is it's mostly a cost thing. If you think about it, with no modern machinery, a chain is a very labor intensive thing to make. Combine that with the need for a large wheel to smooth out the ride, what is the benefit of adding a chain and sprocket? Since these were the first bikes it's not like they &quot;looked wrong&quot; like they do to us, there was no frame of reference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to look at the design in the context of manufacturing capability. They started showing up around the same time as the idea of interchange parts. Before mass production. Making gears and chains would have been challenging. It’s not like the concepts didn’t exist, but making them would have been very impractical. A chain drive bicycle would have taken a skilled craftsman quite awhile to make.</p></div>		</li>
