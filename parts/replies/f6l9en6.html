			<div class="markdown"><p>ELI3? Here goes:</p>
<p>Things feel cold when heat goes byebye! But it's very hard for heat to go byebye into the air because air is grumpy and doesn't like to touch other stuff. So anything that has lots of little air pockets stops heat from going byebye! Rocks and water don't have as many air pockets so heat goes byebye really fast. Like super fast. Like super super fast. I bet you can't run as fast as heat can. Go show me how fast you can run around the yard so I can drink my grown up juice in peace and quiet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I question. Why can bring covered in a furry blanket still feel warmer than example an insulated plastic (or some other material)
Both trap heat from leaving and will probably make you equally warm. Is it just placebo feeling?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically an insulated plastic has voids inside the material, so even if in the long run their thermal coefficients were identical, in the short run the solid exterior of the plastic would take heat from your skin. After a couple minutes, once the exterior closest to you was your skin temperature and heat was now leaving through the voids in the center of the plastic, they would feel pretty much the same.</p></div>		</li>
