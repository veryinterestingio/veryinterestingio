			<div class="markdown"><p>Also some of those TV breakthroughs 20 years ago saved my dad five years ago. It was guaranteed odds, but for his specific cancer he took the &quot;breakthrough&quot; treatment which did nothing for 70% of participants 20 years ago, but he was the 30% or whatever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My aunt was diagnosed with cancer from a previous breast cancer episode having gone into her cerebral spinal fluid. They gave her 3 months to live back in april but they started her out on an experimental medication. No one had any hope but she is still alive to this day so that medication might have worked. Shes weak, but her quality of life has improved where she went for an assisted walk into town for a manicure and hair cut.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Scientist: &quot;Hey, this treatment for a very specific type of cancer shows 50% better results than our old one, under these very specific conditions.&quot;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Media: &quot;CURE FOR CANCER FOUND! (maybe*...)&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This x 1000. Lack of good science reporting leads to this sort of click bait all the damn time. The cure is a decades long slog progressing by millimeters as the science chips away at the problem. Not a sexy headline.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not that cancer needs that much attention, but generally true for other scientific discoveries, ex stuff space-related.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always take anecdotes over foreign 'facts' that people cant show me. I beleive am organization helps people when I see people who have better lives than an organization who just says they do. I know how corporate (and military) evaluations are just ovrrhypes of what people actually accomplish.</p>
<p>Like Publishers Clearinghouse. Someone supposedly wins a million dollars all the time. Still havent even heard of someone who even knows someone who lived in a city where this happened.</p></div>		</li>
