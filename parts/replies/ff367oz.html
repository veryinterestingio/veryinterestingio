			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve noticed when I’ve used teeth whiteners, whatever chemicals are in the whiteners actually will subtly break down calculus on my teeth. When I floss next, some pieces will break off, not completely, but I think there is something in the whiteners that helps break down the calculus. Just my .02</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I have a follow up question. I saw in the video posted in the top comments to brush my teeth twice a day. Well, usually I can't stand staying without brushing it after eating, so I i'm always with a brush in my car, bag, etc, and I ends up brushing them 4-7 times every day. Is this okay?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely not ok. You don't want to brush within about a 45 minute window after eating, or you're brushing weakened/demineralized tooth structure. The abrasives in toothpaste make this even worse, so you're doing far more harm than good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would you say it's better to brush first thing in the morning, then eat breakfast, or eat then brush 45mins after?</p>
<p>What if you're not able to brush 45 mins after eating (commute to work, or at work, etc) what's the best option then?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of good information here -- thanks! Got a couple followup questions, if I may:</p>
<p>Am I correct that a person's diet will affect their salivary pH? If so, what foods would tend to raise salivary pH?</p>
<p>When you say that &quot;it&quot; makes your teeth more sensitive to cold, are you saying that calculus buildup does this?</p></div>		</li>

<ul>
<li>No, this is incorrect. You can't willfully alter your systemic pH with dietary intake. Your body works pretty hard to keep your pH at a constant level. The idea that you can somehow alter this process, or make your body more &quot;alkaline&quot; is a fallacy not supported by any science that I'm aware of.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you say that &quot;it&quot; makes your teeth more sensitive to cold, are you saying that calculus buildup does this?</p>
<ul>
<li>No, using tartar control toothpaste prevents calcium deposits from forming in dentin tubules, which means more sensitive/responsive teeth. If anything calculus prevents this even further, which is why many people often have very cold sensitive teeth temporarily after getting excessive calculus removed.</li>
