			<div class="markdown"><p>Definite merit. Paleontology has trends just like any field. In the middle of last century, there was a trend for a lot of things to be oversplit, and that included mistaking different ontogenetic stages (stages of development through an individual's lifetime) for different species. One of the clades I study, <em>Lystrosaurus</em>, was a victim of that. There were several dozen species named, and now we're down to four in Gondwana. I've looked at the Chinese <em>Lystrosaurus</em> and reduced that number as well in an SVP abstract, but haven't published it yet. I'll actually be hopping back on that paper when I return from Australia to push it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just as an aside, and from an amateur's perspective, I assume we find fewer baby dinosaur fossils because if a baby dies it gets eaten â€“ maybe even by its mother, soft bones and all (just as adult birds eat their own eggs to reabsorb the precious nutrients) whereas if the baby survives to adulthood its bones are slightly less likely to disappear due to their indigestibility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Partially. It has more to do with inherent preservation potential. Tiny bones are more fragile, and therefore more likely to break and be ground into unrecognizeable fragments and dust. But certainly, a lot of baby animals do get eaten, and any that make it into a predator or scavenger's stomach are going to be made more fragile by stomach acid.</p></div>		</li>
