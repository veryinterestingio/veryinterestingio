<p>The body also has limited tools to communicate with other organs. Serotonin affects mood in the brain but also appetite and digestion in your digestive system. Some of the side effects from drugs increasing or decreasing one hormone is due to the body reusing the hormone for many functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a way it also brings to mind the idea of changing the brain in specific areas related to mood, versus changing the amount of ambient serotonin. If we have a set amount of the hormone in our body, then we could adjust our head's receptors to more appropriately handle mood based on that.  </p>
<p>If you had too little and this lead to a lower mood, maybe you could amplify the signal from the serotonin receptors themselves so that fewer are needed for a bigger cascading effect or high.  </p>
<p>And if you had too much, you could do the reverse. But all of that requires being able to change the brain in such a way, which we can't do, yet. And restructuring our brains would make some raise questions on whether it is moral to commit what amounts to mind control (even though interfering with hormones is exactly attempted mind control, anyway.)  </p>
<p>This would avoid the possibility of side-effects related to a serotonin bath causing receptors elsewhere to get flooded when you don't want that.  </p>
<p>It's interesting how the brain can even use these hormones with more specificity than people can when they take pills. Either way we're a long way off a build-a-brain convention.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation. I learned a lot from your comment - The analogy about sugar makes it really easy to understand!</p>
<p>I hate to be that person but I have to point something out. As a student of addictions and mental health I’ve learned that there is a common misunderstanding - physical dependence does not equal addiction. Addiction is a behavioural disorder that involves craving, compulsive engagement, and relapse, despite negative consequences. Physical dependence is only sometimes a part of it, and does not equal addiction, as addictions do not require substance misuse to trigger the same release of dopamine in the brain’s reward system that is characteristic of addiction. </p>
<p>For example: I have a physical dependence upon my mirtazapine. But I am not preoccupied with when I am going to get my next dose, and taking it does not cause any negative effects in my life.
I could have an addiction to sex but not have a physical dependence.</p>
<p>I get that no harm was intended - you may have just been simplifying it in a way... but one issue that fuels stigma is just a lack of understanding and felt a need to clarify for people who might not know! :)</p></div>		</li>
