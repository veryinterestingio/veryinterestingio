<p>Edit: I think this was what she used when she first qualified &quot;Goldmann Applanation Tonometer - Wikipedia&quot; <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldmann_Applanation_Tonometer" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldmann_Applanation_Tonometer</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, no, that is still a modern option for tonometry; it is the most accurate but also the most risky, since it makes the most contact with the cornea of all the tonometry options and requires anesthetic drops to numb the eye before the procedure. </p>
<p>The air puff (“non-contact tonometry”) is fastest, easiest, and safest — except maybe less safe now due to COVID, since you can get COVID infections in the eye. I’d wonder if that would push a significant amount of the virus airborne from an infected patient. </p>
<p>Goldmann is the gold standard for accuracy but takes longer and requires a skilled practitioner, where you can train a new tech to use the air puff machine in two minutes, or a tonopen in 5 to 10 minutes, and get results from either within 60 seconds. </p>
<p>So of course most doctor’s offices will go for the faster, cheaper, “good enough in most cases” option and choose Goldmann only if necessary... but you’ll see the device in the slit lamp (as linked by the above poster) ready to use when needed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Unless like my husband your issue is a cornea erosion; when the air puff hit his eye, I heard his scream in the waiting room.</p></div>		</li>
