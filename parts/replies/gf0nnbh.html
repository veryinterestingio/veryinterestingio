			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a lot of anxiety as well, although my mattress is super cheap.  Once I can settle down enough to get into bed, the only thing I’ve found that makes me fall asleep in minutes is to name the ABCs.  </p>
<p>Pick a general topic (cars, fruits, plants, baby names, cities, etc)  and name things alphabetically in that topic. Asparagus, Beets, Carrots... Acura, Bentley, Carolla... and so on until Z.  If you can’t thing of a thing for one letter, skip it and move on, this isn’t a test, it doesn’t matter.  Don’t dwell on anything, just move on to the next letter.  If you get to Z, then pick another topic and start again with A.  I’ve struggled with sleep issues my entire life, and the ABCs are the only way I can fall asleep reliably.  I rarely make it past M, but don’t feel bad if it takes you a couple alphabet cycles to pass out.  Yes its so freaky it works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I start naming the characters from TV shows and the actors who played them.  (And I hate it when I can't remember someone's real or part name.)  It's just mindless, keeps me from focusing on things out of my control (like a thing that happened back in 1985 that probably only I remember or else the other person is probably dead by now).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't ever focus on naming or counting, so I make up stories.</p>
<p>Usually I start with action to distract my brain (aliens invading earth!), then I calm down to something really sorta boring (one of the aliens is good and has a long, in-depth conversation with a human about how his culture feels about different colors of shoes), then finally gets as sleepy as possible (the alien is now very tired and wants to take a nap. The government finds him the comfiest bed every to exist, which must be imagined in extensive detail.)</p>
<p>Usually I'm asleep by that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve had anxiety rankin from very low level to o coughed while swallowing cereal so now I vomit my breakfast. It’s about using the associations your mind has to your advantage. Your bed applies a pressure to sleep while a couch has no pressure. There are ways round this but  I’m currently and bed and don’t wanna write too long. Ask if you want more otherwise good luck</p></div>		</li>
