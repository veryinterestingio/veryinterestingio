			<div class="markdown"><p>There are signaling factors that tell them to differentiate. Like off the top of my head I think the neural tube secretes bmp or wnt which tells the mesoderm around it to become intermediate mesoderm (which becomes kidneys and gonads) or to become paraxial mesoderm(cant remember  right now what it becomes). Earlier in embryonic life there are factors that drop from the epiblast downwards to differentiate the mesoderm and endoderm. What's cool is yamanaka discovered the yamanaka factors which takes any cell in your body, skin cell, liver cells and will make them revert back to pluripotent stem cell. This could be revolutionary new treatment for so many things.</p></div>		</li>
