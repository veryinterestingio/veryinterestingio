<p>Submarine eruptions don't tend to produce glass; at relatively shallow depths, gas in the magma can expand rapidly to shatter the magma into ash and cinder. So if you look at eruptions such as first phase of Surtsey which appeared off the coast of Iceland in the 1960s, you will see these enormous, dirty clouds of ash and cinder raining down around the vent. So the volcano when it emerges is quite often little more than a pile of loosely consolidated rubble, filled with pores and places where water and air can go to work.</p>
<p>Cinders and ash aren't initially very fertile, they can be drenched in acidic compounds of sulfur and chlorine which first need to be washed away; however, they quickly begin to alter - iron compounds react with oxygen in the air and clay minerals begin to form when hot ash is exposed to water. Over the long term, the same happens with rain which allows dissolved CO2 to react with silicate minerals in the ash.</p>
<p>This means that eventually primitive organisms, such as algae can get established on the volcano followed by increasingly complex organisms relying on the carbon and nitrogen they bring to the volcano. Birds are hugely important, they bring phosphorus and nitrogen to islands in their droppings, but also seeds. Over time, decayed plant and animal material forms a proper soil - something that happens incredibly quickly in the tropics, much more slowly in regions like Iceland where large parts of Surtsey are still bare ash.</p>
<p>The recolonisation of large parts of Krakatau after the 1883 eruption was also linked to drift wood carrying plants and animals from the mainland. It'll be interesting to watch the recolonisation of Anak Krakatau following the catastrophic collapse of the island late last year in which many people on nearby coastlines were killed. It appears from photos that much of the forest that grew up since the volcano rose above the ocean in the 1920s was destroyed.</p>
<p>You're quite right about access to Surtsey being forbidden to anyone who is not approved by the Icelandic government and who is not part of the ongoing scientific investigation of the island. There was a huge furore a while back when a tomato plant was found growing on Surtsey; the seed had germinated from a tomato brought over in someone's lunch. The offending plant was dug up and removed from Surtsey.</p>
