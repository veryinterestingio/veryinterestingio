			<div class="markdown"><p>I would not use that analogy for this. There is no physical meaning to the question of whether it's the same electron or a new one. All electrons are fundamentally identical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pardon my question if it is silly, as I am a total amateur. But what about quantum entangled electrons? If two electrons were entangled, could you determine if it is the same electron? Or is my question non sensical to begin with?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. I'm not talking about &quot;one-electron universe&quot;, which was basically a showerthought that Wheeler had once.</p>
<p>There is definitely more than one electron in the universe. But every electron is fundamentally identical to every other one.</p></div>		</li>
