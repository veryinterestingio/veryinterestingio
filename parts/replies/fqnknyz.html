			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to emphasize this with numbers because just saying low orbit and higher up isn't super clear.</p>
<p>The ISS orbits at an attitude of about 400km. Geosynchronous orbits are about 36,000km. </p>
<p>There's a huge, huge range we use for various orbits at various inclinations, and there debris in all of it, but the lower things are, the faster they will deorbit and burn up in the atmosphere. Higher up things tend to stay for a long long time.</p></div>		</li>
