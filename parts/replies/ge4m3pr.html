<p>&quot;If you grab this item and press it up against this NPC in this very specific way for 2 seconds exactly, you can skip past this entire section of the game and arrive straight at the boss.&quot;</p>
<p>Whoever wrote those laws forgot to clear up their variables.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My toddler lost my driver's license. I forget why, but I couldn't get a replacement online, but I COULD get a nonoperator's license (ID without saying you can drive) and then use that ID # to get a new driver's license online. One extra step, but I didn't have to take a toddler to the DMV so it was worth it. (And no,  I didn't need the physical card. Fill out the form, click the button, get the #, use that to fill out the other form, click that button, get driver's license mailed to me.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't say much about all states but in some U.S. states, what a Notary Public can charge for specific services is capped. For example, in California the fee for a jurat (what is being described here) is $15. Veterans may not have to pay any fees at all but that is left up to interpretation this context. Look up California law section 8202(f) if you're interested. Also note, $15 is a <strong>cap</strong>. In California, a Notary is free to charge <strong>less</strong> for the service, even $0 if <em>they</em> choose to.</p>
<p>Many notary public can, and will, find ways to add on additional charges. Such as a distance charge for so-called &quot;traveling&quot; notaries (there is no such thing, at least with the state I'm most familiar with). Or they'll attempt to charge fees for additional papers to be attached (many Notary use a stamp). </p>
<p>In a nutshell, if a Notary wants to charge you $115 just to do a simple jurat, tell them to pound sand and look elsewhere. </p>
<p>This may be important for an individual where $15 would be difficult enough to scrounge up and represents the difference of going hungry or having a little food in the belly. </p>
<p>Source: I worked for the Secretary of State to commission Notary Publics and authenticate <em>their</em> signatures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then you have places like the Oregon DMV that will only accept a utility bill from within the last 60 days as proof of residence to get your ID. It's a lovely conundrum for even people who are not homeless. My son is trying to get his Real ID and has run into so many problems because of their stupid ID rules. He doesn't have a utility in his name. He doesn't attend school. He doesn't have a job. For him it's frustrating but something he can overcome. But apply those same barriers to unhoused individuals and add all of the other barriers and it's enough to make many people give up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if this will help you, but in Oregon I've always used a AAA statement or bank statement and never had a problem. I've found it is really easy when moving to log in and change my AAA first (in addition to changing my address). They usually  send documents verifying that within a few days and the DMV has never questioned those.</p>
<p>I just checked the DMV website and it says that any of these two documents will work for the new real ID:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any document accepted as proofÂ of identity, such as anÂ approvedÂ County Corrections Proof of Identity/Date of Birth letter, an Oregon Concealed Weapon Permit/Concealed Handgun License or military documents</li>
<li>A verbal statement from any person living at the same residence address you listed on your application. This person must be with you and show proof of residence address</li>
<li>Oregon vehicle title or registration card</li>
<li>Utility hook up order or utility statement issued by the service provider</li>
<li>Any document issued by a financial institution that includes your residence address</li>
<li>Any item delivered by the United States Postal Service, FedEx, or UPS sent by a verifiable business or government agency</li>
<li>Any document issued by an insurance company or agent</li>
<li>Any document issued by an educational institution</li>
<li>A U.S. government-issued marriage certificate or license signed by a government official</li>
<li>Rental/Lease Agreement that includes the original signature of the lessor or landlord</li>
<li>A loan agreement, payment booklet/voucher, or loan statement</li>
<li>Paycheck, paystub, W-2 or 1099 tax form</li>
<li>An Oregon Department of Consumer &amp; Business Services (DCBS) issued manufactured structure ownership document</li>
<li>OregonÂ voter notification card or voter profile report orSelective Service card</li>
<li>Medical or health benefits card</li>
<li>Unexpired professional license issued by an agency in the U.S.</li>
<li>Current Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor (J-1) status (DS2019)</li>
<li>Approved letter from Oregon State Hospital, homeless shelter, transitional service provider or halfway house dated within 60 days of your application certifying your residence address</li>
<li>Letter from Department of Veterans Affairs Rehabilitation Center &amp; Clinics certifying your address</li>
<li>Letter on company letterhead from an employer certifying that you live at a non-business address owned by the business or corporation</li>
</ul>
<p>EDIT: To be clear, as someone who has worked with folks experiencing chronic houselessness, it is really hard to navigate all of this without housing.  There are definitely systemic problems.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Any bank statement counts, including ones you just print from their website. As does any item delivered to you by USPS. As does any insurance card with your name and address on it. Voter registration card works too - and you can often register online.</p></div>		</li>
