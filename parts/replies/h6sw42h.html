			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not exactly accurate. Money can be infinitely adjusted in it's relation to the value it represents, and the value it represents is always changing, but in the end the value in the system at any given point is finite. Resources, time, and ability to do work are all finite.</p>
<p>So if a wealthy person controls x percent of available resources in the world, that's a finite amount that could be otherwise distributed.</p>
<p>Also to the other point, wealth inequality in america is at the highest point its ever been. So the rich definitely <em>are</em> soaking up more of the wealth.</p></div>		</li>
