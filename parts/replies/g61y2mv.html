			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok no that's pretty cool. Not the killed people, but the fact we're trying stuff like this. This question kind of came to mind after watching Abyss where they breathe an oxygenated liquid. I learned that was a real thing, so I thought I wonder if we're doing anything cool with blood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure where the idea of breathing an oxygenated liquid came about from, but the first use I'm aware of is in Neon Genesis Evangelion. It's on Netflix. Watch up through episode 24 then watch The End of Evangelion. Episodes 25 and 26 of the anime had budget and time issues, and The End of Evangelion is basically the real ending.</p>
<p>There's a few minor alterations on the Netflix version. Notably the credits music and a couple dialogues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know the original ending is &gt;!supposed to be the “good” ending where Shinji comes to terms with his emotions and prevent the world from ending, while in EoE he fails to control his emotions and the world becomes tang or whatever!&lt;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The comparison with oxygenated liquid makes sense, although:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the body is more sensitive to what's inside versus what's outside, so replacing the blood is a much harder task than applying something externally (even if it's in the lungs, it's considered external for your body, the lung surface is still a protection against aggression)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there are many things that don't kill you outright, but increase mortality. Synthetic blood is currently in that category, But I suspect breathing oxygenated liquid would also be. I.e., its possible, but that doesn't mean it's not bad for you in the medium/long term </p>
</li>
<li>The blood has a hard job, in that it need to attract oxygen a lot to extract it from air when in the lungs, but at the same time not be too attached to it so that it can give back as much as possible to the cells it reaches. An oxygenated liquid has only half this problem. It needs to be easily detach from oxygen to give it to the lungs, but even if it has a hard time linking to it, you can just load it using pressurised pure oxygen to force oxygen in.</li>
