			<div class="markdown"><p>Man. Let’s just be clear before we get crazy: I have a geology minor ONLY. Please, any hard rocker (or whoever - I’m sure soft rocker pros know way more than I as well) correct my errors. </p>
<p>Imagine cracks in the chocolate. The chocolate is now in giant sections. We call these sections “tectonic plates.” They move around because of convection currents in the underlying chocolate (we’re swiftly getting to why we had to get rid of the pan).</p>
<p>The marshmallow continents, because of their far lower density, float much higher in the molten chocolate than the chocolate skin. So, as the skin gets pushed around (actually it’s getting pushed apart because of upwelling of molten chocolate that comes up between the cracks and push them apart, adding fresh chocolate at those locations - that’s sea-floor spreading). When the chocolate plates, which are denser, push up against the marshmallow plates, the chocolate plates go under. (Imagine crashing a flat square piece of styrofoam into the same size piece is steel plate the same way you might have done with two toy cars as a child - which one ends up on top?)</p>
<p>When the chocolate skin gets pushed under, it cycles back down and gets re-melted. This is why the sea floor is, by and large, so much younger than the continental plates, which basically just always float around on top.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well the continents are much much thicker than the surrounding crust.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Im pretty sure that the amount of land that is sticking up to form the continents is dwarfed by how deep the underlying crust extends into the mantle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, when sea water mixes with magma it produces granite. And granite’s density compared with basalt (of which the sea floor is made) is comparable to air’s density compared with water. </p>
<p>So, since marshmallows are primary air, I would actually say this isn’t a bad comparison. </p>
<p>Mind if I steal it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A quick google search puts the density of basalt at 3000 kg/m³, and that of granite at around 2750 kg/m³, about an 8% difference.  Water's density is 1000 kg/m³, while that of air at standard conditions is 1.225 kg/m³, or about a tenth of a percent the density of water.  </p>
<p>Also, granite does not form by mixing lava with seawater.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Granite forms when cooling magma does contains very little amount of iron. Lava and water can come into contact a variety of ways, but they commonly meet underwater and form pillow basalt, which is rich in iron.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s up for debate (AFAIK). It could have been a several million year barrage of comets during the early formation of the solar system as the accretion disk cleared. Or it might have just been a part of the underlying chemistry of the planet itself.</p></div>		</li>
