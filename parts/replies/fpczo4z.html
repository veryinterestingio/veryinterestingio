<p>The adrenaline part is also why people with ADHD are able to sometime hyperfocus and can cram out a lot of work just before an impending deadline.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The second point is not mutually exclusive to ADHD is it? I’m a serial procrastinator but 100% get my work done usually with the angst and pressure of a deadline and tend to do pretty good work. I love the pressure. I am also a little anxious a lot of the time, fidget pretty consistently and find it hard to turn my mind off. And swing pretty significantly between “I can sit here for a while and zone out” to “I feel like if I sit for a second I’m going to lose it”. May just be my anxiety and the compulsion to do, but always wondered about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are outside factors that can contribute to adhd-like symptoms but may not necessarily be adhd. With that said, you sound like you could have adhd. There are tests online that take a couple minutes that will point you in the right direction. I took a couple of those before going to the doctor for an official diagnosis. Also, for adhd they say it has to be present throughout your whole life, not just recently. You are born with it and it may improve with age but it never goes away.</p></div>		</li>

Ive always left school work to the last minute, all the way now to my masters. I took modafinil once before my 3rd year exams at uni and I have never felt whole like that. If I had something to do I would just do it without distraction like normal</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on where you live. For me I just had to seek a family doctor and take a test. Most places you have to go through a psychiatrist and take a few tests. </p>
<p>If you’re concerned you might have it look up adhd test online. They’re free and take a couple of minutes. I took a few and used the feedback to decide on going to the doctor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP but there have been several studies (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=11462751" target="_blank">1</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=12365958" target="_blank">2</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=29576028" target="_blank">3</a>) showing differences in brain structure (obtained through imaging) between ADHD and non-ADHD individuals.</p>
<p>Specifically, they've shown differences in areas of the brain related to forward planning, abstract reasoning, mental flexibility, and working memory. (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=25142296" target="_blank">4</a>)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=16961424" target="_blank">Here</a>'s a paper about ADHD pathways from 2006 (I'm sorry I don't have access to the full paper). An excerpt from the abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Neuropsychological and imaging studies have  shown that attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated  with alterations in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and its connections to  striatum and cerebellum.  </p>
<p>The PFC is very sensitive to its  neurochemical environment, and optimal levels of <strong>norepinephrine</strong> and  <strong>dopamine</strong> are needed for proper PFC control of behavior and attention.  Recent electrophysiologic studies in animals suggest that norepinephrine  enhances &quot;signals&quot; through postsynaptic alpha2A-adrenoceptors in PFC,  while dopamine decreases &quot;noise&quot; through modest levels of D1-receptor  stimulation. Blockade of alpha2-receptors in the monkey PFC re-creates  the symptoms of ADHD, resulting in impaired working memory, increased  impulsivity, and locomotor hyperactivity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems like we understand pretty clearly that folks with ADHD have decreased levels of dopamine and norepinephrine, leading to dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex, which leads to the focus-related symptoms.</p>
<p>But as you say, we aren't quite sure what <em>causes</em> those decreased levels of dopamine and norepinephrine and the differences in brain structure. We just know that the symptoms are related to these things.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ADHD is an accepted set of symptoms diagnosed by a psychiatrist.
Those symptoms are accepted as being caused by neurotransmitter deficiencies.
The cause of these deficiencies and why they then cause ADHD are generally accepted as having a genetic link but the exact causation is unknown. Some older research points at diet even. </p>
<p>As it's diagnosed by a subjective measure (usually on how it impacts your life, so doesn't account for learnt coping mechanisms etc as well) rather than objective, there isn't a clear answer, along with it being a spectrum of varieties and severities (along with an increased likelihood of other mental co-morbidities). This can also lead to incorrect or partially correct diagnosis. These accepted symptoms could be caused by 10 different things, and are all diagnosed as ADHD, meaning that there isn't a conclusive answer.
Knowing what usually works to assist, allows for treatment, but it doesn't mean that it's the cause conclusively. </p>
<p>It's being researched continually, and as with all science it's all a theory, waiting to be improved on, corrected, and confirmed. </p>
<p>All as far as I am aware - happy to be corrected...</p></div>		</li>
