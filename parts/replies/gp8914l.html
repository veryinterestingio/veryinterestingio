<p>Even in an old coal-fired plant the conversion is much more efficient than in an automobile engine</p>

<p>For some extra context to this, you may have noticed that (In the US at least) electric cars may have a fuel efficiency measurement similarly to conventional cars, but slightly different - in the US, they use &quot;MPGe&quot; instead of &quot;MPG&quot;. That's &quot;Miles Per Gallon (equivalent)&quot;, and is based on the idea that a gallon of gasoline has an amount of energy in it (33.7 KWh). That energy can be used for different things, like for example heating your house; if you had a furnace that burned gasoline, using a gallon of gasoline to heat your house would heat it the same amount as having a space heater plugged into your wall that used that much electricity.</p>
<p>Some cars come in both electric and gas burning versions, and you can compare the conventional model's MPG rating to the electric model's MPGe rating to get a sense of how much energy the car needs to move, and how much of that energy it is able to get from the gasoline it burns.</p>
<p>For example, the Kona gets 30 MPG in its conventional version while the electric version gets 120 MPGe. That means that the electric version can travel 4 times as far on the same amount of potential energy as the conventional version - for the gas burning version, only 25% gets used for motion and 75% of the energy in the gasoline it burns is lost.</p>
<p>A fossil-fuel burning power plant, on the other hand, is around 30-35% efficient and can be up to 50-60% efficient with what's called a &quot;combined cycle&quot;. If the electricity to power your car comes from one of the higher efficiency plants, you may be able to drive nearly 2 1/2 times as far using the same amount of fuel as you could if you were burning the fuel inside your car directly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With your info, I did some back of the envelope math. </p>
<p>At an average rate of 10 cents per kWh, which is a little low but not crazy so, that's $3.37 per gallon of gas (as the electrical equivalent). Since it gets 4x the mileage off a gallon equivalent, that puts it at about 85 cents for a gallon of gas' worth of mileage. The average cost of a gallon's worth of mileage in a gas car is about $2.70 as of today. Thus, electric cars cost about a third to &quot;fuel&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you fuel at home. Many fast chargers charge more than .10 kwh, some are 3x4 that so it actually is much close to even depending on how you charge it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's largely true when you charge at home. Even when you use 3rd party chargers out in the &quot;wild&quot; that take a pretty big profit from the electricity they're selling you it tends to be about 50-60% of the cost per mile compared to gasoline, in my experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a real problem here, though. The 33.7 kWhr number you cite has been shown to be not a true fair comparison because it completely ignores many losses between the electrical generation and the car's motor. </p>
<p>It really needs to be knocked down by a factor of 0.365. That is, the true equivalent MPG number is just over a third of the claimed MPGe.</p>
<p>The US government had a fair apples-apples equivalent MPG formula developed under the Clinton administration. The new metric was developed in 2010 in a pretty cynical way to make electric vehicles look a lot better than they actually are.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/warrenmeyer/2010/11/24/the-epas-electric-vehicle-mileage-fraud/" target="_blank">https://www.forbes.com/sites/warrenmeyer/2010/11/24/the-epas-electric-vehicle-mileage-fraud/</a></p>
<p>edit to add: that electric car boasting 120 MPGe sounds awesome. However, the true apples-apples equivalent is 120*0.365=43.8 mpg. That's pretty good, but nowhere near as impressive as the 120 MPGe would have you believe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 0.365 factor you're quoting is over a decade old and based on the averaged mix of energy sources on the US power grid at the time of publication.  </p>
<p>That number is constantly changing, and it would make no sense for the EPA's vehicle efficiency rating to be dependent on the average US power source, as it would ignore any local variation in energy generation techniques, be they solar panels on the roof of the car owner's home, or the use of nuclear, natural gas, wind or solar power on the local grid.  </p>
<p>If the EPA <em>did</em> include that number in the vehicle rating, it would be not only wrong everywhere because of local variations, but instantly out of date (like that article) because of changes in where the grid gets its energy.  </p>
<p>MPGe is a measure of the car's efficiency at turning energy into locomotion, not a measure of average US energy grid CO2 production equivalent as the author of the article you linked converted it to.  </p>
<p>As of today, there are almost no parts of the US where electric cars produce more CO2 (product life cycle effects included) than internal combustion cars, with the possible exception of parts of WV with old, low-efficiency coal-fired powe plants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes!  We had an electric car, but live in a state that uses a lot of coal to generate electricity.  I was well aware that my car was therefore not very eco friendly.  But I also knew every single upgrade to the grid that made my electricity &quot;greener&quot; also made my car greener bit by incremental bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, you can also add solar panels to your house after-the-fact or charge up in a place that gets their electricity from renewables (the building my workplace is in has solar panels on their parking garage).</p></div>		</li>
