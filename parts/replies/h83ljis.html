<p>&quot;If we were above the atmosphere, say on the International Space Station and looked at the sun (through our filtered visor), the sun would appear white! Why? Because though the sun emits strongest in the green part of the spectrum, it also emits strongly in all the visible colors – red through blue (400nm to 600nm). Our eyes which have three color cone cell receptors, report to the brain that each color receptor is completely saturated with significant colors being received at all visible wavelengths. Our brains then integrate these signals into a perceived white color.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no winning with astrophysics on that matter tbh. They simply have too much information on that matter to flex on you.</p>
<p>If you go ahead and say that the sun is white, someone will yell you that it's actually green because in this part of the spectrum it shines the brightest.</p>
<p>But then, if you tell that to another guy they will probably tell you that it averages out yellow-ish, being a G-type star (notice the unnecessary use of jargon for dramatic effect) which you knew in the first place.</p>
<p>Just joking, it is astonishing to look on space pictures or the ISS feed and see the sun straight white. Makes you think how many things we take as facts depend extensively on our perception and microcosm.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or is it just G stars like the sun that appear white?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They would appear white because our eyes would have evolved to understand them as white.</p>
<p>Also, we get used to different color temperatures and interpret them as white (e.g., we see indoor incandescent lighting as white even though it is much yellower than bright sunlight).</p>
<p>But switching back and forth, we would be able to tell.</p></div>		</li>
