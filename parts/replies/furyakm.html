			<div class="markdown"><p>That may work for some people who like maths but the most universal way to get rid of ear worms is to focus on what you are actually hearing. Maybe it’s the wind in your ears, traffic background, the hum of lights or other machines, birdsong, whatever.</p>
<p>Just listen. Hear these sounds, focus on hearing them (without judging or telling yourself any sounds are good or bad). After 30-60 seconds of truly focusing, the earworm will be gone — without simply being replaced by anything else!</p></div>		</li>
