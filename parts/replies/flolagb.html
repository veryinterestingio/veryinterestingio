			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting. So then how would you compare this current one to the 1918 one in terms of is it less scary? More lethal? More or less people will die after it's run its course etc? And if this turns out to be worse than the Spanish Flu, which I really really really really hope it isn't, then are we medically better prepared to minimize the death toll with our current advances in medicine and science than vs 100 years ago?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1918 Flu was more lethal, killed younger healthy people, was massively censored due to WW1, and hit when medical technology was 100 years older. This is not good, but it is not nearly as bad thank goodness. In \~3 years up to an estimated 500million were infected. We are currently at the several hundred thousand mark from containment procedures, <del>and we have a real possibility of having a vaccine before its first year is done</del>. I tired to find something to back this up, but I am now pretty sure that this has purely been speculation between friends and colleagues.</p>
<p>The 1918 flu is a useful comparison tool but not the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We will have better treatments that should drop the mortality before this year is done but vaccines, even if we found one tomorrow, will take 12-18 to be actually used. No one, absolutely no one wants to have a vaccine that has negative side-effects such as weakening the response to the virus in the long run, making the second and third rounds absolutely devastating. This is a real possibility and we just can not afford it. The cure has to be effective before we can administer it. Hydroxychloroquine has been talked about and it may work, or it may not but those kind of medicines are very easy to start giving to people in very rapid timetables.   </p>
<p>So, preventive, proactive medicine will take long time.  How to treat the symptoms is much faster process. We also can manage some negative effects on the treatment; if it is a case of lide and death, slight damage is ok. When we are talking about ALL healthy individuals, the error rate has to be almost null.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m hesitant to speak in absolutes when it comes to current/future pandemics.</p>
<p>However, in terms of societal impact and response, COVID-19 is certainly more impactful. That, it should be said, is largely because of the far greater interconnectedness of the world today, the speed at which information can be disseminated, and the ease of communication.
Also, there was a global conflict going on in 1918, which by and large meant that the pandemic went relatively unnoticed due to the war effort. Newspapers weren’t reporting on the pandemic, except from in neutral countries (e.g. Spain, hence the name) and national-scale efforts in Europe were concentrated on winning the war.</p>
<p>The 1918 H1N1 pandemic had near-perfect conditions for rapid transmission and a plethora of healthy (mostly healthy) adults to infect.</p>
<p>We are certainly more capable, medically-speaking, of handling pandemics today. The advances we’ve made since 1918, as well as the number of social responsibilities that have been introduced, <em>should</em> keep the mortality rate of COVID-19 below that of Spanish flu, although it’s difficult to be 100% certain. Putting my speculative hat on, I wouldn’t think that COVID-19 will be quite as prevalent as Spanish flu was. There will be more deaths to come from COVID-19, but I think it will have run its course before it gets anywhere near the 17-50 million (though some estimates go as high as 100 million) deaths that the 1918 pandemic caused.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that guy but this virus is projected to have a MUCH smaller death toll than the Spanish Flu. I’ll see if I can link to a chart.</p>

<p>There’s also a great History Unplugged podcast about COVID vs Spanish Flu from a few days ago.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This occurs genetically when the virus is not encountering as many hosts, thus having to mutate to cause milder symptoms so that hosts with the new milder strain will spread it more easily. </p>
