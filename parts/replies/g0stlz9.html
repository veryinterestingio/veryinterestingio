			<div class="markdown"><p>The other things to add to this are salting and the importance of unique passwords for each website.</p>
<p>Salting is when databases add a bit of random info to the password before hashing it. This 'random' info is secret and specific to the system which means that a rainbow table generated from other systems cannot be used to look for known passwords in a newly acquired database.</p>
<p>A person having unique passwords for each website is important because once your password is found out on one site, attackers will use bots to try that username / password combination on other sites. This is how thousands of Disney plus accounts were 'hacked' on the first day. People reused compromised username/password combinations and people gained unauthorized access.</p></div>		</li>
