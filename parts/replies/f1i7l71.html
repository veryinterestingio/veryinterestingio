<p>higher frequencies have shorter bandwidths - therefore the high cracks don't travel as far as the rumbling lows</p>

<p>could you expand on this further? It seems intuitively true that for some reason quieter sources (a radio at low volume) the higher frequencies carry better, while louder sources (a concert) the low frequencies carry further. I have wondered about this before, and figured it was something to do with the relative energy in the soundwaves, but I can't see how the bandwidth fits, as in my mind bandwidth is more to do with filters than energy.</p>
<p>Perhaps you meant wavelength (which seems more ture) but still doesn't tie in with higher energy in the soundwave</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sorry yes wavelength - i took the below excerpt right from a physics site - sounds good - also I wouldn't compare sound created by speakers (so many variables like frequency response, power, etc)  - a lightening clap is tremendous and the highness of the clap will dissipate faster than the low which is why it ends in a rumble.</p>
<p>As sound waves travel through a medium, they lose energy to the medium and are damped. The molecules in the medium, as they are forced to vibrate back and forth, generate heat. Consequently, a sound wave can only propagate through a limited distance. <strong>In general, low frequency waves travel further than high frequency waves because there is less energy transferred to the medium.</strong> Hence the use of low frequencies for fog horns. Although damped waves have decreasing amplitudes, their wavelength and period are unaffected.</p>
