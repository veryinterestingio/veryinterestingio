<p>edit: please don’t do this, it was a dumb thing to do, I was just saying out of curiosity and this is very dangerous, you could burn down your home</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My family bought a recharger for regular batteries. It worked a lot slower than a normal charger and normal batteries, but it worked surprisingly well. It has a rechargeable battery mode, and non-rechargebles would start to smoke if you used that one on them….</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ELI5 explanation of single use batteries is easily described as an 'irreversible reaction&quot;, but as you've pointed out... That isn't exactly the case. </p>
<p>In actuality single use batteries tend to rely on conversion reactions in which completely different materials/structures form after discharge (as opposed to lithium-ion battery intercalation materials that maintain the same structure with or without Li ions).</p>
<p>This conversion vs intercalation process is important because - in order for the battery to function - the electrode material needs to maintain good contact with it's electronically conductive current collector. When conversion materials transform to different products, they tend to break away from the current collector, breaking the circuit and causing cell failure.</p>
<p>So in summary, single-use batteries can be charged BUT</p>
<p>1) The products formed after charge tend to be very stable, and it is difficult to get stable materials to become less stable. Thus, it is difficult to completely reverse the chemical reaction.</p>
<p>2) The large structural changes that take place causes active material to lose contact with it's current collector so that electrons can no longer flow to/from the electrode.</p>
<p>3) Some solutions to these problems exist, but aren't quite worth it to commercialize because it sacrifices the technology's affordability and eco-friendly nature (i.e. if we're going to pay more per battery, then we might as well pay for a different chemical system that serves that purpose more effectively).</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>For example the lead/acid battery. The lead peroxide, which is one of the active chemicals, MUST have its crystals form in intimate contact with the positive lead collector. You cannot make a lead/acid battery by just slapping lead peroxide on a sheet of lead.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Often they are reversible, BUT they may not form in the correct crystal structure, for instance. Or trying to reverse may cause competing chemicals to form, which don't work for the cell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: The chemicals that produce the electricity don't fully reverse every time. Reversing the reaction by 99% builds up over time, as leaving 1% behind every time causes the &quot;stuck&quot; chemicals to get bigger.</p>
<p>ELI15: Pulling electrons off the cathode and returning them to the anode is an imperfect process. Molecules prefer stability, which in chemistry terms is a net 0 charge. Pulling electrons away from the cathode and forcing them back to the anode causes the cathode to gain a positive charge, and the anode becomes negative again. Since the materials used to make batteries aren't completely pure, some portions of the cathode become resistant to having the reaction reversed, and remain at a neutral charge. The percent of the cathode that resists &quot;recharging&quot; (forced polarization) grows over time, and eventually you're left with a cathode that's mostly inert metal that refuses to give up its electrons.</p></div>		</li>
