Primatologists will note how some chimps will perform their gestures over the top so humans can read them easier</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once heard from an old college professor (so I'm assuming this is true but don't know for sure) that most animals, humans included, have 2 separate parts of their brains that are responsible for deducing the emotions on others faces. If you can recognize that I'm shit-scared of something it just might save your own life. There are 2 separate parts of the brain for this because most species have one part that's dedicated to deducing the emotions on their own species faces and the other part is responsible for the same task for all other species faces (i.e. when you see your dad smile vs. seeing your dog smile it's actually 2 diff parts of your brain that are deducing the 'happy' emotion). </p>
<p>Now that I've said all that, my main point was that this professor told me that the part of the humans brains that's responsible for deducing emotions on other humans is, comparatively, much larger than what other mammals have for recognizing the emotions of their own. We are much more emotionally attuned to each other than most other animals are for their own species. All this to say that you're right, humans are far more social and in general we rely much more on communication (esp. non-verbal) for survival as a species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first part is definitely true. There's been several cases where the brain has been injured in someone and they can no longer recognize emotional or physical cues. And he was right, out of the area(s) we know of, they do seem to be larger than in some other animals. In saying that though, other animals like dogs, budgies (most parrots really) also have the ability to recognize emotion in other creatures. Dogs and birds are best at this that we know of, often showing distressing signals or calls when they see a human with an angry or sad face.
Its really quite interesting once you get into it, it also supports the notion that most animals have the exact same emotions as us, just in different ways that isn't anthropomorphized</p></div>		</li>
