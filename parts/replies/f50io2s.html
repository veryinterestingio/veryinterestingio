			<div class="markdown"><p>I experienced this with a friend. We were both trying to remember the name of our friend's girlfriend and it was on the tip of both our tongues. The closest we could get was that it began with an A and sounded a bit like &quot;antipasto&quot;. But that was as far as we got until, a few hours later, I suddenly blurted out &quot;ANITA!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few years ago, my husband and I ran in to the local Legion President at A&amp;W one morning. We had a lovely chat, and then after we left I asked my husband what his name was because I couldn’t for the life of me remember. Husband had no idea what the guy’s name was, just that he was clearly someone I knew through work.</p>
<p>Fast forward to that night. We’re in bed, both nearly asleep, and it clicks. </p>
<p>“HAROLD” I yell, sitting straight up in bed and scaring the bejeezus out of my husband.</p>
<p>He still brings it up and laughs about it sometimes because he never expected me to say another mans name in bed, and he certainly didn’t expect the other man to be a 70+ year old guy resembling Santa Claus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How are you guys doing it?</p>
<p>For me, it's always</p>
<p>&quot;Wait, it starts with an A and looks a bit like anthology... &quot;</p>
<p>Hours later</p>
<p>&quot;Venetian! That's the word I was looking for.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes a lot of sense. I had strokes and often have a &quot;black hole&quot; it seems where I can't say what a word is for something. Like for example - refrigerator. I'll be able to draw a picture  or say &quot;cold, food, you put eggs in there! ... arrrgh!..oh ... whatever.&quot; but the actual word will not be there. It's very irritating.</p></div>		</li>
