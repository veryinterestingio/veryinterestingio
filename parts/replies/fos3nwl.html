<p>For an average journal it takes the better part of a year to get an article published (reviews + shepherding the text through corrections &amp; repeated reviews). For highly solicited and prestigious journals it can be much longer than that.</p>
<p>See e.g. here:<br />
<a href="https://www.nature.com/nature-research/about/journal-metrics" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nature.com/nature-research/about/journal-metrics" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/nature-research/about/journal-metrics</a></a></p>
<p>(the &quot;first editorial decision&quot; usually only means that the editor decides whether or not the paper is in scope of the journal and whether to pass it to the reviewers or reject it outright, nothing more than that). </p>
<p>A week for review is very much a rare exception you see for small workshops and similar where people don't want to spend much time on the papers (nobody pays you for doing the reviews, you are doing it on the side of your normal research job). Or for papers where their value is so obvious that there is nothing to review - but those are an extreme rarity.</p>
<p>When I was reviewing papers in computer science, making a good job on a conference/workshop paper takes several hours minimum, especially if it is something more math-heavy or something that is not directly in my field of experience and I need to look things up to get an idea what the authors are talking about. For a larger (journal) paper, it will take days, minimum. Multiply this by 3-4 (common number of reviewers), and we are talking several weeks from a submission of the paper before the reviews come in. And that assumes everyone drops everything they are doing and starts reviewing right away. Which almost never happens because people have other things to do - including other reviews!</p>
<p>I have been a co-organizer of a few conferences and there the program committee budgets several months (2-3) for the reviewing process. And that was a small(ish)  conference, with maybe 15-20 people in the program committee, with maybe 20-30 papers to be presented and maybe 60 submitted for review.</p>
<p>The current situation is anything but normal for the medical journals, with a torrent of papers being submitted and published and the review process being accelerated but week is certainly not normal practice.</p>
<p>And re:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scientists are just reading the report and looking for flaws in the research methods, results, and conclusions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only that - the reviewers are also looking for whether the subject is something new, that hasn't been done before (publishing the same thing three times would not do any good to anyone, obviously), whether it is properly referenced, how is it written (is it concise, is the argumentation valid, is it an impenetrable thicket of formulas?). All that takes a lot of time if you want to do it properly.</p></div>		</li>
