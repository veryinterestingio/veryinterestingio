<p>But if you only get the reward periodically (i.e. you scroll through several meaningless posts and then periodically find one that rewards you) then it is cery hard to extinguish that behavior. There isn't enough of a pattern for your brain to recognize when it is extinguished. Hense the feeling of &quot;I'm just about done but just one or two more...&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fear</p>

<p>Aout</p>
