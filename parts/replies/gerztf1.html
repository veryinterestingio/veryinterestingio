			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Fight or flight is powered by adrenaline being released which can give you a big burst of energy to your muscles. Smelling salts causes irritation and stimulates your system briefly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really, they give you an adrenaline rush, which can help you focus and, if you're the kind of person who gets too in your head before a lift, they can pull you out of that. In my (limited) experience, you can't think of shit with a head full of ammonia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>During a <em>very</em>  stresful few months in college, I temporarily developed, IBS, a gluten intolerance, and a dairy allegery. Since then, I have been left with the dairy allergy. And not long after, an allergy to eggs developed.</p>
<p>Fuck stress, man.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sucks. It's interesting how stress can so acutely affect the gut biome. I know multiple people who got severe ibs from being stressed. My girlfriend had it years before I met her and she still has issues from it even though her stress levels are better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm..so, to confirm your point that we are robots we would have to go from beginning to see what does a robot have, and what does a human have. It would be quite a journey, and a long discussion, and we are at a starting point where you say we are robots and I only agree that we have some automated functions which we do not control. And we would have to establish what is a robot and what a human. Quite a task it would be!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's homeostasis!</p>
<p>When you eat carbs, those sugars in your blood just swim around. Your sugar-monitoring agency (beta cells in pancreas) senses this and issues a &quot;high-sugar bulletin&quot; (insulin) which all factories (cells) in the body receive, causing them to take in glucose in blood. Your main warehouse section of your central processing plant (liver) and off-site warehouse of motor houses (muscles) receives this too and start stacking it up into glycogen.</p>
<p>With low sugar level, the sugar-monitoring agency starts secreting the low-sugar bulletin (glucagon) wherr the warehouses start unstacking the reserves and releasing them while alerting factories to reduce intake</p>
<hr />
<p>Water: when your blood is running low on water, the water-monitoring agency in the central government (brain) releases anti-water-wastage bulletin (anti-durectic hormone) which increases the flow-back valves in end stage transport pipes (ureter) of the water-base blood filtration plant (kidneys) to release water to blood.</p>
<p>Sooooo funnnnnnn</p></div>		</li>
