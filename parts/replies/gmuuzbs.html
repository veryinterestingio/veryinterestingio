			<div class="markdown"><p>What about the more recent research which found similar evidence? In particular I'm thinking about this study by the National Cancer Institute of Milan performed in November which found SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in blood samples from a lung cancer trial study going back to September 2019?</p>
<p>I ask because that study was performed by a more reputable, relevant and capable group than the other studies, the research is quite recent, and it passed peer review.</p>
<p>Personally, I believe that the science, in terms of the the methodology, the conclusions and the reasoning, that was reported by the researchers of the National Cancer Institute in Milan seems quite sound, and it's exceptionally thorough. In confirming their initial test with a microneutralization assay, they demonstrated methodological rigor above and beyond most similar SARS-CoV-2 research (since most labs don't have the BSL clearance necessary to perform microneutralization in the lab). Their testing methodology actually closely mirrors that of the CDC, for example in the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6923e4.htm" target="_blank">U.S.S. Roosevelt study</a>.</p>
<p>Also relevant is the fact that this is a renowned research institute in Italy; you can see that the authors all have highly relevant backgrounds with published research in flu epidemiology, antibody interactions (and other virological/immunological research), health surveys and assays, etc. However, the findings themselves do contradict much of the assumptions, speculation and estimation performed in consideration of the initial epidemiological research, which of course centered around the outbreak in China.</p>
<p>Of course, it's absolutely possible that contamination or unrecognized methodological error could have unintentionally manipulated these results; reference <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/8/20-1843_article" target="_blank">the CDC report on supply chain issues regarding reagent contamination</a> (and the negative impact that had on initial test manufacture/distribution in the U.S.) for evidence that contamination related to SARS-CoV-2 has occurred in lab environments previously. You make a good point regarding the potential for contamination and issues with replication/similar studies, but I also think that there's simply little interest in raising this issue, regardless of whatever's true.</p>
<p>I'll conclude by saying that it's not for me to say whether the findings themselves make a strong case for early emergence. As you noted, most experts who have publicly criticized the research seem to simply referenced that one should expect exceptional evidence for exceptional claims, and most have called for more research to be performed in followup. It's unfortunate that so few institutions seem interested in doing this research, especially since time is running short in terms of the usability of samples which would have relevant data. But many scientists are looking forward, not backward, and I suppose I can understand that.</p></div>		</li>
