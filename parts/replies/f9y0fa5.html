			<div class="markdown"><p>A step can be 2 feet or 100 yards, it doesn't matter. The light intensity will drop 4 times in both cases. You are right in that it's phrased incorrectly: instead of saying &quot;walk 2 steps away from the campfire&quot; we should say &quot;move twice as far from the campfire&quot;.</p>
<p>So, for example, you're 1 step away from the fire, and make another equal step, so you are 2 equal steps away. Now you're twice as far. The light intenstiy is 1/4 of what it was 1 step away. Take 2 more steps, now you're 4 times as far. The light falling on you is 16 times weaker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesnt matter. Any given distance follows an inverse square function. 2 meters away is 4 times less bright than 1 meter away. 2 miles away is 4 times less bright than 1 mile away. All else being equal, of course.</p></div>		</li>
