			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! It's more clear now.</p>
<p>Now, why the top quark and not other particle? Just because it's the heaviest one and &quot;easiest&quot; to measure accurately?</p>
<p>And how does the stability itself gets calculated? Does the mass of those 2 particles let us calculate the shape of the field under those circumstances and if a certain parameter is, as an example, &lt;1, 1, &gt;1 (Sort of how the divergence or curl work to determine if a fluid field is compressible or if it rotates), then we can tell on which region we are?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These are great questions. </p>
<p>First: why the top quark?</p>
<p>It is indeed because the top quark is so heavy, it is the heaviest known fundamental particle. In fact the top quark mass is hard to measure, because its lifetime is so short, and it is difficult to produce. Even if you could make a perfect measurement, this intrinsically short lifetime would broaden their uncertainty in mass, due to an uncertainty principle relationship between the energy of a state and its lifetime. </p>
<p>As for why the heavy top quark is important, this is related to the question of how stability is calculated. In high energy physics, the values of parameters like masses, charges, couplings, etc, can change depending on the energy scale in question. This is the concept of renormalization: at high energies, aka short scales, new interactions are present that will modify quantities of interest. A classic example is the charge of an electron: when you go to high energies, or shorter scales, the electron charge looks more negative. This is because we think of the electron as being surrounded by a cloud of positron/electron pairs, a manifestation of the fluctuations of the vacuum. These pairs cause the vacuum to act like a dielectric, effectively screening the electron charge at long range. When you do a sufficiently short range experiment, you penetrate this screening cloud, seeing a larger electric charge. </p>
<p>It turns out the Higgs potential is described by parameters that can also vary depending on scale. As you go to higher energies, you have to take more interactions into account, which can modify the shape of the Higgs potential. If the potential permanently slopes downward at the edges, there is no minimum, and if the Higgs falls down the potential the universe is considered unstable. Because the top quark is so massive, it is more strongly coupled to the Higgs compared to any other particle, and so its interactions with the Higgs are the dominant contribution to the renormalization of the Higgs potential. It turns out that in general, fermions result in the potential becoming more unstable (ie sloping downward), and scalars increase stability. </p>
<p>Metastable situations occur when the Higgs potential is stable at low energy, but possibly unstable at higher energies. Then you have to do a calculation to consider the probability of quantum fluctuations at a given scale causing the universe to tunnel away from its stable configuration. These calculations depend most strongly on the Higgs mass and the top quark mass: hence the two axes of the stability chart. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for writing that. I had no idea about the muting of electron charges. Is that essentially just errant pair production?   </p>
<p>I was reading through the paper you suggested and, while most of the math is above my level of comprehension, I do like the very personal way he wrote it! Particularly, &quot;I would dearly love to be able to prove this assumption, but I can not, and the reader should be warned that if it is false, all my conclusions are garbage.&quot;  </p>
<p>I wish the papers I had had to read in uni were that entertainingly written!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Vacuum polarization doesn't mean there is a cloud of electron-positron pairs. That takes virtual particles too seriously, when they only work for perturbative QFT.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Let's make an example with real functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1-x%5E2%2Bx%5E4" target="_blank">1-x^(2)+x^(4)</a>. It has an absolute minimum at x=~0.7 (and also x=-0.7 but let's focus on one here). Stable.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1-x%5E2%2Bx%5E4-0.2*x%5E6" target="_blank">1-x^(2)+x^(4)-0.2*x^(6)</a>. It has a local minimum at x=~0.8 but now there is a region with a lower potential farther outside. There is a tall hill in between, tunneling to that other region is very unlikely. Metastable.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1-x%5E2%2Bx%5E4-0.3*x%5E6" target="_blank">1-x^(2)+x^(4)-0.3*x^(6)</a>. It still has a local minimum, but now the hill between that minimum and the drop is much smaller. A universe won't stay in that local minimum for long. Unstable.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example Higgs mass and top mass would be functions of the coefficients (e.g. 1, -1, 1, -0.3 for the last case) and a few other things we can measure more precisely.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or this one is for sure ruled out.</p>
<p>Is the width of the bump the &quot;amplitude&quot; needed to tunnel? Tunneling only really happens with really hot and high energies?</p></div>		</li>

<p>We might be going by different definitions, but to me that equilibrium would still be metastable, albeit less stable than the second one.</p>
<p>An unstable equilibrium would imho rather be the local or global maximums of any of your functions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would mean that some day an inevitable destabilization event will occur, leading to possible universal collapse due to something called the “Big Crunch”. From a single point in space, the destabilization will spread out at the speed of light. How long it will take for the event to occur universally is unknown and depends on how large the Universe actually is. Our perception of the size of the Universe is only the “known” Universe. Some theorize it’s already happening in another part of space and it will only be a matter of time until it reaches us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But why would a lower value of the Higgs field lead to a crunch? All mass would become slightly less massive (because the majority of the mass of the baryons actually comes from their binding energy) but why would there then be a crunch?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the Universe is said to be expanding at a rate faster than the speed of light due to inflation, it's quite possible it would never reach us even if it did already happen in the non-observable universe or somewhere very, very far away.</p></div>		</li>
