			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the response friend!  Your example of the &quot;rocky planet&quot; having a somewhat ambiguous size definitely hit home to me, as similar issues come up a bit in my line of work (spacecraft navigation).  Yours and everyone elses responses definitely helped push me in the right way to think about this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One thing to keep in mind, is that in particle physics, the more massive an object is, the &quot;smaller&quot; it is, because it is more localized because of the greater mass allowing it to have less uncertainty in its position, thus &quot;smaller&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I took a few courses in quantum/statistical physics as part of a physics minor.  So while I'm nowhere near an expert in this stuff, I am familiar with debroglie wavelengths/matter waves.  After reading this part of your response, and giving it some more thought on my own, I definitely see now how Ill conceived my question was to begin with.  I'm content with a hydrogen atom as (if I recall correctly), its debroglie wavelength is an order of magnitude smaller than its diameter, so its <em>reasonably</em> physical.  But going smaller than that it definitely starts to fall apart quickly, and is clearly not easy to talk about.  At least not how I framed it.</p>
<p>I should point out, I posted this after a question popped up in a different thread where i had compared the sizes between a human and a hydrogen atom, and then a human and the observable universe.  Someone asked me to do it again using the smallest object instead of a hydrogen atom.  Others had used the planck length but I didnt really like that as it isnt a &quot;thing&quot;.  I gave it a bit of thought and just figured I'd post it here.</p>
<p>Thanks again, I can clearly see how my question wasnt super clear, and doesnt have a super satisfactory answer as I've posed it.  But I appreciate you giving me some new stuff to think about, and reminding me material I havent thought about in years!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/lichlord is correct.  I worked for about 9 months on the OSIRIS-REx mission on terrain relative optical navigation, around the time of the arrival at Bennu.   My PhD is now funded by the mission, so I still go back in summers and what not.  </p>
<p>My work is mainly broken into two areas.  The first is my research related to my grant, where I work mostly on computer vision and optimal estimation techniques for navigating and mapping asteroids.  The second, is that I work as student PI of my university's cube satellite lab.  I help mainly with systems engineering and project management, but also put a decent amount of time into mentoring the GNC team, and occasionally write some of the more demanding algorithms. </p>
<p>As for what spacecraft navigation actually entails, it's a lot of math and programming!  For the work I've done/do with OSIRIS-REx, it's been all work related to image processing and orbit determination.  So taking images of the asteroid, and constructing a 3d map of its surface and using that map to navigate relative to, by identifying previously mapped features.  From that, you can determine what the precise orbit of the spacecraft actually is.  Thats definitely the way I want to go with my career.  For the cubesat work I do, it's all work with satellites around the Earth, doing mainly GPS based orbit determination, and attitude control using a variety of techniques.  It's not quite as cool as my main research, but it's faster pace.  We've got a satellite going up in october, and another a few months after that!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The neutrino is still a point-like particle, so it's definitely not the answer.</p>
<p>Since you seem to think that being able to pass through materials easily makes a particle &quot;smaller&quot; (i.e. you relate the &quot;particle size&quot; with some scattering cross section, which is generally incorrect in quantum physics), then the graviton would be much &quot;smaller&quot; than a neutrino. After all, this is the reason why we cannot detect single gravitons, but only strong gravitational waves.</p>
<p>And please nobody reply with any &quot;quantum mechanics and gravity are incompatible&quot; nonsense. We are in a semiclassical regime here where the UV completion does not matter, i.e. there is no strong gravitational field involved.</p></div>		</li>

<p>An atom is easy at first glance, it's the surface, right? But since there isn't a solid shell of anything, and the electrons orbit in probabilistic clouds, where is the edge really?</p>

<p>Chemists find the concept of bonding atomic radii to be useful.  It's an imprecise concept, but the coefficients of variance are not large.  If you look at the distance between two nuclei in an Hâ‚‚ molecule and halve it, you get an estimate of the radius of an H atom.  You can do the same thing with C-C bonds in a carbon compound, and with C-H bonds in a hydrocarbon.  If you look at many compounds and average out the discrepancies, you get a useful set of measurements of atomic radii.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. While my explanation may have had a few errors in the specific examples (I'll admit did not expect it to gain so much traction I only half-paid attention when writing the post), the point I was trying to convey is that you need a precise definition for what you are measuring when you get down to the details.</p>
<p>And my explanation was not meant as a cop out answer of &quot;We don't know! You can't do direct comparisons because nothing is real!&quot; that I got after re-reading it, but rather that you can do comparisons, but you need to be doing the comparisons in the same way.</p></div>		</li>
