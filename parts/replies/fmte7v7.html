			<div class="markdown"><p>I am curious how the lawyers get paid then....  is it hourly or a fee or a percentage? Does it come out first before the plaintiff gets paid? Or at the same time?  If someone gets a judgement, but the loser declares bankruptcy, does the lawyer still get paid?</p>
<p>Whatever it is I assume the lawyer leaves with more money from this thing than anyone else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plaintiff lawyers could be paid a flat fee or a percentage of the judgment.  For a defamation case against an individual (like this one), plaintiff lawyers will definitely get a flat fee.  Defense lawyers are always paid a flat fee.  Where it's a percentage, the plaintiff owes the attorney's cut even if it never collects a dime from the defendant.  The Winklevoss/Facebook lawsuit had crazy facts related to this.  The Winklevoss twins received a settlement of X shares of Facebook <strong>stock</strong> which they thought was worth $65 million, making their law firm's fee $13 million <strong>in cash</strong>.  Later the twins sued FB claiming fraud because the shares were only worth $11 million.  Their law firm also got involved claiming they were still owed $13 million in cash -- $2 million more than what the twins believed they won.  After it all played out the FB stock was actually worth a lot more than $11 million so everyone was ok IIRC.  Here's an outlined <a href="https://outline.com/TjXmE3" target="_blank">WSJ article</a> about it if you want to read more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm currently involved in a lawsuit and I dont believe the defendant will ever pay whatever settlement we come to dispite being a gigantic company.  Does this mean that i could end up owing my lawyer money and never seeing a dime come to me?  Wouldnt the lawyer just take 1/3 off the top when payment is RECEIVED?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lawyer here. </p>
<p>A lawyer makes sure he gets paid. I’m not taking a lawsuit against a person/company where I don’t think there’s money to get paid (if it’s a contingency case). If I don’t think the defendant has money then I’ll bill the client hourly. If neither have money then I’m not taking the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense. I suppose some situations fall into the “ I will spent $100k to make sure he doesn’t get $10k” idea. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One step you missed is that <em>generally</em> you can’t go back and sue for more than the initial complaint after the fact, so these large lawsuit claims are basically covering anything discovered later.</p></div>		</li>
