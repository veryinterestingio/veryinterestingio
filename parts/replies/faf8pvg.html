			<div class="markdown"><p>One time I was recording a singer whose pitch was so reproducible that the takes flanged with each other.  To get a fuller chorus effect, I temporarily adjusted the pitch of the backing tracks a few cents either way to force her pitch to vary between tracks. So yes, having pitch variation can make for a richer sounds. Come to think of it, I guess we've known that since the gregorian chant days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm just an amateur but I've done solo projects recording up to 40 vocal takes of myself to layer on top of each other... at a certain point you have to &quot;do&quot; different voices to sound more like a choir and less like a vocoder but consciously varying the timbre of one's voice seems to work to a certain degree. Also mixing falsetto and head-voice for higher pitch tracks gives a more choir-y tone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One nifty trick you can try is to slow down/speed up your track by up to 20 bpm in either direction. Play it back and it'll be at a different pitch/key because of the speed. But get a sense of of the key, then just sing your backup/overdub at that speed, then return it to original bpm and your voice will have a higher/lower timbre. There's also tools you can use to bring the timbre back to sounding like you but still have the higher pitch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How is this so far down the list.  Distance from mic is key to this IMO, makes a huge difference to the warmth of the sound - as well as the mics themselves.</p>
<p>A great example of this is when you see older sports presenters use microphones with the square on top that's to measure the distance to their face.  Crowd noise tends to be a fairly low rumbling (higher pitched sounds travel less well) so by bringing the mic closer (which for other reasons makes the voice sound more mellow/deeper) they can cut the low end frequencies and reduce crowd noise.  Nowadays this will be done with a headset mic or through other means.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting.  The science of why mics work differently is something I've only scratched the surface of - whenever I've had access to multiple mics it's been a suck it and see experiment.  Do you know of any good resources with accurate info without going hugely in depth to begin with?  Cheers</p></div>		</li>
