			<div class="markdown"><p>The paper plate is covered in a thin film of wax or plastic which prevents water from going in. If you get the edges wet it does get floppy like a wet cardboard.</p>
<p>I don't see how the behaviour of a paper towel is any different from cardboard when it gets wet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Paper towel has chemical additives that increase it’s tensile and tear strength when it’s wet, meaning the sheet doesn’t lose it’s integrity as easily after absorbing some water.  Depending on the type and amount of chemical, the paper can pretty much absorb its max amount of water and still not weaken significantly. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a chemical injected in the process of making paper towels which gives it greater strength when wet. This chemical is not used when making toilet paper, so it will break down when wet and not clog your sewer system.</p></div>		</li>
