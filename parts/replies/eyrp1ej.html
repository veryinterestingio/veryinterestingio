			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really the truth of it. If it's a clear area with no or low living vegetation, the benefits are going to be much greater. In an already densely forested area, most of the existing trees are going to cause the planted trees  to die due to lack of sunlight unless they're planting trees or other vegetation designed to thrive in that environment. For example, it may be better to encourage the growth of moss in a heavily forested area. The impact will be small, but probably better than trees that will die due to being choked out by larger, established trees.</p>
<p>Edited to make a statement make more sense because I basically left half the sentence out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trees planted in an area with no or low living vegatation are going to have a tough time to survive though, especially in more extreme conditions.  No shade for the soil from hot weather, no windbreak.  The soil will almost certainly be poorer quality too, less organic matter, no mycorrhizal fungi, etc.  Perhaps extending already forested areas would be a suitable compromise between &quot;greatest (possible) impact&quot; and &quot;greatest impact through survival&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, I was mainly thinking deforested areas or areas that have experienced wildfires.. I grew up on a farm and we used supports to keep small fruit trees upright. Then we would remove it when the tree was larger.</p>
<p>That's probably not as doable when you're large scale planting. I wonder if there's some sort of biodegradable material that can be used to support saplings until they're larger and also serve as fertilizer</p></div>		</li>
