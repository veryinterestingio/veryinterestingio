			<div class="markdown"><p>We can go distance thanks to sweating.  But the actual function of our feet is bad.  Flattens over time, prove to breaks and tendon tears constantly.  Rather than a few well placed bones it is a mass of numerous tiny bones pushed together with a chaotic mesh of muscles and ligaments and tendons.  I think Cheddar on YouTube did a fun short video about it if you wanted to hunt it down.  But our ability to use a poorly made foot doesn't change that is badly built.</p></div>		</li>
