			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone asked a question. I provided an answer and literally gave them a way to continue their journey if my answer is insufficient or they want to fact check. There is no burden of proof on me for a statement like this. Doesn't work that way. </p>
<p>If someone off the street asked you where's a good place to get food, you'd probably reply with your favorite local pizza place. If you whipped out your phone and brought up a bunch of Yelp reviews, that would be a little TOO intense for such a simple question. If they have doubts they can easily ask follow up questions or research from there. They're an adult after all.</p>
<p>Now pretend some random guy named Basshero walks by and says you did a bad job because you didn't stop what you were doing to literally hold that first guys hand and bring him to the pizza place yourself. Dafuck? You just did a nice thing, it's not upon you to now lead them directly to the pizza place like they're an incompetent child. If they want more info, they're free to ask otherwise you did you part. See how silly Basshero is being? ???</p></div>		</li>
