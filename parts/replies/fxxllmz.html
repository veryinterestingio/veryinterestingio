			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I have an issue where just one of my nostrils is constantly stuffed up (left) and the other one is clear. If I use Vicks, the blocked one will open up for a short time and eventually become blocked again.  Sometimes, it's clear, but mostly it's semi-blocked but the right nostril is almost always open.</p>
<p>I find that if I sleep on my right side (so blocked nostril is up higher) that it opens up the nostril.  I was supposed to go see an ENT to have this diagnosed, but due to COVID, I'm delaying because the problem is just an annoyance and not a health concern.</p>
<p>My doc suspects an issue with my septum as well (deviated or misshapen).  Do you know what the treatment is for this?  I've read elsewhere that it's possible to &quot;roto-router&quot; your sinuses to open them up?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's at least half a dozen treatments that are used. Simplest is round, semisoft tubes that hold your nose open. They're cheap, non-invasive and work especially well while sleeping.</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum is rhinoplasty, typically a cosmetic surgery. It's expensive, but bcause it's all hidden and so less worry about visible scars, it's not too pricey. Lots of opportunities for complications, but as cosmetic surgery has become widespread it's gotten more oversight. It's safer now than the 90s for sure.</p>
<p>There's other options in between those that can help. Everyone should speak to a doctor about your specific issue. Both or neither could help you, depending on exactly what's wrong. Don't decide on a treatment before seeing an expert. Go to an ENT.</p></div>		</li>
