			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this exactly. Explained another way, charge is the ability to interact with the EM field and the EM field is quantized. The quantum creation operator is a photon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Light is an electromagnetic wave. Changing electric fields generate magnetic fields, and changing magnetic fields generate electric fields. This is why light is often referred as a “self-propagating wave,” because it doesn’t require a medium to propagate. The oscillating electric and magnetic fields “inside” a photon can be changed by external electric or magnetic fields, e.g. a nearby electron.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a way, the origin of the interaction can be thought to come from a symmetry of the laws of physics of the universe. By a symmetry, I mean I can change the lagrangian (if you don't know what that is, think of it sort of as an equation of motion but in terms of energies) describing this process, and the laws of physics won't change i.e. the lagrangian will remain the same (e.g. x^2 is unchanged if I change x to -x). </p>
<p>In classical mechanics, this is seen in the conservation of angular momentum. If we rotate a physical system for some angle, the Lagrangian is the same therefore (after a little maths) we get the conservation of momentum. Intuitively, if you have a spinning top, if you look at it from a different angle, how it spins doesn't change.</p>
<p>Now for EM, the symmetry is that we can multiply the electron field (or any of the charged particles) by a complex function of magnitude 1, and the laws of physics don't change. We also perform a transformation of the electromagnetic field but in a different way. In fact, we NEED the EM field to be &quot;coupled&quot; to the electron field in order that the Lagrangian remains invariant under this symmetry. If you're interested in finding out more, Google gauge symmetries, all 4 fundamental forces come from these.</p>
<p>There's perhaps a philosophical question here as to whether the symmetry gives the interaction, or the interaction gives the symmetry. Personally, I prefer the interaction gives the symmetry haha but I get the impression most physicists see it the other way.</p>
<p>ETA: I've tried thinking about what the physical meaning of the symmetry giving rise to the EM interaction is (apart from the obvious consequence, that it gives EM interactions haha). The only thing I can think of is that since it's basically just multiplying the field by a phase, it's sort of like we're applying a position dependent translation (in spacetime) to the field and this leaves it invariant. This doesn't really help r with an intuitive picture. If someone on this sub has a better answer, please do tell.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, it just means that the photon field is multiplied by charged fermion fields in the Lagrangian. If you mean for photon-photon scattering, then yes, any Feynman diagram you draw for that process will involve virtual fermion lines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I took some advanced chemistry and physics class back in undergrad, and I always had trouble with the seam between *-relativity/particle physics/quantum mechanics versus newtonian physics and chemistry.</p>
<p>Chemistry in particular is all about electrons interacting with one another, forcing one another into various orbitals or being shared by multiple nuclei to form bonds. I understood the rules of how those work pretty well. And then in physics we learned all these equations for how the electromagnetic force works at that higher level and all those weird particles and quanta.</p>
<p>But I never could bridge the gap, even just conceptually. Like, what part of (big blob of equations modeling these interactions) makes (any interaction between two different atoms) happen?</p>
<p>Did I just not go deep enough into the physics side? I kinda branched off that whole side of things and into genetics and infomatics. How would I got about even trying to understand all that? Are there books I could check out?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is there is no clean &quot;seam&quot; between different fields, at least not where the math isn't very very complicated.</p>
<p>Taking Chemistry, when you boil it down, it's just Quantum mechanics applied to molecules and large ensembles of these molecules. In a normal QM class, you solve the equations for the Hydrogen atom, but even trying to move to solving the Helium exactly becomes cumbersome to the point we shove all that into computers to get any results about even helium atoms let alone molecules. And these results are not exact like the hydrogen atom.</p>
<p>So we can get pretty good numerical calculations from QM of molecules and ensembles, but chemist have been around longer than QM and figured out how molecules interact using their own methods that are often easier. QM is more interested in knowing the details of the individual electrons which becomes exponentially harder with more electrons. Chemistry isn't so much worried about the specifics of the electron, just its general behaviour. Lewis structures aren't &quot;really&quot; how the electrons are acting, but it conveys the general behaviour of the system.</p>
<p>A pretty important idea in Quantum Field Theory  and Thermodynamics is renormalization groups (possibly you've seen this, even if not as this word!) The idea is if you know you're theory to a high precision (think zoomed in view), you can &quot;smear it out&quot; and lower the precision (zooming out). The scale which you are looking at something can be adjusted by how you're &quot;smearing&quot; things out (all the zooming out/smearing you can do IS the renormalization group btw...) So to go from QM to Chem, you smear out your electron's Wavefunction to heuristic rules of how electrons act in molecules.</p>
<p>All this to say, it's not that you not delving into enough physics, its more seeing how your more complex theory is being &quot;smeared out&quot; that gives you the less complex one. Using your above examples, relativity is saying the speed of light is finite. Looking at a system where speeds are close to that, relativity is the only way. If speeds are much less than the speed of light, we can &quot;zoom out&quot; (in this case lower our energy scale we're looking at) and say the speed of light is infinite. That not to say we couldn't use relativity everywhere (it should work everywhere!), it more that by &quot;smearing out&quot; our theory and looking at lower energy scales, the equations are a lot simpler. Doing Newtonian physics with relativity is a real pain...</p>
<p>Hope that addresses your point well at least some!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well done, I hadn't ever thought of it in those terms, but that's right on.  I remember my inorganic chem teacher helping a person in class that was having a hard time with yet another way of describing acid/base-redox, etc. She said in a fluster - &quot;Well, which one is right?&quot;  His answer was &quot;Whichever method suits your problem. These are only models - what really happens is so wonderfully complex that we don't completely understand it today. Just accept it! &quot;  This was 35 years ago,  and really gave me license to explain chemistry to laypeople in whatever way they could understand it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically chemistry is about atoms, and their structure of states. This is a &quot;closed ruleset&quot; if you want, which you derive from applying quantum mechanics to the bound system of electrons and a nucleus (which interact via coulomb interaction). It's fixed number of particles and often nonrelativistic too. that's far more specific than fundamental interactions between charges (relativistic quantum field theory, variable number of particles, particles can be created and destroyed).</p></div>		</li>
