			<div class="markdown"><p>For a moment I was excited to think in the coming future I will no longer hear the loud vehicles when I'm relaxing in my back yard but then I realized the vehicles I'm hearing are typically the motorcycles and cars that have been modified to sound fast and these probably will not go away very soon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably a pipe dream, but maybe manufacturers could design cars so the low-frequency vibration of a powerful engine is still experienced by the driver and &quot;vroom vroom&quot; audible noise can be piped into the interior but doesn't project outside the vehicle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not expert but here’s my analysis:</p>
<p>Will cars still have horns? Yes.
