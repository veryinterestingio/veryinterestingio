			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  My daughter recently asked 'why do adults make that face when they are looking at their phones?'  It's exactly that, a do not disturb face.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I only see older people make this concentration face. I wonder if younger people don't have to focus as hard on their phone because it's more intuitive for them having grown up with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use it as my &quot;Effort&quot; face; earlier today at work, someone actually asked me why I was making &quot;that face&quot;. I said &quot;If I looked comfortable I would also look lazy. If I look somewhere between focused and frustrated, people know I'm working hard&quot;.
... a couple of hours later, those same people were reprimanded for laughing during the rush. &quot;If you're laughing, you're not working&quot; said the manager. My point was well-proven. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gotta love the no laughter policy.</p>
<p>When I was like 21 I worked a shipping job, pretty low skill stuff, low pay, not a great job. But the guys I worked with were awesome. We worked hard but we were laughing all day, talking, joking. We all hated the job itself but we actually looked forward to getting to work because we made it fun.</p>
<p>I remember some older miserable coworkers that would look angry at us sometimes. But we were energized and they were probably falling asleep at their desk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good points. I work in customer service and we're always in plain view of the customers, and my coworkers and I know how to have fun even when very busy. But I always feel bad when we start laughing while it's clearly busy, because I know that half the customers are thinking, &quot;Quit laughing and give me what I want!&quot; Even though 90% of the time it's out of our control (damn you kitchen and your atrocious ticket times).</p></div>		</li>
