			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah, there's TONS of research that shows nightshift work absolutely wrecks humans. It just affects the more subtle aspects of human health (sleep, stress, tiredness, irritability, immune function, heart health, etc), that society has become so adept at explaining away or making excuses for, so that the results haven't taken root in mainstream thinking yet. You know, bootstraps and all that.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>I feel cold all day and at night my body is so hot</p>

<p>That, I can't answer. While the overall trend is warm during day, cooler at night...each human has their own variation and the brain adjusts the internal thermostat for each person based on their circumstances. </p>
<p>Maybe you have lower-than-average blood pressure, and the relaxation of sleep allows more of it to reach the surface of your skin to feel &quot;hot to the touch&quot;? </p>
<p>Maybe your personal circadian rhythm prefers a more night owl schedule, and wants to gear up later than average? </p>
<p>Maybe you have a chronic immune issue? (cortisol, which suppresses immune activity, drops at night, causing immune cells to go hunting for stuff; it's why fevers/symptoms seem to kick up later in the day) (and immune response are high-activity, use up a lot of energy, and produce a lot of heat). </p>
<p>Or something else entirely different. </p>
<p>I honestly, genuinely couldn't tell you and medically answering that question, for you specifically, is so far outside my professional capacity that I almost have to laugh at the request hahaha. Sorry for the non-answer, wish I could offer something a little more tangible</p></div>		</li>
