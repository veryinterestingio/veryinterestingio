			<div class="markdown"><p>So is this why I always have to adjust my prints to be very light on screen? </p>
<p>When I got to print something, it always comes out my darker than what it looked like on the computer.</p>
<p>I’ve had to do projects over and over to get the lighting right. I was warned by my professors, but it’s never been explained past “everything comes out darker, so print light..”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, color conversion is part of the reason. The other reason is that color from your monitor is presented with a backlight, which makes it appear brighter than the actual corresponding color code, depending on your screen's brightness setting. You can use a screen calibrator like the SpyderX to get your screen looking as close to CMYK as possible if you're serious about photography or digital -&gt; print art.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m an interior designer, so I’d like to get my renderings to look as realistic as possible.</p>
<p>I’ve gone to a professional for my prints, and while they turn out way better than mine. I haven’t quite justified the extra cost from what I can do on my own.</p>
<p>Learning how this works actually benefits me greatly. I’ll probably put more time into this.</p>
<p>I’m not even 100% investing in the Spyder is worth it. I’ve gotten used to the difference on the final product on the screen vs. my prints. </p>
<p>Thanks for answering!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing to think about is that the RYB color wheel emulates the spectrum of light. Colors by frequency of light start with infrared to red and progress ROYGBIV style through violet to ultraviolet.</p>
<p>ROYGBIV and the RYB color wheel:</p>
<p>R = R</p>
<p>R + Y = O</p>
<p>Y = Y</p>
<p>Y + B = G</p>
<p>G = G</p>
<p>B + V = I</p>
<p>V = V</p>
<p>So in the RYB wheel, RYB aren't the only primary colors. Violet also is. Why RYB? Again, because of the visible spectrum of light. R is simply because it's at the low frequency extreme of the visible spectrum (meaning you can only reach it in an additive color scheme by using red light), while V is not because V cannot be added to any other color to make another visible color. The result would pass ultraviolet and enter the spectrum of invisible light at the high frequency end.</p>
<p>So RYB primary color selections are <em>slightly</em> (kind of sort of not really) arbitrarily chosen. R Y and B were selected for educational purposes because of their convenient positioning on the spectrum, while RGB and CMYK were selected for production purposes due to the specific qualities of materials involved in respective applications.</p>
<p>Edit: Fixed typo (RYG is RYB, not RYG).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CMYK exists mainly because of the RGB model. Once we learned that our eyes are most sensitive to red/green/blue light, we then found pigments that absorb only one of those colors, which turn out to be cyan/magenta/yellow. Cyan pigment absorbs red light, magenta absorbs green, and yellow absorbs blue. You can then mix cyan and yellow pigments to get green paint, since only green light is left unabsorbed. Black is added to cut down on how much cyan/magenta/yellow is needed because it is less expensive.</p>
<p>RYB came about before our science improved. At that point, colors were dependent on the smaller number of pigments we knew about. Such and such mineral produced a certain color, and studying mixtures of these crude pigments led us to RYB.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And why did yellow stay the same when the other two were updated?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luck of the draw, though it still took some time to get from yellow ochre to process yellow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha whoops, reading error. Still the reason for CMYK over RYB is the same as CMYK over RGB. CMYK is good at making both light and dark colors, while RGB and RYB, for print media, are good at making only dark colors. Black ink and white paper are cheap to produce, while white ink that's not viscous isn't. Thus, CMYK.</p>
<p>There's a longer explanation to offer here too that revolves around the inherent design of the RYB color wheel. It's informed by additive color (meaning mixing colors results in lighter color approaching white because the wheel describes colors of light) and subtractive color (meaning mixing colors results in a darker color approaching black). I don't want to delve into color theory here though.</p>
<p>RGB vs. RYB is a weirder conversation. I suspect it boils down to power requirements for a CRT, but I don't know.</p></div>		</li>
