			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that Japan doesn’t issue fractional Yen coins, so 1 Yen is the smallest denomination available.  This suggests that at 1:1 valuations 100 Yen should be the functional equivalent of 100 cents, and the current exchange rate is 100 Yen = $0.91.</p>
<p>So it’s pretty close.</p>
<p>This isn’t mere coincidence - the value of the Yen was pegged to the dollar from 1949 to 1971.  Japan experienced a brief spike in inflation in the 1970s when that peg was removed, but the neither currency has experienced hyperinflation since then so they’re still in the same ballpark.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the easiest way to think of it in Japan is like if in America we used cents for pricing.  Like, say, a new Blu-ray would be 2,499 cents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is similar to Hungary where Ft doesn’t have a fractional currency. Except that technically 5Ft is the smallest.</p>
<p>But to complicate things, values ending with 1,2,3,4, 6,7,8,9 do exist. When paying <strong>in cash</strong>, the total is taken and rounded to the closest 5. So 2499 would become 2500, and 2494 would become 2495, and 2492 would become 2490, and so on so forth. <strong>Online and card payments would of course take the exact amount.</strong></p>
<p>All because about 10 years ago 1Ft and 2Ft coins were removed from circulation.</p>
<p>Well, to be fair, this is way better than what my grandparents had to put up with, with madness like 100 million billion pengö (Hungary uses the long numeral system, so in English, that would be 100 million trillion) and what not. The value of which halved in less than a day, and within a week lost 90% of its value.</p>
<p>Bloody crazy times.</p>

<p>Edit: spelling and a missing number. And some probably unnecessary clarification, but I can’t sleep and have been reading my comments…</p></div>		</li>

<p>Japan's &quot;smaller&quot; unit was called &quot;sen&quot;, and is now gone. </p>
<p>Same for Czech Republic, the lowest amount is 1 crown, around 4 cents. That's much more than 1 yen, but that's the tendency in a few European countries, which round up or down to the nearest 5 cents ( Canada ads well, I believe).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But why can’t they do a reverse currency split, i.e. something similar to a reverse stock split.</p>
<p>So for every 1000 VD, give you one new VD? And all loans/bonds issued before that date will also be adjusted as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can, and many nations have done this in the past to bring their currency valuations down to more reasonable levels.</p>
<p>It’s not free though, you have to completely replace all currency in circulation and make sure that every electronic system in the country is prepared for the transition.  It’s a huge and costly undertaking that involves several years of preparation and outreach.</p>
<p>Countries do it when the prices of things start to get so stupid so quickly that all the currency in circulation is practically worthless anyway and a new run of quadrillion dollar bills is being considered.</p></div>		</li>
