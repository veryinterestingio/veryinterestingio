			<div class="markdown"><p>You dont realize how on the nose that pun is.  I was recently in disney world for a week.  All the parks and resorts use some sort of paperboard straws instead of plastic (yay environment!).  Turns out its pretty much the same feel for any normal cold drink.  Awesome. But, try to use that straw in any thick milkshake type beverage (think starbucks frappuccino) and it loses all structural integrity within minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't actually need a utensil to eat spaghetti, we just use them for convenience (so you don't get your hands dirty). You don't actually need a straw to drink iced coffee, we just use them for convenience (because I'm prone to spilling things on myself). </p>
<p>Everyone who tells disabled people they should &quot;just&quot; bring a reusable straw everywhere should also be prepared to bring reusable cutlery (and a cup! And a takeout container!) with them everywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well you bring up a great point! Many places I eat at actually welcome this idea with incentives. Discounts for people who bring their own Tupperware(etc). I want to bring light to the situation and say if we accommodate disabled people, we would have far less plastic(utensil wise) if that were the case. I think it’s a fair sacrifice for people to make if it means extending the livelihood of the planet for us and all species around us. I don’t see why anyone would argue against the idea of continuing to pollute the environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but incentives (especially in the vein that I've seen them, which are usually a 5% discount at most) are a totally different thing than an outright ban. And I'm not necessarily against a ban, because I think something dramatic is probably necessary, but you should be consistent and ban ALL single-use plastics if you're gonna ban straws. Do something meaningful instead of useless virtue-signalling that placates people.</p></div>		</li>
