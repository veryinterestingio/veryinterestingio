			<div class="markdown"><p>Understood. I started out thinking that each square kilometer of Earth has some utility to humanity and there must be some way to quantify that in order to make better decisions or better geopolitical predictions. </p>
<p>But in the modern world it must be impossible to seperate what nature provides, and what humans can provide with their infrastructure in the the way we can ourselves sculpt the land, create roads and plus dig lakes, canals, tunnels and flood defences, whilst moving labor and resources from thousands of miles away. Then add to that better fertilizers, agricultural techniques and genetically modified and resilient crops and it means we can build megaprojects in the desert or create new islands in the sea. </p>
<p>Perhaps a 'habitability index' isn't as useful as I first thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You also have to consider political geography too. The central US is great for agriculture, but because so many states have access to the same aquifer, nobody is responsible for its sustainability. Every state looks out for itself, so they over consume and one day the water might deplete. On the flip side, central Canada has lots of oil, but they can't sell it much to international customers because the costal provinces don't want the oil flowing through their jurisdiction. Every province looks out for itself, so they under produce and one day their product might be worthless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm reading a bit about a battle in Western USA over freshwater supplies after seeing the episode &quot;Troubled Water&quot; of the Netflix series <em>Rotten</em>. Seems like much of Western USA and parts of Mexico are facing a water shortage, with a tug-of-war between water bottlers like Nestle, manufacturers, farmers and salmon fishermen. </p>
<p>I changed my mind. Politics and economics must play a part in the 'livability score' of an area, which can't be predicted by environmental factors alone.</p></div>		</li>
