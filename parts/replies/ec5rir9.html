			<div class="markdown"><p>THe largest insect on earth is about 7&quot; long according to a quick google search. </p>
<p>But remember that is just insects, things like spiders and centipedes aren't insects and can be a bit bigger. I'd say about 2 feet is the biggest terrestrial invertebrate I've ever seen, those big spider like things in iraq. </p>
<p>If you like stories about giant spiders check out Children of Time by Adrian Tchaikovsky. It's about giant spiders that go to space. </p></div>		</li>
