			<div class="markdown"><p>Every laser printer I've bought has been below $70AUD. They can be even <em>cheaper</em> than most inkjets.</p>
<p>I rarely need to print colour, so the cheapies do me well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i have a very cheap brother dcp 7055 from like 2012 or 2013 and its still working perfectly. i also have a very old hp officejet inkjet printer (literally older than me i think) with very good color reproduction it produces great printouts on photo paper and can do borderless a4 and auto double side. It still works excellently too although when i pulled it out of storage a year or so its paper feed rollers needed cleaning. also it can do amazing speeds for black and white text prints (will outrun my dcp7055 for like 5 pages and under prints easily if you include warmup) although its 10mbps ethernet does cause issues at times with it pausing for a bit during prints.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A laser creates an electrostatic charge on the paper in the shape of what you want printed and that draws the carbon toner to the paper which is then baked into place by a heating element. The printout is typically much more durable than a normal inkjet print out making it preferable in many ways to using an inkjet printer. It does use a lot more power though. </p>
<p>Fun fact, you can remove the toner from the paper using alcohol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eli5: A laser printer uses dry powdery dust as its ammunition. The laser solidifies the dust onto the paper to form the “ink”. </p>
<p>Inkjets use a liquid ink in a similar style as a pen or a marker. </p>
<p>Liquid ink can dry out and “go bad”, but has a lot more range of colors. Dry powder is basically the opposite of that.</p></div>		</li>
