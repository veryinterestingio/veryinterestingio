			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there is probably at least one island of stability, but nuclides in these islands won't actually be stable, just less unstable than others with similar masses.</p>
<p>We have some FAQ entries about this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stability is a misleading word. We won't be getting any magical supermetals or anything usable at all from these larger sized atoms.</p>
<p>Stability will mean they're measurable within a time frame such as the one discussed here before they're gone again. Everything around this atomic region will be impossible to measure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's some thought that we might be starting to see some evidence of an &quot;island of stability&quot;, with the creation of tennessine (element 117, named after Tennessee in appreciation of the contribution of Oak Ridge National Laboratory in providing the berkelium target required for its creation) - its predicted lifetime (10 ms for ^(293)Ts and 45 ms for ^(294)Ts) turns out to be shorter than its <em>actual</em> lifetime (21 ms and 112 ms, respectively).</p></div>		</li>
