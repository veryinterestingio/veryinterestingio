			<div class="markdown"><p>You forgot a detail. Some of the fission products are considered poisons, they eat neutrons and prevent criticality.</p>
<p>Some poisons will decay away on their own after a shutdown, or can be burned off by critical power ops. If you go from high to low power, their concentration can rise high enough it's difficult to sustain criticality. Or even making it impossible to start up at all for several hours.</p>
<p>This was one of the factors behind chernobyl.</p>
<hr />
<p>Other poisons last about as long as the fuel element will and won't go away without reprocessing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nuclear power plants run on explodey (fissile) atoms. But when the atoms are exploded, they get used up and stop being explodey. They're still burny (radioactive), so they're dangerous, and you can use the burny energy in other ways, but not in a nuclear reactor.</p></div>		</li>
