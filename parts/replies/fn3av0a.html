			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember as a kid I'd play hide and seek at night with my sister and friends (safe town and we had a large yard), the seeker would have a flashlight and we had to stay on the property for the rules of the game cause otherwise someone would go in the forest and get lost or someshit lol. I would almost always hide on the slope of a large ditch that was within the property and I remember literally shaking trying to contain my laughter when the seeker got near and couldn't find me. Not even a life or death situation, but the adrenaline was through the roof for child me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The parts of the sensory regions of the brain for the feet and the genitals are next to each other and there can be some leaking of signals - I hypothesise that this is why feet fetishes are relatively common...</p>
