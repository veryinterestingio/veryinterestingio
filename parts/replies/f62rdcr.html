			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s actually not true, small bugs are way smaller to us than bacteria are to them. What numbers did you use to determine this?</p>
<p>Bacteria are generally about a micron wide by a few microns long. A micron is 1/1000th a millimeter. There are tons of tiny bugs only a millimeter long. </p>
<p>So that tiny bug is 1/2000th the length of a 2m tall person, but a 3micron long bacteria is 1/300th the length of this bug. The bacteria is way bigger. Even if it was a small bacteria of only 0.5micron long, the ratio is still 1/2000, so it’s equivalent. </p>
<p>Bacteria at this scale can only fit a few wavelengths of visible light in their length, so resolving detail is pretty hard.</p>
<p>That’s why electron microscopes are so much better here. Instead of a relatively large light wave smearing detail, [I believe] you see the electric field generated by the electrons surrounding the atoms of the outermost atomic layer of the subject. That’s why it has to be a vacuum, because the particles generated to scan the subject will hit anything with that electric field. If you know more about electron microscopy please correct me/elaborate!</p></div>		</li>
