			<div class="markdown"><p>You're sort of correct. There are different types of nerves for sending different stimuli. For example, Meissner's corpuscles sense light touch and are very prevalent in the fingertips. Pacinian corpuscles sense vibration and pressure. Those mechanoreceptors send signals along different types of nerve fibers than thermoreceptors do. How a part of your body senses things is highly dependent on the concentration of those fibers traveling to specific areas of the body. This is why you have much better two point discrimination on your hand than you do on your upper arm. Since this is heavily conserved on an evolutionary scale, we can see that the parts of a primate designed to respond to temperature change are the hair follicles which cover other primates more fully than humans, it makes sense that the areas where primates have hair will have more thermoreceptors and vice versa.</p>
<p>In short, our hands are made for fine manipulation of tools and not for making hair stand up to keep in the heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus: our skin doesn't detect temperature in absolute values but in relation to it's own temperature. The torso is generally warmer (37°C) than the extremities. Anyone interested can test this by themselves using 3 bowls with water with 3 different temperatures. Cold, hot and lukewarm. One hand goes into the cold bowl, the other in the hot (not burning hot obviously) and then you put both hands in the lukewarm water. The hand from the hot bowl will sense it as cold and the other as warm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that has more to do with the fact that heat and cold have different receptors. Organs of Ruffini detect heat, end bulbs of Kraus detect cold. When you acclimate one hand to hot water and one hand to cold, what you are actually doing is stimulating one receptor, to the point of exhaustion- it eventually stops sending signals of “hot” or “cold” to the brain, because it has decided its time to ignore it (somewhat like tuning out an annoying but persistent noise). Then when you put both hands in the lukewarm water, the un-stimulated receptors in each hand start firing, while the “exhausted “ one doesn’t, so each hand feels the lukewarm water as the OPPOSITE of whatever temp water it was just in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We did an interesting and easy lab when studying this during A&amp;P. You need a partner and two things to poke each other with. Without looking, have your partner poke you with either one or two, and make a guess if it’s one or two things poking you. If you want to be really scientific about it, write down areas and approximate distances and whether the guess was right or wrong. Then switch so you both get to see it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The prison system showers were almost all just cold water till Alcatraz.
The prison being surrounded by cold water was less inviting to go for a swim by inmates that got used to having hot showers.
If you slowly run out of hot you can be totally immersed in cold in minutes and be able to stand it.
You can be used to ice cold showers if you do it enough.</p></div>		</li>
