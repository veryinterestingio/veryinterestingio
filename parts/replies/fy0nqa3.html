			<div class="markdown"><p>My fiancé and I both have children from previous relationships. Her son(6) is a high level extrovert and constantly needs contact and to be noticed. My son(8) is an extreme introvert and will leave the room if I walk in. My son has no problem sitting and playing by himself for hours. Her son loves to be around people. </p>
<p>The issue we run into is that her son feels left out of my son wants to be alone and my son feels overwhelmed by too much stimulation. I don’t know how to make her son feel ok without making mine feel sick. She described her son as a broken record because he can go for hours making noises and sometimes just screaming. Is there something we can do to help them connect? I’m trying to teach my son the clearly say he needs space. It’s difficult because they are so young. To make matters worse, I am an introvert and I sympathize with my son. She is an extrovert, and she sympathizes with her son. We both have difficulty understanding with the other one is going through. Any help would be greatly appreciated</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I totally understand. I've worked with children all ends of that &quot;spectrum&quot; and in between, too. Communication is always key though that's easier said than done. I'm sure you've already explained it to them anyway, but like explaining how everyone is different, how one feels left out and maybe not appreciated etc.. then to the other explain how not everyone feels comfortable  / happy with hanging out and talking lots.. how they need space to keep their &quot;energy&quot;, how it's great everyone is different in this world but we need to learn to a) understand the differences and be kind and b) try to find ways to accommodate these differences. </p>
<p>Like you could use an analogy that maybe one person doesn't like a certain cartoon but you watch it with them anyway to be kind to them. Because we have to think about others. It could be a great learning point for them both but it is tricky to think of others when young because the ego is not yet fully formed and thinking / empathising is not as easy. Partly due to life experiences, too.</p>
<p>You could try and slowly encourage social interactions. I'm wondering if something like group projects like a Lego set that they could do in silence, or with light music in the background, so they get used to playing together without necessarily talking lots.</p>
<p>Or having them in the same room with different activities. Maybe one building Lego and the other drawing / colouring / reading a book / other activity. </p>
<p>Obviously keeping stimuli low but getting them used to being in the same room together without necessarily even having to &quot;play&quot; together.</p>
<p>You could time it and increase it slowly. E.g. have them together for 5 minutes one day, then 10 etc.. </p>
<p>With introverts, having advance notice is less stressful. This is also the case for autism. Extroverts are more likely to thrive on changes etc. This is also the case for ADHD. However behaviour is certainly a spectrum and children are unique so there isn't always a single activity or plan that will work best.</p>
<p>I think setting up an activity, or even saying &quot;you guys are going to hang out for 10 minutes at X time&quot; would be helpful. Maybe stressing to the extrovert that it's going to be a &quot;quiet&quot; or &quot;calm&quot; activity. Like he can let off steam and run around etc before or after, but stress that he needs to do Lego, book reading or whatever for a quiet 10 mins.</p>
<p>For the introvert, explain the same and stick to the schedule. Then say &quot;don't worry, it will only be for 10 ins and then you can carry on. It is important for X because they feel lonely and want to play with you&quot;</p>
<p>It would be great to do a joint activity like Lego or a drawing together or even a board game, but I think the introvert might feel that's too taxing and stressful at first. Maybe in time because they will learn each other's boundaries.</p>
<p>I know lots of introvert and extrovert friends and children who are friends. When healthy, the introvert can feel energised and try new things from the energy of the extrovert and can help them stop being so &quot;in their head&quot; all the time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the extrovert gets out of it the calmness and enjoys their company instead of needing constant attention, excitement or constant activity.</p>
<p>It's beneficial for both but when young especially they will probably need to build up time, learn expectations, have some boundaries and also begin to empathise / understand another's differences. This can be tricky when young because they a) often think about themselves only and b) tend to think everyone is like them or has the same opinions and likes / dislikes! It's because their consciousness is still developing as is their ego and understanding that everyone is having a separate experience, that even people experience emotions differently. They are also learning still to control and detach from their thoughts, as adults can, which instead flow freely from the Id in children and even more intensely in more alert, active children. They are also processing so much information from the world which is why many children, and adults, can get overwhelmed and drained.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Imagine showing up to a job interview only to be told you would be interviewing as a group for 3 hours, for instance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've experienced that. Not for 3 hours, but what I thought was going to a one-on-one interview - that I was totally mentally prepared for and even looking forward to - ended up being a room full of people where we had to basically shout out answers to be heard by the interviewer. I only actually ended up getting the job as my friend already worked there. Otherwise it would have never happened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's everyone's interview nightmare really!! Even confident, extroverted people. I've had a friend who had that happen to her. She was not informed about that aspect and showed up to find it a lengthy group interview, complete with &quot;get to know you&quot; activities and &quot;talk about yourself for 2 minutes&quot; etc.!!</p>
<p>In new situations, especially stressful ones like interviews where you are on edge, it's natural for anyone to have heightened cortisol and adrenaline responses.</p>
<p>Glad you got the job though! :D</p></div>		</li>
