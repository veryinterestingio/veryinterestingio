<p>Is it only in grean-leaved plants or red ones also do that? </p></div>		</li>

Chloroplasts are green, therefore they require blue and red light as energy source but do not absorb the green light!</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is not accurate and green light can be more photosynthetically efficient at higher lighting levels. <a href="http://www.academia.edu/18406501/Green_Light_Drives_Leaf_Photosynthesis_More_Efficiently_than_Red_Light_in_Strong_White_Light_Revisiting_the_Enigmatic_Question_of_Why_Leaves_are_Green" target="_blank">This paper has been cited about 300 times so far explaining why.</a></p>
<p>Shot off my spectrometer showing <a href="http://i.imgur.com/tdKIr.jpg" target="_blank">about 88% green light absorption.</a> Around 80% green light absorption is pretty typical. Keep in mind that our eyes are much more biased towards green light with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photopic_vision" target="_blank">phototopic vision</a> and the peak reflectivity of green plant tissue is about the same as the peak sensitivity of our eyes.</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HandsOnComplexity/comments/28gp4e/space_bucket_with_a_high_power_green_led_and_a/" target="_blank">pole bean grown with green light</a> as an example of a plant grown with pure green light.</p>

<p>Do you have a source for this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. We see plants as green because they absorb less green than other visible wavelengths, but they still absorb a lot of it. Our eyes are just finely tuned to see color. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>to further this and add a visual comparison, a typical fillament light bulb is around 3000k (hotter than a fire in most cases) and <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yfKiKU01gzk/UB3lNk07tHI/AAAAAAAAGjI/t_cHAyLF8XU/s570/a.JPG" target="_blank">the relative spectral distribution of a lightbulb compared to solar radiation shows the difference</a>.</p>
<p>a fire would be even farther skewed towards infrared</p></div>		</li>
