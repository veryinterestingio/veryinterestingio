<p>Are these classified in some way that would make sense to a non-virologist? I ask because I've had enough colds in my life that I begin to recognise patterns: this is the one where my throat feels lumpy and swallowing hurts for a bit, this is the one where I just feel tired for a day or two and have a phlegmy cough, this is the one where I feel fine except an annoying dry cough that annoys my colleagues.</p></div>		</li>
