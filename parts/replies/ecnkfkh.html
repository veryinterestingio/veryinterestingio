			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple things here, first - the perception of &quot;mental effort&quot; doesn't necessarily correlate to actual levels of general brain activity. In other words, if I hate thinking hard about history, but love thinking hard about politics, then it could feel like my brain is &quot;working harder&quot; when Im thinking about history, when in fact it is actually more &quot;active&quot; and &quot;working harder&quot; as an organ when I am thinking hard about politics, even though it feels like I'm working less because I personally find that particular topic more interesting.</p>
<p>Thus, your question still assumes that the &quot;uncomfortableness&quot; your perceive is related to &quot;caloric expenditure&quot; in the same way that the physical discomfort you might feel when exercising is correlated to increased physical work and caloric expenditure.</p>
<p>So you're your question basically becomes: &quot;why is it uncomfortable to think about things that I don't like thinking about&quot;, which then becomes a question of which things you specifically find uncomfortable to think about, which is best answered in psychological terms.</p>
<p>In a literal biological sense the brain <em>is</em> always in a state of contemplation or computation - monitoring its surroundings and environment, vigilante for any threats that could cause the organism harm, controlling the beating of the heart, breathing, keeping balance as you walk, etc.</p>
<p>To give you a trivial example, if you (the brain) was in a constant state of what you are presumably referring to when you say &quot;thinking hard&quot;, then that doesn't include the mental/brain state(s) of sleeping. Or the mental state(s) associated with socializing and having fun. Or the mental state(s) of rest and relaxation. And while we don't know the exact reasons for sleep, we do know it is integral to the proper function of the organism and the brain. So in that case, the cost of &quot;constantly thinking hard&quot; would be an inability to sleep, and eventual death. And the cost of the mental state of &quot;thinking hard&quot; over the mental states of &quot;socializing&quot; would be the inability to find a mate and reproduce, which have obvious evolutionary costs.</p>
<p>Another example, constant rumination and contemplation may be associated with an increased risk for depression or autism phenotypes or certain other types of mental disorders that are demonstrably not advantageous to the individual, and would ultimately hurt their chances of reproducing.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the reason you find sustained thinking about certain things to be &quot;uncomfortable&quot; is better answered in terms of your unique preferences, tastes, interests and psychological makeup.</p>
<p>It isn't hard to imagine why the human organism (including it's brain) might find certain topics more pleasurable to think about or engage in versus others that are less immediately pleasurable or rewarding.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR: A better question is why you think the brain should necessarily encourage constant &quot;hard thinking&quot; about a topic like abstract linear algebra, versus  &quot;easy thinking&quot; about what you should eat for lunch, or how to make that girl you're interested in like you, or estimating the probability that the person following you down the alley wants to harm you, etc - all of them mental/brain states that have roughly the same metabolic and caloric cost, but some clearly with much more immediate and direct evolutionary benefits</strong></p></div>		</li>
