<p>The structure of the atom is quite amazing to contemplate when you convert the perception of it from “infinitesimally small” to “horizon stretching proportions”. If you were to expand the atom to the size of St. Peters some, the nucleus of the atom would be a grain of salt, and the orbits of the electron cloud would stretch throughout the expanse of empty space that the dome encapsulates. Much like planets orbiting the sun, there is plenty of room for asteroids to slip through and never hit a planet. </p>
<p>That being said, if all the empty space in every atom in the human body were to be “removed”, a person could fit on the tip of a pin. </p>
<p>The universe is extremely strange!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As gp was pointing out, these &quot;particles&quot; don't really have a physical size: they are interacting fields. It's not really to do with the gap between the protons and electrons. It's to do with how the fields react with the incoming fields. A gravitation wave is hardly affected by an atom. An electric field strongly interacts with another electric field (like that of electrons and protons).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An even easier way to think of gravity as a difference in potential.</p>
<p>Mass displaces spacetime similar to how a heavy ball causes displacement on a sheet of cloth as seen in experiments like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTY1Kje0yLg" target="_blank">this</a> where a cloth is pulled tight round a drum and a large mass is put in the middle to create a cone.</p>
<p>On a flat plane, everything is pretty neutral, it just sits there.</p>
<p>Displace that plane with mass, and other objects will fall towards it. I know that's using gravity to visualize gravity, but it is a visual aid not a definition.</p>
<p>Now we can move on to your question:  </p>
<p>At scale, a smaller marble doesn't care if there's another marble behind or in front of it, they're both within the depression(distortion field) so they both fall. ^^^provided ^^^they ^^^don't ^^^have ^^^enough ^^^inertia ^^^from ^^^whatever ^^^caused ^^^them ^^^to ^^^drift ^^^into ^^^the ^^^region</p>
<p>Now, technically they all exert forces on each other by tiny amounts, but at scale their influence is negligible compared to the big mass in the middle.</p>
<p>If you really want to warp your brain, there are examples with breakfast cereal that do the same concept, but twice over.</p>
<p>Water repellent things(dry bits that aren't water logged yet) sitting on top of the surface tension create divots that other things will fall into, and the same is true of the water-logged bits that still float due to buoyancy, they'll stick together because they're below the barrier.  This is why cereal bits stick together while on top of and when beneath the milk's surface.</p>
<p>That tangent aside...</p>
<p>Now, with gravity, this force applies in all directions, which is why everything celestial is mostly spherical....[<em>Mostly</em> except where structural bonds are stronger than the pull of gravity(mountains or buildings or small bodies like asteroids), or where rotation causes a bit of equatorial distortion.]</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure I understand. You're saying gravity can &quot;pass through&quot; objects because every object has gaps in-between its atoms where gravity can pass through?</p>
<p>I don't think gravity is like sound or light in that it needs to travel from source to target before it has an effect</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, I assumed it was instantaneous.</p>
<p>Still, do we know of anything at all that could block gravity? Your explanation of gaps in atoms seems to suggest that gravity <em>could</em> be blocked if only there were no gaps. Am I misunderstanding your original comment?</p></div>		</li>

<p>We don't know the exact mechanism of gravity but we know by observation that it travels. If the sun disappeared we'd still see it for 8 minutes, and we'd still orbit its previous location for 8 minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A field is actually a concept from mathematics, it is something which has a value at all points in space. Like temperature can be thought of as a field, each point in space within say an oven will have its own temperature. The space can have any number of dimensions, 1d, 2d, 3d, etc. The value can be a number, a vector, a matrix or really anything. Fields can also change over time.</p>
<p>In certain cases fields are used as calculation tools, like the gravitational field in the context of Newtonian gravity, it doesn’t necessarily need to exist because it’s completely determined by the masses at all times.</p>
<p>In other cases like electromagnetism the fields themselves are real. The electromagnetic field cannot be completely determined by the positions and velocities of charges so you wouldn’t have complete information of the system without knowing the field, in that sense it has an independent existence.</p></div>		</li>
