			<div class="markdown"><p>So just to make sure I understand the concept of bonds: The reason people invest in bonds is because it's  basically just a &quot;place&quot; to put money to garner interest? The idea being that you'll eventually get that same amount back, plus interest, so why not? But I guess that's why you'd have to consider what's going on with the country you're buying bonds from: Depending on how volatile its economy is, the interest rates might fluctuate, or they may not be able to pay you back (does this ever happen?).</p>
<p>And it benefits the countries because then they get money that they need right away.</p>
<p>Am I understanding this correctly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Sovereign debt is one of the safest forms of investment, which is why a lot of old people and pensions etc. like to hold those bonds instead of, say, stocks (which are very volatile and have no guarantee of repayment).</p>
<p>However, to answer your question, there are cases when governments default on their sovereign debt. This is usually the result of a long term recession, corruption, government mismanagement, etc. This has not happened recently to any major developed economy, but is fairly regular within the developing world (one every year or two). When this happens, bondholders can be left with nothing or can get a smaller portion of what they're owed, depending on how bad the situation is.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can think of bonds very similarly to stocks. They are just a more stable form of investment. There is a bond market where you buy and sell bonds according to the market price. Just like stocks. You could also buy the bond initially and hold onto it till the end, but you do not need to. Bonds come from every level of government. From cities to states and at the federal level. They are essential to civil society, for both bondholders and bond issuers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The distinction being that bonds have a legal obligation to pay out after a fixed amount of time, while stock returns are largely based on secondary transactions (and, to a lesser extent, dividends / repurchases / M&amp;A)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I was thinking about this.
And it is true that individuals would have a tendency to hold others accountable for what is owed to them. But it doesn't make a lot of sense, because when the sh*t hits the fan, then everyone in the country is pretty much screwed.</p>
<p>So the government represents the people, which, in a sense, means it is the people. We vote to place people in positions where they can make choices that represent our interests. The government is not supposed to feel as a separate entity from the people. Officials are selected from the people by the people to represent the people and their needs and desires. Then it makes no sense that internal debt leads you to systemic failure. </p>
<p>Everything suffers: hospitals, education, electrical power, roads, bureocracy, etc. Everything takes a toll when governments find themselves unable to cope with their economic obligations and it would seem in the interest of the people, through their representatives in government, to forgive themselves and lose cash as to live in a country that can function. When things get too critical, it seems priorities should change, even without direct input from the people or the people they have chosen to represent them through government institutions.</p>
<p>I think this is why the explanation of &quot;countries are in debt with its own people&quot; feels a little incomplete for me. I mean, I understand the system while it is working, but when massive debt affects the functioning of basic services, then for the regular citizen it must start to seem more appealing to not hold itself accountable for the debt that it has against itself in the interest of living in a functioning place since, what good is money if I cannot use it to purchase basic services? I would forgive myself my own debt if that debt was the barrier for me to get the services that money is primarily intended to purchase. </p>
<p>Well, a few obvious things came to mind: 1) forgiving debt just like that would probably defeat the purpose of the entire system and &quot;let's revamp the economic system&quot; is way easier said than done; 2) temporary discomfort and lack of services may very well be worth future value. However, these obvious things seem obvious only while things are still somewhat functioning and seem to lose its obviousness as things become more and more grim as they have in certain countries. It would seem increasingly more rational to forgive yourself your own debt to yourself as things turn to the worse. Then comes another aspect to consider: people are not really rational and would fight teeth and nail for their property. But maybe we could all get together, talk it through and see if we can all, through the people from within the people that the people have chosen to represent the people, come to a more satisfactory arrangement that doesn't feel like a form of seppuku. </p>
<p>Well, I am overthinking the answer of &quot;who is the government in debt to,&quot; but I feel I need to overthink it because it seems that the answer that people are in debt to themselves is lacking some depth.</p>
<p>I would forgive my own debt to myself if that meant I am preventing myself through my own actions of performing self-harm.......... And then it hit me: I have no bonds to my name. </p>
<p>So (and I posted this here because I liked /u/ReshKayden answer), after googling and figuring out that only 1% of households (and maybe that term may not wholly represent the diversity of ways an individual may hold assets) hold bonds in the US, it Seems I was sometimes thinking in global terms, seeing people as one cohesive group with common interests, and other times as individuals with diverging interests. And only when I realized that was when &quot;the country is indebted to itself&quot; finally made sense to me and I decided to post this because it really took me a while to understand that what we consider a country (and, of course, the government and central bank that represents and service it) is a large group of individual actors that sometimes agree to behave in accordance to common interests and sometimes behave in accordance to diverging interests. It feels now so obvious, but I really had to think about it to get me out of the mentality of &quot;but people are just hurting themselves!&quot; (which may be true to certain extent, but is not really the way we must see it). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A great comment, and you’re right about most of it.  But realize a LOT of stuff is backed up by treasury bonds.  The entire Social Security system, for example, is invested in US treasuries to pay out to future retirees, because they’re considered the safest, if not the most lucrative, place to invest that money.  So it indirectly affects way more than 1%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes of course, and that is exactly like that little thread on your t-shirt that when you pull it it unravels the fabricnuntil you are naked.
Bonds are hold by a minority (albeit a large one at it, since 1% of 300 MM is a lot of people), but the economic system affects everybody. And I think that is why it was so hard for me to initially grasp it, because everybody is affected by it, and everybody is supposed to have access to the system, but in practice most people affected do not (choose to?) participate in the system that affects them.</p>
<p>So it is worldwide (as foreign investment, exports, and imports make economies intertwine with each other) and directly and indirectly affects 100% of the world population, but only a small percentage of that population actively participates in the system, be it due to ignorance, unwillingness or inability. The ultimate reality is that it affects all, but is a system that works by having governments represent everybody, but it is as if a subgroup of citizens borrows from another, and everybody lives with the consequences of whatever everybody does. So we are stuck together for some stuff, and not so stuck for some other stuff.</p>
<p>I didn't want to say 1% because I know that specific proportion has connotations that transcend this discussion (coincidence?), but anyways it means that ~53% of US debt is owed to ~1% of the US population. So whatever affects everyone comes from a system that affects and is available to everyone but that in practicality is used only by a &quot;small&quot; group of people.</p>
<p>And maybe that's why it was initially so difficult to grasp for me, because I was thinking just in terms of all citizens owing to all citizens, which is probably a wrong way to see it. So yeah, it absolutely affects everybody and even across international borders and even if the global number of people participating in the different securities markets is even below 1% (a personal perception, so I have absolutely no way to back that number up). </p>
<p>I mean, the entire world is in debt to the entire world, but in the end is not the world VS. the world, is more like a portion of the world VS. another portion of the world. It affects everybody for sure, and the system is in place because everybody (?) agrees with it, but not everybody is actively participating in it in a way that everybody should feel as if everybody is in debt with everybody.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the concise fundamental logic goes like this: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Money isn't a 'thing', but an accounting relationship (credit/debt). For someone to have monetary savings (financial asset), someone else must be in debt by that amount (financial liability). If I have $5 in my checking account, that means the bank owes me $5 of value. If I hold a $5 bill in my pocket, that means the federal government owes me $5 of value. A whole system of interlocking balance sheets &amp; IOUs throughout the monetary economy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People like having money savings in monetary economies. But with <a href="https://imgur.com/hoU8Pbc" target="_blank">financial assets/liabilities being zero-sum</a>, it doesn't work too well on the backs of people's private debt which is very limited. So it ends up working really well to create a 'government' entity that can indefinitely/infinitely go into debt, which the people/firms get to hold as savings. This government entity is just an accounting construct -- it's not right to think of the US federal government as a stand-in for all the people in the US collectively. Its liabilities aren't our liabilities, they're our assets.</p>
</li>
<li>Usually the more indebted someone is, the less valuable their debt is. But a (stable) national government is an entity that never dies, that issues IOU debt denominated in its own made-up currency, and has the authority to levy taxes on all citizens each year forever. So everyone values government liabilities (because they can be collected and used to pay taxes), and everyone knows that everyone else values them too, so it functions as a widely accepted money for even payment of anything, not just taxes.</li>
</ul>
<p>So our two major gut-notions are wrong (that 'debt' sounds like a bad thing to be avoided, and that the government's debt is basically 'our' debt). The other smokescreen which leads to confusion is the way they set up the treasury &amp; central bank as ostensibly separate entities which pretend to be subject to market forces (i.e. the treasury issuing bonds which pay interest that they swap for central bank reserves before spending). We call treasury liabilities 'government debt' but don't call central bank liabilities 'government debt'. But they're both government-issued IOUs that pay their chosen policy interest rate.</p>
<p>You noticed that you don't hold any treasury bonds. But as an example: if you work in the military, the government goes into debt to pay you a paycheck of savings. It's just hidden behind a 2-3 layer system. You hold money in a checking account, while your bank holds the treasury bonds. It's your savings and the government's debt, while your bank's balance sheet nets to zero.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let’s say you own a treasury bond at 2% interest on a 10-year term.  That 10 years comes around and the government now has to pay you.  But let’s say it can’t!  It doesn’t have the cash.</p>
<p>Unlike you as a private citizen, the government could just print cash and pay you with that.  But you really don’t want them to.  When governments print money, there is now more money in circulation, which makes that money (and thus your payout) worth a little less.</p>
<p>Creditors hate this.  This means if your government gets the reputation of printing money to pay off debt, less people want to loan them money in the future, meaning the government has to offer even <em>higher</em> payouts to get anyone to do so.</p>
<p>This can become a doom spiral if you’re not careful.  Print money to pay off debt, because you don’t have the cash, and it becomes more expensive and harder to pay off in the future.  So governments have to print more, driving it even higher.  That’s how you end up with 7,000,000% inflation like Zimbabwe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Federal governments have the sole authority to credit businesses’ and people’s accounts out of thin air. When the federal government “spends” money, they don’t print cash. They simply credit the accounts of whom they’re paying. When the government collects taxes, they’re not using to “pay” for spending or their debt. They’re burning it up. Taxes allow the federal government to control the money supply as needed and to partially control relative income and wealth among people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude you’re just wrong. Taxes don’t take money out of circulation, they take money from the population and give it to the government so it can be spent on things like infrastructure, the military, foreign relations etc. The federal reserve, which is independent of the rest of the government, controls the money supply by either printing money and distributing it or by selling their stockpile of bonds to collect cash and then hold on to it. That’s how money is taken out of circulation. It’s in the hands of economists, not politicians, at least in the United States. Remember a few weeks ago how trump flipped out at the federal reserve for raising interest rates and tried to figure out if he could fire the chairman? The answer was no he could not because the chairman doesn’t work for the president or congress. Neither of them get a say in the decisions the central bank makes because it’s been shown time and time again that politicians are incapable of making decisions like that and caused numerous financial disasters through the 1800s into the early 1900s when the fed was set up to take the reins away from them.</p></div>		</li>
