			<div class="markdown"><p>A big part of wound repair is often apoptosis, or intentional cell death. For complex organisms, destroying and metabolizing damaged cells is (generally) the most pragmatic option.</p>
<p>Damaged cells provide food and landing sites for infection. They are a major liability for an organism, particularly as permitting damaged cells to 'attempt' healing opens a time window for infection, which will obstruct later immune responses by simple mechanics (bacteria and its waste blocks healthy circulation). It's better for an organism to grind up those cells and absorb the energy itself, before bacteria does. </p>
<p>This is why washing wounds is so critical--you want to slough off as much debris as possible, even at the risk of damaging more cells (to a point). That way, there is a thin layer of dead cells and debris, rather than a large clump that separates damaged cells from being metabolized by healthy cells. Living cells have better barriers to keep bacteria from feeding off them. But dead and damaged cells are a real buffet.</p>
<p>Let me know if I should better explain something. I worked in wound healing research for the better half of a decade, and it's a really fascinating field. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm curious about your thought on using hydrogen peroxide. I've heard some people say you shouldn't use it and just use water or soapy water. What are your thoughts about that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sail boat comparison really solidified the concept for me. Mitigate the damage to the point that repairs can begin, get the stuff that doesn't belong inside back outside, and complete the repairs. But, at some point, the boat's going down and there's nothing anyone can do about it.</p></div>		</li>
