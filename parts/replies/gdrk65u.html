<p>Taking <a href="https://divediscover.whoi.edu/archives/expedition13/interviews/divers.html" target="_blank">a trip on Alvin</a> to the bottom of the ocean was literally the biggest privilege and honor of my professional life. There, I realized that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_who_have_walked_on_the_Moon" target="_blank">more people have been to the Moon</a> than to where I went!</p>
<p>So, in case it's not obvious, I'm in the camp that in situ human visitation is essential for scientific research.</p>
<p>IMO, on a practical level, you get much quicker reaction times when working at the place, and by looking through the porthole the live, three-dimensional view gives you unmatched situational awareness that virtual reality doesn't come close to. Much work can indeed be done remotely and the technology is progressing rapidly, but there is a role for vehicles like Alvin.</p>
<p>More qualitatively speaking, I believe science is ultimately a very human endeavour, and humans <em>are emotional and subjective</em> which I think scientists (who are humans!) should acknowledge and embrace. Many scientific discoveries and insights are spontaneous and/or serendipitous, and they partly rely on the &quot;feeling&quot; you have for a given topic. I can tell you that being on Alvin <em>definitely</em> gives you a totally different &quot;feel&quot; for what you're studying!</p>
<p>On a related note, NASA's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program" target="_blank">interstellar Voyager space probes</a> were a huge inspiration for me going into science. Our robotic representatives have opened our eyes to a universe of scientific discoveries and gave us a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot" target="_blank">new perspective on the planet we share</a>. However, that doesn't mean there's no use for <em>human</em> space exploration! (I'm clearly not an astronomer or space-scientist, just my personal opinion!)</p></div>		</li>
