<p>Solar cells are also limited  by thermodynamics, in a principle called the Shockley-Queisser limit .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's rather generalized. Shockley-Queisser includes a number of terms, some of which are thermodynamic in nature (ie recombination) and others that are quantum-mechanical in nature (ie spectrum limits from single pn junctions).</p>
<p>You could, theoretically, make a infinitely varying junction solar cell that did not have any spectrum losses, including both bandgap losses and thermalization losses. That would be a much fairer comparison to the Carnot limit which instead has the engine work infinitely slowly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the good answer with numbers to back it up through thermodynamics.</p>
<p>To add some other numbers and considerations, for thermoelectric generators, they're around 5-8% efficient. From what I recall, part of their challenge is just a really high internal resistance (might be a simplification as I don't recall looking at the solid-state/stat-mech analysis).</p>
<p>And another similar technology are piezoelectric generators, which use mechanical stress on materials with certain crystal lattice properties to generate a voltage. They suffer similar issues to thermoelectric generators but have seen some applications in small power draw - e.g. wireless light switches, and some use in... vanity power generation - e.g. step plates in subway turnstyles and speed bumps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to be the pedant leaping in on a basically accurate post.<br />
The temperature of a coal flame is close to 2000 째C and the Carnot efficiency if you could use all that heat is around 85% . The steam temperature is limited by the &quot;slump temperature&quot; where the metal gets weak (around 600 째C.) </p>
<p>Combined-cycle natural gas turbines have a Brayton cycle (basically a jet engine bolted down) and the exhaust is over 600 째C, hot enough to boil and superheat water, so they run a steam turbine off the exhaust of the gas turbine. so they use all the heat from 1400 째C to nearly-room-temperature. Theoretically something like 82% possible; in practice somewhere around 62% which is still pretty impressive.<br />
(To answer the next question, you can't run a combined-cycle plant on coal because little bits of flaming powdered coal hit the turbine blades at high speed and destroy them. Maybe someone built one somehow, but not that I know of. )</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup.  All good info: I chose not to cover the fuel-burning side of the story since the question was about extracting energy from steam specifically.</p></div>		</li>
