<p>Time passes slower for the denser object, but time is still passing at the same rate for the observer in the experiment...</p>
<p>Ugh what do I know I am confused now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Scott Kelly spent a year in space orbiting the earth at 27,000 km per hour and when he came back due to relativistic time dilation, he was 8.6 miliseconds younger. that's for a difference of 27000 km/hr and a duration of a year. in this object experiment the time difference can't even be measured.</p></div>		</li>
