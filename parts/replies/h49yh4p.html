			<div class="markdown"><p>Also: DirectX. Before this time, there was no such thing as a standardized, non-proprietary interface between graphics hardware and software. Before this, every major video card maker had its own software, which was making a total mess of things. For the consumer, it meant one game would have totally different features and performance if you had one video card chipset versus another (even if same relative hardware cost/power). For software developers, they had to invest a lot more time if they wanted broad support across chipsets and features. </p>
<p>Interestingly, people <strong>hated</strong> DirectX when it was brand new. It made all non-DX compliant cards obsolete, even ones people had just paid hundreds of dollars for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, I didn't specifically bring up DirectX (though I just mentioned it in another comment) because I don't think it released with Win95. It had kind of a slow burn. I see it officially released about a month after Win95, but I don't think it had much traction until big games were using it. A big milestone was Doom95 in 1996, officially the first published DirectX game, and it was still a year or so after that before games started using it widespread. 1996's Quake ultimately used OpenGL for its acceleration, etc. </p>
<p>I don't remember DirectX really being a big factor until Win98 had been firmly established! I imagine the catalyst there was the rapid collapse of 3dfx causing a lot of people with expensive graphics cards to see the value of an abstracted interface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, it was a slow burn. But then, &quot;multimedia&quot; and &quot;plug and play&quot; were just as slow. What new multimedia capabilities did day one Win95 have? Not a lot. Plug and play meant little when very few hardware makers yet conformed to MS or newborn industry standards. I remember it very well, a lot of manual configuration was still required, especially for less-common hardware like SCSI devices. Loads better than Win3x/DOS, though. </p>
<p>Not that this is Microsoft's fault. These are major technologies that require entire industries to change. It doesn't happen quickly or easily. Microsoft showed amazing sense and foresight. Wish they still were =/</p></div>		</li>

<p>OpenGL existed four years prior to Direct3D, and Direct3D is actually proprietary, unlike OpenGL.</p></div>		</li>

Dos was amazing.  Windows 3 was like next level, and by windows 95, I thought they had perfected home computing. </p>
<p>Then Windows ME came out, and I was certain that 95 was still the pinnacle.  Haha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation and on point. I worked at CompUSA when this came out and one thing I would point out to OP's question in terms of being a 90s pop culture touchstone is that to showcase the multimedia aspect you've mentioned, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqi2Jy0UMiA&amp;ab_channel=Stupid1519" target="_blank">a brand new music video from a nerdy-looking band named Weezer</a> was included in the OS.</p></div>		</li>
