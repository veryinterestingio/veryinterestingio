			<div class="markdown"><p>also, at least for me, what helps a lot with the hangover is eating, preferrably something meaty/greasy before going to sleep. the difference in the next day is... night and day. often even the difference between puking the next day, and just feeling slight stomach unease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You will be ok while your liver is healthy and as long as you don't go on multi-day benders. If you drink a lot and often though, you will wear your liver out and that's when bad withdrawals will happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The withdrawal has nothing to do with the liver damage from chronic alcohol abuse.</p>
<p>The withdrawal comes from up regulation of excitatory neurons in the brain in response to the chronic presence of the depressant ethanol.</p>
<p>This is what causes seizures and DT.</p>
<p>The dependence on ethanol develops much much faster than the chronic liver damage.</p>
<p>You can be drunk for 2 months straight, and die from a seizure after stopping cold turkey, but your liver would still be fine if you slowly weaned yourself off and let it recover for a few weeks.</p></div>		</li>
