			<div class="markdown"><p>An elephant is made of zillions of tiny magnets pointing in random directions. Some push some pull, the ones that point north tend to cancel out the ones pointing south and so on.</p>
<p>In a metal bar magnet somebody has tweaked the atoms so they point in the same direction so they work together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the magnetic susceptibility (how much a substance is affected by a magnetic field) of a paperclip (or anything made of iron) is much higher than an elephant. There is a weak attraction felt by the tissues in an elephant, but the susceptibility is so much lower that it's almost imperceptible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>... no not quite.. The magnetic force is basically electrons in motion.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>An electron has a negatively charged electric force and a proton has a positively charged electric force.  </li>
<li>In comparison to the force of  gravity which all particles with mass have, one particle with gravitic force attracts another, and there’s no positive or negative.</li>
<li>this means for instance if you drop a ball, technically the ball and the earth attract eacch other, and both move (relative to their mass) towards each other.</li>
<li>But gravity is accumulative, i.e. you can put things with mass together, and they will have more mass, thus more gravity to pull in more particles with mass, and so on and so forth.  </li>
<li>The weirdness of the positive and negative electric forces is that negative particles force other negative particles <strong>away</strong>, same with positive  particles forcing other positive particles <strong>away</strong>, but negative particles  <strong>attract</strong> positive particles and vice versa. </li>
<li>This means when the electron is zooming around an atom a lot of the +/-  forces neutralises itself between them, but there’s almost always some asymmetry because the electron can only be in one place around the atom (in a simplified model),  and so the other side of the atom will actually have some positive force leaking out into space that’s not neutralised by the electron on  the other side.</li>
<li>You can also look at this from the point of view from the electron,  the proton can only be on one side of the electron, so the negative  force must leak a little into the space where the proton isn’t.  </li>
<li>This creates then a yin/yang pattern that rotates at the speed of the electron spinning around the atom, and in certain elements the crystal  structure synchronises the atoms so they all spin the same way and these little rotating fluctuations get amplified into the magnetic force.</li>
</ul>
<p>So.. can a magnet be used up?  Not technically, no.. but because negative electric forces only attract positive electric forces, and they cancel each other, you can cancel the magnetic forces.. neutralise them.  So if you have a 1 microTesla magnet, you can technically only attract 1 microtesla worth of opposing electric force and that's it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Demagnetisation is connected to the crystal structure getting broken down (heat) not the magnetic property itself as magnets is just the electric +/- force in motion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if magnets are effectively electrons in motion, does that mean that a magnet brought to absolute 0 would lose its magnetic properties?</p>
<p>Or would the crystal structure of the magnet break down due to loss of so much heat?</p>
<p>And if the magnet brought to absolute 0 does lose its magnetic properties, would bringing it back to room temperature restore them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, i might sound really stupid and i am not even sure it’s like this but since electric engines use electricity to create a magnet, why wouldn’t it work to just use magnets and have them spin with no need for electricity?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A magnet can't get used up, but the potential energy stored in its magnetic field can be. If you move two magnets (which are north/south attracted) away from each other, you've put energy into the system. When you let go, that energy is used to move them back together. In that way, you've &quot;used up&quot; the energy stored in the magnetic field. However, that energy can be regained by moving them apart again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Magnetism is a vector complete field. So you are correct. (In the real world, it’s only the non-ideal characteristics that lead to entropy losses of a magnets potential, not the ‘work’ itself)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't like the answers that you got. Gravity doesn't use energy to hold a book to a table. Lifting the book fights gravity, dropping the book uses gravity.</p>
<p>Magnets don't use energy to stick to metal. Pulling the metal away from the magnet takes energy to fight the magnetism, and releasing the metal and having it get drawn towards the magnet uses the magnetic field/energy.</p>
<p>Gravity doesn't get used up (you can lift that book a thousand times) and Magnets don't get used up (there are permanent Magnets in electric motors that get cycled thousands of times an hour)</p>
<p>Sorry if you were already happy with your answers or if you were just calling out the guy you responded to for being confusing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow-up questions if you don’t mind</p>
<p>Since there are possibly infinite amount of objects in the universe, does that mean each magnet has an infinite amount of potential energy? Even if as you say the potential energy is minuscule for distant objects, it should still add up to infinity as anything multiplied by infinity is infinity</p>
<p>Also, where does the potential energy “come” from? Since energy can’t be created out of nowhere nor destroyed, what energy is converted into the potential energy of the magnet?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, just like earth and every other object has gravitional potential energy with regards to each other, so have magnets with magnetic potential energy (but it depends on 'how magnetic' other objects are)</p></div>		</li>
