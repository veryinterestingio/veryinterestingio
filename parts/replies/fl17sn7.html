<p>Washing with soap, on the other hand? That's scraping up the houses and trees and the dirt under them down to the bedrock and <em>hurling it all into outer space.</em></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Also, I don't really care whether I have oil, dead skin cells etc on my hands. Those are all fine and even beneficial. I'm still going to use soap though, because it chemically dissolves nasty stuff like viruses.</p></div>		</li>
