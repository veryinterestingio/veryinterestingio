			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lyttle" target="_blank">William Lyttle, the Mole Man of Hackney</a>.</p>
<p>Dude spend like 40 years digging tunnels. They connected to the underground train lines, the water table, and reached up to 60ft long. </p>
<p>They removed 33 tonnes of crap from his house (because thats where he kept it -his garden and the house, because all he did was tunnel) including cars and a boat. </p>
<p>In the end the council evicted him, filled the tunnels with concrete and charged him 300k to cover the cost.</p></div>		</li>

<p>After this, Lyttle was moved to a hotel for three years, before being rehoused in an apartment in a high-rise building. He was put on the top floor, to discourage tunnelling. While there he knocked a hole in a dividing wall between two rooms.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. Here in NM water rights are a huge issue, and one problem is that developers will buy them from poorer areas of the state, then try to take water in richer areas. Which then messes all sorts of things up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Guy here buys land with water in a western state and leaves it to his son.  There is a small stream running through the middle.  The guy had water rights to the stream.   The son sells land on one side of the stream to a group of doctors who want to have hunting land and build a cabin.   They sign everything and then the seller says, 'What are you guys going to do for water?'   And the doctors say 'Just take some from the stream'.   Seller says 'You don't own a drop of that water.'    Oops.   That will be $60,000 more if you want a sliver of the water rights.  Doctors paid it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>IRL, no real estate agent would show a parcel that doesn't have a reliable water source.</p></div>		</li>
