			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, that was extra helpful in addition to other explanations. You added the hypothetical where (say) the Sun was black and invisible, and we counted the days by some other stars. And then we'd have 366 days! Cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also turns out that, in 400 years, we need 97 leap days, not 100. This is the reason that 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not leap years, despite the fact that they're divisible by 4. In the Gregorian calendar, century years are not leap years unless they're divisible by 400. (ex. 2000, 2400, 2800)</p></div>		</li>
