<p>It's not like you could shield a detector against either at all.</p>
<p>An alternative to directional sensitivity is looking for yearly variations - we expect a slightly higher hit rate when Earth's orbital motion is &quot;forward&quot; with respect to the Sun's orbital motion around the galaxy. It needs a very good control over other seasonal effects, however, that makes this method problematic.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I knew that, and for some reason the thought of shielding it against both just made me laugh internally, so I couldn't bring myself to write it. No idea why.</p>
<p>I believe the dark matter wind/annual modulation was observed by DAMA, but not by other groups (?), so yeah it's got some problems as is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, DAMA sees <em>something</em>, but their claim is in conflict with detectors orders of magnitude more sensitive that see nothing. It is most likely some other seasonal effect. That's the difficulty with this approach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These yearly variations sound like a good idea, <del>our speed in the galaxy's reference frame must vary between 170 km/s and 230 km/s (adding Earth's speed and Sun's speed)</del>. But how does that work for detection? If you detect n interactions during the low season and N during the high season, this doesn't mean than N-n interactions are WIMPs and the rest are neutrinos, does it? Is it really that simple?</p>
<p>(I'm assuming solar neutrinos are pretty constant since their directions is (almost) perpendicular to our orbit, and galactic neutrinos should also be pretty constant since their speed, undistinguishable from c, is 3 orders of magnitude faster than ours, right?)</p>
<p>Edit: I just remembered that Earth's orbital plane isn't coincident with the galactic plane, and in fact it's almost perpendicular, so I striked that part through to avoid confusing whoever glances over this thread. The real numbers will not vary that much and stay closer to the Sun's speed of 200 km/s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neutrinos shouldn't have a yearly variation apart from the eccentricity of Earth's orbit (3% difference for solar neutrinos, and well-known), while the dark matter contribution should vary a lot (~10%).</p>
<p>Neglecting the eccentricity here: You detect k neutrinos per time in both cases but 1.1 m and 0.9 m dark matter events: N=k+1.1 m, n = k + 0.9 m. Solve: m = (N-n)/0.2. What you really do of course is take the multi-year data and fit both numbers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>directionally sensitive.</p>

<p>How would that take Earth's motion into account? The direction that solar neutrinos are coming from circles every 24h. I've read that these xenon tanks must be kept cooler than 1ºK, so rotating them sounds like a bad idea...</p>
<p>Also directional sensitivity wouldn't be able to do anything against galactic neutrinos. Can we assume their abundance is low enough to neglect them since the other stars are so far away?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Directionality lets you reject primarily solar neutrinos. Since we know where the Sun is at all times if you ever observe an interaction in your detector that is pointing away from the Sun you assume that event is from a solar neutrino rather than dark matter. But if you observed an interaction that is pointing back towards the sun, then you can be nearly certain that the interacting particle was not a solar neutrino. </p>
<p>Here's an example of the solar neutrino directionality spectrum as observed by the Super-K detector <a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/1242573/files/icrc2013-0048-01.png" target="_blank">http://inspirehep.net/record/1242573/files/icrc2013-0048-01.png</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Got it. What I wasn't considering is that you can detect the direction a particle is coming from rather than just &quot;event or no event&quot;.</p>
<p>Quite clear now, thanks!</p></div>		</li>
