			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm...I have had huge anxiety issues all my life. I work in security, first as a guard, now as security managment for a large company. With every different experience in security, I got better at handling the situations. Now I can recognize and reassure people on my team of what to do in certain situations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this, I used to be absolutely terrified of talking on the phone - I would freeze up, stutter and never know what to say even if it was just ringing up to make a doctors appointment. I decided the best way to get over this would be to get a job based around talking on the phone, so I got a job as a 999 call handler. No phone call has ever been as stressful as the ones I took working there, so now I have no issues ringing people and talking to them. Kind of like exposure therapy I guess</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, exposure therapy really is one of the best ways to combat this. </p>
<p>Also, alcohol works but I strongly recommend not using it as a crutch. Been there done that. 9 months sober.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heres the NHS website on anxiety. even if you're not british the NHS website is a good source of free advice on most health subjects.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/understanding-panic/" target="_blank">https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/understanding-panic/</a></p>
<p>You can also try self-help CBT </p>
<p><a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/drugs-and-treatments/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/about-cbt/" target="_blank">https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/drugs-and-treatments/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/about-cbt/</a></p>
<p>again a british organisation but the websites free and im sure you could find a local equivalent.</p>
<p>failing self help find yourself a therapist if you can or your GP, you're worth it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Practice...practice, practice.   I can tell you that because I, just like you, would get tongue tied at the drop of a hat, talk to a girl my voice vox would shut down completely, talk in front of class I would tremble...even at work, during meetings I couldn't manage to get my ideas across. </p>
<p>Interestingly enough, there is a group that specializes in just this.  If you are lucky there is a group in your town, or nearby city.  Toastmasters, they can turn you from a &quot;I can't string two words together mess&quot;  to a polished social speaker,  trust me on this.  </p>
