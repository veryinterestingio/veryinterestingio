<p>It's cheaper than building twice as much storage &amp; distribution infrastructure. And so you don't get sick drinking in the shower.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Water treatment to the required standards requires many millions of dollars in infrastructure, the more water you use the more capacity you need the more taxes you must pay.</p>

<p>That's absolutely not true. The contamination of the water is what makes it expensive, not the amount of water. To a point, flushing additional water makes the treatment easier. The infrastructure (depending on the design) also needs a minimum flow to avoid problems with build-up and hygiene.</p>
<p>Most municipalities in Germany need to flush the sewers regularly since Germans have gotten so good at conserving water that they block up if they don't do it.</p>
<p>The average German uses very little water though, about 123 litres a day, compared to about 300 litres per day for Americans. And we wouldn't even need to conserve water that badly, it's very abundant here.</p></div>		</li>
