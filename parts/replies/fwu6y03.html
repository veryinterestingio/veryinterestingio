<p>I watched my dad play music his whole life and made quite a bit of money as a side gig. Never could read a lick of it. Always say in front of a cassette player and played back the song over and over until he learned it. </p>
<p>Sorry for getting a bit off topic he passed away 2 weeks ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also important to add that professional classical musicians don't have a lot of rehearsal time as a group. The groups I've performed in as a bassoonist get together 1-5 times to rehearse before a performance. I've had plenty of performances where the only time we've met as a group was the night before and we only had an hour to go through everything. So when we are in rehearsal we have to move fast and write down everything the conductor tells us to as well as reminders of our common mistakes and other things on the sheet music.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly about <strong>your</strong> notes on the paper rather than the actual musical notes on the paper, at least for me. </p>
<p>The conductor part is very important, I think. Even if you know the piece, every conductor will have a different interpretation of it and it's nice to have those nuances written down along the sheet music so you can pay attention to things as subtle as a particular tempo variation the conductor likes (&quot;LOOK UP!!!&quot;), volume balances across the orchestra (&quot;it says ppp but you do pp and this other guy do pppp&quot;) to some other stuff like particular coda jumps or so.<br />
As a former tuba player, it was also nice to write down some cues closer to my parts so I could just chill for a bit (or a big fraction of a movement) instead of having to just sit there and count for 74 empty bars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to the comment about limited rehearsal time, classical musicians don't repeat music often (except in certain settings, like musical theater tours). We could perform a Brahms Symphony 4 or 5 times in one week, then not play it again for years.  Some new trendy pops tunes we might never play again, but we would be expected to come to rehearsals prepared. There would be no way to prepare a new arrangement without sheet music.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, often you're given 70 pages of complex music in which every line is completely different for a 2.5 hour concert, and then you get a new 70 pages for the next week's concert. Often string players will be playing passages with 500 notes per minute, in which the notes don't follow a clear pattern, so you would have to memorize each individual note, then tens of thousands of those notes (plus rhythms, style markings, etc.), then do it all over the next week. Then there are thousands of these pieces that are frequently performed, plus new pieces which sometimes you get the music for days before the performance, and rehearse once with the orchestra. And then you make one mistake and get fired, then take another five years to get a new job since it's so competitive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, there is a pattern to the notes, it's just complicated. If you were to eye track an orchestral musician sight reading, you'd find that they're always at least a measure ahead and are chunking the notes. You can't keep up otherwise.</p>
<p>Granted, the people in the big boy orchestras are good enough that they can sight read flawlessly things that have no real musical pattern, but atonal music isn't exactly popular and is rarely what they'd be asked to play.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point being that complicated patterns are much harder to memorize than the relatively simple and short patterns typical in rock/pop/etc., and rarely are most of the notes predetermined by the pattern. Chunking notes during sight-reading is a short-term memory technique for reading music, and isn't so much finding a pattern, as grouping nearby notes. Lots of 20th/21st century music has elements of randomness, or super-complex all-over-the-place passages, and a lot of that music really is performed regularly, such as Rite of Spring, in which the famously hard rhythmic part at the end has the measures literally arranged randomly.</p></div>		</li>
