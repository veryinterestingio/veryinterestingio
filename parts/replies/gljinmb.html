			<div class="markdown"><p>All animals consume salt. Humans just have lots of ways to get rid of salt. Dogs can’t keep up with human salt intake. No salt and your body ceases to function. Salts bring in nearly all sodium and chloride. Sodium is necessary for a nervous system to function. Without it you’ll have seizures and die. This is why ion drinks like Gatorade are important for severe dehydration. If you don’t replace the salt you sweat out (sweat is one of the rare traits humans have that allow us to eat lots of salt) you’ll just fucking die because you’re only replacing water not the ions like magnesium, potassium, and sodium that you sweat out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Acid isn't the most important part of the puzzle, usually digestive enzymes do most of the work.</p>
<p>To get acid tho, they either eat other things that have eaten the appropriate chemical somewhere down the line (predators eating organs rich in nutrients, herbivores eating a specific fruit or plant) or they have specific bacteria that &quot;eat&quot; part of the food inside their stomach on a micro scale and leave behind something that the animal can absorb.</p>
<p>Mammals get a head-start from their mothers' digestive system, egg-born creatures are encased with a bit of nutrients to get them going. Animals that feed their young through regurgitation share enzymes/bacteria.</p></div>		</li>
