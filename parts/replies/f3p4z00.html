			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think I have ever eaten a bogey, I used to pick and flick a lot as a kid, or occasionally pick and wipe. Even now, I occasionally pick my nose and wipe it on a tissue (sometimes you just can't get at that bit with a tissue). But I have never eaten a bogey.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, and chewed food.  Imagine you've just thoroughly chewed a big ol' mouthful of food, then just before swallowing it, you spit it back out.  The thought of putting that any where near my mouth - despite the fact that it was just in there - is horrifying.</p></div>		</li>
