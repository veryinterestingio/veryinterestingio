			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool question, it made me wonder why tuna is a reddish color as opposed to other fish I've had. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1uhaea/why_is_tuna_a_red_meat_and_swordfish_white_if/" target="_blank">This previous thread</a> has a lot of neat information it. </p>
<p>Basically seems similar migratory fish that constantly swim for long distances have more myoglobin and those that just do quick bursts to capture prey or avoid being prey themselves have whiter meat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! Not just the distinction between red/orange/gray/vanilla colored fish, but can a single fish have both “white meat and dark meat” just as a chicken or turkey would?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When a chicken flees a predator they don't run, they fly/ish, so breasts that control the brunt of the action, become fast twitch, but the legs remain dark meat because it doesn't need to work as hard or fast.  When a fish swims it uses it's whole body so it all need to be fast twitch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dark meat or darker colored fish are high activity fish. Salmon, tuna, shark, swordfish. These are fish that are constantly swimming so their muscles are in constant use. Especially shark and swordfish; which is why they have high levels of mercury generally. </p>
<p>White meat fish are your flounders and bass. Usually docile and slow going or idle, they aren’t constantly working their muscle. But rather similar to chicken when they need to move they move quickly, thus developing that white color.</p>
<p>Things like Atlantic farm raised salmon get their color from their diet which I believe is some combination krill and other feed, so they artificially dye their meat in a sense. But it’s basically orange colored white meat, which is why Atlantic salmon is usually dry.</p>
<p>If you want to salmon (or any fish) always go for wild caught. There is no such thing as wild caught Atlantic.</p></div>		</li>
