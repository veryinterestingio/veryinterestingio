			<div class="markdown"><p>Amusing story about pronunciation too: I had a mate with French parents who spent his first 7 years of life in the UK, so he spent most of his life before school speaking French at home, but learnt to read and write at school in English. They moved back to France and he obviously spoke French with no accent but whenever he would read in class he would read the French text out loud in an English accent and he told me they thought he had some kind of strange learning disability for the first year of school in France...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My husband's cousins do essentially the same, they're in their late teens now, English parents and flawless English, but went to a French speaking school - so these two highly intelligent, articulate young men read English books with heavy French accents. It's hilarious.</p></div>		</li>

I was watching a TV chef the other day. She is Australian I believe, but has a Japanese accent (?).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cow and vache also have different meanings. That is why pork doesn't mean pig. A class of people continued to talk about the fine veal they were fed. The people that raised that cow spoke Celtic/gaelic.
It's why you can order pig tacos, but it could mean a lot of things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pork <em>does</em> mean pig... in French. Though there it's spelled porc. That's actually why English has different words for the food version of the animal: gentrified English folk back in the day were very particular about appearing upper class, and French cuisine was the height of fine dining among high society. So when it came to food, the French terms dominated, eg. porc instead of pig, boeuf instead of cow, etc.</p></div>		</li>
