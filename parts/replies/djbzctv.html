			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a problem. When I started dating my wife she thought it was funny to stick a finger and poke me under the tongue every time I yawned. I now haven't completed a yawn, consciously, in over 15 years.<br />
Once I feel it and know it's there it will go for a whkle, sometimes until it feels like I'm going to vomit.<br />
I always thought yawns were a more primal instinct so perhaps she reprogrammed me since I'd close my eyes and tilt my head back. Now my eyes shoot open and my mouth just shuts on instinct.<br />
Am I just being paranoid or was I reprogrammed?<br />
She started doing it when our kids were small and I told her it isn't funny, don't do that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I put my elbow in my husband's mouth one time when he was yawning several years ago, and now I see him do this weird closed mouth yawn even when I'm across the room. I even tell him &quot;just yawn! I'm not going to do it again!&quot;, but I guess the trust is broken.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When you yawn, you stretch a load of muscles in the face and chest etc. These feed back onto an area of your brain that is associated with a good feeling.</p>

<p>Brb, going to go sit in the corner and yawn repeatedly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't force a yawn though. According to another comment the beast way to coax one out would be to breathe normally. Actually, that'd only add to the pleasure. You've got to let the oxygen slide down your mouth hole and tickle your chi-spot. The yawn is kind of a lung-gasm.</p></div>		</li>
