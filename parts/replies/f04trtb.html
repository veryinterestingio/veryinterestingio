			<div class="markdown"><p>Very important for certain circumstances. Recording, maybe someone is using samples where the timing is preset so the drummer needs to be on point to that, can be important for stadium shows where everyone in the band has a click track though more often they all have earpiece to a good mix of the band that's useful to them (foldback but in ya ear), maybe types of music where everyone is playing overlapping times and they're all using a click track (math-metal comes to mind).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m with this, I just taught myself by playing along to favorite tracks. Played trumpet in band but can’t read sheet music for drums. I just get a beat and go with the feel.</p></div>		</li>
