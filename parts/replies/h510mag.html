			<div class="markdown"><p>Second this.  3 months ago I had a strange accident with a q-tip which ruptured my eardrum quite badly.  It put me on my knees, then I had to pull it back out...  Worst pain I've experienced in my 4 decades here.  I've spent hundreds of dollars on specialist visits (and the ER), and my hearing is still not back and there is constant ringing and pressure.</p>
<p>I've since learned that the ear is self cleaning, and all medical professionals discourage the use of sticking anything in there.</p></div>		</li>
