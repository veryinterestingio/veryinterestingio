			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of. This whole process only impacts your <em>broadcasted</em> signal strength, so it doesn’t change how well you can <em>receive</em> signal. If your phone is struggling to reach a modem or cell tower then yes, that could theoretically work, but your results will be noisy at best. It also won’t have any impact in many situations. For example in a situation where many devices are sharing bandwidth on a single router, your phone talking a bit louder won’t have any impact on the amount of bandwidth the router allocates to you, and thus your signal will be unaffected. The impact of SAR does more to improve the entire ecosystem of radio communication than it does to make any individual device more responsive.</p>
<p>On top of this there are other factors that can place different limits on your broadcasting power. If those limits are lower than your SAR limits, then SAR becomes irrelevant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But since none of its ionizing, who gives a crap? Only certain types of UV are carcinogenic while greater than an ionizing wavelength. In the same way being hit with a microwave just warms water molecules, all radio band frequencies don't even put a dent in heating up bodily tissue or we could use our wifi or gsm like a space heater or radiant heater on cold days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that's related to what the tower is able to broadcast (your reception). Technically it would improve your own voice when speaking but then again you've just moved away from the phone :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do we know what the threshold is based on?  It sounds like a concession made for folks who speculate about tissue damage from EM exposure.  Is there another reason to limit the transceiver in this way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no trouble believing manufacturers need to regulate for safety.  But it's fascinating to me that a significant benefit is gained by adjusting power based on such a small distance (sensor range).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I said jacket pocket because it’s likely the jacket creates space between the phone and your body. But yeah if we want to be pedantic, yes it will still detect flesh if it is still close to flesh.</p></div>		</li>
