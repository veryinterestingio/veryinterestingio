			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m thinking like bats, humans and rabies is the ultimate example of OPs question. But to extend the question, would it be fair to say that some viruses and bacteria can even be “harmless” to some individuals, and deadly to other individuals within the same species? It seems like the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic plays out that way with some asymptomatic super spreaders that are seemingly unaffected themselves but with seemingly raging viral shedding which would (probably) correlate with high viral loads. And what kills many is something that looks very much like what we otherwise see with e.g. autoimmune diseases?</p>
<p>I find it fascinating that our complex biological systems can be so incredibly resilient against both “known and unknown” in many cases, yet hyper sensitive to some things and cases.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Absolutely!! There are many variations within a species that make some susceptible to a disease and others not. An example that I can think of is immunity-related. For example, <em>pneumocystis jiroveci and aspergillus fumigatus,</em> which are fungi, are commensal in many people (they live within us but neither harm nor benefit us) but are deadly to people with compromised immunity. Another example is with HIV. People with a specific mutation (called CCR5-Δ32) are HIV-resistant because HIV cannot recognize their target cells, but it leads to AIDs in people without that variation. You can also get a situation where a microbe, say <em>E. coli</em>, is very beneficial to us when inside the gut but becomes harmful if it got access to another organ that it wasn't supposed to be at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is also worth noting that viruses generally adapt to not kill their hosts, to become parasitic, because a species that kills off its food supply doesn't last.  That is why dangerous diseases for humans tend to come from other animals (bats, cows, monkeys, pigs, etc).  The disease adapted to be relatively harmless to one host, then enters a new population and is <em>not</em> adapted to not kill its new host type.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a great angle too. I’m thinking this is sort of mimicked by how capsaicin has “adapted” to not irritate birds at all, meaning the seeds of very hot peppers will  still be eaten by birds specifically, and carried far - increasing its potential to spread geographically which is good for the survival of the species. (And yes, I know evolution doesn’t mean things “adapt” per se, but rather that traits that favor survival and spread will generally grow more dominant with time.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This actually happened with the H1N1 flu virus. It was responsible for the 1918 flu epidemic (sometimes erroneously called the Spanish Flu because their media were the only one willing/allowed to report on it) but infected enough people to enter seasonal circulation, after which it adapted to humans in order to become less lethal and more infectious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a question I've had for quite some time. How exactly do &quot;Type A&quot; rabies vectors like bats and skunks function - i.e. Can carry rabiesvirus asymptomatically.</p>
<p>I mean rabies is pretty inarguably the single most lethal disease in humans; hell, hemorrhagic fevers generally don't go above like 75% mortality. What mechanism is preventing the neurological outcome that occurs in humans 100% of the time from happening in these type A vectors. </p>
<p>I've done some cursory searching and can't find much in the way of publications on it, although my background isn't in biology so i might be way off base and it's common knowledge in the field.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's either something weird about Peruvians, or something different about vampire bat rabies in that area, as it seems <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22130-natural-immunity-may-protect-peruvians-from-rabies/" target="_blank">neutralizing antibodies</a> to rabies are found in some people there.</p>
<p>IIRC the pneumonic form of bubonic plague is considered by some to be the most lethal disease out there, although perhaps you were referring to viruses only. Untreated mortality approaches 100%.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Occasionally, however, the pathogen can mutate and cross species, like what happened with SIV and HIV.</p>

<p>Which is just another example of your short answer: &quot;evolution&quot;. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, I know OP didn't ask about fungi, but i would like to add it here anyway. Fungal pathogens face many of the same restrictions as viral and bacterial, but the biggest barrier for them is body temperature. The reasons humans get so few fungal pathogens compared to other organisms like fish or plants is because our body temperature is simply too high for fungus to reproduce in. There are a few exceptions, of course, athletes foot I believe is the most common.</p>
<p>I actually like to think of fungi as our front line of defense against bacteria, since they eat bacteria and mostly don't hurt us.</p></div>		</li>
