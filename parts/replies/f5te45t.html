			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a big majority of people only sleep on 6 hours and think it's an accomplishment or should be normalized. But I don't think they realize how much it effects their brain function or how tired they actually are. A lot of these people are running on caffeine or adrenaline throughout the day and are less productive than if they slept for 8 hours if possible, I know some people have actual sleeping problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone with severe sleep apnea, that only gets 6 hours <em>at most</em> every day, even I can tell how much it affects me. Its like living in jello. Everything is slow and your brain just wants to quit every second of every day. You cant focus for long, and everything takes that much more effort and energy that you just don't have.</p>
<p>Its awful. Would not suggest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a sleep disorder and only get 5-6 hours most nights and generally don't feel that way. I get that feeling and severe mood regulation problems under 5 hours though, or multiple sustained days in a row of extra poor sleep. </p>
<p>This is an anecdotal conversation-extender not meant to argue or act like its data. Just interesting that we are all sort of different. </p>
<p>If I do get 7+ hours (rare, but I did on Tuesday of this week!) I feel good but not really quicker or better, just good, and am similarly exhausted at night.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's absolutely terrible and terrifying because you just CAN'T RELAX ONE BIT. I got sinus infection and it was very close to sleep apnea: I had to bite a towel to force my mouth open wide when I sleep, couldn't even breath normally when sleeping sideways, had to breath manually when I lie down...</p>
<p>For other illness/injuries, you can lie down and relax to make it better. But for sleep apnea, doing this just you feel worse! It doesn't allow you to &quot;rest properly&quot;.</p>
<p>Fuck sleep apnea!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or.. busy days.</p>
<p>If your job takes up half your day, you kinda get desperate for free time, and the only activity you can afford to take time from is sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! the caffeine and the alcohol part were the most eye opening sections of his book. Let’s say you drink a cup of coffee in the noon. No worries, that’s 10-12 hours before bedtime, right? Well by the time you sleep, a quarter of that caffeine is still in your brain by midnight. </p>
<p>Essentially, pretend you don’t drink any coffee at all the whole day, and then pour yourself a quarter cup, and try to go straight to sleep. That’s the effect of having coffee at noon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty certain it was less long than that isn't it? i thought he recommended not drinking caffeine after 2 so that it would go away by the time you sleep (9 or 10 i believe).</p>
<p>EDIT: the half life of caffeine is about 5-7 hours, so it could potentially remain in your body  in 14 hours. I can't find information on Matthew walker recommending a cut off time for caffeine, that wouldn't affect your sleep. Seems like the earlier you drink caffeine in the day the better, but avoiding it all together is still the best option.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Finally a real response instead of “I feel” and “I think”.   I noticed from my nieces and nephews when they were young 7 - 10 if they slept less than 9 or 10 hours they looked tired af.  Most cases they just took a nap after school not sure how healthy that is but it seemed to work.  </p>
<p>I’d be interested to see what the average number for adults is but I wouldn’t be surprised if it was 8.   Right now I’m running on 6 hours,  I can function but I know I am tired.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus, that is an average. I know that personally, I'm noticeably not at 100% if I get 7.5 hours of sleep instead of 9. I'm 22. It's a lot better than it used to be, say 90% after one night of 7.5 hours compared to 75% when I was a teen, but still. Plus it semi adds up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On average, people sleep less as they age. For a long time, we simply assumed that this must mean they <em>need</em> less sleep, but recent studies suggest this is not the case. It's likely our brains just become shit at sleeping. </p>

<p>Personally the thing that clicked in my mind was when he linked the lack of sleep as one possible path to Alzheimer’s. I don’t know about you, but I’m terrified of losing myself decades into the future, and I’m 100% going to take care of my body and sleep to avoid that.</p></div>		</li>
