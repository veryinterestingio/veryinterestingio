			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the reasons why Comic Sans is so ubiquitous in schools is that it's a free/default font with lowercase &quot;a&quot; and &quot;g&quot; made the way kids are taught to print them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s why it’s my default font for flash cards when tracing English as a foreign language. </p>
<p>You’d not believe the amount of my coworkers who wouldn’t care, and we’re suddenly wondering why their students couldn’t write the letter “a” simply without the loop at the top... they’re copying what you’re showing them, and they get confused, thinking it’s a different letter. </p>
<p>Even when I’d point it out explicitly to the coworkers, they’d just go “it’s the same thing, it doesn’t matter.” Like they revel in making life harder for Jr High kids or something. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ESL teacher here. I try to teach that a,c,d,g,q, etc. all start the same (counter-clockwise stroke) and other letters start with a straight line, and so on. In other words, it's like categories of stroke order in Chinese characters. Maybe your co-workers will buy that. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Youre a great teacher (and i wish there were more like you) but what jr high students can’t write? Thats a foreign concept to me. </p>
<p>Ninja edit- i realize you may be teaching in europe or asia or underprivlidged kids or kids whom dont have english as their native language. Sorry for commenting from my high horse...imma get down now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my most vivid memories of first grade is getting to the letter &quot;g&quot; in our hand writing workbooks.  </p>
<p>It was a cheap textbook with g written the fucked up way for kids to trace.  And all the kids and teacher were like, what da fuq?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I've never seen someone use the other g. I think on the keyboard the a is the only one that is different than what I write out, except on the q. I put one of the lines off the tail. And that goofy little t curl I guess. </p></div>		</li>
