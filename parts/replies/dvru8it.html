			<div class="markdown"><p>I've done something similar. But I wasn't sleepy before or after driving! The problem is that I've driven the same route so many times it becomes mind-numbing routine. Dullest drive ever, so I get sleepy and bored on the middle of the highway. </p>
<p>Eyes go half lidded. Then I sort of nod off. Then I jolt awake. Seems like I get some adrenaline, but two minutes later, the entire cycle repeats. This happens several times in a row. I just cannot force myself to keep my eyes open until I get off the highway. OFC, I'm perfectly fine when I'm not on that particular stretch of highway.</p>
<p>Edit: and to all the people freaking out, yes I do pull off the road or take a different route. This also has nothing to do with actual tiredness levels, its just an extremely dull stretch of road.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>same here. if it's something you are interested in and something you havent read or listened to before then it helps keep the mind from going into autopilot. in my case this is mostly when I travel across the state to my hometown to visit family and stuff, 6 hours driving can get tedious otherwise</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have this problem. I tried all sorts of things to keep myself awake: play music really loud, turn down the AC to an uncomfortable setting, eat something before I start driving, chew gum during driving, etc. None of them worked that well, but then I started taking mid-day naps and I never have it anymore. You might try getting a bit more sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scariest moment of my life was when I was on the highway at night, on a long stretch of road, with a truck in the distance. After a while before I even knew it I was dozing off. Felt like 2 seconds but then I opened my eyes and suddenly that truck was awfully close. I realised what just happened and was wide fucking awake after that. Knowing that you were sleeping when you shouldn't been sleeping is what makes you awake. </p></div>		</li>
