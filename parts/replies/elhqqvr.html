			<div class="markdown"><p>The main concerns are around what could happen to animals around rotating turbine blades, either collision risk or changes in behavior. Underwater sound from devices may also be a concern as this could interfere with navigation, hunting prey, and socializing.  There are other lesser concerns, but most do not indicate real risks to individual animals or populations. There is still a lot of uncertainty about the effects of marine energy devices, so additional research and monitoring is needed. If mitigation is required is needed, there are several methods that are being investigated and look promising.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, thank you! When you look at these effects, do you compare them to the impacts of other types of energy generation, such as fossil fuels? If so, how do they compare? I see renewable energy get picked apart for various impacts, but I rarely see that put in the context of mining, refining, and burning fossil fuels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All forms of energy generation have some environmental footprint. Fossil fuel exploration and extraction have deleterious effects on marine animals and habitats through changing the ocean environment. Renewable energy technology development and operation will have some effects, but they are thought to be less damaging to the oceans and other environments.</p></div>		</li>
