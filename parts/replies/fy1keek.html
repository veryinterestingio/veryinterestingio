			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's an easy one: not making eye contact.</p>
<p>Sometimes kids won't make eye contact because they are shy. This is a personality thing and can be tied to upbringing. Say the kid does something wrong, parent gets upset, kid hides their face and suddenly the parent is less harsh. If this becomes a pattern, the kid will learn to hide their face when they are scared.</p>
<p>But not making eye contact is also a behavior associated with autistic tendencies. In this case, it has more to do with a reaction to environmental stimuli choosing not to interact with them. Nothing the parents did or did not do would cause the child to act like this.</p>
<p>If it's just shyness you'll outgrow it. If it's autism you won't, and the behave will take effort to change.</p>
<p>Disclaimer, autism is a spectrum. It's not going to be the same for everyone. Those on the higher end of the spectrum may be able to learn to make eye contact without too much trouble, but will still have more than their &quot;normal&quot; peers would. Eye contact may not even be an issue for certian individuals. And on the flip side, those on the lower functioning end may never learn to make eye contact despite the best efforts of those around them</p></div>		</li>
