			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a simplified explanation but one that is relatively well explained. </p>
<p>To add on a bit of background though, there is a number of different “arms” of the immune system. Histamine responses are one arm; lymphocytic pathways are another. Our skin acts as another “arm”. There are many others too which I haven’t touched on. </p>
<p>The immune system can be thought of almost like a military, you have the army, the navy, and the air force all doing different things. Within each of these forces there is multitudes of people doing different things all in support of the goal (eliminate the enemy). For example, you have defense mechanisms for before the invader arrives (skin &amp; innate immunity), you also have cells checking papers for spies, you also have different types of soldiers to fight different types of battles, and lastly you have fighting techniques to disrupt the enemy (like a fever). </p>
<p>I do recognize criticisms of the immune system being compared to military (it isn’t perfect, but its largely acceptable).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you wouldn't mind answering a follow up question: I've heard mixed reports that anti-inflamatories like ibuprofen can interfere with the vaccine. If this is the case, how does the inflamation in that context differ from the inlflamation that histamine produces?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Immunologists can give a more specific answer than I can; although I’ll give it my best shot. I’m going to explain it in lay language, as I assume most of us are not doctors. </p>
<p>The concern with anti-inflammatories and the covid vaccines is (from my current understanding) that the vaccine depends upon a small reaction from the body to generate the defences necessary to protect you from covid. The anti-inflammatories could in theory strip your body of the ability to respond to the vaccine and in essence the vaccine would go to waste. </p>
<p>Now, here is my (relatively; I’m a medical student) educated opinion on this topic practically. An anti-inflammatory like ibuprofen will reduce the effectiveness of the response but does not entirely eliminate the response. It also only impacts a portion of the response (COX pathways), but does not stop the generation of signal to start the cascade (this signal being the macrophage and b-cell/t-cell signally cascades in response to viral debris in the body.) </p>
<p>So, from a practical stand point, while it could be possible - taking an ibuprofen will not substantially affect the majority of people and their ability to develop a defense against covid infection. If you have a pre-existing immune condition which alters your ability to respond to vaccines, you very well could cause the vaccine to become ineffective.</p>
<p>Edit: I did want to add, for sake of certainty and out of an abundance of caution; don’t take this as medical advice and please consult with a medical professional if you have concerns about anti-inflammatories and covid vaccines. Everyone has a different situation which requires different decisions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this analogy. Its not 100% accurate, but it doesnt need to be. Im a middle school science teacher, and i find that anology is one of the best ways to give people a sence of understanding the content on an intuitive level, which makes them more likely to believe that science knows what its doing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are antihistamines which work by inhibiting histamine from being released, and also the ones which bind to histamine receptors and stop the effects of histamine that was already released. Either way, as you said, other parts of the immune system are mostly not affected, and the effects of histamine, which is responsible for allergy symptoms are reduced/eliminated.</p></div>		</li>
