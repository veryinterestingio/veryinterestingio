<p>Such as...</p>
<p>Higher-end components</p>
<p>Specialized hardware</p>
<p>Processing Power</p>
<p>Distributed computation</p>
<p>Parallel computation</p>
<p>Memory</p>
<p>RAM</p>
<p>I appreciate the guy's answer, but unless you already know what these terms mean, then it really doesn't answer OP's question.  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV5J6BfToSw?t=1887" target="_blank">It's a classic example of the curse of knowledge.</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>They are just, a very fast computer. Literally, that is it. All the rest is just technicality that is added on and sometimes isn't even inclusive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>MapReduce isn't a supercomputer. Its not even a computer. It is a programming model for working with distributed systems.</p></div>		</li>
