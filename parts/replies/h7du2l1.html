			<div class="markdown"><p>Those ocean and atmospheric currents are in danger of dissipating due to the warming trend.</p>
<p>The cold dense air at the north pole is warming much faster than expected and thats what keeps the jet stream stable. </p>
<p>The same thing is happening in the ocean except that also has co2 acidification to worry about and also i think most of the super salty brine sinks in the north when that stops the ocean will become much more salty and that will have a big effect of the ecosystem.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>When the very saline water sinks in certain regions of the Arctic, this does not remove the salt from the oceans, it just forms one of the major deepwater currents of the thermohaline circulation (North Atlantic Deep Water) which then goes on to circulate around the oceans globally. </p>
<p>So, slowing this process does not add new salt to the oceans or create a buildup of salt. Even halting the process completely wouldn‚Äôt do that (but also that won‚Äôt happen). In fact, as climate change increasingly melts more ice at the polar regions and prevents ice from forming as much during the winter, you don‚Äôt get as much of the super saline waters because they are only generated by brine rejection from sea-ice formation in the first place. That‚Äôs how deep water currents are formed in surface waters.</p>
<p>If anything, all the additional freshwater from melting ice will dilute the salinity of the oceans (though not by a significant amount at all).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah those ocean currents are the reason England is so moderate, it's so far north with a change in the gulf stream they could become super cold.  Previous warming periods saw some areas much cooler actually because of all the cold water melting into the ocean I've been told.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall learning a few years ago that a potential impact of global warming is that places like England may end up much colder because the cold water from the ice melting near the North Pole flows against the warm stream coming up from the Gulf of Mexico, eventually the gulf current may not be able to reach as far as England anymore</p></div>		</li>
