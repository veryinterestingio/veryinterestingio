<p>There is no advantage to use a higher grade</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd caveat this with one point... some manufacturers only include beneficial additives (detergents and lubricants) in their higher grade fuels (Shell), whereas some include them in all grades (Sinclair).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And some add ethanol to lower grades of gas and not to premium. Ethanol inherently has water in it which is bad in the winter as it can cause your fuel lines to freeze, ethanol also has less energy in it than pure gasoline per gallon, which can result in lower fuel economy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I keep premium in the gas can in my garage for small engines like my lawn mower.  I heard once that it stores slightly better and honestly the price difference for the 5 gallons I use per year is negligible.</p>
<p>No idea if this is actually true but since I started doing this I haven't had any problems starting engines after storage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed.</p>
<p>The manual for your car will often say &quot;Use grade X or Y, but Y won't give you any performance difference&quot;.</p>
<p>I know my (UK) 95 RON (&quot;standard unleaded&quot;) car can safely use 98 RON (&quot;premium unleaded&quot;) fuel, but the manual literally says that it will make no difference.</p>
<p>If the only pump available or working is premium, you can usually use it without ill effect.  But otherwise it will make no difference unless you have a sports car, which will tell you that in the manual.  In fact, it will probably say &quot;Only ever use&quot; the higher grade in that case.</p></div>		</li>
