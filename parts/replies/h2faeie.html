			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! Much appreciated. And yes 10000 years is negligible in cosmic terms.</p>
<p>So what happens if we have a wormhole window or something similar from where we get the information from a &quot;younger&quot; part instantaneously, what will we see exactly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All information in the universe moves at the speed of light. So if you have a &quot;wormhole window&quot; going somewhere, looking through it would look the same. </p>
<p>But even if you could see a 10000 year younger part of the universe instantaneously, it wouldn't be very different. People were around and civilization was pretty well established 10000 years ago. The rest of the universe is probably largely unchanged.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it was messy, I'll try to be clearer. Consider a part of our Galaxy, near to the center where there is a massive blackhole, So it would be safe to assume that it has experienced less time and there clock is running slow relative to us. If we look each other through the window, what would we see, since our clocks are unsynchronized. Would we see them in slow motion, would they see us in fast motion?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our clocks desynchronized, we see them in slow motion? And they see us in fast motion? We'll see something different surely, for eg. If we see a particle with negative mass, we'll observe that its going from future to past.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The existence of a comoving frame seems to sit a bit uneasily with the idea that the universe has no &quot;preferred&quot; reference frame.  Is this something people think about?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what you mean by &quot;preferred&quot;.  You're perfectly well able to do your physics calculations in any reference frame you want, the co-moving frame is just a bit simpler.</p>
<p>It's hard to conceive of a type of universe that doesn't have such a reference frame. No matter what you do, there will be some reference frame in which the center of mass of the stuff nearby isn't moving.  For some more complicated universes there won't be a reference frame in which the background radiation is the same in every direction, for example a rotating universe, but there can still be a reference frame that is the simplest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The CMB frame is not actually universal. It just varies over scales larger than the observable universe. That means it a useful frame of reference to use by convention, but there's nothing particularly special or universal about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used that phrase for rhetoric's sake.  I meant that of any planet or foreseeable spaceship that's not around a black hole.  Moving a small percentage of the speed of light relative to the comoving frame.</p>
<p>If you pick a reference frame that's moving a lot faster or is in a deeeep gravity well then the time dilation can be huge.  Ultra-high-energy neutrinos may be so close to c that billions of years here pass for them every second.</p>
<p>It's not unreasonable to think about any reference frame at all.</p></div>		</li>
