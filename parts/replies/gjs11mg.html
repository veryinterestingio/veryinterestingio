			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak for all the messaging, but a lot of this confusion is still the result of politically-influenced media and a decent amount of simple scientific illiteracy in the media and populace.</p>
<p>A lot of the studies and advice being put out in the early days had specific notes on the scope of the statements and people felt no need to preserve that when reporting the results.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;Masks don't help&quot;</strong>: Actually, this stated that masks don't protect the wearer in environments where non-mask wearers were common and not distancing themselves.</li>
<li>&quot;<strong>People who aren't sick shouldn't wear masks&quot;</strong>: At a time when PPE was in very short supply, the greatest impact was getting PPE to people who actually had symptoms or were exposed to those who had them. Unexposed people wearing masks out of fear just prevented people who needed masks from getting them.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;Only N95 masks are effective&quot;</strong>: Again, the tested statement was that N95 masks were effective at <em>significantly</em> protecting the <em>wearer</em> when in environments where no other mitigating practices were used. There were also studies showing that an even more effective strategy was to layer mitigations: socially distance, everyone wears some mouth/nose covering, clean common surfaces. </li>
<li>&quot;<strong>The virus isn't airborne&quot;</strong>. And even now, it technically isn't (based on the definitions used in practice for virology etc.). It still requires aerosols or droplets and can only transfer short distances and quickly deactivate the virus. It doesn't travel freely through the air. Media sometimes got this right and sometimes didn't. Anecdotes and misunderstandings were commonplace and the general populace didn't spend much time analyzing the reports.</li>
<li>&quot;<strong>The virus doesn't mutate quickly&quot;</strong>. And it still doesn't, but the vast majority of people have no baseline understanding of what that means and how the scale of the pandemic impacts that. Stories of mutations play out as if this disproves the low-mutation declaration, but it really doesn't.</li>
</ul>
<p>There were some communication fumbles through this, including from some top officials who knew better. This amounted to them saying things that were technically/factually untrue but designed to achieve some goal when passed through the misinformation streams. It ends up not helping as much, because it just undermines later messages. Masks were the big example here and while I'll readily admit that it was done poorly, it doesn't really excuse the horrible scientific literacy displayed by the general populace.</p></div>		</li>
