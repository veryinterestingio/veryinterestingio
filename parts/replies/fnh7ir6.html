			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that we can predict and measure the Moon's drift by 4cm is absolutely bonkers. The moon is 384,400 km away. 4cm is like <del>.0000001%</del> of that distance.</p>
<p>It's even smaller: .000000001%</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They currently have a mirror on the moon, as another comment mentioned.</p>
<p>The crazy part to me, is how the son of Charles Darwin figures this out in the first place, prior to that mirror being placed on the moon.</p>
<p>He looked at tide levels, and managed to come up with a theory that the moon was slowly drifting further and further away from Earth.</p>
<p>When they put boots on the moon, and left the mirror there, they confirmed his theory. Absolutely bonkers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if I'll explain this correctly but it's profound.</p>
<p>The moon pulls the oceans around the Earth. And then the oceans have a slight pull back on the moon. That slight pull increases the velocity of the moon. And all those that have played Kerbal space program know that an increase in velocity will result in an increase in the orbit height. </p>
<p>So it's actually the Earth's dragging the moon around making it go faster which is making it go higher.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Put it rather this way: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The moon pulls on the oceans, but the oceans get dragged around the Earth due to its rotation... </p>
</li>
<li>That drag slows the rotation of the Erath and speeds up the moon.</li>
</ul>
<p>tl;dr The Earth loses rotational energy and the moons gets orbital speed out of it, like a hammer thrower</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just the oceans, it's the entire earth (to a smaller extent,). This is why we say the moon is tidally locked to the earth, or Mercury is tidally locked to the sun. Eventually this effect will synchronize rotational period with orbital period.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The earth and moon, together, orbit their common center of mass. Because the earth is so much more massive than the moon, this <em>barycenter</em> happens to be still inside the earth (at about 75% of the earth's radius away from earth center). So while the moon orbits at 3683 kph, the earth orbits at only ~45 kph.</p></div>		</li>
