			<div class="markdown"><p>You're overcomplicating the problem. </p>
<ul>
<li>White blood cells are irrelevant in the context of a blood transfusion</li>
<li>Clotting agents are almost irrelevant in blood transfusions, and we have some solutions for that problem already</li>
<li>The other transports are just suspended in the liquid, the stuff we should be able to easily replace</li>
</ul>
<p>The red blood cell stuff is still beyond our tech, but be careful not to fall for the nirvana fallacy. Just because something doesn't solve all the problems in a good way doesn't mean it's a bad solution, especially in the absence of anything else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ll chime in that the white blood cells can send you for a wild ride though. I lost over half the blood in my body Easter weekend with a D&amp;C. I received a double transfusion. For about a week I had the worst migraine I’ve ever experienced. Constant oscillating between fever and chills, night sweats, dizziness, heart rate was “resting” 90-110 when normal for me is in the 50’s. I was certain I’d picked up Covid at the hospital. Nope, it was just my white blood cells reacting to the ones in the transfusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even something that is safe and will just deliver half as much oxygen and keep blood pressure up so it will all still flow around would be huge.    Doesn't have to be perfect, but if an ambulance could just pull up to an accident scene, find a wounded person bleeding out and pump a few liters of replacement blood into him to buy time...</p></div>		</li>
