			<div class="markdown"><p>When my daughter was just learning to talk we noticed that she would repeat the phrase &quot;mee mee&quot; every so often.  She wasn't talking to us when she said it, she just said it.</p>
<p>Eventually we caught on that she was saying &quot;mee mee&quot; every time she belched.  She had picked up the fact that both I and my wife reflexively said &quot;excuse me,&quot; after belching and was imitating us to the best of her verbal ability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My daughter was a premie and seemed to focus every ounce of her developmental allowance on “verbal”. By 12 mos, (9 mos adjusted age) I had lost count of her words and she spoke in short sentences.  But she did not walk at all until 20 months.  First word was not mama nor dada but keeeee! For “kitty”.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>My first full sentence was uttered at a pizza restaurant. It was &quot;Lady pizza now!&quot; While banging hands on table. </p>

<p>According to my parents, though, until the age of 4 or so I called them &quot;griffins&quot;, which is weird because that's more complicated to say than &quot;crisps&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
