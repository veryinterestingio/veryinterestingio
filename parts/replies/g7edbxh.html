			<div class="markdown"><p>It wasn’t that crazy when you consider the alternative was sitting there and being bulldozed by the largest army ever assembled in Europe. They had to retreat, why leave the goods right there to be plundered? </p>
<p>Also, the strategy is called a scorched-earth policy and it was definitely used before the campaigns of Napoleon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you're saying is not true. Napoleon's armies were well fed and prepared. In fact, canned foods were invented during his era as a means to feed his armies. His use of logistics and supply chains was unprecedented and was a major reason for his success, they didn't just 'grab it on the go'. Also, scorched earth tactics were used since ancient times, nothing modern about that. And the Russian winter was the primary reason Napoleon's Russian campaigns failed miserably, the lack of supplies and food was a subsequent result of the cold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They absolutely had to forage, a supply chain stretching from Paris to Moscow that in Eastern Europe was moving over dirt tracks known mainly for turning to mud just wasn't capable of supplying the largest army ever assembled, much less one keeping up with one that was on a forced march pace.</p>
<p>They were facing supply problems before they even took Vilnius and that was in summer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They foraged and had to live off the spoils of war once their supplies were cut off after the winter set in during the Russian campaign, yes. What I am refuting is your original claim that 'he brought very little food or supplies' which is completely false. At the time, Napoleon's armies were the most organized and well supplied armed forces in the history of mankind. They got screwed over by Mother Nature and had to do do whatever they could to survive. That was not what was intended nor their traditional modus operandi. </p>
<p>Also napoleon's forces were not even close to the largest army ever assembled.</p></div>		</li>
