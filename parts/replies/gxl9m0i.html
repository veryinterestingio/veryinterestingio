			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory it should be harder for bacteria and fungi to grow in anti-bacterial soap. However the effectiveness of the antibiotics in the concentrations found in most such products is usually too low. So bacteria is able to grow even in these soaps and might instead develop resistance to these antibiotics. This means that you may still get infected but now the germs is resistant to the higher concentrated soaps that is used in hospitals and doctors office so now you are risking spreading the germs to the entire hospital. This is actually a problem and hospitals have discovered antibiotics resistant bacteria spreading through their soap dispensers. Which might be traced down to the use of so called anti-bacterial soap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, don't do this. Not only can what you said happen, but your also diluting the soap so it's not as useful in the first place.</p></div>		</li>
