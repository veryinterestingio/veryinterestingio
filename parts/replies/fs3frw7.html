<p>The bees determine if they need a new queen to maintain the current hive  or if they need a queen to reproduce the super organism (hive). </p>
<p>If it is to reproduce, the bees first ensure they have enough stores for the current hive to survive and to fuel the 60% of the bees that will leave. They make several queen cells and have the queen lay eggs in them.  These are fed royal jelly only and continually until the cell is capped. This takes about 8 days to capping the cell. Meantime they tell the current queen to quit laying eggs and literally run her around the hive until she has slimmed down enough to fly. Once the last cell is capped, the queen and 1/2-2/3 of the bees leave the hive and find a new home. 8 days later the first queen to hatch finds the other queen cells and kills the pupae inside by stinging the the cell wall. Then she goes on a mating flight, returns (hopefully) and about a week later starts laying eggs again. While process takes about 3 weeks of no queen laying eggs in the hive</p>
<p>If the queen dies or quits laying due to age... they use a regular cell with an egg or a larvae less than three days old.  They build that cell out and feed only royal jelly.  Obviously they do this with more than one cell. Then the same process happens, queen hatches, kills the other queens, mating flight, start laying.  </p>
<p>A “walk away split” mimics this. You take a frame of fresh eggs, frame of brood and a couple frames of food. Put them in a nuc box, ensure no queen.  Come back a month later and you should see eggs, meaning you have a laying queen.  One way to expand your apiary</p>
<p>Bees eat pollen. Their preference is fresh pollen. Excess is turned into bee bread and stored for winter. They use the pollen to make royal jelly, which all bees get, but worker and drone brood only get it for a few days.  Queens get it until the cell is capped. </p>
<p>Lots of scientific books written on this</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is insane.
I'm still a bit confused about the mating flight. Who do they mate with? Male drones from other hives? How can they keep laying eggs for so long if they only go on one mating flight early in their life? Do they save sperm up? Don't the sperm die?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, they mate with multiple drones on their one mating flight and store up the sperm in an organ called the spermatheca. The queen knows whether to lay a fertilized egg (which will make a worker or queen, both female) or an unfertilized egg which will produce a drone based on the size of the honey comb cells the workers have prepared. So a drone has no father but he has a grandfather. The workers will usually hedge their bets and produce a few of queens at a time. The first queen to emerge makes a peeping sound and the others respond from inside their cells. Once the first queen knows where the others are, she will sting them to death before they even emerge. Sometimes the workers will make a new queen because the other one is getting old, in which case they’ll kill off the old queen themselves once they have a new one. Sometimes they’ll make one because they’re planning to swarm and the old queen and half to three-quarters of the bees will head off with her to start a new hive, leaving the new queen to run the hive they’ve left. Sometimes they’ll make a queen from a fertilized egg because the queen has died. If there’s no queen in the hive, you sometimes get worker bees laying eggs. Worker bees can only lay unfertilized eggs (drones) and you know you’ve a laying worker bee because she’ll often lay more than one egg in each cell and doesn’t follow a tidy pattern like a queen would.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They mate with drones from other hives. The drones all hand out in a particular patch of airspace, much higher than normal flight would demand.</p>
<p>The queen then mates with multiple drones, usually over 3 to 5 flights. During the mating process the drones die, they pop so hard you literally hear a cracking noise..... the queen stores the sperm in a special chamber which she uses to fertilize eggs on demand from that day forth.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing about drones, is they are born from unfertalised eggs and only have half the chromosomes of a normal bee.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think the only thing the queen has a choice in, is to lay male drones or not, but hopefully someone else knows how that's done. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In humans and other mammals, biological sex is determined by sex chromosomes. Everyone has two (two of every chromosome): X from your mother and Y from your father. If you have XX you’re female, XY and you’re male.</p>
<p>Different species do things differently. In the order to which bees, wasps, and ants belong, sex is determined by haplodiploidity. Females have two copies of each chromosome, like mammals: one from mom’s egg, one from dad’s sperm. Males have only one copy of each chromosome, which comes from mom’s egg. </p>
<p>In order to produce a son, a queen bee (or other female reproductive ant/bee/wasp) lays an unfertilized egg, while to produce a daughter, she  lays a fertilized egg. The queen mates before founding a colony and never again; she has a little internal pouch where she stores sperm for the rest of her life. So she can control whether or not sperm and egg meet, and thereby the sex of her offspring.</p>
<p>[Corollary: insects from this order, Hymenoptera, have developed the colonial lifestyle many times, more than in other groups. This might be because haplodiploidity means a female is more closely related to her sisters than her children: like humans, she shares 1/2 of her DNA with her children, parents, and brothers. Unlike us, she shares 3/4 of her DNA with her sisters—the half from mom gets reshuffled just like us, but the half from dad is exactly unchanged because he only has one set of chromosomes.]</p>
<p>That’s all the “how”; I don’t know about the “why” of what causes a queen to produce male vs. female offspring. Like other bee colony decisions, it probably involves colony-wide chemical communication.</p></div>		</li>
