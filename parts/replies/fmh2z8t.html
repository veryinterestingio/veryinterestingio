			<div class="markdown"><p>Just curious- in an ideal world where someone could plan when theyâ€™re going to get pregnant, would you recommend someone receiving all their boosters right before getting pregnant? Theoretically the titers will be higher and the baby will get a little make protection.  right? Or is it silly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is generally recommended that pregnant women get the flu vaccine and the DTP.  These vaccines are not live virus vaccines so there isn't risk to the fetus (you don't want to give a pregnant woman an MMR or varicella shot, there is a theoretical risk associated with the exposure).  DTP and flu probably give the baby some protection against pertussis and flu.<br />
We have a baby die of pertussis every year or so in the hospital that is too young to have been vaccinated themselves.  Its a really terrible thing to watch.</p></div>		</li>
