			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve ALWAYS been the opposite. Even in middle and high school. I woke up at 5/6am naturally ever since. Unless I pass out after like 2am but then i wake up at 7/8 at the latest. It’s weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve always said that I’d like to start a school that ran from 10-5 instead of 8-3. Morning people can bring their kids to early care. I’d just be sooooo much more functional if I could stay up late like I want and sleep in just a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some schools do this. Due to problems with parents failing to bring their kids, Cleveland (OH) Municipal School District starts after 9. It doesn't last until 5 though. </p>
<p>The &quot;just bring your kids to early care&quot; doesn't quite work though, because the kids will be on a morning schedule and will fall asleep at 7 or 8. Parents won't get any time with them all week. I'd be interested in a school that accommodates both somehow, although I've never seen a good way to make it work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like I've been dealing with perpetual jetlag my entire life and is has really affected my stress levels and overall health working 'normal' hours. There was a brief reprieve during maternity leave when I was up all night with baby. I was able to indulge in my normal sleep cycle!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That could be that you have a longer than 24 hour cycle so you are always trying to go to sleep “too early” even if it’s the same time every day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just came back to reddit to delete what I thought was an overly personal post I made.  I figured I could do without yet more comments about how I'm lazy because I struggle with mornings.  These comments have made me feel pretty good!  Thank you nice people.</p></div>		</li>
