			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're asking for the purposes of losing weight, I lost 30 pounds by counting calories. After the first week it averaged to about two pounds per week. Losing weight doesn't have to be strenuous and you don't have to be hungry. It's just boring. Find your caloric max, split your calories three ways between carbs fat and protein. If you feel hungry after you've reached your caloric max only intake protein. I'm talking plain chicken, turkey or tuna. If you don't have the appetite for any of those you're not hungry you're just craving. Cravings subside after about two weeks.</p>
<p>Once you get past two weeks you get used to your very plain and boring diet.</p>
<p>Alcohol and eating out aren't very practical during this time. If you don't have a lunch with you you can find stuff at the grocery store which won't mess up your three way carb/protein/fat split. Usually slices of meat from the deli or some of the soups. (Chicken noodle and chili mainly. Forget chowder or anything potato or dairy based.)</p>
<p>EDIT: Couple more tips: don't rely too heavily on protein bars or drinks. Once a week is fine and keeping them on hand so you don't have to make a choice between getting hangry or messing up for a day. (One day isn't a big deal in reality but it can fuck with your mental momentum.) You want a diet that you don't change much after you're at your target weight. Protein drinks and bars aren't a long term diet solution.</p>
<p>Tuna is great but get chunk light and keep the weekly servings low (2-3 a week generally) to avoid intaking too much Mercury.</p>
<p>Greek yogurt is great. 1/4 cup in a bowl and then fill a single spoon with honey. Keep it on the spoon and dip it. Draw a little of the honey with it. You can have nearly the same flavor with way less calories. Do something similar with salad dressing. Put a measured amount in a bowl and dip it. You'll realize some pieces of salad taste great on their own (cucumber, tomato, radish, carrot) and the more bitter leaves don't take much to flavor.</p>
<p>Crock pot stews are easy to measure, make and prep. Don't worry about figuring out the nutrition of each cup. Just average it out and by the time you finish it over a few days it'll balance out the numbers. I recommend chicken, chicken stock, beets, sweet potatoes and brown rice. Any combination of those will taste good just figure out what works with your fat/carb/protein split. And you can flavor it afterwards. (Greek yogurt and salt after microwaving can make a huge difference.)</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Someone reminded me, at the first sign of hunger drink some water. Sometimes you're just thirsty.</p>
<p>EDIT 3: Keep your diet somewhat varied. Don't eat chicken exclusively or something.</p>
<p>EDIT 4: Some people were confused why I was giving diet suggestions as if it affects how you lose weight. It doesn't. You can lose weight on Twinkies provided you stay under your caloric max it's just gonna be <em>way</em> more difficult to stay under because you're going to feel like you're starving. Making sure to get the three way split should prevent you from feeling starving. If you feel that way after drinking water you probably need to allocate a higher percentage of your calories to protein. Plain protein (I'm talking chicken cooked in water not oil) isn't very appetizing unless you're actually hungry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. We're lining up like exactly. I'm counting calories too. Have lost 26 lbs. After first week it was about 2lbs a week. It's annoying more than anything cause it's just a hassle to count calories. But Huel or repetition helps me count when I'm lazy. But it's working...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I counted calories and was miserable. I switched over to no carbs and it seemed more manageable and I felt better. This however meant no beer, no soda, no snacking, no pastas or potatoes. It was doable because I was still able to eat until I was full/satisfied. While I am not counting calories, I'm only able to eat so much chicken and vegetables, or fish and vegetables etc. It's still surely on the lower side but maybe even psychologically it helped knowing if I want another piece of chicken I'm able to have it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been intermittent fasting since January and it has fundamentally changed my life for the better. I've lost 33 pounds since then. and I've packed on a lot of muscle because I've also implemented regular weight lifting into my daily routine. seriously if you're on the fence about in a minute fasting don't be this is the best and easiest way to lose weight that I've ever tried.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh I‚Äôve been IF for a while now on and off, I definitely feel a lot of benefits from not eating so often. The reason I asked the question is because my metabolism seems to have changed, I actually gain weight now if I‚Äôm not careful about what I eat ! So I was asking how fasting actually changes the function of my metabolic rate</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of this is pretty accurate however, their is a reason most doctors dont just say fast and lose weight. It isnt always the best thing to do. Always consult a doctor before doing this. If u do it incorrectly I can turn your blood acidic and that's not good.</p>
<p>Otherwise it is the same thing everyone hears. Eat less and healthier and exercise to lose weight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just one clarification on this, what most consider &quot;intermittent fasting&quot; isnt enough to trigger ketosis. Ketosis gets triggered only after the glycogen stores of the cells are completely drained, a process that takes 2 days to a week to happen. What intermittent fasting does is it makes it easier to stick to a caloric deficit, since you limit the eating window (thus making it harder to eat as many calories).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Challenge accepted.  </p>
<p>Seriously though, my first few times trying IF, I did end up consuming my daily calories upon breaking my fast.   Which is exactly what you don‚Äôt wanna do.  :-)</p></div>		</li>

I believe IF is not that practical when your daily caloric intake is low when you are an average height woman. Calorie counting did it for me though. I lost 19lbs since end of last year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Intermittent fasting is fairly often combined with One-meal-a-day. I know for me the whole &quot;eat small meals/portions more frequently&quot; just results in me being hungry constantly, while having one large meal allows you to have that part of the day that you're actually full. Eating 1500-2000 calories in a single meal results in a <em>lot</em> of food even if you're still doing stuff like fast food.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I have to partially disagree with you, based on your imprecise language.</p>
<p>Glycogen is stored in the liver, muscle cells and fat cells. (this split is important, because muscle glycogen is locked into the cell for use during exercise, and won't leak out if you have low blood sugar). It also holds like 4g in your bloodstream, so I guess that counts.</p>
<p>Your body uses about 5g of glucose per hour and will pull that from your bloodstream, which in turn gets it from food you recently ate, and stored sugar.</p>
<p>The first place your body gets stored sugar from is the liver. The liver only holds about 75g of sugars via glycogen, so if you skip 2 meals you're probably in ketosis (if you skip an entire day, you're definitely in ketosis).</p>
<p>You are correct though, in stating that skipping meals intermittently is not enough to hit ketosis, because it's easy to eat an entire day's worth of sugar in one hit. Then you just coast through the rest of the day on stored glucose.</p>
<p>If you eat low-carb, it can still take a few days for your liver to get down to zero glycogen from full.</p>
<p>but <em>technically</em> you can get there from 100% full sugar stores in a day if you work at it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Low blood sugar stimulates release of glucagon from the pancreas. Stimulating glycogenolysis (breaking down glycogen into glucose in the liver) and gluconeogenesis (formation of glucose from fat and protein). You will absolutely not be in ketosis from intermittent fasting and a normal diet. The formation of ketone bodies as a result of gluconeogenesis does not necessarily mean you are in ketosis.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Evolutionary changes happen slowly. McDonalds and Grocery stores happened an eyeblink ago on that time scale.</p>
<p>We hang on to fat easily because that was a survival trait at one point.</p>
<p>To stop hanging onto fat, being fat would have to be bad enough for your reproductive future that skinny people have more children than fat people, for long enough that the 'fat' genes go away.</p></div>		</li>
