			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly like this except your dad points a gun at his bosses head and demands money so he can loan it to you.  If his boss refuses to pay, your dad locks him in your basement for several years.  If his boss tries to defend himself against being kidnapped, then your dad simply murders him.</p>
<p>Other than the part where none of it is consensual, it's exactly like your dad getting a loan from his boss and then loaning it to you</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite.</p>
<p>You need $5, but all you’ve got is a savings bond for $5 that matures in three months.</p>
<p>Dad lets you sign over your savings bond to him and gives you the $5 now instead of in three months.  When you give him back the $5 he’ll sign that savings bond back over to you.</p></div>		</li>
