			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem I see, as a mechanic who works with ICEs hybrids and EVs, is battery recovery and recycling. Take prius for example, I'd expect 7 years out of their batteries which are costly to replace and and fairly nasty to recycle. ICEs on the other hand can last 30+ years (I drive an 85 daily on original engine). What would make sense would be also looking into clean fuels and retrofit kits. I liked hydrogen for a while, mazda even had an RX-8 that would run on hydrogen or gas which was a cool concept.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that's the solution though, both obviously have problems that need to be sorted out. I think we shouldn't put all our eggs in one basket however, otherwise we'd see a mass exodus of mechanics. I know I'm considering leaving the industry, too much knowledge and experience will be thrown out the window if the industry keeps going the way it is. Not solely because of EVs, they have their purpose, but everything interesting is being sucked out and it's becoming increasingly more difficult to work on, meaning I make less money. Also Tesla's business model is basically selling DLC and software locking systems that are in the cars for extra money which is just anti-consumer. Good thing they aren't the only manufacturer of EVs though. </p>
