			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that’s one of the arguments for pregnancies in older women producing more children with Down syndrome - since the eggs pause in metaphase (I think metaphase I...) they are more likely to suffer nondisjunction which leads to aneuploidy</p>
<p>Which I can’t discount - it’s certainly plausible- but that too has been overblown.  I read a paper recently saying this (egg age and nondisjunction) was the cause of ALL aneuploidies.... which.  Uh.  Multiple Y syndrome, anyone?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not true. Dolly the sheep died from a virus, not from cloning or shortened telomeres. Most clones have been found to be perfectly healthy. Theres a lot of misinformation about dolly dying from cloning but this ignores the vast majority of healthy clones and the past two decades of research showing that they are healthy.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should definitely post this as it's own point.  I had no idea she died from a virus.  I must have missed that news and only got the clones die early because of DNA problems assumption news.</p>
<p>Edit: Disregard I see you're working on it per post.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point they make in that review is that not many animals have been cloned and so average life expectancy is based on small sample sizes. But the animals that have been cloned have mostly been healthy. </p>
<p>Low sample size is a fair point, there could be some less common complications which have not been observed yet. However, short telomeres don’t seem to be an issue in clones:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”However, telomere length appears to have been exonerated for the inefficiency: Tian et. al. [15] produced 4 live clones and 6 dead clones (died soon after birth). Both the live (15.38 kb) and dead (15.87 kb) clones had telomeres of the same lengths as controls (14.73 kb). The dead clones were found to have abnormal X chromosomes inactivation in a later study [37], indicating that the high fatality rate of clones is related to abnormal gene expression during embryo development.”</p>

<p>Note the abnormal x chromosome inactivation and abnormal gene expression are epigenetic problems to which subsequent studies have found work arounds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AFAIK there were some issues resulting in shortened clone lifespan, but those were related to stuff like epigenetics not being reset properly - which, in turn, caused all kinds of issues.</p>
<p>Once that was fixed, you could get about 10 generations of clones without a noticeable drop in lifespan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer is maddeningly incorrect.The OP's question mentions &quot;dna degrades&quot;, but we should define what happens to DNA (sequence, ignore the epigenome) during aging.</p>
<ol>
<li>Shortening of telomeres</li>
<li>Somatic mutations</li>
<li>Persistent DNA damage</li>
</ol>
<p>For 1) rederiving a blastocyst via SCNT should result in an ICM with active telomerase and &quot;restored&quot; telomere length (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3220723/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3220723/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3220723/</a></a>)</p>
<p>For 2) you're stuck with the somatic mutation, not much you can do about it, should have chosen a different nucleus to transfer</p>
<p>For 3) I have no idea. I'm guessing you can't get a viable embryo from such a cell, but weird shit happens in biology (edit, I stand corrected: <a href="http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/25/21/2248/F1.expansion.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/25/21/2248/F1.expansion.html" target="_blank">http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/25/21/2248/F1.expansion.html</a></a>)</p>
<p>So bottom line: assuming you chose a cell without somatic mutations, the telomeres will generally reset in length. If you chose a cell with a somatic mutation, it could mean nothing, or it could result in really bad stuff, but that's not very different from what happens during normal sexual reproduction.</p>
<p>However, that being said, there's an extensive body of literature out there showing that reprogramming using OSKM is less efficient and less &quot;complete&quot; when using cells from older donors, but this appears to be due to incomplete reprogramming of the epigenome and isn't really related to changes in the sequence of the genome or length of telomeres. Not sure if this extends to SCNT.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very nice answer -- really important point about the different genetic and epigenetic factors at play. I personally don't think the top of this thread is so much 'incorrect' as it is 'incomplete'. I would assume that you cannot possibly choose a cell without somatic mutations as:</p>
<ol>
<li>There's a lot of them: <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/18/9014" target="_blank">https://www.pnas.org/content/116/18/9014</a></li>
<li>How do you determine which cells have mutations and which don't? You'd need to compare to the germline -- and I don't know if anyone does that.</li>
