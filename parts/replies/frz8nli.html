Even someone just telling you that you're smart can send back thoughts of somehow faking it though school even though you do actually know what you're going.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People doing nice things for me (be it a compliment, getting food, giving me money, etc...) is the absolute worst feeling. I always say no. I don't deserve it, I didn't earn it, let me be please. </p>
<p>On the flip side, I LOVE giving, and helping others. Often times I will go out of my way to help people. Just, for the love of God, don't reciprocate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to feel the exact same way, but then someone sat me down and explained it to me this way, that by refusing (gifts, help, compliments, etc...) that I was in actuality, robbing that person the feeling I loved so much myself.</p>
<p>The giving isn’t as much for the person receiving as it is for the person giving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An important aspect of imposter syndrome are the societal and social pressures that can trigger impostor syndrome (in other words social psychology versus individual psychology.)</p>
<p>For example, more women in technology jobs report imposter syndrome than men, because technology jobs are often male dominated.</p>
<p>Thus imposter syndrome can also be studied at a macro/societal level too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a latino scientist in the US, I can totally relate. It's also accentuated by a few different biases like some version of Survivorship bias where you see folks that have the most exposure and it feels as if you need to have that level of success or recognition to meet the minimum criteria to be adequate for your job (whereas it's easier to find people who excel at what they do because they have more papers etc). But as my spiritual director put it when I was worried that my doctoral dissertation was not worthy of a PhD: &quot;[edjuaro] that is your job to determine, your dissertation committee will decide if they approve of your work, you have to follow their advice if they think you need to improve something, but if they didn't think your work is valuable they would have made it clear&quot; and knowing how ruthless criticism in academia is, I still hold on to that and keep thinking to myself that while I can of course have an opinion of my own work (and that opinion may change over time), this is also why we submit things for peer review and just as I accept their criticism, I need to accept their acceptance.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How many people do you know that are bad at their jobs? How many of those has the topic of impostor syndrome come up with? </p>
<p>I’ve literally never had anyone admit to me that they feel like they have impostor syndrome, good at their jobs or not. So it surprises me you know many people who are not only bad at their jobs but also think they have impostor syndrome. </p>
<p>That’s like reverse impostor syndrome. </p>
<p>Person is bad at job.
Person learns about impostor syndrome.
Person feels bad at job.
Person convinces him/herself they are really good at their job and that the feelings of inferiority are just impostor syndrome when in fact they are simply bad at job.</p></div>		</li>
