			<div class="markdown"><p>it means it's a separate entity and the owners are only liable to the extent of their investment i.e. their share in the company. it's a warning to potential creditors.</p>
<p>sole proprietorships are another type of business where the owner bears unlimited liability towards the debts of the business i.e. even his house can be sold to pay off the debts of the business. partnerships are another example of this. the partners personal assets can also be taken over to pay the debts of the business. so the inc., ltd or plc. tags on the names of businesses are there to distinguish them from sole proprietorships and partnerships.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It means legally created and registered.</p>
<p>So, for example, a limited company incorporated in UK means the company's shares were issued there, and the company is a UK company, governed by UK laws and company regulations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest thing you are missing is that we can tax them just we decide not to as well because they employ so many people and most are high paid jobs. </p>
<p>This is the real reason most of those companies pay nothing in taxes. Because if the feds made them pay taxes they would take the jobs else where. </p>
<p>It is a balance between employment and capital and the feds do take notice if you are just shoving capital around with out also employee citizens.</p>
<p>Apple, google, Cisco and all these big tech companies employ thousands locally and globally and can afford to pick up and jump countries if taxes go against them.</p>
<p>That environment is what creates the low federal taxes.</p>
<p>You can also see the micro instance of this on the state level last year with the mass exodus from cali because of the change in tax laws.</p></div>		</li>
