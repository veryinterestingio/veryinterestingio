			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comment about the realism of statues in Ancient Egypt has brought out the sharp contrast between it and their stylized 2D carving. That seems to me to be a slam-dunk case for their carvings being ultra-stylized. Clearly they knew how to reproduce images accurately... but that just wasn't the goal of most 2D artwork.</p></div>		</li>
