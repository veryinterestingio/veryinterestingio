			<div class="markdown"><p>High blood pressure is a &quot;cumulative damage&quot; scenario. It doesn't do that much damage in the short term, but it puts overall stress on the entire circulatory system.</p>
<p>It's also very rarely the sole risk factor present in people with cardiovascular disease. People who have high sodium intakes, tend to have high fat, LDL cholesterol. Which all have a similar cumulative damage profile.</p>
<p>To ELI5 it, sodium increases the pressure on veins/arteries. because there's more liquid inside them, LDL Cholesterol and fat can build up in the walls and cause minor and major blockages. High fat leads to high fat stores present in the body causing pressure from the outside of the veins/arteries. This means your heart has to pump harder and harder to move blood around.</p>
<p>Eventually with all of these present your risk of a major blockage, a burst somewhere in the system, or your heart eventually going &quot;Nah, Fuck this, I'm out.&quot; go up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>EDIT: consider taking salt pills and powders too. I take one SaltStick Cap with each meal, and Re-Lyte Electrolyte Mix in my decaf iced tea (higher salt:sugar ratio than other brands I’ve seen).</p></div>		</li>
