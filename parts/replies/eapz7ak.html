			<div class="markdown"><p>That link doesn't day that's why ice is slippery. So I'm assuming the last paragraph is just your own assertion? </p>
<p>Scientists with a deep understanding of the physics haven't been able to figure it out. That explanation may make sense to you, but it would have to be proven before you can say that's the cause with certainty. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All elements can be thought of as round. Some molecules maybe, but not so much. Water, H2O, is not round and in fact &quot;sticks&quot; to some molecules because the it is polar. That's what makes water such a good cleaning agent. </p>
<p>Besides the fact that this is flat out wrong, there's much more to it even if the molecules were, in fact, round. </p>
<p>Edit: &quot;some&quot; not &quot;most&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The book &quot;The Physics of Hockey&quot; by Alain Hach√© (goalie and experimental physicist at the University of Moncton) explained it this way as well. He even walks through calculations on why pressure and temperature increases generated by hockey skates are insufficient to melt the ice and create a layer of liquid water. I'm at work right now so I don't have the book handy but one of the early chapters is all about ice, how's it made in a rink, and why we can skate on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should link to the article you found. Especially if you are going to directly copy and paste a paragraph. <a href="https://www.livescience.com/62621-why-is-ice-slippery.html" target="_blank">Article in question</a></p>
<p>Also, you should make sure to denote which words are your own and which come from the article.</p></div>		</li>
