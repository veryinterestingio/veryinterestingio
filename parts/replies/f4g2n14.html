			<div class="markdown"><p>But I'm 5 years old. How can I understand compression algorithms? I'm just really good at basic arithmetic for my age.
Just kidding. That makes sense. For instance if there are several pixels with the same data, then it doesn't need to transfer all the data for each pixel. So it works like a zip file, it is compressed but is still sending the true data when uncompressed by the decoder?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 for compression?</p>
<p>Uncompressed: AAAAAAAAAABBBBBCCCCCC
Compressed:     10xA, 5xB, 6xC</p>
<p>Which is shorter?</p>
<p>Extremely simple overview btw</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could also say:</p>
<p>Scene 1: AAABBBCCC</p>
<p>Scene 2: AAABBBCCD</p>
<p>Compressed scene 2: (reuse data from first 8 parts of scene 1)D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also:</p>
<p>AAABBAAAACBBBBAA</p>
<p>XYXACYYAA</p>
<p>X=AAA</p>
<p>Y=BB</p>
<p>I bet my &quot;compressed&quot; version is a bit larger, but with sufficient patterns you can quickly have a compressed file and library that are much smaller than the original file. Of course, this is lossless compression. When you watch a video online that looks like shit and is full of squares, that is because it is using lossy compression. For example:</p>
<p>XYXCYYX</p>
<p>The original and reconstructed files, side by side:</p>
<p>AAABBAAAACBBBBAA</p>
<p>AAABBAAACBBBBAAA</p>
<p>They're not the same, but they're close. Close enough depending on what the file is for. But the compressed file is smaller, so it might be worth it. So some compression algorithms throw out bits of data, like only compressing every other frame and letting the decompression algorithm guess what the intermediate frames looked like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After the data received is uncompressed by your device, the actual stream information going to the display/monitor is indeed very large.</p>
<p>For example: DisplayPort 1.4 allows ~26 Gbps, your example is about 5.7 Gbps. However you might be transferring at 60 fpsor more and 3x10 bit color data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It works kinda like a zip file indeed. You need processing power on the receiving end to decode the video tho.</p>
<p>Yeah, sorry about the non-eli5 answer</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes— quite a lot of processing power for 4k video. In fact modern GPUs and CPUs (technically the GPU that’s built into most CPUs) have application-specific circuits that do certain kinds of video decoding really efficiently— because they are meant for it— instead of relying on raw “horsepower” to do this through software. </p>
<p>As a result, whether a computer will play video well can depend more on its age and whether it was designed with a certain format/resolution of video playback in mind, than whether it’s an especially powerful computer. A decent desktop computer more than 5 years old may not play back 4k video smoothly but modern cheap tablets, smart TVs, etc can. This is because they have hardware dedicated for this, rather than putting enough money/energy into their hardware that they <em>generally</em> outperform a 5 year old general-purpose computer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You do lose some data because must compressions use color gradients or groups, on most streaming services you can see “shades” or gradient lines, in to dark or to bright scenes.</p></div>		</li>
