<p>To activate the PNS, you can use breathing. Exhaling actually produces a relaxing feeling in the body. Making so your breaths are regular and the time of the inhale is smaller than the time of the exhale will relax you and make the SNS activation receed.</p>
<p>A short example (my most used method):
Take air in for 5 seconds, release in 7. That is 12 seconds total. Do it 5 times, that's a minute. Do it 25 times and that's 5 minutes. In 5minutes you should be feeling calm and relaxed. </p>
<p>Try it out and let me know :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a psychologist, but, here's an anecdotal story to add a real world situation demonstrating how these principles are employed in real life at very high levels:  </p>
<p>I worked for the DND (think military) for close to a decade, when we would do urban operations (fighting in built up cities as opposed to jungles, mountains, etc..) one of the most vital drills we were taught was to take 2 deep breaths before breaching a room. It had a profound effect on maintaining some semblance of cognitive abilities while under extreme levels of stress-- which as you can imagine, is very important when operating in a city full of civilians.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you don’t mind, I have a question that sounds ridiculous. What can I do instead of breathing?</p>
<p>Breathing is my stressor. I have severe allergies, chronic rhinitus, and nasal polyps. I’m doing all I can with allergist and ENT. I’m okay but breathe through my mouth mostly, and focusing on the sensation of breathing causes me discomfort and alarm.</p>
<p>I think stretching helps. Any other hacks to activate PNS?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Conceptually we process the situation presented in the game narratively (that of warfare), but there are none of the stakes that are actually associated with those situations. The stakes that are actually being processed by your sympathetic nervous system are based around far more abstract and simple concepts; rewards for hitting a target, avoiding obstacles, anticipating and avoiding lines that will make you &quot;lose.&quot; You know your life isn't in danger, only your sense of value as a player, judged by your net number of abstract &quot;successes&quot; and &quot;failures.&quot; Most games are very similarly processed by our sympathetic nervous system, especially when we play those games so often that the narrative being presented isn't even processed anymore.</p>
<p>From my own observation, a lot of kids actually get the impression that they would be effective soldiers from gameplay, not because they don't understand the difference between reality and fiction, but because they don't anticipate the stakes of warfare being drastically different than those being dramatized by a video game, and the fact that our nervous system isn't capable of handling those stakes without being quickly overloaded in a way a child (hopefully) never experiences.</p></div>		</li>

<p>this isn't actually true. Anyone who plays a mil-sim will tell you how combat isn't just running around and instead just sitting prone on a hill until something happens. That or dying to someone else doing the exact same thing. You fire bullets at greyblobs from 200m away or get killed by said blobs without a second notice.</p>
<p>Even in more arcade/unrealistic shooters players rarely get a KD over 1.  Power Fantasies are not common in PVP shooters that have some sort of ground in realism. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1YDaSw8gDM" target="_blank">Usually you die to stuff before you even realize it.</a> Tell me if that isn't an indicator that war isn't as easy as it looks.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I’m guessing you’ll feel much more relaxed. My day job as an engineer already stresses me out and I’ve found that pvp games afterward will wear me out even more and dampen my productivity later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m the opposite, I only play games where I’m competing with others. My work is also stressful, but I crave the stimulation the game brings. I get adrenaline rushes as I play games and can feel my sympathetic response. I enjoy that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Points B and C are interesting because they seem to be heavily affected by your upbringing and community. Certain stressors can be lesser or greater if you were taught that something -- let's say, swimming -- was relatively safe or relatively dangerous. Likewise, you could be taught, or learn, that people are generally willing to help or generally reluctant to help, which affects how you view relational resources. That can really change how stressed a person is on average.</p></div>		</li>
