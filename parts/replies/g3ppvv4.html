			<div class="markdown"><p>Cooking food is one of the milestones for humans in that it allowed us to eat a wider variety of foods and essentially better access the energy within the food. We essentially adapted along with our learning to cook and as that happened our teeth got smaller but our brains got bigger and needed more and more energy since we were able to consume more energy with less time devoted to eating.</p></div>		</li>
