			<div class="markdown"><p>My sibling and I had braces at the same time and we shared a bathroom. Our parents insisted we keep a before and after photo of people who'd brushed well with braces and people who hadn't taped to our bathroom mirror the whole time. It scared the shit out of me and 100% improved my dental hygiene for the rest of my life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I ended up with one white spot and had sub-par dental hygiene when I had braces. It really doesn't look that bad so you REALLY have to have genetically inferior teeth and/or horrible hygiene</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately I was one of the people who ignored the warnings and didn’t take good care of my teeth. I have white spots around some of my front teeth. From what I understand the white spots are calcified bone basically. </p>
<p>Yeah it doesn’t look amazing and if I could go back I’d definitely take better care of my teeth but what’s done is done and I’m just glad it wasn’t worse.</p></div>		</li>
