			<div class="markdown"><p>Surely whether or not a donation is &quot;legitimate&quot; depends on the purpose and the status of the recipient, doesn't it?<br />
At least around here I couldn't simply make a random private gift of 1,000,000â‚¬ to my neighbour - there would be a significant tax deduction, which would decrease depending on whether and to what degree I'm related to the recipient.</p></div>		</li>
