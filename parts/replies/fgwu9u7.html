			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm reminded of a story about a castle that withstood a massive barrage of cannonfire.  They built two walls and then filled the space between with sand.  The sand gave the outer wall resilience so the cannon balls simply embedded themselves in it, without knocking it down.  The cannon balls that penetrated through the wall became the plug that kept the sand from spilling out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the thickness. After all, Krupp armor on battleships was facehardened armor, and it worked pretty well against AP capped projectiles.</p>
<p>Regardless, it has fallen out of use since modern metallurgy is much better at finding alloys with a more optimal balance between hardness and low brittleness, to the point where modern armor plating usually has a hardness of about 500 on the brinell scale (where as Krupp cemented armor had a 650-ish hardness facing while the deeper steel was closer to 250) but is still very shatter resistant.</p></div>		</li>
