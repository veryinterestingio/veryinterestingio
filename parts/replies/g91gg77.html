I remember hearing a podcast where Ben Platt discussed how he basically had to relearn how to sing because he cried so much in “Dear Evan Hansen.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's cool but as a non-broadway performer...er...actually not a performer at all, how do you do the inverse?  I'm a pretty sensitive dude and if something is sad or makes me very angry, there is a good chance I will cry.  Just like performers learn how to control their &quot;crying&quot; voice, are their some tips for people that maybe are experiencing the emotion but do not want their voices to get wavery?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who cries a lot and still has to keep working, i find that methods like sensory resets, nausea fixes, and a good old face rub help. Little circles working on the muscles, look up pictures of the faciomuscular landscape for input on where the muscular bits and tendons are. Nerves in the back of your neck can also change the sensation in your face with small deliberate circles gently working into the muscle. Get control of your breathing, figure out your rhythm and restrict it with the muscles in your core. In thru the nose, out thru a metaphorical strawshape u make w ur mouth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, fellow easy-crier-dude here</p>
<p>There were two posts about crying on the front page, so I just posted this advice elsewhere too. I've found recently that if I *know* when I have a difficult conversation coming up, scheduling some kind of hard workout beforehand helps a huge amount</p>
<p>It should be something that leaves you in a state of post-workout calm, when I guess you've a different cocktail of hormones floating about.</p></div>		</li>
