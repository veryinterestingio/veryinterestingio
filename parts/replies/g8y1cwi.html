<p>The PFS thing seems to be a chicken/egg problem. Are you saying that the genetic mutations to prepare the brain happened in person A, then that person perhaps passed the mutations to a family of offspring who developed language while they were living together as children? </p>
<p>Also, I’m fascinated by how imaginative thought maybe didn’t exist before 65k years ago. Can you explain what you mean by imaginative thought? What would it be like to live without imaginative thought?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sort of. I didn't go into it for simplicity's sake above, but actually yes.</p>
<p>Genetic evidence suggests human brains predisposed to invent, learn and use modern recursive language have been around for hundreds of thousands of years, but during that entire time we were using non-recursive proto-languages as, for whatever reason, the 'spark' that enabled language potential didn't catch. Though we couldn't form spatial prepositions, verb tenses, nesting, and other recursive elements (&quot;that black cat, over there by the fire, and that we caught in the woods, is eating some meat&quot;) that define modern language, we (and likely too other human species) still possessed the ability to use nouns, verbs, adjectives, numbers, and color and size modifiers (&quot;that small black cat eats&quot;). Similar (albeit variable) non-recursive language is used by folks with PFS disabilities such as prefrontal aphasia today (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWC-cVQmEmY" target="_blank">for example</a>).</p>
<p>We know that PFS-development and recursive language acquisition takes place during a critical period of pre-frontal cortex (PFC) development during infancy. In behaviourally modern humans, that critical period of PFC development is reasonably lengthy. With that in mind, one hypothesis on why it took so long to invent modern language, despite us otherwise being hard-wired and ready to do so, was because for a long period of time PFC developmental time was <em>too short</em>, preventing infants developing PFS.</p>
<p>A mutation to &quot;delay PFC&quot; development is, after all, dangerous - it results in prolonged immaturity during which time the brain is incapable of, for example, risk-assessment. Chimpanzees have rapid PFC development rates; three-year old chimps avoid getting too close to water, or climbing too high. A three-year old human, by contrast, would happily walk off a flight of stairs into a swimming pool and drown - it just can't risk assess as, in modern times, PFC development is delayed. For much of early human evolutionary history, when we sat in caves around fires etc. - an environment dangerous for toddlers - it was beneficial to, like the chimp, have rapid PFC development. A mutation to &quot;delay PFC&quot; would be dangerous, but would offer the developmental time required for PFS (and associated later fitness benefit) to manifest. </p>
<p>As such, all it'd take for language (and PFS imagination) to develop would be for a couple of children, with a &quot;PFC delay&quot; mutation, to be born into a family group roughly at the same time, statistically overcome the high associated mortality rate, and then spend several years growing up together so that they could talk to each other - and boom! Cognitive revolution. </p>
<p>So yeah, the groundwork had been sitting there for a long time. A singular mutation, or set of mutations, inherited by two or more children (perhaps twins) then lit the spark that finally caught. Though this combination of events probably happened multiple times (and likewise probably died out multiple times) over many thousands of years, in theory it only needed to happen - and be successful mid-/long-term - once.</p>

<p>PFS (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_synthesis" target="_blank">'mental synthesis'</a>) refers to a very specific type of imaginative thought. Imagination, in general, can include unconscious (i.e. non-controlled), spontaneous imagination (e.g. dreams), and conscious (controlled) recollection of single mental objects from memory - both of these are common to many animals. PFS is unique in that, unlike, single memory recall, it involves the recall of several separately stored mental objects and the manipulation of those objects to synthesise novel objects. </p>
<p>Dogs can dream about catching balls. Dogs, when awake, can imagine a ball (and go and find it). A dog can separately recall a human friend. A dog couldn't however mentally recall both and combine them to imagine a human friend made entirely of balls.</p>
<p>Same, perhaps, with Neanderthals and early humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much for replying. Your work must be fascinating! As a final thought, do you have a book or two to recommend about this subject matter. Something that would be accessible to a reasonably bright and motivated layperson?</p>
<p>Edit: never mind, I see the references in your first post. Thanks again!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems strange that neanderthals, with their big brains and social groups, may not have been capable of PFS. It seems it would have fundamental to the development of the brain in relation to fire, tool use, hunter/gathering etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I really enjoyed reading your explanations here today! A further question-</p>
<p>Imagination is integral to the ability to plan, is it not?* To be able to picture a future and the tasks and tools required to achieve that future, maybe to also extrapolate several different futures and aim for the most optimal?</p>
<p>How did ancient hominids, who (if i understand correctly) so far lacked imagination, make plans? How did they spread across the globe without making the basic plan of, for eg, carrying enough water to make it between oasis? Or sourcing enough furs to clothe themselves through winter? </p>
<p>(*or am I starting from a false assumption to begin with? Ha!)</p></div>		</li>
