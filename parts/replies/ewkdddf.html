			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing that I'm curious about is whether or not the existence of a single moon is a prerequisite (or at least greatly increases the chance) for life to appear on the planet in the first place. Until we find other forms of life, I'm not sure if there is a way to prove this one way or another.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tides add to the hostility of that environment, require slightly different survival mechanisms, and lead to unique ecosystems which interact with other ecosystems. That, plus the simple butterfly effect of chance encounters generated by tides means <em>something</em> is likely to be different, and a small fork in the path can create immense variation over billions of years.</p></div>		</li>
