<p>Function A and Function B can both be Turing Complete by themselves, but as soon as you attempt to use them together they have a high chance of failing to pass Turing Complete and there are almost always undefined states.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful idea, and I know a few people who tried to fix it so they could build a compiler for a &quot;mathematically prove language&quot; to generate bug-free and security code based around Turing's ideas.  But last I heard they drifted apart as they couldn't even prove their core thesis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You seem to be confusing the Turing test, Turing completeness, and computability.</p>
<p>Turing completeness is a property of models of computation - anything which can compute at least as much as a Turing machine can is Turing complete.</p>
<p>Computability (or being computable) is a property of functions, which is that for any input a Turing machine can calculate the corresponding output.</p>
<p>It's pretty hard to design from computable components a function that's not computable, and natural examples tend to involve reflection on computational models themselves, because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice%27s_theorem" target="_blank">Rice's theorem</a> - in colloquial terms, all functions that tell you whether or not programs behave in a certain way aren't computable. This includes properties we really want to know, like &quot;does this program reach an invalid state&quot; - we can check this for individual cases, but not in general.</p>
<p>The Turing test (which you seem to allude to with 'high chance of failing to pass') is entirely separate - it's about a machine's ability to fool a human into thinking it's also a human. It has nothing at all to do with computability, since we know human conversation is computable - it's more to do with the complexity of human speech and thought, and the relationship between the computational models of Turing machines and human brains.</p></div>		</li>
