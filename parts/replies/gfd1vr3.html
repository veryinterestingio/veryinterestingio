			<div class="markdown"><p>The point is - unless you abuse some really powerful substances - you get eventually too tired and your body will force you to get a rest. (Usually - it, of course, sometimes happens that people die from exhaustion caused by physical activity).</p>
<p>There is, however, no limit of how much damage sitting all day being stressed can cause to your heart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not true, unfortunately. I abused no substances and felt fine when distance running, but it made me lose my period (any number of factors which raises cortisol/stress can cause that). It's a common issue among distance runners, and it has been found that in the long term, it is actually worse for your health to run marathons than to run moderately. It's not like the only options are perfect health and dropping dead. </p>
<p>I mean yeah in general exercise is much better than being sedentary, but the body isnt foolproof with forcing you to rest. It's quite easy to &quot;override&quot; it, I felt sore a lot of the time but not fatigued and I rarely got injured. It's probably a survival mechanism, your body gets stressed from running so much but it assumes there is sth very important you are running so hard from or towards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a little hyperbolic to say that there is no limit to the possible damage. Inactivity is bad, but it won't make your heart explode.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Excessive cardiovascular exercise is linked to a lot of health issues. Itâ€™s very difficult to get to that point though.</p></div>		</li>
