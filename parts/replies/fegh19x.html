			<div class="markdown"><p>It varies. It's quite rare for an egg to break inside a hen. Takes a strong, forceful blow low on the abdomen near the vent while an egg is there getting shelled up. But it can happen.</p>
<p>Sometimes the egg just cracks a little and can get &quot;mended&quot; if there are more layers of shell still being applied to it. That one should get laid ok, though the impact that cracked it would leave the hen at the very least quite badly bruised, inside and out.</p>
<p>Or the egg can fully break open inside. If she's lucky the hen might be able to &quot;lay&quot; it still, or she might have pieces of shell stuck and stabbing her insides. Internal trauma with yolk and whites leaking out can set her up for a nasty bacterial infection, like egg peritonitis or sepsis. Which can be fatal, even with prompt treatment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I won't go into a ton of detail, but look up a &quot;lash&quot; egg. If you feel real adventurous, look at one that's been cut open.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lash eggs arent broken eggs, though. They're puss and other material, sonetimes including erroneously secreted shell fragments, that accumulates in the cloaca when there's an infection. &quot;Lash eggs&quot; don't start out as eggs, even though they might look a bit like eggs when they come out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An egg breaking inside a hen can cause a serious infection called egg yolk peritonitis.  It is quite often fatal.  Sometimes they can get all of the egg and shell out on their own, but there are times when they need assistance.  If caught early, some can be saved with antibiotics, but often it's too late by the time you realize your hen has a problem.  They are very good at hiding illness, as the others may attack if they sense weakness in order to move themselves up a notch in the pecking order.  </p>
<p>It's not fun caring for a sick chicken, but you have to do what you have to do when an animal needs help.  On a farm, you learn how to take care of most problems yourself, because vets who treat chickens aren't always easy to find, are rather expensive and aren't always available on a Friday night.  Fortunately, there are plenty chicken keeping discussion groups with folks willing to share knowledge.  Some groups are lucky enough to have actual vets giving advice.</p></div>		</li>
