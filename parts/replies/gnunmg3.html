			<div class="markdown"><p>I have not kept up on cosmology since the advent of dark matter. Way back when it first was gaining traction, WIMPs and MACHOs were the theoretical culprits. </p>
<p>MACHOs are Massive Compact Halo Objects. They are “non-exotic,” everything from rogue planets to unignited suns. Here’s my question... . Is all the “dust” accounted for in the visible matter calculation? the Sun is our local light emitter, and condensed from the soup of hydrogen, helium and the larger atoms produced by previous nova cycles. Alpha Centauri formed from its own dense section of the gases and dust. </p>
<p>The Sun far far out-weighs the planetary masses in its gravitational reach... but there is a lot of unused mass out there between the stars. A sphere of such baryonic matter, beyond the solar system disc. Less dense that the disc that collapsed and ignited, but still massive.</p>
<p>Was that interstellar waste ever accounted for?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>MACHOs (Massive Compact Halo Objects) have mostly been ruled out. The idea is that there are massive objects out in the “halo” (the sphere of extra gravity around the Milky Way), which do not emit light but account for the extra gravity. Black holes are the most common MACHO candidate, but it could be neutron stars or brown dwarfs, or maybe even some sort of exotic matter.</p>
<p>The thing is, even though MACHOs don’t emit light they <em>bend</em> light thanks to relativity. Although the effect would be subtle, we should be able to spot them passing between us and other galaxies. In recent years there have been a lot of full sky surveys launched, which should be able to spot lensing from MACHOs. And they haven’t. At this point we can probably rule them out, at least at most reasonable sizes.</p>
<p>I believe intermediate-mass black holes are still a possible MACHO candidate, <del>but they themselves are theoretical, and have resisted all attempts at detection</del>, but they have proven very difficult to detect, with only a few hints here and there. This would seem to indicate that they are rare, too rare to account for dark matter.</p>
<p>As for dust, despite being dark we can see dust pretty easily when it blocks light. It is typically counted as part of the sixth of matter that is visible. Based on the full sky surveys we’ve done, there simply isn’t enough of it.</p>
<p>So right now, WIMPs are the strongest candidate that best fit the evidence, though the case for them is getting weaker as we continue to build big old experiments to detect them and find nothing. Some versions of WIMPs have been ruled out. There are still a few left. Lately more scientists have been coming back to the idea that maybe gravity just breaks at galactic scales. Though if you did a poll, WIMPs would probably still win.</p>
<p>All that said, we really are in uncharted territory here. We have some evidence, some theories, and some experiments. There is good work being done. But we may well have missed something. Could be we miscounted the MACHOs or the dust or something. Can’t rule it out at this point.</p>
<p><em>EDIT: Looks like we have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW190521" target="_blank">detected</a> intermediate-mass black holes! I corrected my original wording which suggested they were still theoretical. They definitely exist, but there may not be very many of them.</em></p></div>		</li>

<p>Not all attempts. There's been a few discovered recently via gravitational waves, from small binary black holes or neighboring neutron stars merging together. But this is a rare phenomenon and your second point stands: intermediate-size black holes can't account for 85% of the matter in the universe.</p></div>		</li>

<p>we HAVE spotted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter#Gravitational_lensing" target="_blank">lensing</a>, we can't see what is causing it though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I love that those are two competing theories, but last I heard MACHOs were pretty much ruled out.</p>
<p>As for your question I see this on the wiki page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, multiple lines of evidence suggest the majority of dark matter is not made of baryons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sufficient diffuse, baryonic gas or dust would be visible when backlit by stars.</li>
</ul>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you might have already explained it in the dark energy paragraph, but for simpletons like me, when dark energy pulls space &amp; galaxies apart, new dark matter/energy pops into existence &amp; replaces this space? Or is it kind of like ‘heat’ dispersing into new, empty space as it’s freed up now?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The expansion of space doesn't create more matter. It also doesn't pull galaxies apart - expansion only happens in the empty space between galaxies; in fact galaxies represent regions of the universe that stopped expanding early on in the universe's history and collapsed instead.</p>
<p>The current best model for dark energy is something called the &quot;cosmological constant&quot;, which does have exactly the same density everywhere, and so more of this is &quot;created&quot; as expansion proceeds. But this isn't really a useful way of thinking about it, because the cosmological constant isn't really a tangible thing - there will never be a &quot;cosmological constant particle&quot;. It's just a degree of freedom allowed for in the equations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm probably way off on this thinking, but the way you described how galaxies are held together by the gravity of dark matter, and space is expanding in the empty spaces between galaxy with dark energy, what's to say that's not some sort of connection? The way I visualize it, which is probably wrong, is if there's expansion forces all around the galaxies, then maybe that expansion forces could help keep the galaxies compressed and held together as they're spinning. Maybe there's some sort of weird trickery in the boundaries between all the matter and the effects of it's gravity with all the very empty space as you head into the void between galaxies?</p></div>		</li>
