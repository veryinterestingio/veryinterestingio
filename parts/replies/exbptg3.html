			<div class="markdown"><p>An additional reason is that serotonin, if it could be delivered in this form, would be easy to overdose, which is a concern with depressed patients.  Not so with SSRIs. This safety aspect particularly has contributed to the success of SSRIs (and SNRIS) following the earlier-generation antidepressants.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is a technology called &quot;Beer Hats&quot; which you could use to store a container with your most desired chemicals as close to the opening as possible.</p>
<p>On a hot day it would also help keeping a cool head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There have been experiments on this (not on people of course). Turns out the drugs don't travel very far when you inject it directly into the brain. I suppose you'd have to get it directly onto the spot you want, but that just means it is going to be way more complicated than it is worth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The blood-brain barrier lines the arteries that supply every brain cell with oxygen and nutrients. The blood is supplied through arteries that permeate the brain, and it's on the surface of these arteries within the brain that is reinforced compared to the rest of the body.</p></div>		</li>
