			<div class="markdown"><p>While EM radiation absolutely can take any wavelength, our ability to measure it is limited.</p>
<p>There are two main ways to detect light: with antennas (treating light as a wave) or through their interactions with matter (treating light as a particle).   </p>
<p>Antennas are relatively narrow band receivers, meaning that any given antenna only detects EM waves over a &quot;narrow&quot; range of frequencies. The physical size of the antenna scales with the wavelength of EM wave you want to measure. This places physical limits on the range of EM waves measurable by humans from the macro (size of the earth: radio waves) to the micro (nanoscale: visible/UV light)  </p>
<p>Light interacts with matter primarily through quantum mechanical means. It can interact with electrons in an atom (visible light), vibrations or rotations of molecules and solids (infrared), or even nuclei (gamma rays). The ability of the material to interact with the EM-wave depends specifically on the material's quantum properties. So again, materials are sensitive only to specific ranges of EM-waves. If you wanted to measure some particular range of wavelengths, you would have to search for a material which strongly interacted with EM waves of that wavelength.  </p>
<p>So while it is possible for EM waves to have any wavelength, as far as I know our ability to measure them is limited due to the actual measurement processes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So theoretically if we made an antenna bigger than the earth it would pick up energy with wavelengths longer than radio waves? Like it exists we just havenâ€™t measured it yet?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We used to use radio waves with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremely_low_frequency" target="_blank">wavelengths larger than the earth to communicate with submarines.</a>  So yes, those very long wavelengths do exist and we can detect them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A wavelength longer than the diameter of the observable universe wouldn't lead to anything that behaves like radiation - it would be a static field. Apart from that there is no known limit.</p>
<p>The detection limit for very low frequencies comes from the question what you call radiation and what you consider a slowly changing static field. In general there is too much other stuff being detected to extract any useful information once the frequency is too low.</p>
<p>There is no relevant upper limit for the detection - photons with extremely high energy hitting the atmosphere produce showers of secondary particles, with a higher energy these showers contain more and more particles, so they always get more visible. The natural occurrence drops quickly at very high energies, what we actually measure depends on the area we can cover with telescopes. More area -&gt; more chance to detect one of the few ultra high energy photons.</p></div>		</li>
