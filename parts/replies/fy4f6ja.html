<p>Cholesterol and fat are now seen as actually beneficial (though quantity/portion control matters!), and not as bad as previously thought.  BUT, too much cholesterol (or fat or...quite a few other things, actually) can get caught in small capillaries and bends and such in the cardiovascular piping system.  So when it stacks up, you can get constriction and/or blockage.  </p>
<p>Not sure how exercise fits into that other than I would think it has a tendency to break up those deposits due to more blood flowing and the vessels dilating.</p></div>		</li>
