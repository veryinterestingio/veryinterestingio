			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you cite this? It is my recollection that enterocytes (lining the intestines)produce chylomicrons based on the food that is consumed. Thats why high lipid foods will make your blood lipemic ( literally looks milky) for a few hours after consuming something like fried chicken. I tried searching for it, but all I could find was new studies on bacteria that break down lipids more effectively in some individuals.</p></div>		</li>
