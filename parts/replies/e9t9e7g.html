			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also stuff like Fachabitur/Fachoberschule, Berufliches Gymnasium, Berufsausbildung, Berufsausbildung mit Abitur, Universität and Fachhochschule. The British secretary for education recently visited Dresden to learn about these things and the guy who had to explain this to him failed miserably (I didn't have the guts to correct him, because he's my higher up). </p>
<p>The German educational system can be a clusterfuck if you look at it's entirety.</p></div>		</li>

<p>e amount of semesters is depending on what you are trying to achieve. After successfully obtaining this title, you are capable of going even further to get your &quot;master&quot; (master of sience&quot;) and  </p>
<p>after that  </p>
<p>you can make your &quot;Doctor&quot; (PhD). Usually, the intention for making this, is to teach at universities. You get another title as well (Professor).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Important difference to add:</p>
<p>In Germany, when applying for a university, <em>you apply for a program:</em></p>
<p>You have to pick whether you want to study philosophy, maths, bioengineering, etc, <em>straight out of school</em>.</p>
<p>Since university is free (except for some private onces, which are <strong>not</strong> considered superior to private ones), it is pretty common to attain a master's degree, for which you have to re-apply however; also it is often more specialized then the bachelor program was.</p>
<p>Example: Bachelor's in biology, masters in molecular neuroscience.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Because of this, our doctorate programs (PhDs) <em>do not</em> encompass a master's degree, or university classes, at all.</p>
<p>Rather, you apply straight to a research lab you want to work in, or maybe a grant program of an institute which deposits you in one of their constituting groups after an intro period.</p>
<p>From there on out, you just work 3-5 years on your research, as a rule of thumb 3 publications with first authorship are considered the norm for attaining a PhD, though this varies on the discipline and specific university, of course.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So I'd also disagree that PhDs are for teaching in Unis: they are a necessary first step into the world of conducting research, and are linked to teaching responsibilites in universities - which is not the case for most research institutes.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: Some universities offer 1-2 semester programs during the course of which you can attend various lectures to &quot;try out&quot; subjects and see what you are interested in, but these are not very common and also not used by the vast majority of students.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That‘s pretty much spot on! I would just add that Fachhochschule is commonly translated as University of Applied Sciences. And a PhD doesn’t get you the Professor title yet, but just Doctor.</p>
<p>The idea behind the whole system is, that Hauptschule prepares you to go and learn trade/craft, Realschule prepares you for an apprenticeship and Gymnasium qualifies you for University.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, everything was fine until &quot;Usually, the intention for making this, is to teach at universities. You get another title as well (Professor)&quot;. First, indeed, Professor ≠ Doctor. Second — and I guess it depends from person to person, but still — claiming the usual reason for obtaining a PhD is to teach, seems inaccurate. I'd say the vast majority do it to be able to do research. Either at universities or in the industry. Teaching is typically considered either a necessary evil or a nice bonus, but is only rarely the goal.</p>
<p>Still, overall it was a pretty thorough yet concise description, so +1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well... lets put it simply (but take this with a grain of salt):
If you &quot;only&quot; get your Hauptschule-Abschluss (degree), you are kinda restricted. You usually end up with some crafting-job.. electrician, constructions, ... stuff like this. </p>
<p>Realschule tries to aim to get you a position above, so you sit in your office and manage a bit. Something like an event-manager as an analogie.</p>
<p>Someone plans an event (catering, line-up, dresscode...) (realschule) and someone has to &quot;work&quot; for it - as in: building up a stage, carrying heavy stuff to their places... </p>
<p>Maybe to sum it up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The higher your degree, the more responsibilities you get. Usually, when you have a high responsibility, your don't have to physically work that hard. Lower degree means more physical work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope i made it somewhat clear.</p></div>		</li>
