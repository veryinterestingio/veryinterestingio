			<div class="markdown"><p>This comment implies that causing someone to die by banning them from receiving treatment is not immoral. Even under the Copenhagen Interpretation of Ethics, this wouldn't hold up because the FDA is preventing people from taking medicine.</p>
<p>China decided that waiting for efficacy data on vaccines and tests would be too slow, and instead allowed people to take the vaccines and rapid-tests once they were found to be safe but not proven effective/highly specific. This approach has some flaws certainly, but it clearly outperformed. I have yet to see any strong arguments against the liberalization of medicine response to pandemics, but am open  to them.</p></div>		</li>
