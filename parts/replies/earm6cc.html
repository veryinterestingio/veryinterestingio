			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm were dragons an eastern thing? No, it mentions dragons in the bible i think. Maybe that was inferred. Dragons might be myths from dinosaur fossils?</p>
<p>I suddenly started wondering where dragons came from </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eastern long and Western dragons really aren't the same thing. They are both called dragons these days because of that era of translation. It's like Romans calling Odin Mercury. People like to conflate similar things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, Mercury. From what I understand, Mercury was the god of magic and so was Odin. I don't know exactly why the Romans called Odin Mercury but you can look it up. It's in all the primary sources. Tacitus calls Odin Mercury and Thor Hercules.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Western traditions of dragons <em>quite</em> clearly start from giant snakes.  For example, the text description of dragon here <a href="http://bestiary.ca/beasts/beast262.htm" target="_blank">http://bestiary.ca/beasts/beast262.htm</a>  is quite clearly referencing an Indian Rock Python, garbled through transmission of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's interesting dragons appear in all sorts of mythology. I guess everyone may have said &quot;ya know what's scary... Snakes... Ya know what would be scarier... giant flying snakes that breathe fire...&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you think about it, a dragon going underground with treasure (gold) would stay underground for a long time, so long that the dragon becomes stone. Or something like that.</p>
<p>Then a earthquake happens and a man sees a fossil of a t-rex or something similar. This same thing happens at a different time revealing a natural cave with jems and gold.</p>
<p>A connection is formed.  And legends are made in different parts of the world all focused around serpentine creatures with hordes of money.</p>
<p>Maybe?</p></div>		</li>
