<p>In order to use the mark &quot;New York Times Bestseller&quot;, a book only has to exist on a list once, at any position, at any time. Getting on the list is more about marketing for a single spike in book purchases all at once than about sales in aggregate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To add to this point a bit - the New York Times Bestseller lists don't track consumer sales, they track sales to book sellers.  So if Amazon orders a bunch of your book but none of them actually sell then the book is still a New York Times Bestseller.  </p>
<p>Publishers can, and have, gamed this system by buying their own books.  They then &quot;ship&quot; the books to a warehouse until actual demand for the books materializes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add more. Publishers don’t just game the system. It’s the absolute standard and default
marketing tactic to do so. </p>
<p>NY Times bestseller basically just means you have a marketing budget.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They game it, but NYT does eliminate obvious manipulations. Publishers have to do some work to create the illusion of broad interest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to these points: more popular books are more likely to keep being popular and selling more books. Of course bookstores would stock mostly books they think will sell quickly. It’s kind of like asking why you’ve heard of so many of the products at the grocery store.</p></div>		</li>
