			<div class="markdown"><p>You can cause pores to and micro-scratches to form if you clean non-metal kitchenware with steel wool. Bacteria can grow and hide in these and get people very sick no matter how hard you work to clean it. Never use steel wool on plastic or ceramic kitchenware.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are missing that the capsid of some viruses (like coronavirus) are disrupted by soap and kill, not just wash off, the virus. It takes time for the interactions to happen for it to kill them hence why waking hands wash longer than 20 seconds. Antibiotic soap takes time for the chemicals to kill as well. Alcohol sanitizer needs time for the alcohol to get into the cells which is why it needs to be in gel form as straight liquid goes away too fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing to note: antibiotic soaps are rarely better than normal soaps. If you're about to have a surgery, you can be asked to take a shower with antibiotic soaps and you'll be told to let the suds sit there for 2 minutes to make sure they have time to kill things. If you're not in that situation you're flushing antibiotics down the drain, which causes more bacteria to get exposed to dilute amount of antibiotic and develop countermeasures.</p>
<p>TLDR: Please use normal soap for washing unless your doctor or other professional tells you otherwise</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is an ideia of giving time to the chemical reaction of the soap and the germs as well.</p>
<p>For in hospital hand washing with some &quot;special&quot; soaps, this is thought to be particularly important.</p></div>		</li>
