			<div class="markdown"><p>Especially when there is a blue light around that dark area That's called a perkinje blue ring.</p>
<p>It does darken the vision where you are poking, but it looks reversed since vision is upside down and back to front. because vision in the top half is detected by the bottom half of the eye and vision on the right is detected by the left side of the eye. So when you push on the top right of your eye, that spot detects vision on the bottom left of your field of vision, and that's where the spot is. &quot;Opposite&quot; to where you're pushing but in reality exactly where the vision is detecting</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s because you actually see upside down and back to front but your brains flips it around so you can see everything the right way up. When you press on the left side your eye, for example, that’s actually where the light from your right is hitting.</p></div>		</li>
