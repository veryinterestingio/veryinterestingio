			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact - I can't find it, but a relatively recent NPR report looked into how companies can convince people to exercise (because this makes their health insurance plans cheaper).</p>
<p>Short answer: nothing works. They tried literally paying people to do it and it wasn't enough to form strong habits, lol.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: I'd like to add, I'm referencing the 150 minutes of moderate cardio and two muscle building sessions a week mentioned in the article.</p>
<p>Anyone can add a little bit here and there daily, but almost none of that is moderate cardio.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it feels like everyone here wants to have some misguided conversation about evolution while ignoring that the vast majority of chronic back pain is coming from sitting too much and poor posture. </p>
<p>There are a number of resources that go in more depth, but here is a nice TED talk on the subject to ease folks into thinking about what they can do that might be more helpful than just bemoaning their vertical spine. <a href="https://youtu.be/jOJLx4Du3vU" target="_blank">Why Sitting Down Destroys You</a></p></div>		</li>
