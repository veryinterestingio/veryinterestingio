<blockquote>
<p>But probably the best-documented evidence for asymptomatic cases has come from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which had a COVID-19 outbreak in early February while in Japanese waters, says Chowell. The ship was quarantined and the 3,711 passengers and crew members were repeatedly tested and closely monitored. Chowell’s modelling study3, published on 12 March in Eurosurveillance, shows that about 18% of some 700 infected individuals on Diamond Princess never showed symptoms. “You have to keep in mind that this was a special population” with lots of elderly people, says Chowell. Older people tend to fare badly when infected with the new coronavirus, so he suspects the rate of asymptomatic infections in a general population might be closer to the 31% that the Japanese team reported. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's another source that puts the asymptomatic rate even higher:

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:  I just want to point out that just because 50% were asymptomatic at the time of the test, that doesn't mean that all of those people remained asymptomatic.  Given the long incubation period this thing seems to have, many of them may well have developed symptoms afterwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One factor is the amount of virus you got infected with. A heavy virus load right from the start makes for a greater risk of serious complications. Not that just catching it from a small amount of virus particles is &quot;safe&quot;.</p>
<p>The other is age. I haven't found solid information yet on why kids are more often asymptomatic, they just are. My guess would be the still active thymus. The younger, the more the immune system is still actively learning to handle the vast variety of germs it encounters for the first time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When they say &quot;mild symptoms&quot;, do they mean *compared to being admitted to the ICU and put on a ventilator&quot; - like it still is a pretty nasty flu-like illness where you're shivering with a fever and struggling to breath and dry hacking...?  or just a slight cough and sore throat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s really hard to figure out, because some people just think they have colds. Because of a lack of testing right now in most places, only the more severe cases seem to be caught. I think some reports out of South Korea, where testing was more widespread, indicated that most cases are very mild (aka don’t require a doctor’s intervention, no worse than the flu type stuff). However, it’s really hard to predict who will get hit hard. Yes, you’re more at risk if you’re older and have pre-existing conditions, but some young, otherwise healthy individuals have also needed hospitalization.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To get tested at our local drive through place you have to have a fever of at least 100.</p>
<p>Who knows how many actually have it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read that Iceland has been able to do sweeping tests across the country testing everyone without bias. Their results are showing roughly half of those who test positive for COVID-19 are asymptomatic. Implying there is a good chance you have people in every part of the world right now who actually show a whole range of symptoms from the very severe, to extremely mild or never showing any symptoms at all. Asymptomatic carriers are the most dangerous of all since they can potentially infect hundreds of people with ever knowing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my understanding it follows a progression over time. </p>
<p>No symptoms-&gt;Mild cold like symptoms-&gt; Spread to the lungs resulting in mild pneumonia (flu like)-&gt; Severe Pneumonia requiring <del>a respirator</del> Supplemental oxygen or a CPAP machine-&gt; Critical Pneumonia requiring more invasive techniques-&gt; Death.</p>
<p>How bad it gets depends on how long it takes you to fight the virus off. If you stop it before it spreads to the lungs it may very well be an extremely mild cold (where you can spread it without knowing you ever had it). If it reaches the lungs before you fight it off you develop more flulike symptoms and difficulty breathing. Then it gets progressively worse until you fight it off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mild symptoms as you've been seeing in the reports means &quot;mild enough not to require significant medical intervention&quot;. The symptoms can run the gamut from a cold to fever, body aches, and chills lasting weeks. If it doesn't land you in the hospital (as a general rule) it's considered &quot;mild&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
