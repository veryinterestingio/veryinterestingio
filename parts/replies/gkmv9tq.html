			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a structural engineer, but I am a signals analyst, and I think metal things attenuate radio waves because it has to do with metal being conductive rather than the atomic structure or composition of that material.</p>
<p>To improve signal, move your router away from metallic objects. Metallic object act as a literal antenna for radio waves and will attenuate the shit out of them.</p></div>		</li>
