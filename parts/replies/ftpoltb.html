			<div class="markdown"><p>Story fun time! My first job out of school for medical lab science (being the person running your medical tests in a hospital from microbiology to chemistry etc)  I took a job at a small hospital where we had to do blood draws. Late one night a guy who was a drug addict comes in and I'm on call. I'm not confident let alone good at drawing blood. He realized I was new and calmly walks me through finding a good vein on him (between his ring and pinkie finger) and insisting I try until I got it (soooo not standard). Oddly good learning experience for me!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When my dad was in hospital after having had a heart attack, 2 female student doctors and a consultant came around to him on their rounds. The consultant said that one of the students was going to take a blood sample.</p>
<p>The first student doctor tried a number of times unsuccessfully, so the consultant took over. When the sample was taken, my dad asked the first student did they see how it was done? She said yes, so my dad gave her his arm again so she could practice some more until she got it. He then proceeded to let the other student try. He said the next day both of his arms were so bruised, but he didn't mind at all. Apparently the two students reminded him of me and my best friend. Those student doctors later came back and asked him could he be used in their case study because he was so kind to them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no stranger to blood tests, I was on lithium for 8 years until kidney damage.. at some times I'd go twice weekly for levels. It doesn't bother me at all anymore, plus I'm easy to hit first try. I went for regular blood work, yearly physical, and she nailed it, no problem, first try. She was chatting, fills a vial, removes the needle, cotton ball, oh fuck, she needed 4 more vials.</p>
<p>She got so upset and I felt so bad. I told her it was no big deal, don't worry, and she's apologizing. She asks if I want someone else, I say only if she's uncomfortable, and tell her I'm fine, she did really well, its not a big deal, you'll laugh about it later. So she uses my other arm, first try, painless, gets the required blood, apologizes again. She goes and grabs me a handful of candy (out for kids,) thanks me, and I leave.</p>
<p>The next time I had her again, and we laughed about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was pregnant with my first child I was high risk pregnancy so they needed blood every week for some insane reason, Starting around month 5 or 6. Anyway.... I suffer from anxiety so instead of sitting at the doctor having my visist, and then getting blood on the way out; I asked if that could be the first thing they do as soon as I get there, so I am not thinking about it the whole time I'm there. Another thing is I must look when the needle pierces my skin, if I don't I'll have a panic attack. So one day I'm sitting there chatting it up with the phlebotomist and he says to me... you have to be the weirdest person I've ever gotten blood from, it's crazy how you like doing it. I was like what type of psycho do you take me for? We had a good laugh after I explained to him why my behavior was so weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On one awful occasion I had blood taken from an artery. The pain was dazzling! I saw spots, and I have never been a fainter.</p>
<p>Just to share, a phlebotomist recently told me that if you are having a planned blood draw, drink 16 ounces of water 30 minutes before. it distends your veins and makes them easier to access. HTH! 65 years old and no one ever told me that!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was in the hospital with sepsis, I learned all sorts of new places you could draw blood from or insert an IV into. The worst was trying to get an IV in my foot (painful AND the vein blew out so it didn't even work) and the side of my pointer finger. I was so bruised all over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the exact same experience when hospitalized with sepsis! They didn't do my feet, I think because I'm a rough sleeper, and I kept getting violent after anesthesia. All the normal veins blew in a few days and on top of that my veins are always super difficult. They were threatening to IV my neck if they couldn't get one soon. So, so many bruises.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On like, literally the 7th try to get an IV in (I guess I have really deep veins), I joked that they could just use my jugular. The doctor, without any hint of humor said &quot;we're not quite there yet&quot;. Thankfully they ended up getting it in my arm... eventually.</p></div>		</li>
