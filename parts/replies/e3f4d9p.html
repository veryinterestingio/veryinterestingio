			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a small correction:</p>
<p>When Phase 1 is at its peak, Phase 2 and 3 are 50% in the negative, with one phase on its way down and the other phase on its way up.</p>
<p>The rule is that the sum of all phases must always equal 0 volts.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It delivers a steady stream of power, and that makes it much more useful for higher electrical loads.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With single phase, both wires pass through the middle of the AC cycle at the same time so there's constant brief periods of zero voltage, providing an uneven pulsating supply of power. For small appliances this doesn't really matter, but with heavier use (think big industrial machinery) that tiny lapse can interfere with the proper functioning of the machine. Plus there's 50% more wire, so you can just deliver more current overall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two major benefits. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Using two hot legs for a circuit instead of a hot and neutral, gets you a peak of 208V instead of just 120V. This means you can power high voltage devices (things that normally take 240V) from the same power tap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because of the way the phases are offset, if you have the same power load on each leg, then the current moving back down the neutral wire is totally cancelled out. </p>
</li>
<li>Now you will never get the load on all three legs exactly the same, especially in the live event industry, BUT you will get them close, for that reason we use a 5-wire setup. 3 hot legs, 1 neutral, and 1 safety ground. Because the currents cancel out so well, we only need 1 neutral wire instead of 3. </li>

<p>That's a 3-phase generator. When the central axle spins, it generates a current in the pole it's passing. The three phases are shown in different colors. So when it lines up with one that one will be at max current, the other two will be 50% negative with the axle coming towards one and going away from the other. </p>
<p>An engine is the exact same thing, and you can basically hook up the phases to another identical machine and when they induce a current in the poles the exact opposite thing will happen and they will pull the central axle around using the same magnetic field the axle induces on them when it spins. If you take two poles and swap them around the machine will run backwards. This is a common issue when hooking up machines which use 3 phase power, you have to make sure the poles are lined up correctly. </p>
<p>So in a house you'll generally just split the phases. Divide them around so one goes to the kitchen, one to the living room and bed rooms and one to the laundry room and bathroom, for example. </p>
<p>I think the most interesting thought here is that you can really see how it's just a transfer of energy. Imagine you had the same two machines next to each other, a generator and an engine but instead of the wire it's just the generator's source of torque hooked directly up to the thing you want to power (like a mill) by an axle. Electricity just takes that incredible power we generate with steam turbines, windmills, water turbines etc, puts it into a wire and transfers it wherever you need it. </p>
<p>But it's really the same thing, if you had 5 bulls powering a generator, and ran the wire to some machine, that machine would have the power of ~5 bulls. Maybe I'm just weird, but for me this example kind of clarified that point and i thought it was really cool. It's not just this abstract energy thing. It's physical energy, and just like stuffing water into a hose to power something at the other end, we put electrons in motion to power stuff. </p>
<p>Edit: For the experts: In the bulls example. If you put more resistance on the machine the bulls are powering, would the bulls feel it as resistance in the generator?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Partly correct. The 120V are not the peak voltage but the average voltage. The peak voltage is 120V*sqrt(2).</p>
<p>Three phase power is also very good for electric motors. The three phases build in a circular arranged coil a spinning magnetic field. This field can then easily spin a magnetic rotor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Partly correct ;) The 120V is the RMS (root mean square) voltage. The average of a sinusoidal function is zero.</p></div>		</li>
