			<div class="markdown"><p>I was in a sound proof room with negative sound pressure. It felt very strange when I entered the room. It was negative pressure in my ears. Almost like the opposite of going under water. Very strange feeling. They have negative decibel rooms that people can’t stay in for more than a few minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait. So is it normal to hear a slight ringing in your ears sometimes when it’s completely quiet in the house? I always thought that was just the sound of the blood rush in you ears or something? Or do I possibly have light tinnitus? I never hear it except when it’s fully quiet around me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I may have just remembered what could have caused this! I’ve been slightly worried about my ears ever since homecoming about 6 months ago. They had reallly really loud speakers in there and I eventually got used to it and was walking by in front of the speaker kind of close and I remember it all of a sudden being way louder as soon as I walked in front and my ear hurt. It even would’ve been my left ear which is the one that occasionally is a little worse than the other. It makes so much sense. I forgot about it a few months ago. But I kept being worried about my ears for a little while after that. Anyways that is not something that commonly occurs in my life. And I believed that’s what caused it. So as long as I continue to be careful it may go away. It doesn’t really bug me though. I at least feel better thinking it’s not my fault (even though part of it may still be )</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oof, I’m so careful thoughhhhhh to the extent where I always think it’s dumb how low a volume I listen to my music and etc. so if this is true that sucks so much.  It’s not too bad though, and I only ever hear it in the middle of the night</p></div>		</li>

<p>The sudden relief when a noise I didn't notice suddenly disappears is strange.</p></div>		</li>
