			<div class="markdown"><p>Saying enamel is harder than steel is misleading because steel can have a wide range of hardness depending on alloy, heat treatment, and probably other factors. For example AR500 steel is way harder than mild steel and tool steel is harder than spring steel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, came here to say that. The tools they use might be treated in such a way that they are softer than teeth, but steel can be treated to be incredibly hard and brittle. I wanted to make sure people are aware of this befoee they start going around biting steel things as a party trick or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also hardness doesnâ€™t correlate perfectly with yield stress and elasticity.  Structure is super important. </p>
<p>Biting a piece of steel may not scratch your teeth but it sure can crack it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>edit: <del>yes, but dentist equipment manufacturers don't make their dental picks out of case-hardened steel.  They use mild steel for that.</del></p>
<p>Drills for example.  Yes, those are hardened steel and they <em>do</em> go through enamel.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, I meant mild steel which they make the non-damaging tools OP is talking about.  Not e.g. dentist drills which also are made of steel (and an entire range of misc other alloys), and are <em>much</em> harder than enamel. </p>
<p>It's ELI5, not a class in metallurgy. But you are correct, there are multiple different alloys and treatments of steel. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because steel, is heavier than enamels. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Mohs scale doesn't really mean much; soft materials can damage harder, it just the majority of the damage is on the softer material.</p>
<p>Besides, dental tools are often made from 410 or 420 grade stainless [1] which is depending on heat treatment is either a little bit harder than tooth enamel to a lot harder. [2,3]</p>
