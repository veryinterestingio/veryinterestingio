			<div class="markdown"><p>Just one correction; you don't need to dissolve salts on land. Instead, take a look at minerals, e.g. Alkalifeldspars. Those contain Na. Now let's also take some volcanoes, who can spew out Cl-compounds, which can also dissolved in water and boom; now you can evaporate the water and get NaCl.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. The water doesn’t just dissolve the salt. Chemical-filled rain reacts with rocks where there was no salt, and creates salt. Then that salt gets carried by the rain to the oceans, where it <del>cannot escape</del> accumulates while the water evaporates.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Salts both enter and leave the oceans. It’s a continuous cycle for each salt. We’ve known this since the early work of marine geochemist and paleoclimatologist Wallace Broecker in the 1970s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The oceans have had variations in past salinity levels (both the different salts relative to eachother, and the overall salinity level), but this is always towards a new equilibrium point. As it stands, current salinity levels have been stable for a few million years. </p>
<p>This is because salts do not endlessly accumulate in the oceans. There are removal processes as well as ones which add salts. Specifically, salts leave the oceans as sediment onto the seafloor, or into the oceanic crust itself via chemical reactions in hydrothermal vent systems. There have also been episodes throughout Earth history in which inland seas can become isolated and cutoff from the oceans, so that the basin dries up and leaves behind salt deposits on land - evaporites.</p></div>		</li>
