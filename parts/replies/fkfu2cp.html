			<div class="markdown"><p>I turned over a fallen sign at a state park in California that said do not feed the chipmunks, they may have bubonic plague.  Of course this was after I had already fed the chipmunks.  I suspect, but can't prove, they were the ones who knocked the sign over to begin with.</p></div>		</li>

My mom would pull me away and say I was going to get “Blue Bonnet Plague.”  I was 5. I’m 53 now and I still can’t help but think of people in blue bonnets with the plague when I hear bubonic plague.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to take away anything from that, but just a note that plague is caused by bacteria and ever since the invention of antibiotics treating all bacteria diseases has been relatively easy. This is why viruses are so scary because we don't have a large spectrum weapon against them; and why antibiotic-resistant bacteria are so scary because we don't know how to treat all these diseases without antibiotics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The last major plague outbreak in the US happened in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1924_Los_Angeles_pneumonic_plague_outbreak" target="_blank">1924</a> (it was the even more contagious version, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonic_plague" target="_blank">pneumonic plague</a>), it killed ~30 people. It was probably the result of an earlier plague outbreak in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_plague_of_1900%E2%80%931904" target="_blank">San Francisco</a> (killed 100) in 1900, that was covered up for economic gain. Stowaway rats on cargo ships from China spread plague carrying fleas across California, eventually reaching Los Angeles in the fall of '24. </p>
<p>The plague still occurs across the Western US, with about half of the deaths occurring in New Mexico. California still has a few plague cases annually, but they're quickly treated and people rarely die. </p>
<p>There is still a form of the plague, although extremely rare, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septicemic_plague" target="_blank">Septicemic Plague</a> (infection of the blood), which will kill even with the benefit of modern medicine. Its case mortality rate approaches 100%, and is certain death if not caught within 24hrs of symptoms presenting. Luckily, it was rare in the Middle Ages and incredibly rare today (although people still get it).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2595158/?page=1" target="_blank">Here's</a> some more info on the 1924 plague. It was handled quite well and stopped before it became serious, partly due to lessons learned during the 1900 outbreak. </p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/rh6jnyj7cnd41.jpg?width=1024&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=544c710eb3d92484abbb21a2c21ad6e2f6813c6a" target="_blank">Here's</a> a photo of the disinfecting crews used during the outbreak. Their lack of PPE is pretty terrifying, considering the plague was airborne. </p>
<p>And <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_century_Madagascar_plague_outbreaks#2017" target="_blank">some info</a> on the most recent plague outbreak in Madagascar, where the plague is still endemic. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Plague is relatively easy to treat now that we have antibiotics. Some people get pulmonary anthrax still from shearing wool but thats about it. The problem was that sanitation was so bad back then that fleas were rampant and handling of corpses wasnt helping. </p>
<p>I believe it stopped partially because it killed off so many people that, in a way, it limited it's ability to continue to infect more people. Less hosts around.</p></div>		</li>
