			<div class="markdown"><p>Another consideration would be Jupiter's luminosity.  Sparing the maths, I think apparent magnitude would be around -16 from Ganymede when in opposition.  This would make it \~15 times brighter than a full moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed.</p>
<p>Back-of-the-envelop calculations assuming the Moon's albedo is 1/8 and Jupiter's is 1/2 and that Jupiter is at 5AU and the Moon at 1AU leads me to think Jupiter's surface brightness would be around 4/(5\^2) \~= 1/6th of the Moon's.</p>
<p>From our earlier numbers, I said Jupiter's luminosity was 15x the Moon's.  From your calculation, Jupiter's angular diameter was 15x the Moon's.  So the difference in surface brightness should be \~15/(15\^2) = 1/15.</p>
<p>Close enough for astronomical estimates :D  (the discrepancy can probably be explained by my sloppy approximations like using -13 as the Moon's apparent magnitude and 5AU as Jupiter's distance to the Sun.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the other hand: Life on Ganymede would be used to lower light intensities in general (1/25 from the Sun).</p>
<p>There are places that will always see the Sun or at least a nearly half full Jupiter. It is never very dark there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this take into account that Jupiter is 5 times the distance from the sun that Earth/Moon is, and is relatively 1/25th as bright had it been the same distance from the sun as the Earth/Moon?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All the numbers are rounded and only express order of magnitude, but yes.</p>
<p>Jupiter's apparent magnitude at opposition from Earth is -2.6 at a distance of 4 AU \~= 6e8 kms.  Ganymede is \~1e6 km away from Jupiter.  A parsec is \~3e13 km and the equation for apparent (little m) and absolute magnitude (big M) is:</p>
<p><strong>m - M = 5*log(d/10)</strong>, where d is distance in parsecs.</p>
<p>So, Jupiter's absolute magnitude = <strong>M = -5*log(6e8/3e13/10) - 2.6 \~= 26</strong></p>
<p>Apparent magnitude from Ganymede = <strong>m =  5*log(1e6/3e13/10) + 26 \~= -16</strong></p>
<p>Since the Moon's apparent magnitude from Earth is close to -13 and every point decrease represents a \~2.5x increase in brightness we gather that Jupiter's from Ganymede should be <strong>2.5\^(16-13) \~= 15</strong> times the Moon's brightness from Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wikipedia says the surface of Ganymede receives about 8 rem per day (that's about 50 times the regular background dose at sea level here on Earth) from Jupiter's magnetosphere. Ganymede has its own magnetic field generated by water circulating in its Mantle, so the highest doses would be found near its magnetic poles as charged particles - mostly high energy electrons - follow the Ganymedian magnetic field to the surface. </p>
<p>So the OP might want to locate any base away from the poles;  bury it under a few metres of ice (water is a great radiation shield); and restrict surface time for the astronauts.</p>
<p>There's also a regular fluctuation in radiation hitting Ganymede as the moon's orbit is inclined with respect to Jupiter's magnetic field which means there would be times when the radiation dose is pretty low and other times when it might not be wise to go out (which is of course the precise time the plot would require our hero to be on the surface). This paper gives more details:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jupiter emits vast quantities of radiation. The Juno probe had to be specially hardened against radiation but its instruments are still expected to be damaged by the radiation. However Ganymede orbits about a million kilometers from Jupiter while Juno's orbit takes it to only a few thousand kilometers from Jupiter at closest approach.</p></div>		</li>
