			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I believe it's all in the recipe. I have a recipe named &quot;Cut-Out Sugar Cookies,&quot; and the dough is quite dry. We roll the dough to cut out a santa or whatever, and the baked cookie has exactly that shape. I tried buying a tube of sugar cookie dough, rolling it out, and cutting out cookies, and they baked into blobs, not resembling a santa at all. So it must be the recipe.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A cup of flour can vary pretty significantly based on how packed it is, and U.S. cups are slightly less than cups in the rest of the world. But 100g of flour  or 100g (=100mL) of water are going to be the same in every kitchen</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why the US Government specification for MRE brownies runs 26 pages.  Everything from the nuts on top to the flour to the baking time is spelled out to ensure uniform size and consistency - and a shelf life to rival twinkies.</p></div>		</li>
