			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to think of the human adenovirus as a 'weak' virus because it is fairly asymptomatic , but after considering your point here it's much more adapted to human infection. Given a long enough time frame, all viruses should make themselves relatively benign as a survival strategy against a population that actively pursues vaccines to deadly or inconvenient diseases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolution doesn't have an end goal. It is just a greedy minimization algorithm to an ever changing search space. While becoming less damaging to your host is a good general strategy that most viruses have adopted, there is no set of mutations that would make a virus perfectly adapted to every possible host.  Most of the time we see deadly viruses is because a mutation that made it better adapted to their usual host also allowed them to jump to humans. But because humans have a different biology, what would only be a minor inconvenient to the virus' host is deadly to humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only thing that gets selected for is increased transmission and there are many ways that pathogens can achieve this. </p>
<p>One important variable is how much transmission occurs before symptom onset. For COVID, transmission <em>peaks</em> around symptom onset, so the severity of the disease is somewhat irrelevant since the virus has already had the chance to spread to a new host by the time the patient feels sick. This is thought to be one of the main reasons why it spread so much more than SARS in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>Mutations that increase replication rate are another way that viruses can become more transmissible. We're seeing this with the delta variant which spreads much faster because it produces about 1000x more virus by the time we can detect it. For now, we haven't seen much of an increase in virulence with the delta variant but it could happen.</p>
<p>People often claim that viruses cannot evolve to become more virulent and that's just not true.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>But a mutation being deadly is not necessarily beneficial to the pathogen; in fact it is quite often the opposite.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So why do we ever see pathogens mutate into more deadly versions? Is that just an unintended consequence of a mutation which is otherwise more beneficial to the pathogen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. The evolutionary pressure is simply towards whatever spreads the most <em>now</em>. Evolution has no foresight. If a pathogen drives both its host and itself extinct, so be it.</p>
<p>For example myxomatosis was introduced to rabbits in Australia. It was initially over 90% fatal and spread rapidly through the large rabbit populations. Only once the remaining population was sparse did less deadly strains of the virus evolve and dominate, while the rabbits also evolved resistance.</p>
<p>Dutch Elm disease is another case of a highly lethal epidemic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mutation isn’t by design, it’s random. A virus doesn’t choose to become more lethal, it just buggers up a replication and all of a sudden it’s killing the hosts quicker. Sometimes that’s enough to trigger social changes in the host, or incapacitate the host before it can effectively spread the virus, sometimes not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Natural selection on pathogens acts mainly at the level of transmission. There’s a widespread amateur notion that pathogens “evolve toward harmlessness”, but that’s nonsense; there are lots of counterexamples. Changes in virulence are almost always reflections of adaptations toward enhanced transmission. </p>
<p>The most famous example might be myxoma in Australian rabbits, which evolved to reduced (but still very high) virulence because the sand fleas that spread the virus don't feed off dead rabbits, but feed very well off dying rabbits that can't scratch them away; so the virus evolved to kill rabbits slowly and enhance transmission through insects.</p>
<p>Enhanced transmission is exactly what we’re seeing with the COVID variants of concern.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well you're pretty much describing what we'd expect. Immunity for vaccines may create evolutionary pressure for a variant which can bypass the vaccine immunity, but while there are still plenty of unvaccinated people walking around catching it, the selection pressure won't be that high. Whether a strain is more deadly or not probably won't effect transmission so much in that case, because there are still lots of unvaccinated people to infect (even if they eventually die)</p></div>		</li>
