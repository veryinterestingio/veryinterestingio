<p>Galaxies do not fail to form spheres because they lack mass. The mass in galaxies is dispersed over an area that's vast compared to a solid body, and the force of mutual attraction decreases with the square of the distance between two particles or bodies. Galaxies are mostly empty space, that's why they don't form spherical shapes. The wide distribution of mass also prevents that mass from collapsing and forming massive black holes.</p>
<p>Black holes are not going to inevitably consume entire galaxies. When such a black hole is &quot;turned on&quot; by consuming mass, mechanisms start that push other mass away from the black hole. This process is still being studied, but it is relatively widely theorized that they keep galaxies in some kind of balance and prevent consumption of entire galaxies.</p>
<p>Our solar system did not engulf the accretion disc that formed around it (no such disk &quot;preceded it&quot;). The accretion disk formed the planets and asteroids, and small particles left out of that process were blasted away by the solar wind</p>
<p>Galaxies do not condense into elliptical shapes. Current elliptical galaxies are the result of chaotic galactic mergers. There are unknown forces that keep galaxies in the spiral shapes: the forces involved in all baryonic matter (normal matter which reflects light) present in such galaxies would deform them into homogeneous discs over time, but not into spheres or ellipses.</p></div>		</li>
