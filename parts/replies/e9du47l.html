<p>Western rules of &quot;fair play&quot; are no better or worse than Chinese value of &quot;cleverness&quot;, just different.</p>

<p>I beg to differ. </p>
<p>If you cheat your way to your job, that doesn’t mean you are good at your job. Imagine a surgeon who cheated his way up. That good for no one but the surgeon. </p>
<p>There is also a lack of trust which results in people spending more energy watching their backs than getting the job done - i.e. There is no social punishment for playing dirty so why not?</p>
<p>I don’t see anything good in Chinese “cleverness” - which is not unique to China; Brazil has a similar culture (which went in display during the Olympics when the booed the French high jumper to try to get him to lose - the “win at any cost” mentality).</p></div>		</li>
