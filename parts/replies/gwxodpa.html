			<div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: bacteria and other germs need to eat just like we do. And just like we do, after germs eat, they go potty. Even though we can reheat the food to kill off the germs, it doesn't kill their poop. It's never a good idea to eat poop and that's no different than the poop from bacteria. So when you eat food that's old, the toxins from the bacteria poop is still there and that's what usually gets you sick. As strong as stomach acid is, it's more designed about breaking down proteins than destroying something as small as toxins from bacteria poop. So you can still get sick from it despite all the acid your stomach makes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the poop. Nitrogen outputs like nitrites, nitrates and ammonia go into the nitrogen cycle to be used mainly by plants. Acids like lactic acid can be neutralized in the environment and decompose chemically.  </p>
<p>The other &quot;end of the line&quot; are oxides or salts. Happily, most salts came to you as a salt, so it's just running through.  Oxides, particularly iron oxide, are pretty end-stage as far as life goes, though of course you can do chemistry to reverse it.</p>
<p>Water, co2, and nitrogen compounds are the vast majority of the final outputs we creatures emit. Everything else is pretty trace.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing eats that bacterial waste because by its definition its broken down as far as it can go, but depending on the species of bacteria, that waste can be useful for other organisms or for the environment in general. For example, one of the types of bacteria that live in our bodies are lactic acid bacteria, which are so named because they &quot;poop&quot; lactic acid. This lactic acid can help us digest our food and prevent the growth of bad bacteria that make us sick.</p>
<p>Lactic acid bacteria are also useful to us outside of our bodies. Lactic acid how we ferment a bunch of different kinds of food. If you like cheese, yogurt, sauerkraut, or kombucha, thank lactic acid bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wash your hands</p>

<li>Don't eat poop</li>

<p>Abide by these two rules, and you'll prevent a very very large portion of foodborne illness</p></div>		</li>

Food is food and it hasn’t killed me yet but if I’m being honest it’s definitely given me some bad belly aches</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's OK, it's just a sliding scale. You venture to eat some more byproducts of someone (innocent bacteria) eating the same food, hence the off smell. Unless it's rampantly rancid and rotting, you probably will stomach it, but with great difficulty and unpleasantness. Day old food certainly won't have any kind of bad aftereffects, unless it sat in the heat for all that time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it is always hotter than the bacterias can handle, they never really grow much and the food is safe.</p>
<p>It is the principle behind buffet tables, they are either very hot or very cold all the time, so the food can stay there all day.</p>
<p>There is something called &quot;forever stew&quot; I think. Common in medieval times, a pot above an everlasting fire, where you dump all scraps and make a constantly replenishing stew out of them.</p></div>		</li>

I guess as long as you keep it cooking at the right temp the bacteria don't have time to multiply? Just a guess though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, the space between 40F and 140F is <del>in</del>hospitable to bacterial growth.</p>
<p>So either keep your food cold (think refrigerator temps or lower) or hot (think before burning but, uncomfortably hot water for most people) and you won't give bacteria etc/ much chance to propagate.</p>
<p>EDIT: CAPTAIN FAT FINGERS STRIKES AGAIN.  40-140 is good for microbial growth.  Colder or hotter less so respectively.</p></div>		</li>

<p>“[Botulinum]is a million times more deadly than the most deadly manufactured compound – dioxin.”</p>
<p>It also notes that it is used in Botox  which I guess I’d heard before but had forgotten.</p></div>		</li>
