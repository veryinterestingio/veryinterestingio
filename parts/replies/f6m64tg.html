			<div class="markdown"><p>I have good iron and ferritin levels and i still have dark circles, i think there are too many factors at play. It doesn't seem to matter what i do, they are always there. They do get worse with not enough sleep though, i don't notice anything else affecting it.</p></div>		</li>
