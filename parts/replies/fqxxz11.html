			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that was my comment too about the IgM vs IgG. Here's a good link as to how these apply to covid-19 versus the molecular tests for active infection: <a href="https://www.diazyme.com/images/covid19/figure1.png" target="_blank">IgM, IgG, Molecular tests</a></p>
<p>I was rather saddened to see that the widely available antibody tests don't include IgM, only IgG. It is helpful to have both to determine active infection versus something you had previously and are immune to.... you could literally be at the opposite ends of the infection depending on which is peaking.</p>
<p>I think my answer to your question is:</p>
<p>1) Yes you typically develop immunity to a virus and that's what I'd expect. But this is a one in a century phenomenon so who knows</p>
<p>2) What level of IgG actually induces immunity? Do we need a vaccine with a &quot;booster&quot; shot to incur higher levels of IgG?</p>
<p>3) Will this continuously mutate like the common cold or influenza, so even if you had either before you are not immune to the new strain every season? It's not brought up much, but that is my biggest concern.</p></div>		</li>
