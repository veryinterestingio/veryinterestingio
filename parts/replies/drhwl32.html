<p><a href="http://www.ninjutsu.org.uk/takamatsu_ninjutsu_grandmaster.html" target="_blank">http://www.ninjutsu.org.uk/takamatsu_ninjutsu_grandmaster.html</a></p>
<p>Read about this guy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em>Koto Ryu training involved strong conditioning of the hands and feet, especially the fingers and toes. As a result of constant striking of rocks and hard objects, Toshitsugu's finger nails were 4 to 5 millimeters thick. He could not cut them with nail cutters. It is said he could tear the bark off of a tree with a simple sweep of his hand. He later said that this kind of training is of no use today.</em>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the fact is that some of this training is still relevant today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure! Our fingers are notorious for their dexterity. If you really get rid of a fingernail - say, you lose it after hurting it - you have just a bit less control over that very end of your fingertip. If you work at a computer all day, then no biggie. But if you spend a lot of time doing needlework, fretting strings on an instrument, untying fine knots, doing small linework with a pen – all of those very fine motor skills? It is just a little less control and stability in that area that can really make an impact in those skills. </p>
<p>I am a dancer, and I notice it most when I cut a toenail too short. Having some nails gives the front edge of the toe a little more support in balancing, and makes it easier for me to spread my weight more evenly across all 5 toes instead of relying on the more stable big toe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Op said it, and I’ll add. If you play a fretted instrument, it becomes obvious that the nails reinforce the pressure you can apply without pain or damage. After a point, the nails stick out too far and interfere or get bent or broken. It’s better to trim than deal with the negative effects.</p>
<p>Toes just seem to be thicker and receive more continuous wear, but that’s not what you asked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say so, infact, I would say we may use our nails more now, then we did then. Being a guy, I keep my nails awfully short, and probably should keep them a bit longer, but regardless, I find on a daily basis how much use I would have for long nails. Prying, opening, etc. We don't use our nails for opening nuts like we use to, but we still use them an awful lot. For example, those stupid lock bags you can't open that eventually you just end up shoving you nail into. </p></div>		</li>
