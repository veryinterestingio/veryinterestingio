			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a great question! There’s a real issue with adults who game for long periods of time. I can’t say I’m as worried about children (not teenagers yet), but we’ve seen a number of patients who have died from thrombosis from extended periods of gaming. It’s all about that immobility in the chair for really long periods of time, which stimulates clot formation. It’s t he same thing, really, as sitting on an airplane for long periods of time.</p></div>		</li>
