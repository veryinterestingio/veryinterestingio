			<div class="markdown"><p>I love that you basically understand this!!!! We now understand magma to not be this liquid inferno of molten rock, but a mush. It's crystalline and starting to turn into rock, and based on the percent mineral to percent melt (magma) we infer the likelihood of another eruption. Something like Yellowstone is probably somewhere in the realm of 60% crystals, meaning it's mostly crystals and the magma is localized in small pockets between the crystals.</p>
<p>To unlock the pockets of melt to combine and become eruptible is going to take a lot of heat and energy. And exponentially more to make is supereruption energic vs. lava flow energy. </p>
<p>But that was a long winded way to say...you're basically correct!!!!</p>
<p>Edit: Not sure why the downvotes...that wasn't sarcastic. I was legitimately stoked that someone understood that. Sorry if I come across wrong. I'm just super into this stuff and really excited about this discussion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This should have been a parent comment. We've seen Yellowstone inflate, deflate, become more active, back off somewhat, etc. Every change is accompanied by clickbait such as YELLOWSTONE SUPERERUPTION IMMINENT???. And similar tabloid headlines in the 20th century. </p>
<p>The Yellowstone caldera is one of the most scientifically monitored spots on earth. A supereruption would wreck much of North America, of course, but also cause catastrophic effects over the entire Northern Hemisphere, and probably beyond. It wouldn't cause humans to become extinct, but it would probably end many civilizations. </p>
<p>A smaller eruption is definitely possible, given Yellowstone's history and present state. In fact, the next eruption is more likely to be a less destructive event. This is <strong>not</strong> to say people living within a few hundred miles should let their guard down. Even a partial pyroclastic explosion has the potential to kill hundreds or thousands of people, but wouldn't be a global disaster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would an earthquake be enough to let some fresh molt in? Can there be earthquakes there, or are earthquakes in that region always caused by the volcano, and not the other way around? Why is that area so active (with geysers and such) but &quot;safe&quot; at the same time?</p>
<p>Do we know that much about Etna too? Is there a risk of it exploding catastrophically, St. Helen style?</p>
<p>Sorry for the wall of questions. Your comment gave me so much new info, I'm bursting with curiosity now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the earthquakes in Yellowstone are mostly due to magma movement, not plate/regional stress (similar to hawaii not the San Andreas fault zone). The area is has geysers and mud pots and thermal pools because the subsurface is very hot. It's safe because there isn't a ton of new heat being introduced into the system. Hawaii has a very consistent supply of melt and a well established plumbing system to get lava to the surface.</p>
<p>We know lots about Etna. I personally don't know if it will explode violently like St Helens</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So earthquakes around all volcanoes are super common! Within the US there are a few USGS volcano observatories that constantly monitor the background activity around volcanoes. </p>
<p>Yellowstone is super seismically active, hundreds of earthquakes per year. Most of them are &lt;M3.0. A huge earthquake in the are could potentially trigger an eruption.</p>
<p>In 1959 the M7.3 Hebgen Lake earthquake (very very near Yellowstone) didn't cause an eruption. So, it'd most likely take a much bigger magnitude earthquake to cause an eruption. And that is very unlikely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not sure why the downvotes either — I was excited to see someone else who understood it! And who definitely said it simply enough for ELI5, because I would’ve ended up with something long winded myself since it’s such an exciting topic. It’s always fun seeing other geologists and volcanologists floating around!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey if this is something your anxiety likes to latch onto, then aside from the excellent Eli5 answer you replied to, there is a wealth of information out there which can assure you further (which unfortunately often gets drowned out by the popular alarmist narratives surrounding Yellowstone and supervolcanoes). </p>
<p>Anyway, take a look at the USGS’s brief answer to the question “when will Yellowstone next erupt?” <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/yellowstone-overdue-eruption-when-will-yellowstone-erupt?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products" target="_blank">here</a>, which itself has a link early on in the text to a similar question they’ve answered about if volcanic eruptions can be “overdue” (spoiler alert: it doesn’t work like that!) where they specifically talk about Yellowstone in more detail. </p>
<p>It’s not just lip service either, the USGS employs the best trained scientists and has probably the most well funded volcanic monitoring programme in the world (<em>looks in envy from the UK</em>)</p>
<p>If you want a little more insight into volcanic plumbing systems, how they influence eruption dynamics and with specific reference to Yellowstone again, then take a look <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/yellowstone" target="_blank">this excellent answer from a volcanologist</a> in the FAQ over at r/askscience. </p>
<p>If you want something to worry about, then California’s much more enigmatic Long Valley Caldera might do the job. (But seriously, that’s closely monitored too, and there would be decades of warning <strong>if</strong> something major were to ever occur again).</p></div>		</li>
