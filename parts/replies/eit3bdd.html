			<div class="markdown"><p>Or rubbing your hair on a blanket to create a bunch of sparks. Sparks generate ozone. If you smell the blanked after rubbing your hair in it you can smell the &quot;metallic&quot; scent if ozone. Also can be achieved by playing with a plasma globe. My hands always smell like ozone after touching it for a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While there is no doubt ozone smell occurs with rain, I am not sure I buy this explanation for pre-rain smell, simply because it doesn't explain the smell occurring when there is no electrical activity to produce ozone.  I think smell before rain is more than likely caused by the same components of petrichlor that is observed after a rain, just in smaller concentrations.  Before a rain, humidiy often rises sharply, and I suspect this increases our ability to detect smells such as geosmin.  Many decisuous trees, for example, will invert their leaves just before a rain.  Even your link mentions oils secreted by plants as being a contributor, so maybe plants reacting ahead of rain (like maple trees inverting their leaves) is one of those contributors.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It did; it said it was the ozone from the lightning activity in the storm itself, carried ahead of the storm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, you can even smell ozone in the air (it has a sharp scent reminiscent of chlorine) before a storm arrives because it can be carried over long distances from high altitudes.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's always an elevated concentration of ozone higher in the atmosphere compared to ground level because of ionizing UV rays. What's happening before a storm that brings some more of that ozone down to ground level is precipitation that forms higher in the atmosphere falling down into a warmer air mass, where it vaporizes again, thus cooling the warm air and causing the entire air mass to descend, including the ozone in it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No no the electric current happens before that rain hits the ground. The storm is happening before it hits us. That’s what OP was referring to when he mentioned that ozone’s scent can travel miles in distance AND altitude! :)</p></div>		</li>
