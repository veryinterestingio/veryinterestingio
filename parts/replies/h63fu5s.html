			<div class="markdown"><p>So where exactly in the brain does this happen? Is there a neural memory created in a certain part of the brain that stores muscle memory? like in the frontal cortex or something</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you do same action again and again - neural connection between specific neurons in your brain improves, so less resistance and signals are easier to pass.<br />
It's like with hike trails - at first it's bumpy and covered in grass\roots\etc. But as more and more people pass by - trail start to turn into a road, roots are removed, slopes and holes are covered, etc.  </p>
<p>So if at first you would need a map to find a trail - now it's 20-line autoban with signs and gas stations on the way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main part involved in this is the Cerebellum.</p>
<p>Funfact: language involves a lot of muscle memory too. Not for recognizing Word=meaning, but for the actual speaking part of how to move lips, tongue, jaws and vocal cords</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the cerebellum is more for fine tuning of movements. The main work of selecting and initializing motor movements is done by the cingulate gyrus ðŸ¤“</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same as throwing a basketball. At some point you get better, because you remember how strong you gotta throw and how to move your body for it to hit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am into cardistry to some extent. I noticed that when I have a deck of cards in my hands, I can do the sequence of moves easily without thinking much about it. But trying to rember those motions with empty hands is much harder.</p>
<p>Does having cords in my hands triggers the muscle memory somehow?</p></div>		</li>
