			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, note that the major vaccine studies measured efficacy by testing symptomatic individuals (in both control and vaccinated arm) for covid. They were not regularly screening all participants for covid in the absence of symptoms.  That means they were not designed to determine efficacy of preventing asymptomatic infection. Pro sports in the US, where screening continued originally even for vaccinated individuals, showed some breakthrough asymptomatic cases - sometimes with a cluster of unvaccinated players. I don't think the contribution of spread by vaccinated individuals has been determined directly. Transmissibility is correlated with viral load, which is certainly lower in vaccinated individuals. I continue to wear my mask in crowded indoor areas to ensure I do not carry the virus to immunocompromised or vaccine intelligible individuals. I recognize that CDC doesn't recommend that and it's solely my personal choice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding of those asymptomatic results, due to being PCR tests, is the equivalent of saying a person who just got spritzed in the face by a plant mister while wearing full rain gear is wet. Sure, technically correct, but they'll dry out really quick and don't need to do anything about it.</p>
<p>They would be just fine to give anyone else a hug without getting that other person wet maybe a few drops, but nothing that would last or cause impact, and certainly nothing that would transfer to someone else if that person gave someone else a hug.</p>
<p>Am I oversimplifying?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very right! It’s even less likely for people more recently vaccinated, as residual anti-Spike IgG (the antibody that binds the virus) is highest about in serum levels until about 6 months post-vaccination, where it starts to fade. This means people will have antibody that can freely bind to any virus variants (though not as well, we’re learning) and prevent infection or replication and spread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The question is then how many generations the virus can replicate before it is cleaned up, right?</p></div>		</li>
