			<div class="markdown"><p>so weird. This happens sometimes when I'm taking laundry out of the dryer that have been there for an hour or so and they get cold, and I have to figure out whether they are actually still wet, or just cold... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first couple of times I sat on car seats with built-in cooling my butt refused to believe it wasn’t wet.
My brain knew better but my butt wouldn’t listen.
I guess it had fifty years experience that a cold seat (in hot, dry conditions) had to be wet. No other way for it to be cold. </p></div>		</li>
