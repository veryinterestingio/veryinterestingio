			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah this is an easy one. </p>
<p>When a fluid evaporates (turns to gas) it absorbs energy (typically heat) to do so. Acetone evaporates very rapidly at room temperature (assuming it hasn't saturated the air with vapor) and takes a lot of heat while it does so. Water also will evaporate at room temperature in most humidities, but will do so much more slowly, taking heat less quickly. </p>
<p>As mentioned in the OP, you perceive heat transfer, rather than true heat. Since you transfer more heat to acetone than water in the same amount of time, acetone feels cold. </p>
<p>Rubbing alcohol will have the same effect, though to a slightly lesser degree than acetone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And why is this? It's the configuration of the molecules. H2O is famously viscous and magnetic because all the triangle shaped molecules are tiny magnets that want to stack up together. Gasoline and acetone are closer to symmetric in 3 dimensions, therefore not as strong magnetic poles, and therefore easier to separate from each other (evaporation).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Acetone evaporates at a lower temperature, which carries heat away.  It's the same reason why you can be comfortable in a pool, but freezing when you climb out, and the reason why we sweat in the first place.</p>
<p>The acetone can be the same temperature as water, but it is absorbing heat to transition from liquid to gas at a faster rate when it's on our skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is almost right.  You can still be losing heat from your finger, but it will feel warmer than ambient as long as it's losing heat less quickly than it does in free air.  For example, when you put on gloves, your hands feel warm not because there's something external adding heat to them, but because they're losing heat less quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For gloves and clothes in general, the item traps the heat you naturally release and keeps that energy close to you, reducing the temperature difference between your body and the outside world.  This is why it can feel cold to put on a sweater at first, your torso and arms have lots of contact with a cold surface that you warm up in a minute or 2.  It also explains why putting gloves on when your hands are already cold &amp; have little blood flow (and heat loss) doesn't really help much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly the same functions that detect temperature are used to detect &quot;wetness&quot;. Your body just assumes that becouse it's whole hand just got cold quickly that it must be wet.</p>
<p>That's why you still feel like your touching water when wearing thin latex gloves.</p></div>		</li>
