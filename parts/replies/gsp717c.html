			<div class="markdown"><p>Would they just form as expected for other stars in the galaxy, as in within nebulae? Or is it more a case of gravitational interactions throwing them off their standard orbit? And for ‘large number’ I was meaning more like hundreds of thousands to millions of stars, a significant fraction of stars in our galaxy as a whole.</p>
<p>I’m just looking at it like planets orbiting a star, maybe I should be looking at it like asteroids instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your problem is that you've defined away the entire population of galaxies. &quot;Conventional spiral&quot; <em>means</em> there aren't any weird out-of-plane features. If you just want to consider galaxies broadly, there are very many examples: <a href="https://talk.galaxyzoo.org/boards/BGZ0000004/discussions/DGZ1006810/" target="_blank"><a href="https://talk.galaxyzoo.org/boards/BGZ0000004/discussions/DGZ1006810/" target="_blank">https://talk.galaxyzoo.org/boards/BGZ0000004/discussions/DGZ1006810/</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just referring to spiral galaxies because A), we live in one and have a prime view of the galactic bulge, and B), galactic bulges are most commonly associated with spiral galaxies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even in the outer plane, couldn't a perpendicular collision w/ another galaxy cause stars to be thrown out of their current orbits and cause them to orbit perp to the original disk?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my uni astrophysics classes, the disk that gives spiral galaxies their shape is made of gas/nebulae which forms stars, as well as stars themselves. That's why disks are often blue (blue stars are short-lived, so more blue stars means a younger population). Over time, longer lived (redder and dimmer) stars will definitely be flung out of the galactic plane gravitationally. Often this also involves throwing them into the centre of the galaxy, explaining the origin of the galactic bulge. By which time any bluer stars have gone supernova.</p>
<p>So to answer your first two questions, both are correct. Polar orbit stars are formed in nebulae in the disk, and then are flung out by gravitational interactions. This happens on such large time scales that any blue, bright stars will die before they get very far, which is why galactic bulges are red and also why galactic halos are so faint. Incidentally, some galaxies do not have a steady supply of infalling gas to make new stars, meaning all their stars were made in a big initial burst and are now their orbits are randomly oriented and all the leftover stars are red, which explains elliptical galaxies (which can be just as big as spirals)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know if your first question about how these halo stars form was answered if I’m interpreting right. Generally halo stars that can have random orbits are old and were created early in the galaxy’s life, as there isn’t active formation going on in the halo. A way way smaller portion of these stars were formed elsewhere later on and pushed into an irregular halo orbit by some disturbance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do they remain that way though, or is it mainly a temporary phenomenon that disappears over time? My (non-astrophysicist) thinking is that when a galaxy is formed its distribution of mass is more or less random. But virtually all random distributions will be ”unbalanced” in the sense that there’s more mass in certain planes. Wouldn’t gravity gradually pull orbits significantly differing from that plane into an orbit parallell to the orbit of the majority of the galaxy’s mass?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, gravity on its own can't do that. Galaxies form disks because they form from gas clouds that experience friction, which allows orbits to collapse into a single plane, the orientation of which is essentially random and given by slight irregularities in the gas distribution. But once stars form their motion is effectively frictionless and this no longer happens.</p>
<p>An observational confirmation of this is that halo stars are universally old, so their orbits must be stable. We also believe that they didn't form in situ, but instead were originally part of dwarf galaxies that were destroyed in the process of merging with the Milky Way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would the bulge contain <em>more</em> stars out of plane, instead of fewer?  Why doesn't the increased density of stars make collisions more likely and thus result in a <em>stronger</em> tendency for stars to exist in the same plane?</p></div>		</li>
