			<div class="markdown"><p>I was deferred from donating due to a single concussion. I was a potential match in 2016, but when I started the questionnaire I was flagged for stating I had a concussion in 2014. Then they said I that was not eligible to donate. </p>
<p>ETA: I lost consciousness for a few seconds, needed staples (but didn't fracture anything) and had symptoms for like week after the injury. So the severity of it probably played a role in my deferral. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I'm remembering correctly, on the BeTheMatch website says that if you had a concussion but did NOT lose consciousness, you're still eligible. </p>
<p>Edit: I'm not sure if I'm remembering correctly or if this is true, and if it is, why its true. </p></div>		</li>
