			<div class="markdown"><p>Dont forget that Covid-19 cases will be tracked and quarantined, cases of cold and many flu cases won't be. So I'd assume that the rates of cold and flu go down as well, but they are not the targeted diseases and will thus survive. I currently do have a mild cold, live in Germany and noone would even remotely consider me to be in need of testing for Covid-19. No fever, no aches, just very mild running nose. It's easy for me to spread this as noone cares. </p>
<p>Fun fact, considering the numbers here, i still think that this flu season numbers plus Covid-19 will total about what we can expect from a normal flu season (within the margin of error).
However, this is with the massive lockdown we went through that also cut off a sizable chunk of the expectedly bad flu season.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that’s also kind of the problem with our culture here in Austria. The common cold can spread rather easily, as some people go to work, even though they are sick. Often required by their employers, but also because of the mentality to be strong despite sickness.</p>
<p>At least in my company mentality might change permanently due to positive feedback from home office. General order for now is to work from home with sickness symptoms (I.e. if it’s just a running nose).</p>
<p>Just as additional info: I didn’t really recognize this in previous years, but I had a longer stay in Shanghai and Taipeh. The mentality over there is that they put on masks, as soon as they feel sick. Too late for covid though ;)
But I was only there for a short time, maybe someone with more experience can go into the detail on the differences in mentality ...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Same thing happens here in Spain. I hope after this people will start taking the flu more seriously, bu to be honest I expect the exact oppossite. In five years people will be going to work while having the flu and will justify it by saying that it's not as severe as the coronavirus.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Four years ago i had a throat infection, but as i work in my own corner in a factory and don't come face-to-face with people, and don't share tools, i just carried on working. The difference between being sick at work and being sick at home is <em>how much i get paid</em>. I went to the doctor on the Friday because my illness hit a peak.</p>
<p>Tonsillitis. :S</p>
<p>This is why i don't trust my colleagues at work right now - we've <em>still</em> got guys sharing cars, going to each others' houses, hanging out with folk from another factory down the road at lunch. It's a debacle. </p>
<p>But people gonna peop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A cold is not a valid reason in Belgium for sick leave. We are required to work even if we are sick. Most doctors will only allow sick leave if you have a fever (this is pre-corona times), I do hope that because of Corona this can change in the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Since there are so many asymptomatic/&quot;silent&quot; carriers, one cannot state unequivocally that one's runny nose is not due to COVID-19. Even more alarming, one cannot reasonably assume they can't transmit the virus because they feel healthy or display no symptoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Australia and New Zealand acted fast enough and locked down hard enough that New Zealand and some parts of Australia have zero community transmission of Covid-19. Everyone with the disease is in arrival quarantine and <strong>everyone</strong> arriving is quarantined. </p>
<p>In these areas, your cold is just a cold. It's the beginning of winter and people have colds, but Covid-19 is, as far as we can tell, gone.</p>
<p>Whether this is good or bad, it's hard to tell, if there's no vaccine, there'll be real problems when the borders item back up, but for the moment that's the situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm in Germany too and last week developed mild symptoms: sore thorat, body ache. No cough, no fever. Corona was very unlikely since I'm still being cautios bordering on paranoid. Called the 116117 hotline and two hours later had a doctor visit me for a test. I don't know if it's the same county wide but I was told we do have the resources to test anyone with even mild cold symptoms. I was told to stay at home until I got a phone call two days later (negative).</p>
<p>Since a corona infection can even be totally asypmtomatic and we do have the means to test a lot of people I'd definitely consider calling the hotline and ask their opinion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But what if we assume that every single human being on the planet did not leave their house for 3 months (I know it's not feasible), would we have eliminated all flus/influenzas? That should give time for all surfaces and more than average to recover people to eliminate it, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>probably not - people have fallen ill months into space missions, it is not a common mode of transmission, but long term viability on even inanimate objects is a thing, then it just starts all over again.</p>
<p>plus the fact that you would have to individually isolate everyone to also account for people that do not end up with immunity after having it passing it amongst themselves and individually isolate all the animals as well makes this a pretty unlikely plan as the whole thing falls apart as soon as someone needs emergency services.</p></div>		</li>

<p>End of last year I had a chest infection and was basically out of it for a full month and ill for at least a couple of weeks either side of that. Not sure how long I was contagious, but I'd guess longer than 2 weeks.</p></div>		</li>
