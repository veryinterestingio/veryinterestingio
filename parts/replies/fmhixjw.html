I guess when the body really really needs certain nutrients it will do what it can to tell you it wants that, even affecting your taste</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gotta remember that some substances are addictive if consumed in unnatural amounts. We eat lots of junk food. Salt, sugar, all that, kinda contaminates out cravings, so it's not like we can trust them 100% of the time.   </p>
<p>I imagine if we only ate fresh fruits, veggies, and meat, without excess sugar or salt, we could trust our bodies much more.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But I will add that another oddity is that some pregnant women will start to [<a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2018-05-18/call-the-midwife-what-is-pica-and-why-do-some-pregnant-women-crave-coal/" target="_blank">crave coal</a>] and other non-food items. It's a condition called 'pica,' which isn't unique to pregnancy, but happens in a whopping one-third of pregnancy craving experiences.</p>
<p>It's thought to be linked to certain deficiencies - iron is one of the most common. Given that pregnancy is basically the process of 3D-printing an entire human being, it's pretty easy for the wild hormones and bodily stress to induce such deficiencies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to point out that pica is usually caused by a mineral deficiency and it manifests as you craving non-nutritive objects.  There is no link that this condition makes you crave food or items that will give you iron, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Growing up in East Africa it’s seen as a normal thing for pregnant women to crave soil dug from anthill mounds due to its rich mineral content. I honestly didn’t know it happened outside of the dark continent but it makes complete sense. <a href="https://www.aboutuganda.com/uganda/health/eating-soil-pregnant" target="_blank">Soil Craving</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My ex gf suffered from anemia, but we found that out only accidentally, when we went to donate blood and they did blood tests there. They were shocked to find she had like 68 (sorry dunno the units) of hemoglobin when normal is like 120-130 or something (might be wrong there). And she was feeling fine, little pale as always, but nothing serious. The guys there were shocked wondering how she’s not in critical condition...
What was interesting that for more than a year she was obsessed with eating ice cubes, she had several ice cube trays and would rotate them in the freezer, and eat like 4-6 of those on some days. She said she loved it cause it was crunchy.
After the treatment for her anemia finished, she stopped craving for ice, the thing stopped completely.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Maybe,maybe not. They've demonstrated in other studies that  things like human pheromone affect how attractive another person is too us even though they have no discernible odor. It's possible some in the smell or texture clued him in that the eyes would be a good source of nutrition even without previously eating them.</p></div>		</li>
