<p>We have lots of scientific evidence of what the lack of vitamins does.  However, most people aren't vitamin deficient, so that's not going to sell anything.  So, sellers have adopted the &quot;if a little is good a lot is better&quot; philosophy.  For this, there isn't enough evidence to convince regulators.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also too much of some nutrients can block absorption of others. That's why high levels of biotin breaks some out - it blocks pantothenic acid (another B vitamin). For anyone curious, here are the tables for enough intake and too much intake of vitamins and elements (minerals): <a href="http://nationalacademies.org/hmd/Activities/Nutrition/SummaryDRIs/DRI-Tables.aspx" target="_blank">http://nationalacademies.org/hmd/Activities/Nutrition/SummaryDRIs/DRI-Tables.aspx</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>I've heard that over 40% of people are vitamin D deficient, at least in America. Is that not true?</p>
<p>Here's what I'm talking about:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this the answer? I had a nutrition/nursing major in university tell me that they can't prove that pill-vitamins are processed by the body at all.  Something to do with not being able to measure vitamin usage by the body so can't see if they are actually beneficial.  She did say that they believe it does, they just can't prove it'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>vitamins are often not absorbed fully, but to say they aren't absorbed &quot;at all&quot; is taking it too far. mostly what happens is you're getting rid of (peeing out) the excess, which, if you aren't deficient in anything, is a lot.</p>
<p>you actually have to be careful in taking too much of the fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) because you can't pee out the excess (since they aren't water soluble) so they can build up to toxic amounts in your body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can't say they stop your teeth from falling out, either - FDA regulations state that they can't claim to prevent, cure, or treat any type of disease, and &quot;teeth falling out&quot; counts as a disease</p>
<p>It's why every supplement says &quot;supports healthy [x]&quot; or &quot;may help with [y]&quot;. Same goes for foods, it's why Cheerios say &quot;may help lower cholesterol with a healthy diet&quot; (which is bullshit, Cheerios have like a single gram of fiber...the otherwise healthy diet would be doing all the heavy lifting in that case).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought the FDA doesn't regulate supplements? </p>
<p>Because its a supplement which is technically different from food (something you can consume to give you calories and help you live), Drugs (meant for dealing with diseases, pains, etc. ). Supplements are not something you have live off of like food, are not meant to cure any diseases. </p>
<p>Correct me if im wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, they're regulated by the FDA, that's a myth. For example, if you try to market a novel supplement, you need to prove to the FDA it has a history of human use or provide a study showing it's safe (edit: or prove it was on the market prior to the mid-90's, though then it wouldn't be novel). If you make straight up definitive health claims (&quot;keeps teeth from falling out! vs. &quot;May help prevent tooth loss&quot;), though, the FDA considers your product a drug</p>
<p>You can just Google &quot;FDA supplements&quot; and read the FDA website if you want to know more.</p>
<p>Edit: also, keep in mind the regulations aren't that great. I could sell you &quot;magical plant extract&quot; that's actually just a sugar pill and probably never get in trouble</p></div>		</li>
