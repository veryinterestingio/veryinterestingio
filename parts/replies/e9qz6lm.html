			<div class="markdown"><p>It's basically like falling asleep.  You're given medication prior to being brought in to the OR that helps keep you calm, ten eventually you're in the OR and suddenly you're not anymore.</p>
<p>It wasn't much more different than being exhausted and falling asleep on a couch in the middle of a gathering, and then being woken up as people go home.  Yah the situation is different from when you fell asleep, and you don't have a first hand understanding of what went on in the meantime, but it's not a big deal.</p>
<p>Obviously the pain from surgery is potentially a different issue, and some people can get sick from the meds, but for the most part people are fine </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was afraid of this too. I had my kidney stones removed recently through ureteroscopy and my main fear was anaesthesia.<br />
As it turned out it was just like falling asleep but much faster. You probably think that while you're falling asleep you're trapped inside your head coping with the feeling of your body being forcefully put to sleep.<br />
But it's not like that, it's a very natural feeling. In that moment you just don't care, especially if they give you prior light sedation (they gave some to me because I was working my way towards an anxiety attack).
Waking up is far more annoying because you wanna go do stuff but they wont let you. Your body coming back up to speed is interesting.  </p>
<p>Don't fear it. </p></div>		</li>
