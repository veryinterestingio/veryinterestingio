			<div class="markdown"><p>The phrase is everywhere in medicine and science as well. Currently working with a bio-toxin at my job. Was worried at first but then realized that <em>even if</em> I spill it on myself, washing my hands for a few seconds will be more than sufficient. I don't even need to get the 15 minutes that every company recommends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They each don’t pee that much, they’re not all peeing at the same time, the ocean has currents which moves the water and thus the pee, and the fish themselves are probably moving as well which brings in fresh water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1000 meters in a kilometer. 1000³ cubic meters in a cubic kilometer. That's 1,000,000,000. 0.0003 of a billion is indeed 300,000.</p></div>		</li>
