			<div class="markdown"><p>Somewhat. One hypothesis is that the abundance of food within their environment allows them to stay grouped up during the day while foraging, in contrast to the fission-fusion lifestyle of chimpanzees. By staying grouped, females are able to socialize more and form deep bonds. So if any individual male tries to challenge a female, he's not just challenging her, but her and all of her friends. I can't speak specifically about how females tend to stratify among themselves, I believe age is a big factor, but the main reason the society is matriarchal is because there's power in numbers.</p></div>		</li>
