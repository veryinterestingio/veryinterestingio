			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't really get bothered by crazy theories, but it is upsetting when patients and their families get swindled into spending their money on therapies that aren't truly effective. People ask me all the time if a certain food or exercise can make their child taller. The bottom line is that in a well nourished child, there is no magical food that is going to make them tall. If I knew of one, I would be a billionaire and everyone would be using it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>right, like good nutrition won't make them taller but it will no long be an obstacle for their genetics to max out their height. Is that kinda right? Like bad nutrition might stunt or affect growth but having good nutrition kind of gets out of the way...</p>
<p>also thanks for replying!</p></div>		</li>
