			<div class="markdown"><p>This is due to the physical/chemical properties of the battery, not programmed. If you look up charge and discharge curves of pretty much an composition of battery, you'll see the steep drops towards them being &quot;empty&quot; and then flattening over time as they are getting &quot;full&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is programmed in the sense that a charger would have no problem forcing the same current through the battery when it's almost fully charged, it would simply heat it a lot, as the person you replied to is saying. Chargers are definitely programmed to switch to a different charging mode at 80% soc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're thinking about older style rechargable batteries.  At a given charge voltage their draw would reduce as they got close to full.  A lithium ion battery, like most (if not all) phones have these days, would continue to charge at pretty close to the same rate when close to full if the voltage wasn't decreased.  This would cause heat which would degrade the battery, so chargers sense when the battery is getting close to full and decrease the voltage to decrease the charge current. </p>
<p>This is why it was ok to leave a NiMH or NiCad battery charging overnight, even once it was full, when connected to a low current simple power supply, but you can't do that with a Lithium Ion battery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The capacity does not change but the energy does.<br />
During discharging, the voltage of the cell drops until it reaches a cut off level. Let's assume the power request stays the same at all times. Because of the reducing cell voltage and Ohm's law (I = P / U)  it means that the current will increase as the cell gets more empty. This causes the capacity to decrease faster when the cell gets empty and the effect can be noticed in the soc (state of charge) indication, usually shown as a percentage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On paper, yes. The stress on the battery is higher, and so you are doing long term damage to the battery and lowering its lifespan. </p>
<p><strong>In practice</strong> it is very <em>very</em> well mitigated and planned for by the manufacturer. The fact that they slow down the charging helps to minimize the damage and wear, and so while the effect is real, it is very very slight. They even have programming in place to keep the battery from constantly forcing itself to 100% charge overnight, if you leave it on the charger. once it hits 100%, it stops charging and lets itself drain a bit, and then will gently trickle back up to 100%. (usually without showing that process on the actual displayed percentage that you see). </p>
<p>If you're planning to keep your phone 3+ years, and don't want to ever have to have the battery replaced, it's best to keep your phone between 20% and 80% at most times, as going on either side of those will do some damage that accumulates over time. </p>
<p>But most normal users need not be concerned. Especially if they're getting a new phone ever year, or every two years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much for your answer! I've had problems with batteries in the past for over exerting them at lower percentages and then over compensated. It's good to know it's better mitigated against at higher percentages but I'll try to keep them at that sweet spot between 20-80%. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>
