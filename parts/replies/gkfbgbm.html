			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern engines run fine when overcooled (if we're not talking about -20Â°C ambient), if the right oil is used. It's actually emission guidelines that require quick warm up of the engine/catalytic converter, which is also the reason for secondary air injection systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not true. If an engine runs colder than it should it will get carbon buildup and the oil will start getting condensation in it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The coolant always goes through the heater core. When the coolant reaches operating temp the thermostat opens it goes through the radiator. The heater would never drain the battery. There is a door for the air or an actuator to control the flow of the coolant as well as a fan. These things consume a miniscule amount of electricity.</p></div>		</li>
