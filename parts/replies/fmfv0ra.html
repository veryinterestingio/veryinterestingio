			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone posted below. MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) is contraindicated because its a live vaccine. Same with Hep A. Theoretically the mother has been immunized so its not a problem. </p>
<p>Tetanus is a toxoid vaccine which means you vaccinate against fragments of the Tetanospasmin protein that is a paralytic, not the bacteria (C. Tetani) that produces it. These can be dangerous to employ in pregnant women because they generate incredibly potent immune responses. In fact, we often conjugate (attach) various toxoids to cell fragments of other bacteria to generate a bigger immune response. dTAP is one (diptheria toxic and acellular pertussis) and H. Flu Type B is another that is also conjugated to diptheria toxoid. Now, if a mother steps on a dirt covered rusty nail and didnt get a tetanus booster, itd be up to her doctors as to whether or not to vaccinate. But then if comes down to weighing benefit vs risks. Do you vaccinate and maybe cause a hypersensitivity reaction or do you hope that she isnt paralyzed? </p>
<p>Its also important to note that we dont have to necessarily vaccinate people to treat for things. We can infuse them with pooled immunoglobins. Basically, when you donate blood, they can spin out antibodies that are useful as antidotes. So in our tetanus case, they could infuse the mother with a ton of preformed anti-tetanospasmin antibodies. </p>
<p>We do this to try to treat rabies in a combo approach called &quot;Passive-Active.&quot; It's why its so important to go to the doctors if you wake up with a bat in your room (even if you don't think they bought you). In this case, we give you a &quot;killed&quot; viral vaccine (viruses aren't alive but we make the virions inert) in combination with pooled anti-rabies immunoglobins. It is the only thing that can even remotely help. But it only works if done early...SO IF YOU CANT CATCH THE BAT AND BRING IT IN FOR TESTING JUST GO TO THE DOCTORS PLEASE.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>dTAP if for children younger than 7. It is recommended to all pregnant women to get a TdaP booster if they haven’t had the vaccine within the last 5 years. This has been the protocol for the past 10 years I’ve worked in OB, with all OBGYN’s at different hospitals. That and flu. If a mom’s titer shows she’s non-immune to MMR, or Varicella-its recommenced she gets the vaccine in postpartum, for reasons well explained previously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Colostrum (the first milk) is high in IgG (antibodies). In roughly the first 24 hours of life for most mammals the gut is open to absorb antibodies, and gastric pH is neonates is more alkaline. Humans are a bit weird in their placentation compared to many domestic species (they’re hemochorial: the baby’s epithelium bathes in a lake of the mother’s blood), so they get more transfer of antibodies in utero.</p>
<p>In most domestic species, there are more layers between the fetus and maternal circulation, so they rely on that initial colostrum intake. If they don’t get it before the gut closes they’re essentially immunocompromised, and may require transfusion with immunized plasma.</p></div>		</li>
