			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it is thought to be caused by the mother 'preferring' the youngest. Even in humans the youngest child is generally percieved as most vulnerable and get lots of attention as the 'favorite', and gets the most support. So if another sister wanted to take the younger sister's position, they need to go through mama. In the case of macaques, this sometimes leads to the youngest being the dominant.</p></div>		</li>
