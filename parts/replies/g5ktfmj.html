			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the question. For me, your question reminds me to say that traveler’s thrombosis can occur during an airplane flight, during a bus journey, or a train journey, or a car journey – it’s all about not sitting for prolonged periods in the same position. I’ve seen people who have traveled through the day, on the continent, and not gotten out of the car and haven’t moved all day, and they have ended up with clots. It’s just the same as flight-related thrombosis—it comes down to immobility.</p></div>		</li>
