			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually think I'm a better driver in that state. My subconscious is handling all the routine stuff so the other part of my brain is scanning for novel input. If I'm taking in all the information like it's new for the first time it's overload. Like driving in a new city in bad traffic looking for a certain road to turn on. Very stressful since I have to hold all that new data at the forefront at the same time and constantly prioritize what's most important in the moment.</p></div>		</li>

The researchers who wrote the book got a novel prize in economics for how they were able to link psychology with the stock market</p></div>		</li>
