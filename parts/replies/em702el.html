			<div class="markdown"><p>A bit of a tangent, but a while back I came across <a href="http://rickbradford.co.uk/Diprotons.pdf" target="_blank">this neat article about the conditions in hypothetical universes where physical constants were tweaked to allow stable diprotons</a>. Turns out there may actually be ways that stable long-lived stars could exist in such a universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, there's a straightforward (just a few lines long) proof that electric charge is quantized if you just assume that one magnetic monopole exists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your post reminded me about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0604027" target="_blank">this</a> article (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/0604027.pdf" target="_blank">direct pdf link</a>) about how it is possible to construct a universe without the weak nuclear force that still has big bang nucleosyntheis, matter domination, structure formation, long lived stars, and finally supernovas that scatter the newly produced heavy materials into the interstellar medium. I.e. it is a universe that could contain life, but without the weak force. It is a really fascinating read. Instead of the pp-chain you (iirc) change the abundance of strange quarks in the early universe to increase the likelihood of forming deuterium, and then you start stellar fusion with that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Reading this paper feels like watching a rick and morty episode. Fascinating</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>heh pp chain. Are there other ways of producing deuterium? Because I've heard of deuterium reactors but I didn't think we could react regular hydrogen yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many ways that deuterium can be produced, but the effect of stellar burning is to destroy deuterium left over from the Big Bang. The equilibrium abundance of deuterium in a stellar environment is smaller than whatâ€™s left over from Big Bang nucleosynthesis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whenever somebody mentions Helium-2 I'm always reminded of this quote from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_helium#Helium-2_\(diproton\)" target="_blank">Wikipedia Isotopes of helium page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to theoretical calculations, it (Helium-2) would have been much more stable (although still undergoing beta-decay to deuterium) if the strong force had been 2% greater.[6] (Bradford, R. A. W. (27 August 2009). &quot;The effect of hypothetical diproton stability on the universe&quot;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is just awesome to think about.</p></div>		</li>
