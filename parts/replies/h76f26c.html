			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, that's why spider legs recoil on death.</p>
<p>Doesn't really answer OP's question though as this is not common knowledge.</p>
<p>I tried to raise my kids with the idea that spiders are our friends (I mean they un-ironically are) so I could put them to use, but it didn't work, the fear is innate from what I can tell.</p>
<p>I keep (allow) some named daddy long legs, those guys are bullies to other spiders</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a kid, I found the reaction of some of my relatives to spiders weird, but it gave me a feeling of power to be able to swoop in with some paper and gently take it outside. (They were terrified but tender hearted.)   For some reason, I never picked up on being afraid of spiders. </p>
<p>I remember walking into a coworker's office.  He was pointing at a spider in a neat orb web and I thought he wanted to show it off.  I said, &quot;That's really neat&quot; before I realized he was in a state of terror, and carried it off.</p></div>		</li>
