			<div class="markdown"><p>A big distinction between apoptosis and necrosis is pretty much whether it's a graceful death or not. Apoptosis is like shutting down a computer, where the computer takes a bit of time to clean everything up after the command is given. In contrast, necrosis is like yanking out the power cord. It leaves a mess behind. Necrosis can happen in infections where the fact that the cell just explodes and leaves all the mess behind can mean bad news. An example of this is tuberculosis.</p>
<p>There actually are molecular pathways that induce necrosis similar to apoptosis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also a bunch of other forms of cell death that have been studied over the last few years including necroptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis! They have different biochemical features, but broadly share the fate of cells halting their metabolic processes and being cleared. There are more types of cell death being worked on, but these are the most accepted ones.</p>
<p>I'm a cell death researcher. I work on apoptosis and that's my area of expertise, so I'm only passingly familiar with the other forms, but I've been to some cell death conferences and it's really interesting to hear about all the other death pathways people are studying!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a specific term for a cell death researcher, like how a bird researcher is an ornithologist? Honestly cell death seems like a genuinely fascinating area of research (no sarcasm).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really--it's considered a subset of cell biology, generally, although other types of people who work on it might be biochemists, structural biologists, or cancer researchers.</p>
<p>It comes up a lot in cancer. One of the hallmarks of cancer is loss of the ability to receive proapoptotic signaling or carry out apoptosis.</p>
<p>Ama about apoptosis if you want! I can't promise how responsive I'll be tonight, but if you or anyone wants to know more about it, ask away.</p></div>		</li>
