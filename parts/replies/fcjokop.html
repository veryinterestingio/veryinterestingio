			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference is that there is no way the patients can distinguish the sugar pill from the real one. With therapists, if they know there is a chance they are fake, they might be able to figure out whether or not they are.</p>
<p>Furthermore... who would agree to participate in such a trial in the first place? With pharmaceutical trials, the incentive is that you might get a medication that is otherwise unavailable on the market, since the point if the trial is to test whether it can go on the market. With psychotherapy... you are not offering them any novel otherwise unavailable treatment. Unless of course you offer them money or free treatment they might otherwise not be able to afford... but if money is the incentive, you are entering an ethically questionable territory, because it can be seen as taking advantage of the poor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no way an ethics board would approve a study where a lay person was impersonating a licensed therapist. While one may believe a therapist is no better than  your average Joe, the damage done by sick relationships shows serious damage can be done to a person, especially if they are in a vulnerable psychological state. Even if you were to question whether a therapist is less damaging than a therapist (something quite probably true some small percentage of the time), the psychological community <em>doesn't</em> believe this, and they are the ones approving such a study.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about the other way around - Get therapist to impersonate laymen.</p>
<p>I.E tell all the patients that they are getting to talk to laymen for a study, but half of the therapist are actually real trained physiologists then we can see if there's a difference in results. </p>
<p>There's no ethical problem here, and if the sessions are free/very cheap people will participate, though I'm guessing that the results are going to be lower then with normal as the title of trained physiologists probably has value by itself</p></div>		</li>
