			<div class="markdown"><p>I work with glass and ceramics a lot. A critical element is operating in a brittle mode. We're trying to crack the material evenly, to a specific depth. Each grinding operation should remove material while also imparting shallower cracks each time. Until eventually you use a polishing operation that doesn't create sub-surface damage. But with metals it's really difficult to grind in this matter without specific tools, speeds, and feeds. Which you mentioned above.</p></div>		</li>

<p>important qualifier there.</p>
<p>when you get to a point where a pass-over doesn't make shallower cracks, then you can't make the material any smoother because each pass-over will just look like the previous one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the end you want to have zero cracks. Material with no cracks has better strength and lower surface roughness. For optics the sub-surface damage makes lenses scatter light, or in laser optics can cause heat stress raisers, causing literally exploding lenses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In semiconductor research, that step is done with chemical-mechanical polishing. For several examination methods you strife to reach a atomic planar surface. The colloid we use for that is prepared from three liquids. Two of them form the particles used as &quot;abrasive&quot; through crystallization (the ratio determines the particle size) and the third one is en etch for the particular semiconductor material.</p>
<p>The etch pretty much loosens/destroys the bonds of atoms sticking out of the surface you want to reach, but takes much longer to eat into a pristine crystal layer. The &quot;abrasive&quot; (which is softer than the semiconductor) removes those atoms and does not damage the planar surface. At least if you don't polish too long ;). The trick is to find the right moment to stop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to u/Onsotumenh comment below. The cracks from grinding are caused from tiny pressure points pushing into the surface (normal force). With polishing we try to use shear force (parallel to the surface). This prevents crack growth. Also, people control the PH balance of their polishing compounds and chemical make-up so they can chemically soften the surface to aid polishing. Unfortunately many of the materials I work with are made to be chemically inert. My polishing machine would corrode terribly if I tried a chemical-mechanical process. So we just stick to fine diamonds suspended in a fluid or paste.</p>

<p>Why don't circuits normally vaporise while working? Much higher voltages? or is it current?</p>
<p>And why doesn't it dissipate the concentrated heat by conduction?</p></div>		</li>
