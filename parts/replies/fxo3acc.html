			<div class="markdown"><p>But all of this can be a bit of a hassle for our poor bankers.  After all if one of them buys that contract and doesn't sell it again (at hopefully a higher price) by the end of October well he will be getting 40K pounds of pork delivered and he doesn't eat quite THAT much.  BUT people are making money trading pork futures and coffee futures and coal futures and so on so can't we do this more civilized like without a truck of pork showing up at the office?  </p>
<p>And note that yes these accidents do happen which is how one British bank ended up with 3 barges full of coal and one of the big American banks ended up with a rather decent stockpile of uranium...</p>
<p>SO what the bankers were really doing was betting on the price of pork.  They didn't want pork or produce pork so having those physical deliveries is a bit annoying.  So let's make a similar contract where we do the exact same trade BUT instead of exchanging actual pork at the expiration date, we only exchange money.  And how much we exchange?  Will be derived from the real pork futures!  As an example (WE are bankers now) I sell 40K of virtual pork to you for 50K.  When the end of October comes along the contract expires and we just look at the current price.  AHA Oktoberfest did become a hype and that 40K pounds of pork is now worth 60K USD.  So because you get to buy virtual pork from me for 50K USD that is worth 60KUSD right now, I simply owe you that 10K difference rather than having to get you 40K pound of pork get it to you and then  you need to find someone to sell all that meat to.  Naah we just sidestep that whole part with the actual pork and just exchange money.  But we were still trading pork derivatives!</p>
<p>AND because there is money to be made this business of trading virtual pork flourishes such that what we see all of a sudden in the markets is that the number of open contracts:
Real pork futures:  842 contracts for a total value of 42.1million.
Virtual pork futures: 6325 contracts for a total value of 316.25 million.
Total pork market in the USA at this point is worth: 358.35 million USD.  Amount of pork actually produced?  42.1 million USD.  </p>
<p>In reality by the way 21400 contracts for 40K pounds of virtual pork were traded yesterday for expiry in October alone.  So that is just over 1 billion dollar worth of virtual pork to be turned into virtual sausages that changed hands yesterday.  BUT the amount of open contracts for October alone is 71000 or 3.5 Billion USD worth of pork to be traded virtually at the end of October.  Fun little detail:  That is almost double the amount of Pork that is actually produced in the whole of the US in a month.</p>
<p>So what we see is that the pork market for October alone is worth 3.5 billion even though pork production is half that.  Still though the Pork Market for October is worth 3.5 billion.</p>
<p>Part three coming.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now how much money will actually change hands?  Maybe the price of pork fluctuated by 3% between today and October?  That means 100 million USD will actually change hands between the traders of virtual pork in a market worth 3.5 billion USD for an underlying that is produced at a rate of 2 billion USD worth per month.</p>
<p>When we apply these same ideas to Currencies and Credit of all kinds, things just explode.  Currency traders don't fuck around.  They make trades for MILLIONS at a time in currency deals.  Again quite often virtual currency deals.  Or they buy in the morning and sell in the morning and that foreign currency never actually changes hands.  So what happens here is that I BUY 100 million worth of Euros from you and pay in dollars.  No wait that's old school...  We set up a contract that I will buy 100 million worth of Euro from you in a month at today's prices.  Euro goes up by 0.5% by the end of the month and either I sell the contract before expiry or again commonly we just settle everything in cash without actually doing the real underlying transaction just like with the pork before.  So 0.5% profit for me because you have to hand me 500K USD because of the price fluctuation of the Euro.  However as long as that deal was open it contributed the full 100 million USD to the number in the title of your post.</p>
<p>So in essence that number is so huge because it counts every single possible trade that still exists as a contract somewhere to trade something credit or currency for a certain price on a given date in the future even if the trade is defined as virtual to begin with because it will be cash settled not through actual delivery, or because the traders involved have no intention whatsoever of actually doing the trade when the day comes at all, just cash in (hopefully) by closing their position when the expiry date comes along.</p>
<p>So yes there is currently 678 trillion bound up in future trades on credit and currency markets alone.  Derivatives are a HUGE market.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for such a clear explanation! So does that 678T include all leverage as well? Like when a bank/fund is leveraged 10:1 or more, their part of the 678T is 10x more than their actual margin?</p>
<p>Because I've heard total world wealth is only 360T, so the 678T must be because of leverage right?</p></div>		</li>

<p>But doesn't that defeat the purpose of the contract? If the farmer sold the meat to lock in the price/the bank bought the meat at the locked in price, why are they paying extra at the end?</p>
<p>Also, how can contracts be traded on the same 40k pounds of meat? If you're buying an asset, don't you get exclusive rights to that? E.g. if I bought a house, 8 other people couldn't also buy that same house.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This will be ELI a lot more...</p>
<p>Farmer Joe sells a future for 50K worth of pork.  Banker Geoff buys the same future.  Even without physical delivery this still works by the way.  Just hurts the brain even more so I'll do it with physical delivery...</p>
<p>At this point NO money has changed hands.  And well no pigs either they are still growing.</p>
<p>How it actually works in detail is that these futures get settled every day.  What that means is that the change in value is paid/received every day.</p>
<p>So after 1 month the price of pork goes up to 51K.  Now Geoff should be making a profit because he bet on prices rising and Joe should be losing money because he bet on prices going down...  That's what happens, Joe has to pay 1K now and Geoff gets 1K.  This process actually happens every day but you know we do it by month.</p>
<p>At this point Geoff decides that he will lock in his profit and he sells the 40K pork in October to someone and another banker, Eddy, buys it from him.  Geoff is now gone because he sold one contract and bought 1 contract net zero contracts remaining.</p>
<p>A month later the price has risen to 52K.  Since it went up again by 1K, Joe pays 1K and Eddy receives 1K.  Eddy thinks that's nice 1K in the pocket I am selling it now.  This time Hot Dog maker Baktru buys the contract.  At a current price of 52K.  </p>
<p>Now in the final month the price goes up to 53K.  So Joe has to pay 1K again and Baktru gets 1K.</p>
<p>Then the final settlement happens at the expiry and this is WHEN the actual trade happens at market price.  Market price is now 53K so Joe sells his pork to Baktru for 53K.  BUT where did all the money go?</p>
<p>Farmer Joe:  Paid 1K, 1K, 1K.  Then received 53K.  Net income 50K.  What he locked the price in at.
Geoff:  Received 1K.  Net income 1K.
Eddy: Net income 1K as well.
Baktru:  Received 1K a few days ago and bought pork today for 53K.  Net expense 52 K the amount he locked the price in at.</p>
<p>So in the net Baktru pays 52K, 1K went to Geoff, 1K went to Eddy and 50K went to farmer Joe.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if I bought a house</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The difference is you bought a specific house.  This house here at Swan Street 24 that they are building right now.  With these types of contracts you are buying 40K pounds of pork of certain quality and and a whole bunch of stipulations.  Not any specific pork.  Even if at the moment that we both entered the trade, Joe and Me, we did trade with each other we may not have to trade with each other on expiry.  These contracts are allocated randomly at expiry so my pork may come from farmer Fred instead and Joe's pork goes to the Bratwurst maker.  If somewhere along the way there were more open contracts than actual pork it doesn't matter.  It really doesn't.  As long as at the end of the story it all matches up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This disconnect is bizarre. Is it dangerous?</p>
<p>Also, I understand that this also happens in stocks with price/earnings ratio, but there my understanding is that investors believe that the earnings of that company will grow to match the price in the future. Is that also true of derivatives?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With &quot;virtual&quot; contracts (or as they are called, cash-settled) there's not really any risk to the market itself.  There is of course to the traders if they bet that Oktoberfest will happen, then they can lose a lot of money.</p>
<p>And yes you buy futures/options in something because you believe it is currently undervalued and will go up.  Sell futures or buy put options if you believe it will go down.</p>
<p>But also to hedge risk which is also quite a complex topic.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Generally it's considered to reduce risk in the market, and therefore is seen as beneficial (which is why it's allowed). However as the 2008 housing crisis shows, that's not always the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That component of the Volcker rule was not rolled back. Banks can now make investments in smaller investment funds and there are lighter margin requirements when banks trade derivatives, but they can still only trade derivatives to provide liquidity and for hedging purposes; trading desks cannot take a speculative position on any security.</p></div>		</li>
