			<div class="markdown"><p>HPA: Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal Axis</p>
<p>The HPA axis is just a series of 3 organs ranging from your brain to your adrenal glands. The first organ (Hypothalamus) is stimulated by signals originating from areas in the cortex responsible for awareness and emotional input. Once stimulated, a variety of related chemicals are released in sequential order and transported through a network of vessels which eventually make their way to the adrenal glands, which are stimulated and release hormones such as cortisol into the blood stream.</p>
<p>And theeen
cortisol is transported into cells through a membrane protein. The hormone binds to other proteins within the cell which eventually contribute to the unwinding of DNA and the production of inflammatory signaling proteins elicit an immune response for the distribution of white blood cells all around your body! </p>
<p>Isn't biology cool?</p>
<p>If you wanna know more you could surely find a quick article or anatomy lecture on youtube that describes these processes much better than I could!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1.) - Consistent Sleep</p>
<p>If one has irregular sleeping patterns, this could cause a hormonal imbalance. Virtually all hormones (cortisol included) are regulated by circadian rhythms. Go to bed at the same time every day, and most importantly, wake up at the same time every day. Let your body know when to produce the right chemicals at the right time of the day.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>2.) - Resolving External Stressors</p>
<p>I'm no therapist, but I suspect many who are hypersensitive to stress and experience it chronically, may have problem(s) in their life that haven't been addressed. When something bad happens to someone and it is never resolved, then their mind will treat its environment as if it is dangerous every day, and their cortisol levels will be heightened every hour. It's a defense mechanism. </p>
<p>The cortisol-based system is not meant to be activated chronically like this (because what results from it is only disease and suffering).</p>
<p>So, why would our minds always remind us of stressful and painful events that either occurred in the past or have the potential to occur in the future?</p>
<p>Answer: So that we may avoid stumbling into that same difficulty later in life. Problems exist to better equip us for the future.</p>
<p>Once you overcome a problem, you have figured out exactly how to deal with it along with similar problems that may arise later in life. What that means is, they no longer become actual problems. You become more powerful than you were before, and your mind no longer perceives those particular stressors as threatening. </p>
<p>If someone experiences a repeated problem that continually succeeds in evoking an emotional response, they should make it their priority to resolve it.</p></div>		</li>
