			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the OP is actually asking about 'background' conversations that aren't distinguishable audibly but still get clear subtitles.</p>
<p>In other words, in some movies, you can read some dialogue that is actually impossible to hear because it's mumbled, trailing off, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know what I find interesting? Audio descriptions for the blind. On Easter my brother and I sat and watched the og Ben-Hur and were enraptured at the over narration describing the scene and action. It was timed perfectly with the dialogue and would have made a competent audio book. Until I saw it that day, I had no idea people made such things. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really cool that they do that. Like I said I had no idea. When I was little (80's-way before audible) my grand dad used to record audio books for people. I think he did it with the optimist club or Shriners. He'd take requests at the nursing home, pick  up the books at the library and spend hours reading into the recorder in his study. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I watch everything with subtitles, not because I need to but because I like to. The vast majority of the time I see subtitles word for word. I have seen times where subtitles exist where audio doesn't but the rest of the subtitles for that movie/show were word for word.</p></div>		</li>
