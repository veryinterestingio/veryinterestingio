			<div class="markdown"><p>1% solar flux of Earth. So about 13 W/m2. Which in practical terms means solar power is utterly useless. Really anything past Mars and sunlight becomes a poor power source. </p>
<p>And 1% is more like sitting in a room with one lamp. Just being indoors cuts almost 99% of the sunlight possible. And it's also logarithmic, so simple multiples or percentages aren't as good an indicator of scale.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought that Saturn's magnetic field actually extended past Titan. Am I incorrect? And if I am correct, is it not sufficient protection? </p>
<p>Also you are forgetting the best part of Titan. Approximately moon gravity with think atmosphere.... We might be able to achieve lift with some kind of Icarus wing-like backpack!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Who knows if the field lines on Saturn will protect Titan or channel high energy particles into it tho? I don't think we know that yet... but yeah there is a chance it is &quot;safe&quot;.</p>
<p>There is a scene in <a href="https://vimeo.com/108650530" target="_blank">https://vimeo.com/108650530</a> where they show people doing the Icarus thing. On Titan. </p>
<p>Also a blimp in the clouds of Saturn.</p>
<p>Among many... Many other things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if push comes to shove, just put your cities underground. </p>
<p>I actually read an interesting article once that said Titan would make an excellent location for building extremely powerful computational networks, since the planet can essentially act like a giant heat-sink.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been very difficult to study in any great detail as we really only have two data points: one earth gravity, or zero gravity. The effects of everything in between is largely speculation. </p>
<p>Radiation is bad, we know that, but the extent of atrophy is debatable and speculative. </p>
<p>While the book itself is somewhat dated now, <em>Mining the Sky</em> discusses lunar settlement. Today, I largely imagine a lunar colony as something analogous to a work camp (like those found in oilfields or mine sites). The Moon is useful as it provides a working site that provides <em>some</em> gravity as well as easy/cheap radiation shielding in the form of thick-roofed bunkers under the regolith. It also offers good high-quality vacuum, readily available out the airlock. One could use it as a sort of drydock/shipyard/fabrication plant, where you have enough gravity that tools don't float away and workers don't have to train for null-g, but the gravity well itself is small and easy to launch out of. </p>
<p>Stretching the analogy further, I could see it being the kind of place workers do a year or so in; not permanent inhabitation, but a long, well-paid &quot;hitch&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently read a book called Beyond Earth: Our Path to a New Home in the Planets by Amanda Hendrix and Charles Wohlforth, itâ€™s much more recent (2016) and talks about titan directly, for anyone interested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the real question is - is it really <em>useful</em>? Is there anything we can mine at a lower cost on the moon and bring it back than on Earth, whose price would not crash instantly because the higher supply would easily exceed any demand? Like, even if moon's surface was littered with gold nuggets, it wouldn't necessarily be a good idea to go there and get them, because the gold price would fall drastically and having a vehicle that can transport a substantial amount of it back would be damn expensive. You'd need some material that humans need and use a lot, that has a huge price per kg and a pretty high density that is easily available on the moon. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The radiation probably isn't too big of a problem since it's pretty far from the sun and has Saturn's magnetic field to protect it, and I don't think I'd get too much muscle atrophy if I could strap on wings and fly whenever I wanted. Let's go! </p></div>		</li>
