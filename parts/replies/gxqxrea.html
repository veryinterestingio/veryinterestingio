			<div class="markdown"><p>Wikipedia the flynn effect. For a science article its not insanely well sourced and im on a phone so i can't properly check, but since its not a politicised view or religious contradiction its unlikely to be heavily skewed. Read into that what you like.</p>
<p>The flynn effect suggests that IQ seems to rise about 2 points a decade in the developed world. By knowing more stuff our brains get more efficient, technology and information transfer being this fast create this momentum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree on two points here. </p>
<p>First, IQ tests are measuring <em>something</em>, but it's probably not inherent &quot;intellect&quot; (if that's even definable) and I doubt that the Flynn effect has anything to do with an increase in brain efficiency. Looking at average IQs per country, people in Ethiopia have an average IQ of 61. By most metrics this is mentally disabled. It seems completely implausible that there is a significant biological difference leading to this, and clearly the average Ethiopian cannot be walking around with such a significant cognitive impairment. Much more likely is that IQ scores have a strong correlation with formal education. I.e., performing well on an IQ test is something that you can teach a person, and requires similar skills to what is expected in a school. </p>
<p>Secondly, maybe I am misunderstanding you here, but that just isn't how evolution works. What I'm understanding from your line </p>
<blockquote>

<p>this sounds like some kind of Lamarckian evolution thing. On that note, noticeable evolutionary changes are very unlikely to occur over the span that the Flynn effect has even been a phenomenon. The Flynn effect is incredibly recent. Humans are really not a different animal than they were 100 years ago.</p></div>		</li>
