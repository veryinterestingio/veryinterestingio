			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Boiling point&quot; as a technical term means the temperature where a substance's vapor pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p>In the kitchen, it's less straightforward because water at the bottom of the pot is hotter than water at the top of the pot.</p>
<p>Simmering is when bubbles form at the bottom, and the bulk of the water is around 180-190F (82-88C) at sea level -- so not boiling temperature. Rolling boil is when the bulk of the water is around the boiling point (100C at sea level).</p>
<p>It might help to understand that a liquid generally can't exceed its boiling point because it would vaporize first -- so the hottest you can get a pot of water is its boiling point, hence simmering being below the boiling point. Microwaved distilled water is a case of a liquid exceeding its boiling point, which causes it to vaporize violently when disturbed.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That pretty much answered my question. I guess I never realized that a pot of water will hit that temperature and just stop getting hotter. I actually meant to post this as a reply to /u/shleppenwolf's comment about people estimating land elevations in Africa, I guess they'd heat water until it stopped getting hotter and that was the boiling point at that pressure. Neat!</p></div>		</li>
