			<div class="markdown"><p>If you stabilized the laser and aimed at a perfectly static background, then you would expect a static speckle pattern. If the target was vibrating ever so slightly though, you could potentially see the pattern change. The interference occurs because of small differences in distance on the order of 200- 300 nm. </p>
<p>Interference is the main idea in <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">LIGO</a>, which goes to show how damn sensitive interference effects can be!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small differences in the scale of 200-300nm wow! I didn't know we also use it for LIGO</p>
<p>Would air currents cause changes in the speckle? Say over a distance of 5 meters?</p>
<p>I suspect yes since Schlieren Photography is a thing <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlieren_photography" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlieren_photography</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, air currents cause differences in density of the air, which act as very weak lenses.  This is a very small version of the heat waves visible on a hot road.  Hobbyists who do holography with low power lasers have to let the air settle in an enclosed, temperature stable room for at least an hour before attempting long exposures.  They also have extensive setups to mitigate the vibration mentioned in your comment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bonus: if you have some material that slowly changes over time (due to thermal fluctuations or a slow phase change or whatever), you can use changes in the observed speckle pattern (given a static light source and position) to examine how fast those changes happen.

			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on the laser power rating.  There is an old and new system; I'm more familiar with the old one.  Roughly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Class I: There's no possible way you can hurt yourself with this.  Even if you look straight at it with a magnifying glass.</li>
<li>Class II: Blinking reflexes will save you.  Don't deliberately hold your eye open and stare at it for extended periods of time.</li>
<li>Class IIIa: &lt;5mW.  Additional optics, or staring at it for a while, can hurt you.  Hard to cause damage by accident.  <strong>This is where laser pointers usually are</strong>.</li>
<li>Class IIIb: If it gets in your eye, it can cause damage faster than you can react.</li>
<li>Class IV: You really need eye protection.  Not just direct exposure, but even reflections can cause eye damage.  Can potentially even cause skin damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, you're pretty safe with a class IIIa laser pointer.  Just don't continue doing something where your eye says &quot;ouch, this is bright; please stop&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just assume that all lasers will damage your eye if you look directly at it, it is not worth the risk. Cheap laser pointers are often labeled as &quot;eye safe&quot; when they really aren't. Quality name brand laser pointers off a projector screen are probably safe, but assume they are never safe if you look directly at them off a shiny reflection.</p>
<p>To answer the first question, more dangerous than reflections off a rough wall (diffuse reflection), and nearly as dangerous than than off a mirror (specular reflection).</p>
<p>For the purposes of safety classifications, red and green are considered under the same &quot;visible&quot; category since your eye is sensitive to both and the damage is photochemical damage to the retina, and retinal burn.</p></div>		</li>
