			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand that the mRNA vaccine (perhaps others?) have demonstrated effectiveness against the variants of COVID-19 as well, though. Wouldn't that suggest that the immune response to one strain of COVID-19 would coincidentally hamper the second strain while both are present?</p>
<p>OP's question seems to be about coincidence of infection from totally unrelated viruses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the concurrent infection with two strains would be dealt by the innate immune system unless one has previously been exposed to the virus or has been vaccinated. The goal of vaccination is the development of adaptive immunity against the virus, which takes weeks to develop.</p>
<p>The vaccine's efficacy to variants probably stems from the spike protein structure. Antibodies are very specific to a small part of a protein. So, when you get vaccinated, you don't just make one single type of antibodies against the spike protein. You make a bunch of antibodies that each target different part of the protein. As long as you have antibodies against the conserved parts of the spike protein, the vaccine should provide protection against the variant, albeit potentially  at lower efficiency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus a mutation that would evade vaccination antibodies would basically have to mutate to not use the spike protein, correct? But that's how it infects you, so if it mutated to not use it, it would just be DOA?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reality of the situation is that a lot of the &quot;different strain!&quot; media hype is fear mongering.</p>
<p>Unless <strong>a major</strong> mutation event occurred (e.g. loss of the entire spike protein), the vaccine's effectiveness would not change. Although the virulence/transmission ability of the variants may be different, the underlying proteins present are virtually the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This co-infection situation is how hybrid variants (like the &quot;India/California double mutant&quot;) appear. It is my understanding that during the RNA replication process, the enzyme involved tends to fall off, but it can hop back on at the right spot so it can continue. When a co-infection occurs, there's the potential for the enzyme to fall off a strand from one variant &amp; then reattach to the other one. Since the genes are relatively close, it can still pick up where it left off.</p>
<p>That leads to the potential for mutations from both variants to be encoded within a single strand. That new hybrid strain can then be transmitted to others.</p>
<p>This is why it is critically important to minimize the spread of this virus as quickly as possible. Each new person provides more even chances for the virus to randomly mutate and become worse, and areas with multiple variants create many chances for more dangerous hybrids to appear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, this isn't as significant as the reassortment process that lets influenza viruses swap entire RNA strands to create novel variants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In this case its not the enzymes (polymerase) falling off as the enzyme does not contain the code, its the new RNA strand annealing to a different viral RNA template (strand jumping) that allows the 2 mutations to be together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't it equally likely that the coronavirus would mutate into a highly transmissable and less severe strain that aids in global herd immunity?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Possible, though unlikely. That would be very cool tho. </p>
<p>The thing is that if the strain is less severe, the immune system will fight it off faster, leaving less time for the virus to be transmitted. If the less severe strain is so easy to fight off that it is comparable to a common cold, then it is unlikely that an infected person would be able to infect someone else, basically ruining chances of hers immunity. </p>
<p>Also, this is basically what the vaccine is. You could technically say that the vaccine is a variant of covid-19, since the vaccine only has the mRNA coding for the virus spike proteins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Highly transmissible? Yeah, definitely. Less severe? As far as I am aware, no not really.</p>
<p>The reason why deadly viruses tend to evolve into less severe versions is because of the natural pressures that way. A virus that's too severe has a tendency to kill the hosts so fast that transmission is directly limited. That's a significant part of why MERS never spread like COVID19.</p>
<p>Instead, COVID19 <em>is</em> the less severe evolution of SARS. A very large proportion of COVID infections are already &quot;asymptomatic&quot; in that they don't tend to become acute infections, but they are still contagious and often even experience organ damage. Even the people having severe, relatively immediate reactions tend to be most infectious before serious symptoms appear.</p>
<p>Also, I may be the wrong person to ask. I have been waiting for almost a year for more research on the impacts of COVID on the nervous system. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the people experiencing anosmia are discovered to have degenerative nervous system conditions. That's pretty damn severe, but it is slow enough that it wouldn't have an impact on transmissibility.</p></div>		</li>
