			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know where you live, but here you can buy a not so fashionable pair of glasses for not that much money. If they're to wear in the evening at home, or even only in bed, who cares what the design looks like :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve tried to learn ways around this, such as walking very slowly to take them out, or switching to glasses earlier in the evening. Probably should brush my teeth earlier too just in case too haha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, I usually keep my eyes closed and &quot;try to sleep&quot; while letting my electric toothbrush do the thing for me. When I'm not too lazy I brush my teeth earlier, when I'm still not tired, that's the best thing to do to prevent these unpleasant situations</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I try to stay in the dark as much as possible. Avoid turning on hallway lights and such. I have an auto on rather dim night light in the bathroom so I can see but its not a full blown room light so it doesnt perk me back up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Extended wear contacts. Completely changed my life. I can wear them for about week (could go longer, dont want to risk losing my eyes), take them out for a day and repeat the process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was much younger/dumber I had contacts that were supposed to be worn no longer than 8 hours at one time, and thrown out after 2 weeks. I would put them in and leave them in for a week or two, and rarely up to 4-5 weeks. Showering, sleeping, swimming, didn't matter.</p>
<p>The reason I stopped was one day they were slightly bothering me so I took one out only to be greeted by immediate intense stinging pain in that eye. I thought something was in my eye and spent a good 30 minutes trying to flush it out. Extremely frustrated, with my eye very red, I noticed it - the inside of my eyelid looked like <a href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/diseases/what-is-giant-papillary-conjunctivitis" target="_blank">this</a>. I put in a fresh contact and the pain instantly went away - it was like a little shield for my eyeball. Went to the doc, got that cleared up, and never over-wore contacts again.</p>
<p>Nowadays I mostly wear my glasses but have one-day contacts for days I need them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are a game changer. Granted, my eye doctor still advised that i try to take them out every night just to be safe, but even being to able to keep them in for one night is great - let alone seven.</p></div>		</li>
