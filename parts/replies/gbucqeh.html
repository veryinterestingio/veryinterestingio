			<div class="markdown"><p>I have learned so much about myself from a wikipedia article. This is fascinating. I have always been bad with numbers in a way I would have described as being akin to dyslexia but never really looked into it. There was a full list of signs of dyscalculia in that article and I have issues with almost all listed. Most fascinating to me was &quot;Mistaken recollection of names, poor name/face retrieval, may substitute names beginning with same letter.&quot; I have very bad facial recognition and do things like call my nextdoor neighbor &quot;Tony&quot; (his name is Todd... I think) or my employee &quot;Jason&quot; (Jeremy) and I have a million other examples. Weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm right handed, and have dysgraphia (dyslexia, but for handwriting/drawing). I only know which hand I write with because I have a callus where the pen sits when I write. There's muscle memory, but if I have to actually think about it, I get confused.</p>
<p>But am EXCELLECT at navigation. I can visualize where we are going or what we need to do to get there. Usually don't need a map if I've been there before.</p>
<p>I always say the wrong word for left and right.</p>
<p>When I'm telling someone directions, I will tell them with full confidence to take a left up ahead, while picturing in my head that we are taking a right. I often don't notice my verbal error until we miss the turn or they start switching lanes the wrong directions.</p></div>		</li>
