<p>You're 100% correct that diseases that purely exhibit such extreme symptoms and progression aren't very long-lived</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is widely believed but wrong. </p>
<p>In general pathogens evolve toward increased  transmission, not increased or reduced virulence; but changes in virulence do sometimes alter transmission. In some cases reducing virulence may increase transmission, but in others increasing virulence increases transmission. That's probably the case with rabies, which has been around a long, long time by specializing in spreading through bites, which it encourages by damaging the brain to make animals more aggressive. </p>
<p>As far as a pathogen is concerned, there's no difference between a dead host and an immune host, which is what normally follows most infections -- both are unavailable for further infection -- so there's no benefit in leaving its host alive. </p>
<p>Long posts, with references, are <a href="http://www.iayork.com/MysteryRays/2015/07/06/evolution-of-virulence/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/aqrtu9/why_are_some_viral_infections_permanent_but_some/" target="_blank">here</a>.  (The second link is hidden behind a deleted comment and I'm pasting it in the bottom here so it's easier for me to find next time someone makes this statement.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The primary carriers or rabies in the USA are bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes; all of whom are primary hosts for rabies that aren't killed off by the disease</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is 100% wrong as well.  Rabies is highly lethal in raccoons, skunks, foxes, and North American (and probably South American) bats. I'm disappointed to see a highly upvoted answer spreading so much misinformation.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>a virus that very rapidly kills its only host isn't only going to be short-lived on an evolutionary timescale</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not <em>wrong</em> but it's a little misleading.  Selection on viruses (and on most pathogens in general) is at the level of transmission, not (primarily) replication or pathogenesis or virulence. That is, viruses are selected for efficient transmission between hosts first and foremost. There's also selection for other things, but if they conflict with efficient transmission, transmission wins out. </p>
<p>For many modes of transmission, low to moderate virulence is a plus. For respiratory viruses with moderate transmissibility, say influenza for example, a host who's staying home in bed isn't going to be contacting large numbers of potential victims, so the virus may well evolve to lower virulence so the host is able to wander around and contact more new individuals. The same is true for pathogens with vertical (parent-to-offspring) transmission. </p>
<p>But what about something like cholera? These pathogens spread through fecal/oral contact. Maximizing fecal output maximizes the amount of fecal contamination. It doesn't matter if the host is at home, they're still contaminating the environment. But maximizing fecal output is going to kill the host by dehydration a lot of the time. That's a tradeoff the pathogen is happy to make. Similarly, the longer the parasites can persist in the environment, the more virulent they can evolve to become (the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4873896/" target="_blank">&quot;Curse of the Pharoah hypothesis&quot;</a>).</p>
<p>Then there's something like the myxoma virus in Australian rabbits. It started out with very high virulence, and then dropped slightly to something like 70% mortality (still very high -- much higher than smallpox and even higher than Ebola.) Turned out that in Australia myxoma spread via sand flea bites, and sand fleas don't bit dead rabbits. On the other hand, healthy energetic rabbits groom away sand fleas and reduce bites. What myxoma did was make the rabbits extremely sick, on death's door, for a longer period. Keeping them alive let the fleas bite them and transmit more, while keeping them very sick prevented them from scratching away the fleas. So selection at the level of transmission pushed the virus from extremely high virulence to just very, very high virulence, and no further.</p>
<p>Finally there's things like rabies. Rabies is a very efficient, widespread virus that's been around for a long time, but that invariably kills its hosts within a short time of symptoms. It transmits through saliva, and then damages brains to encourage the host to bite things and spread that saliva. Brain damage is a route to quick death, but it's also a way rabies optimizes transmission. </p>
<p>There are even scenarios in which increasing viral virulence enhances transmission. It's speculated that Marek's Disease of chickens was pushed in that direction because of incompletely effective vaccines.</p>
<p>So pathogens don't generally have a lot of incentive to let their hosts live. In some cases, letting hosts live meshes with the pathogen's own selection forces, but that's just coincidental. </p>
<p>Another way of thinking about it - Many pathogens induce long-term immunity after infection. As far as the pathogen (and its progeny) are concerned, after infection the host is equally invisible to them whether it's dead, or immune. So there's no benefit to letting it live. </p>
<p>Of course, pathogen evolution is countered by host evolution, since obviously the hosts have an incentive to try to live longer, so all of this is hard to study in natural settings.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rabbit example and the phrase “maximizing fecal output” reminded me how terrifying it is that viral evolution isn’t a designed process. Keeping the infected suffering but barely alive to extend the transmission period sounds like it’s deliberately malicious or sadistic, but it’s really just the logical, unconscious result of optimizing for transmission given certain selection pressures. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My apologies for the off-topic comment, but I'm in a PhD program for computational sciences. One of the recent models I worked with was a diffusion model, and the professor mentioned it is a type often used in epidemiology. If your expertise is in that direction, could you point me toward some of the core research on computational studies of epidemiology?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As rabies progresses through the brain it causes a couple distinct behavioural changes. The biggest is a huge inhibition of aggression and self preservation. Rabid animals are mindlessly agressive by this point. The other is an intense hydrophobia. The animals cannot swallow liquids and thus become dehydrated and their mouths fill with saliva. The rabies virus then collects in the animals saliva.</p>
<p>This is how the rabies virus spreads from symptomatic hosts. It causes them to get insanely agressive and then hopefully bite and infect another host before the current hosts brain melts. Rabies is metal AF basically.</p></div>		</li>
