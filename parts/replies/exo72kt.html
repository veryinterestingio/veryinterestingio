			<div class="markdown"><p>If you’re talking about the drug in the reservoir- you’ll receive a concentrated dose of drug that should be absorbed over hours or days.In the case of Fentynal- you’ll probably die. </p>
<p>If you’re talking about the adhesive side only, the drug will work as long as there is drug in the adhesive. Once it’s gone it can’t be replenished by the now missing reservoir. In addition, Without the air facing backing covering the adhesive you’ll pick up every speck of dust hair and skin known to man because those adhesives are very tacky.</p>
<p>Edit: autocorrect got me</p>
<p>Also to add- skin transmission from people opening them up without proper gloves also contributes to death rate of tampered fentynal patches.</p>
<p>Edit 2: should you accidentally rupture the reservoir (it’s really difficult to do this on accident) you can mitigate the transmission rate by flushing the area with water effectively diluting the drug. I’m not an expert on the drugs themselves so this advice may not apply to all drugs but usually there are safety precaution disclaimers in the packaging that tell you what to do in the event of an accident.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One small point on 2 - my understanding is that a while ago FDA required fentanyl patches to switch to the drug-in-adhesive matrix for exactly this reason: reservoir fentanyl patches can be dangerous due to leaking (on purpose or otherwise).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I was going to say I haven’t seen a reservoir patch in years. They all seem to be matrix ones nowadays. Plus you can cut matrix patches and get a proportion of the dose so they’re more useful for titration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just want to clarify scenario one, you put melt in quotes, I would change that to dissolve. The melting point doesn't really affect whether it can be absorbed, but it's solubility does. Typically drugs have to be at least somewhat soluble in oil to pass through the skin. For example, Ortho Evra is a matrix patch but the active ingredients (Norelgestromin 110°C, ethinyl estradiol 140-180°C) melt at temperatures well above body temp, but are oil soluble and so will pass through the skin relatively easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks I put melt in quotations cause I didn’t like it but it was 6am and I was trying to get ready for work.the extra sentence was unnecessary and incorrect I’ve changed both. I need coffeee before I answer things on the internet apparently.</p></div>		</li>
