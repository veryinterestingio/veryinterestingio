			<div class="markdown"><p>When i was a young lad I worked a small Job at McDonalds to finance my car. Here in germany McDonalds workers are mostly immigrants(no hate please, most of them were absolutely lovely people who were dealt a shitty Hand in life) and a lot of them were following Ramadan. Just seeing them working in a Hot McDonalds kitchen, in summer, working with food 8 hours a Day and NOT giving in was a surreal experience.</p>
<p>I Was like 17 at the time. One of my absolute favourite people was tarik a tall, big, friendly turkish guy. The friendliest Person ive ever had the pleasure of getting to know. We talked all our shifts about our Different cultures (Not in a preachy way. Like friends who love the exchange) and It was a fantastic experience. You wouldnt expect something like that in a McDonalds kitchen but its one of my fondest memories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is why, on the Gregorian calendar, Ramadan happens at all sorts of times. It started today (April 13th) this year, but started April 24th last year, and August 11th back in 2010. In fact, there were two Ramadans in 1997 â€” January and December.</p></div>		</li>
