			<div class="markdown"><p>Constant monitoring is important. Transported a suspected stroke. Husband woke his wife up in the middle of the night acting strangely and not making much sense. Still able to walk and speak his answers were just incoherent and his movements were a bit unsteady. Last known normal behavior was hours ago when the couple went to bed.</p>
<p>I kept asking questions of the pt largely for the sake of his wife in the front seat of the wagon. She gave me the pt history in their house before we loaded him up and the pt was calm but responding with disconnected answers. Because I kept talking to him I noticed when he started wincing. I asked if he was in pain, if he was experiencing a headache, thought he nodded in what might have been an affirmative way. Checked with the wife and she agreed he hadn't shown any signs of pain since he woke her up. It was one of the reasons she was so calm.</p>
<p>We were transporting to a hospital across the city as it was where the pt was regularly receiving treatment for other issues and he wasn't a priority transport. I called a hospital 15 min closer and confirmed that their CT scanner was unoccupied. I let them know what I was bringing in.</p>
<p>If that gentleman was asleep I would have learned exactly the same about his medical history because his wife would have filled it in. My treatment of him would also have been identical. He basically just rode in the back of the ambulance while I talked to his wife.</p>
<p>He would have spent  at-least 15 more minutes with a brain bleed though. Though for reasons exactly like that if he had drifted off it would have qualified as a reduced level of consciousness and that new symptom would also have qualified him as a priority transport.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pt original presentation was an unknown last known normal and his vitals were stable. In King County that makes him a non-priority patient. Still get him to a hospital quickly but whatever damage was done by the stroke is presumably done by now, lights and sirens would be a more of a threat than and aid and he was not going to be a candidate for fast acting thrombolytics.</p>
<p>Also his history was tragically complex and he was actually due for an oncologist visit that morning at hospital 1. I called the requested hospital and actually told the wife that I would probably be instructed to take them to our systems stroke center, which was neither of the hospitals in the story above, but the charge nurse at hospital 1 said to bring him in.</p>
<p>So up until his new symptom presented he was a non-priority patient he was non-sick with his family and a higher level of care both agreeing about his transport.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When my brother had an accident, they decided it was so urgent to fix his leg that they immediately put him under and started. He had an allergic reaction reaction to morphine and several other painkillers, stopping his heart multiple times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing: There used to be a belief that if someone with a concussion fell asleep, they were at increased risk of slipping into a coma. This belief now appears to be largely debunked.</p>
