<p>Sars-CoV2 has NOTHING that resembles flu virus. It’s a coronavirus, a different family, it’s actually more alike to some common colds (some are coronaviruses) but a lot stronger. It’s a beast that was never vaccinated before even in different strains (Sars-CoV1) and many of the damages that it does are not fully known or understood yet</p></div>		</li>
