<p>The German 8mm Mauser bullet is actually 7.92mm. Even the Germans apparently said &quot;Eh, close enough&quot; for a change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 5.56 was not designed using the metric system. When the US military asked for a lighter faster round, manufacturers took the .222 Remington and lengthened the case and named the new round the .224 Springfield. </p>
<p>Chamber pressure from the round was to high so they contacted both the Winchester and Remington companies asking about increasing case capacities. Remington then developed the .222 Special which was later renamed the .223 Remington. </p>
<p>The .223 Remington was then the basis for the new 5.56 NATO design.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The designer of the .222 Remington cartridge must have had a preference towards round metric dimensions. Not only were the bullet diameter a round 5.70mm compared to the .224&quot; but the base diameter was 9.60mm and it taped down to an even 9.0mm before the neck. The overall length of the entire cartridge was an even 54.10mm. There is just too many nice round numbers in metric to have been a coincidence.</p>
<p>This is not unlikely since most scientists and engineers in the US were and still are using metric. It is first when you get to machining and manufacturing that they are using imperial unless required by the government to use metric for these parts as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that's not how bullet design work. They aren't designed with nice round numbers in mind, whether metric or not. They are designed with ballistics in mind. Just because 3 of the 10 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.222_Remington#/media/File:222-Remington-scheme.svg" target="_blank">measurements here</a> end in a zero, doesn't mean anything. There are also 3 of them that end in a three.</p>
<p>They also have tolerances of a few thousandths of an inch in either direction. The .224 projectile could be anywhere from .221 to .227 or 5.63 to 5.77. That's why custom rounds are more accurate and consistent than mass produced rounds, the tolerances are tighter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have another questions coming up, why are the bullets bigger than the barrel? I understand that they need to make a seal but wouldnt it wear down the barrel from firing to often? Or ist to create the spin from the riffeling? And is the pressure in the chamber that big to schove the bullet through a barrel that is smaller than the bullet?? Oke that where a lot of questions</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, after tens of thousands of bullets, barrels do wear down and need to be replaced. However the barrel is made of a much harder material than the bullet, so the bullet bears most of the wear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer to all your question is; yes. The bullet needs good contact with the barrel both to create a seal so that the gasses do not just go past the bullet and also so that the bullet will start to spin from the rifling of the barrel. If the bullet was smaller then the barrel then it would not be able to build up enough pressure behind the bullet to push it out at great speeds. The issue is as you point out that this does heat up and wear out the barrel. The way this is fixed is to make sure the bullet is made of a soft material like lead or copper while the barrel is made with a hard material like hardened steel, chrome or ceramics. And machine guns which needs to fire rapidly either have a cooling system for their barrels or they allow the gunner to replace the barrel entirely within just a few seconds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Copper and lead are a hell of a lot softer than the steel alloy of the barrel, which can also be chrome lined or nitrided.  The bullet actually forms itself to the rifling, which creates the gas seal.</p>
<p>For the second question, yes.  5.56x45mm NATO can get up to 430 MPa (~62,000 psi) chamber pressure per NATO testing.  About 1800x the pressure in your car's tires.  That pressure takes the path of least resistance, which is through the bullet.  The bolt face is usually designed to not move until the pressure drops to a safe level, and exactly how this works depends on the specific firearm in question.</p></div>		</li>
