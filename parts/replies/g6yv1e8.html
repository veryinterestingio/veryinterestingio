			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. OP's mistake is to think in terms of negative pressure from the vacuum. A better strategy might be to think of it as a positive pressure upwards from the air below the glass, and no pressure downwards because the inside of the glass is a vacuum. Once you make a hole in the glass, you have air exerting pressure on both sides. When you think of it that way, you can probably work out the difference in the fully-vacuum case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, you mention what happens once there's a hole in the glass, and that's a perfect place to demonstrate what the gradient is and why it's the gradient responsible for the effect observed, especially if it's understood that the inside of the glass has lower pressure but is not an actual vacuum (as evidenced by the fact water doesn't immediately boil).</p>
<p>Put a hole in the glass and the effect is cancelled because the pressures inside and outside equalize, not because the pressures inside the glass is no longer zero. It is the difference in pressure that causes the effect, not the &quot;vacuum.&quot; It doesn't matter of pressure is 10 outside and 0 inside or 100 outside and 90 inside - the difference is the same.</p>
<p>Replace every mention of negative pressure in the post with negative pressure gradient and it becomes more accurate and pretty much answers any questions stemming from misunderstand what's taking place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, my reply was sloppy. I was trying to convey a more intuitive picture without details, but you are correct in pointing out the misuse of &quot;vacuum&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
