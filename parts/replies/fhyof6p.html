			<div class="markdown"><p>True, that's something I've wondered myself! Unfortunately, I haven't come across much in that respect in my learning :c</p>
<p>However, as another redditor commented earlier, they likely find more stable shelters, like the hollow of a tree (though, they'd need to be cautious, as that would be a popular nesting spot for owls or woodpeckers), underneath roofs, in a log, or perhaps just lower down on a tree, where branches are thicker and less liable to sway in the wind. This is mostly guessing on my part though. </p>
<p>I will also say, that there are many species who do not build their nests in trees. For example swallows build mud nests in the eaves of roofs or under gutters or bridges. So they'd be relatively secure in their homes. Kingfishers nest in the banks of rivers, burrowing owls burrow underground, owls and woodpeckers nest in the hollowed out portions of tree trunks. And so on.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;If I were a bird, I'd ask where all the other birds go when it's stormy and they can't get home to their nests&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve been wondering this too. We had a snow blizzard last winter that left hundreds of people stuck in their cars all over town. In the morning there was a thick layer of ice everywhere. I woke up from crows cawing. Went outside to see what’s going on and lo and behold there is this huge owl sitting on top of my house, just looking around. I’ve never seen an owl in a day light up until then. I was wondering if his shelter was damaged by the storm or something.</p></div>		</li>
