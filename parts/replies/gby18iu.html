<p>Pollen isn’t terrible though, so we’ve got that going for us, which is nice.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But in various times of spring, there will be a thin film of yellow on everything from all the pollen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m in Memphis and we suffer from sinus issues because we get the pollen and mold along with barometric pressure changes. OTC meds don’t help that much so we have to go get ‘sinus cocktail’ shots from the doctor to get relief. I feel so bad for people who move here and have no idea that they have to be proactive in heading off a sinus infection before it can take hold, and from what I understand these cocktail shots aren’t a thing in other parts of the country. They just suffer miserably until someone clues them in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ah yes mold thrives in our humidity. It is a little easier to remedy though.</p>
<p>Most people i meet are only &quot;allergic&quot; to one type of pollen though, so when that plant blooms they get lethargic. After a few years you can usually figure it out. Eating honey helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just take Benadryl every night. Since I started doing that I only get sick about once a year or so. If I do start to feel sick I waterboard myself with the neti pot.</p>
<p>Good point about the honey though!</p></div>		</li>
