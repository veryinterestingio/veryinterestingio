			<div class="markdown"><p>Around 12 years ago I had a small loan from one of the major banks (Canada) and when I had the funds I wanted to pay it off. The outstanding balance was calculated to the day, so I had to pay it that afternoon. I gave a cheque for my bank (different bank) to a teller and about 20 minutes later it was out of my account.</p>
<p>Another time I owed CRA some money for my tax return. I mailed them a cheque to a location that's about a 10 hour drive away. By the end of the next day it was already out of my account!</p>
<p>As you say, it can be done if they want it to be. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Also things like drafts and certified cheques have a completely different system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My employer still uses paper pay cheques. Everytime i deposit it i have a 5 day hold on the money. I get that it's a period of time where someone can notice a fraudulent cheque and raise the alarm but this is 2019! Send them a text and get it settled in 20 minutes! Not the 8 days that i end up waiting!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I wanted to pay off my mortgage at a Canadian bank I called them up to ask them what the balance would be. They told me they couldn't tell me that but they could send it to me by mail, which would take 2 weeks. I asked them if I had the privilege of paying an extra 2 weeks interest on about $200K and they said of course.</p>
<p>Mortgages are mathematical functions of time so you can calculate them to the penny at any time. I asked them what my balance was the last time they recorded it. They told me. I asked them the exact dates and time. They told me. I calculated the balance and walked into the bank later that day and transferred the amount as a prepayment. A couple weeks later I received a balance statement showing $1.23 - because I hadn't estimated their processing time exactly.</p>
<p>The rules are written for the banks, not consumers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the real answer. I don't know where all the other BS came from.</p>
<p>It's because these were computerized ages ago. They run through daily feeds that have to go through steps for authentication et al.</p>
<p>It would be like if you wanted to load a website, but each different request/command had to happen on a different day. It would take ages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, either because they modernized or because they skipped the very first version of computerization.</p>
<p>I wasn't defending it. I'm just starting how it works. It's been the exact same process for decades and that's why it's slow. </p>
<p>Basically it needs to be... Recomputerized. It doesn't really fit the OPs idea of computerization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We somehow convince a handful of the few largest banks in the US to embark on a multi-year project to upgrade the foundation of their entire electronic banking system from the ground up at the cost of millions of dollars. Most of these mainframes were written in COBOL in the 70s and haven’t been entirely updated since then, they’ve just been frankensteined with bits and pieces of stuff added on. </p>
<p>Edit- ironically keeping up these old systems also costs banks a lot of money. I work at a large US bank and just earlier today I was meeting with a 70 year old guy who was a programmer in the 80s and helped write some of these original programs that they’re <em>still</em> using. No one knows fucking cobol anymore except old guys so now a few times a year the bank pays him some obscenely high hourly rate to come in on contract and fix their mainframe problems. Obviously the replacement would be a huge upfront cost but ffs this is ridiculous. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone (probley the government) pays developer and hardware engineers a lot of money to rewrite the bank to bank system to use up to date technologies. Then spend even more time and money testing the system to find all of the bugs and possible exploits before using it for real. Any bug or exploit in this system could cause trillions of dollars of damage. </p>
<p>The current system for all of the issues that are caused by it being slow has a large advantage of working and everyone using it being confidant that the bugs and exploits have been ironed out already.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>EVERY company enjoys playing with your money while saying it takes 5-6 business days to get a refund or whatever. I went into Home Depot and bought some plumbing fittings. Got home and it turned out it wasn't what I needed. Brought the fittings back with a receipt showing I bought them not 15 minutes earlier.</p>
<p>Up to 5-7 business days for a refund.</p>
<p>Are you fucking JOKING?!? It took a split second for that money to leave my account, (I don't care if it's technically in limbo or the Outer Dark or whatever, it's not in my account anymore), and you expect it to take DAYS to put back? Like I don't know you are perfectly happy with holding that money in YOUR accounts and using it for YOUR investments?</p>
<p>And, I get direct deposit. Why the fuck do some people, at the same bank, get their deposit at the stroke of midnight. I can see my pay as a pending deposit 2 days ahead of the actual pay date. Why does mine show up at 9AM for some reason? It's already a transaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My cell phone company double charged me yesterday.  7-10 business days for a refund.  What the ever loving fuck?! I asked them if they were mailing the money back to my bank. I was not happy.
Long story short,  they are processing it as a high priority refund and I now will only be paying half my cell phone bill next month. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good that THAT part worked out, but I have to say I pretty damned surprised they didn't just &quot;apply it to your next billing period&quot;. I accidentally paid my cable bill twice one time, and that was their not-happening-any-other-way solution to the whole thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You realize it’s the processing company and the bank that is “holding” your funds for 5-7 days. </p>
<p>When I run a refund for a customer at our small mom and pop business the processing company shows the refund immediately and removes it from our account during that batch (that night).</p>
<p>I’m not sitting on that money for days earning interest. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yet some companies are able to process refunds and have them appear as pending refunds on my card, and if a debit card then sometimes with funds available, nearly instantaneously. It may be a difference in processing companies, but that doesn't excuse the processing company or the (large) businesses which work with these antiquated processing companies. I can forgive a mom &amp; pop business for using a processing company which works like this in exchange for possibly lower fees; I cannot forgive large companies, like Home Depot referenced by the parent comment, for the same.</p></div>		</li>
