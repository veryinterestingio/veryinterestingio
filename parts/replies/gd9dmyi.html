<p>If it’s been totally depleted by leaving the lights on or something or sitting way too long then it should be replaced if it’s a 2-3 years old because that seriously damages car batteries.</p>
<p>Edit: </p>
<p>OK I GET IT! You people in Arizona don’t get shit for life out of your batteries!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Both cars dealer maintained, in EU.</p>
<p>It seems better than it used to be. Notably expensive batteries though.</p>
<p>Where does five years come from?</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's another chart with 4-5 zones but the idea is the same. The heat cooks them, ruining the chemistry - the cold snaps strain them and that's when most faults are revealed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unlike lithium ion cells that last longest when kept partly depleted lead-acid cells last longest when kept fully charged. A car battery ideally is used to power the starter then allowed to fully recharge during the trip, then stored near full charge when parked. Like the man said fully depleting them is bad for them, as lead sulfide builds up on the plates too much to be reversed during charging, greatly reducing capacity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the climate in Phoenix kills batteries. I'm from Michigan and bought a car about 18 months after moving here. I had never had a battery die on me before but my car wasn't able to start a whole 20 months later. That was 7 years ago and I just put my 4th battery in the vehicle two weeks ago</p></div>		</li>

<p>Remember each time you let a lead acid battery totally “die” you’re losing about 10% of its expected lifetime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, in most vehicles if charging output isnt provided it allows the circuit to complete an the bulb to light.
Fun fact in some designs if you remove this bulb or it burns out it turns the alternator off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true, but I believe more specifically, it's when current is flowing from, rather than to, the battery. So it lights up when the engine isn't started, or if the alternator is failing, causing the battery to drain.</p></div>		</li>
