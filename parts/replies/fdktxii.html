<p>First day of 5-10 minutes is purely mental, a day or two later it's twice as easy</p>
<p>That being said I've been putting it off for months now</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is also good to consider, that when you finish (extreme) physical activity, your activated muscles continue to use/burn calories for some time in your rest mode. It is beacuse they need to regenerate, adapt and restore its energy sources.
ELI5: after it spent more daily energy for runnning, your body also uses more calories being in rest mode.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hence why Phelps in the lead up to the Olympics could consume 12,000 calories per day and still maintain his swimmer body. If you too exercised for most of the day, you too would burn a lot more calories. </p>
<p>On the down side, the fitter you are the more efficient your body gets. So working out to build muscle will  raise how many calories you burn just sitting around. On the flip side, working out on cardio equipment will actually make you gradually burn less when running the same distance at the same speed as you build the right muscles in the right places.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember during olympics coverage they said it’s not actually the workout that burns that many calories for Phelps. Otherwise marathon runners could eat the same (and they don’t). It’s workouts <strong>in the pool</strong>. Dude’s body has to work in overdrive to stay warm, then he’s working out on top of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My best friend at work is also a cross country coach. After lamenting to him about how few calories running actually burns, he intimated that humans were born to run, especially long distances. We do it well, and we do it efficiently. We don’t use a ton of extra calories, and it allowed us to hunt and survive for generations.</p>
<p>Further along in the conversation, we concluded that humans are not built to swim. The floating, the mechanics, the breathing, homeostasis, every single one of those processes is extra taxing on our bodies. Think running a mile is tough? Try swimming one. You’ll burn way more calories because we suck at it as humans.*</p>
<p>a couple of addendums:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>running might not burn a ton of calories, but it’s still really good for your heart, and</p>
</li>
<li>another activity that we’re “not meant to do” and burns a lot of calories is weight lifting/training</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also swimming is a lot harder, and uses much more of your body than running.</p>
<p>I'm a runner, I mainly use my legs, a little of my arms, and then my lungs. Like yes my whole body is being used, but the main stress parts are my lower body.</p>
<p>Swimming, you are using your core to keep you up, your arms AND legs to push you forward. Basically your entire body. And you are pushing through a medium much harder than air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One could say you become <em>less</em> efficient since all the extra muscle burns through a lot more energy even at rest. But less efficiency is good since you burn more calories.</p>
<p>Imagine having crazy high efficiency like 100 caloric intake per day, plus 1 calorie per minute running. A single Burger King combo plus a sundae could sustain you (and your insanely angry and growling stomach) for more than half a month.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body wants to be as efficient as possible and if you work out the same thing it will build muscle and endurance in that area to become really good at doing that one thing. It's why workouts get easier as you continue doing them. As you get more and more efficient, your body needs to burn less calories to get the same results.</p></div>		</li>
