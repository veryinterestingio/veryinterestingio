			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine the next scenario:
You are flying above the sea during a very very quiet night.
Attached to your plane there is a brand new speaker that could be heard from 20km away if turned to max volume.
Soon, you are going to fly through point A, then continue straight towards point B. There's a distance of 20km between point A and B.
A few minutes before reaching point A, you already move at the speed of sound and keep accelerating.
Once you reach point A, your speed is greater than the speed of sound, but there's not a tremendous difference. You also turn on Roackbaye exactly when you reach point A.
If someone is standing in a boat, at point B, will he see your plane /above/ his boat first, or hear the song first? </p>
<p>What I think is that you shall be above him, before he could hear that fatty singing Roackbeyeeee. But physics is full of surprises, so what do you think?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If he knows exactly where the plane is then he will see the plane first, depending on the air quality and weather giving him the unobstructed visibility to do so. It's perfectly possible for the human eye to see a plane 20km away. However he may have trouble picking the plane out in the sky as a plane is a pretty small dot at 20km distance. The reason he will see the plane first is because the speed of light is faster than the speed of sound by an incomparable amount.</p>
<p>One huge factor that's going to make a lot of difference in this scenario is the altitude the plane is flying at as our observer may actually be looking at it diagonally which increases the distance.</p>
<p>If the plane is travelling above the speed of sound when it hits point A and continues to fly above the speed of sound all the way up to and beyond point B, then no matter how long it takes the observer to spot the plane, he will see it before he hears it or the music that it's playing. It will pass over him silently before the sonic boom hits the observer followed by the soundwaves from the speaker.</p>
<p>However what he will hear will sound pretty garbled rather than music per se thanks to the doppler effect, wave degradation and distortion thanks to the sonic boom. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought of it again and I have a theory.</p>
<p>That guy in the boat however, should hear the middle of the song FIRST. Then he shall be able to hear the song's beginning. </p>
<p>I don't really know how to explain it, maybe someone will do it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to disagree with you on a few points, mainly citing John Stapp's research.  OPs test is very possible by sitting in a rocket sled backwards for a short period of time.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stapp" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stapp</a></p>
<p>&quot;Stapp reached a speed of 632 mph (1,017 km/h),[7] which broke the land speed record and made him the fastest man on earth&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stapp stayed with his aircraft at a speed of 570 mph (920 km/h) with the canopy removed, and suffered no injurious effects from the wind blasts.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm aware of Stapp. However very little of Stapp's scenarios apply to the one I described (Flying through the air like superman). Stapp's research was conducted under controlled conditions.</p>
<p>He was strapped to a rocket sled which gave him stability and he had a neck brace to prevent the spinal damage I described in every rocket run he made. He also wore a helmet for the majority of his runs (Including the 632mph run, only a small few where conducted without a helmet and they did not attain the higher speeds) but wearing a helmet breaks the rules of the OP's scenario as I alluded to.</p>
<p>His aircraft canopy tests where conducted to show that a pilot could withstand high velocity winds. To that end they where conducted as a pilot, so he was strapped to a seat, was wearing a flight helmet and there was some argument the nose cone was assisting in providing means of streamlining and thus he was not subject highly to the effects of air compression.</p>
<p>Finally, the difference between air compression at 632mph and 800mph is massive, just as the difference between air resistance at 100mph and 252mph is hugely increased. It's fairly certain he would have been badly injured had he tried to go faster (He suffered many injuries as it was including three broken ribs).</p>
<p>I'm not saying OP couldn't reach 800mph. I'm saying completely unprotected (Which Stapp most definitely was not) he could not reach that speed alive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But your not slowing down, your still accelerating to our magic 800mph.</p>
<p>In this case we will assume your flying like superman,</p>
<p>(If your accelerating really fast, this will likely kill you first)</p>
<p>Now your not going anywhere</p>

<p>I loved your amazing reply, all except this...</p></div>		</li>
