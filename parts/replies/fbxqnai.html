			<div class="markdown"><p>As an expansion of above poster's great ELI5, also imagine that most of the DNA &quot;words&quot; have gibberish in-between. It'd be like reading a newspaper, where in between each word was a jumble of letters that didn't spell or mean anything. </p>
<p>We call this &quot;Junk DNA,&quot; as it doesn't encode for any kind of region, but may (likely) be important in other ways. But that's getting beyond the scope of an ELI5.</p>
<p>Edit: I want to thank all the biologists, geneticists, and other scientists whom posted replies talking about the importance of non-coding regions in DNA. I didn't get into it because it's beyond the scope of an ELI5, but for anyone curious there are a lot of great comments explaining it below.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh Junk DNA is definitely important - Evolution doesn't play games when it comes to &quot;useless&quot; energy expenditure. Especially not in mammals like us that are designed to go hungry for longer periods.<br />
Think of our DNA code not only as of the words and books, but also the shelves in this library that our nucleus is. Having the structure around the books enables a much more flexible and complex regulation. Imagine the RNA polymerases as tiny robots which randomly move around in this library and grab a book to copy it's instructions. Now - you could annotate whole book(-shelves) (epigenetic histone modulation) to make them more or less important to your copy robots, or even move unneeded shelves closer to each other to save space, but also diminish the chance of your copy robots to randomly walk in there. Also, having shelves (and often largely empty shelves) as opposed to just book stacks makes it less likely that a bullet shot into the library hits a book (e.g. radiation) or that a bookworm will eat itself into a shelf rather than an important book, where it would remain and do no harm (viral integration). You see, there are many wonderful advantages to having a functioning library system around our books, rather than just having them stacked up in a room - both for organisational and maintenance purposes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Junk DNA really isn’t in vogue as a term anymore. This is for three reasons. First, many of the repetitive intergenic DNA regions appear to play important roles in scaffolding the 3D architecture of the genome and influencing how much certain genes are expressed. Second, the vast majority of the genome is transcribed into RNA at some basal level. It’s likely that in the majority of cases, the transcript is rapidly degraded, but in others, the non coding (i.e., doesn’t encode a protein) RNA is indeed functional. Third, mutations in non coding DNA can cause diseases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How is this the best ELI5? I don't mean to be rude but it completely leaves out the concept of junk/non codifying DNA. The real answer to the OP is that genes only make up 2% of our DNA, not that genes are long.</p>
<p>About 3 billion of the 3.2 billion base pairs aren't genes at all. This feels to me like a completely different answer to what most of the comments are saying here.</p>
<p>EDIT: Just because this is ELI5 and you are supposed to explain it simply doesn't mean you should explain it wrong. That's like telling a 5 year old volcanoes explode because of fire dragons living at the bottom. It's not like telling someone that genes are only 2% of the DNA is complicated. </p>
<p>The fact that genes are only 2% of the DNA is a far larger part of the answer than the fact that gene length varies.</p>
<p>First time I've ever been mass downvoted and it's because I wouldn't want people to learn wrong things. I didn't mean to offend anyone. Sheesh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The concept of “junk” DNA is actually starting to be rethought in the biochem community. A large portion of what is referred to as “junk” DNA is required to duplicate DNA and to produce RNA/proteins, serving as amplification signals, scaffolding, and regulatory regions built into the DNA itself. </p>
<p>EL15: most of the DNA isn’t genes, but all the non-gene code is required to produce those genes, sorta like how when someone builds a skyscraper, they use scaffolding, but that scaffolding doesn’t remain in the finished product, though it is absolutely required</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're literally completely correct. Reddit hivemind is wild sometimes. This ELI5 leads readers to think that there are only genes in DNA and that's literally incorrect. A good ELI5 not only has to make it easy to understand, but it also has to be correct...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just like spaces, line breaks, and punctuation marks: a lot of DNA base pairs aren't part of genes at all, but are essential to the &quot;grammar&quot; of gene expression.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And to continue the text analogy, as many as 4 bytes or 32 bits (individual 1s/0s) could be used to store a single character on a computer depending on the text format. A simplified set of American uppercase/lowercase, numbers, basic punctuation and spaces would need at least 6 bits per character by my rough estimate. </p>
<p>Similarly, one base pair only has one of 4 “values” (2 types of pairs in 2 possible orientations each). Even if a gene were as simple as a word (it’s not) you’d expect to need <em>many</em> more base pairs to communicate that information compared to letters.</p></div>		</li>
