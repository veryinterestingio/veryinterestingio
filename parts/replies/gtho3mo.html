<p>Where do the minerals come from, just by applying heat?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They were already there to begin with, it's not like heating something will put more minerals into it, but there is a grain of truth to this. It has more to do with how it was heated than how hot it is. If the water was boiled for a while, and you already had dissolved solids coming out of the tap, you're going to end up with a higher mineral concentration in proportion to the amount of water vapor that boiled off. If heated with a hot water heater, you might have some minerals dissolve from the inside of the tank, but that's not going to do much. As for air content aka oxygenation, heating has pretty much no effect beyond the circulation effect at the surface, and it's not going to have an impact on taste unless it's neutralizing contaminants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before I start my explanation, if any part is wrong, please feel free to call me stupid and correct me.</p>
<p>Now, as baseline knowledge, we know that the lower a substance's temperature, the slower it's molecules are moving and vice versa.</p>
<p>In cold liquids, gases want to rise to the top and escape but the gas molecules are surrounded by the slow moving liquid molecules so they have nowhere to go. Think of it like a molecule traffic jam.</p>
<p>In warm liquids, the molecules are moving faster so they have more energy behind them. They slam into the molecules of a solid substance with much more force, which increases the solid molecules' ability to break apart and bond with the liquid. Think of it like a pitcher throwing a baseball at a LEGO set: the harder they throw, the greater the force with which the bricks separate from each other.</p>
<p>So, in a warm liquid, because the molecules are moving much faster, the gas molecules have a much easier time rising because they're not constantly surrounded by stagnant molecules. To go back to the traffic jam analogy, the warm liquid is a large group of cars moving at relatively the same speed and the gas molecules are cars weaving in and out of traffic.</p>
<p>Hopefully my explanation is clear as mud. Let me know if I've confused you in any way!</p></div>		</li>
