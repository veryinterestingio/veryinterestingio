			<div class="markdown"><p>You pick up a lot of vocal habits from what you do and the people you talk to. I trained myself out of doing the whole ending my sentences on a higher pitch that most women learned to do. I did it to sound more assertive for work, but it also makes any compliments I give sound really backhanded and insincere (I'm already fairly sarcastic, it just added to it.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have the opposite. A sweet, weak, soft voice that is higher pitched that I use when I’m nervous or sometimes when working and my normal, lower, confident voice. My partner always knows when I’m nervous because I start talking different.</p></div>		</li>
