			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if this explains how people can wake up right as they’re arriving at their stop. I do this all the time. I always attributed it to “I’m not fully asleep so I can hear the announcements and can wake up when I hear the doors opening after the announcement for my stop.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm deaf due to a completely malformed vestibulocochlear system - there is zero function in this system.  No matter how long you spin me on an office chair, I always walk in a perfectly straight line.  It's also utterly impossible to get me dizzy or seasick.  Yet I do get this exact same thing as described by OP.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just went for a bunch of testing to do with Meniere’s. Does the malformed vestibulocochlear system affect your inner ear? I would assume it does based on the symptoms and the name , just curious</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the vestibular system and cochlea both compromises the inner ear. Mine are blobs of solid bone instead of fluid filled <del>bladders</del> canals. I was born with this so it's normal to me. I have poor balance compared to the normal person especially in the dark (I use my eyes and the horizon to balance) but I don't get dizzy at all. I'm also deaf obviously.</p></div>		</li>
