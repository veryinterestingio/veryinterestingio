<p>How do you decide if you ‘sacrifice’ a nerve, or use a synthetic tube to repair it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the size of the gap and where in the hand it is. A small gap of a millimetre you would use a tube but a larger one it won't work as well as when the nerve grows back it won't find its way as effectively.</p>
<p>If you've injured the nerve on the outside of the little finger, thumb side of index or index side of thumb these have high priority and should be repaired with the best way possible so if you're missing a whole centimetre you may well sacrifice the other nerve. Nerves don't bridge gaps well. </p>
<p>The nerves out in the fingers are about the size of a thin spaghetti except those important sides of the fingers where they are as thick as a regular spaghetti.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How are nerves attached, how many? Do you need to relearn using finger from scratch ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>3-4 hours is realistic if it is a fairly clean cut like with a hydraulic wood splitter but if it is a crush injury it'll be more complex.</p>
<p>To reattach the nerves you suture the outside called the epineurium. The nerves are a lot like a power cable with an insulating outer with the actual cables on the inside. We take a thread that is 0.03mm thick and usually place three little sutures in that outer cover. It's the same kind of little knots that you'd get if you cut something open and needed stitches on the skin. Each finger has two main nerves you'd aim to get reconnected.</p>
<p>Afterwards you'd need to learn to use the finger again to some extent but since the movement comes from the tendons running down your arm it isn't that difficult. The main problem will be that scar tissue will form making the tendons stick to everything around effectively limiting movement. The scar tissue is broken down to some eccentric with training so that is why you'll spend many hours with occupational therapists training.</p></div>		</li>
