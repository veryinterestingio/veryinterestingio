			<div class="markdown"><p>The statistics of this are kind of interesting. The total number of shark teeth that were produced while those monsters were around was probably really high. The teeth were probably all over the place in their haunts. Only some of those areas are now adjacent beaches and only some of the teeth adjacent beaches are thrown up on the beach before they are abraded to sand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>ISTR that</del> IIRC sharks' teeth are constantly being shed and renewed, so there are more discarded teeth than you might expect; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark#Teeth" target="_blank">30,000 or more in a lifetime</a>.  Their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark#Skeleton" target="_blank">skeletons are cartilage,</a> so the teeth are often the only surviving trace.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is ignorant, but how do the teeth get preserved? If plastic decomposes every 1000 years, then do the teeth have to be somehow fossilized to survive that long?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More like it was inside a band of submerged sedimentary rock for thousands of years until it was finally exposed.</p>
<p>Similar process with seacoal (fossilized trees) where the submerged coal seam is eroded by wave action and the dislodged coal fragments are washed up on beaches. Seacoal was a major source of coal until about 1100, when mined coal was exploited more to keep up with the demand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least where I am from, a lot of these fossilised teeth are protected in clay formations. The waves slowly break up these deposits and release the teeth. Any teeth you find were probably recently released, or they get steadily destroyed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback on this, you have to remember that the land and water was not in the same place as it was back when these sharks were living. When I used to go hunting for teeth, they would be found along the edges of cliffs that would be eroded by the river between tides and storms. Back when they were originally deposited there it was the middle of the ocean, and over time, things changed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is a beach in Hawaii called the magic sand beach. Each tide the sand is completely washed away to bare rocks, then when the current reverses washed back into place forming a beautiful sandy beach again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It happens a few <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La%CA%BBaloa_Bay" target="_blank">times per year</a>, depending on storms that wash the sand away. It isn't something that happens twice per day with the tide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple of the beaches in my town did this 2 years ago. Had some pretty violent storms for a couple weeks and afterwards all the beach sand washed away.</p>
<p>The stairs at one of the beaches were unusable for a while until the sand came back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Add to this, there is a sedimentary layer in the mid-atlantic stretching from New Jersey down to the Carolinas about 20 million years old that is particularly rich in sharks teeth. This layer is currently very close to sea level, and is subject to a lot of erosion, putting new artifacts into the soils/sands along the surflines. This is especially true along the Chesapeake Bay - beaches along the bay, especially those along sea bluffs are rich locals for finding sharks teeth</p></div>		</li>
