			<div class="markdown"><p>There are models in which the same fields are driving both the accelerated expansion of the universe in the first instances (inflation) and in the late universe (dark energy). However, the mechanisms might also be unrelated â€“ and we usually assume that they are given that the energy scales are widely different.  </p>
<p>We know that inflation had to stop since we would otherwise not be here to observe the universe. However, I agree that this is not a satisfactory explanation. Within the inflationary paradigm, there are different ways for inflation to stop. Usually, we describe the inflationary expansion in terms of a field that dominates the inflationary universe and slowly changing its value which is linked to the rate of expansion. In other words, the dynamics of this inflaton field dictates what happens in that era, including the end of the inflationary expansion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks.  It sounds like the field hasn't advanced much in this particular area in the 10+ years since I took cosmology in my first year of grad school.  Would you feel it is fair to say that infalton field theories are inherently ad-hoc to fit the observations rather than arising from fundamental understanding?  That is not a criticism (and I hope it is not taken as such), just an attempt to understand how advanced this area is at this point.</p></div>		</li>
