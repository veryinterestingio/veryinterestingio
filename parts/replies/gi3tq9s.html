			<div class="markdown"><p>With the emergence of natural sweeteners like stevia, high intensity is a more accurate term than artificial. But I digress. High intensity sweeteners can range from 150x to 600x sweeter than sugar. Some have the same amount of calories per gram, but since so little is used, it's essentially zero calories. Some are actually indigestible by the body, so no matter how much you have, they provide no calories at all</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is why many &quot;diet&quot; foods like olestra (a fat substitute) and sugar-free gummy bears (which use sugar alcohols) are known to cause digestive issues. You basically have a bag of oil/syrup passing through your body without being digested, and coming out the other side as one liquid mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll never understand how olestra became a thing.  &quot;Why did I turn into a grease gun with a hair trigger?&quot;, dude you stuffed yourself with non-digestible grease, what did you think was going to happen?  There was also the whole &quot;Well just have it in moderation&quot;.  The people who where switching to olestra were not known for their self control or they wouldn't be eating it in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Olestra causes issues because it blocks the absorption of fat in the intestines. This isn’t a problem unless you have a high fat diet and then the non absorbed fat causes a bit of a slip n slide situation. </p>
<p>Sugar substitutes can cause issues because they aren’t absorbed but still have a property known as being “hydroscopic” basically meaning it sucks water into itself. This causes issues when your large intestine is trying to turn food slurry into turds. It stays slurry. This is actually the same issue you see in Lactose Intolerance. Lactose is a sugar, but some people can’t absorb it so it is basically the same thing as a sugar substitute.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Stevia 0 calories packages actually have 3 calories according to the manufacturer for example</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't see anyone post this yet so I will. You mentioned rounding down, which is why Tic-Tac's can say that they're 0 sugar when in fact they're nothing but sugar. Each piece is less than 1 gram and when they round down it equals zero even though that's the main ingredient.</p></div>		</li>
