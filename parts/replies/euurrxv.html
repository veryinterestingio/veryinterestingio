			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this. Even if a barcode did repeat for a different product, it's not like there's a universal pool that all stores everywhere accessed. The barcode actually had to be in the store database as a product that is sold there. I used to work at a retail store and we would occasionally get things off our trucks that were from an entirely different store. Think brand names unique to the store or just things that my store didn't carry at all and were delivered by accident. If we tried to scan it in our system there would be no data found for it. It would just pop up and say &quot;product not found.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My company works with retailers and this misconception- that all barcodes are in a database somewhere - is one of the hardest things to get new store owners to understand. They donâ€™t realize that they have to actually type in descriptions, prices and then associate a barcode with the product in their system. They keep asking to just have us tap into the barcode database.  Nope, it takes work to set up a point of sale system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, companies still like to avoid that. I worked for a CPG company and we sold a &quot;multi-pack&quot; at one store (let's say Costco). Costco didn't sell the individual item but we still had to make sure the UPC was fully covered on the inner (bunch of extra work/cost).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>Multipacks</del> Masterpacks should use 14 digit GTIN codes while the saleable unit should use 12 digit GTIN codes. The 14 digit codes should just not come up with a price. </p>
<p>12 digit GTIN codes are also known as UPC's depending on where you are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually it's the 7 first numbers for the manufacturer. The 3 first numbers are country codes.
3245678xxxxxx is an item and belongs to a given manufacturer. But I've observed discrepancies to that pattern so I think companies have to purchase a range of codes if they want it to be their own.</p>
<p>There are two categories of barcode as mentioned earlier by MrOctantis.
The long ones are 13 characters long and called GTIN 13.
The short ones are GTIN 8 If I recall well. 8 characters long.</p>
<p>GTIN stands for global trade item number and belongs to GS1 as mentioned by MrOctantis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and there is even a couple versions of what is basically ipv6 -2d codes (like the complicated looking ones on FedEx labels) QR codes and whatever ups calls the square with a circle in the center. Those are all barcodes of a sort, but like ipv4 used decimals and ipv6 uses hex, those are a step up in complexity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most long numbers work like that. Phone numbers (country, area, town, house), credit cards (Visa always starts with 4, the first 6 digits identify the issuer, etc), zip/postal codes, etc. </p>
<p>It's not all that complex, really - it means you can insert more things later while keeping the same number system. A town will always have 1-123-45x-xxxx, even if they only need a fraction of those. As the town grows, they can continue adding while keeping the same leading digits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. I have a manufacturer's code for my business followed by 1000 numbers in a string that we have paid for ~$14 each to register through GS1.</p>
<p>I own a small brewery so each time I make a new seasonal or limited release beer I need a new code. More often than not these beers are one offs which means I need a lot of codes. That being said I own about 40 years worth of codes at the current rate of production.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So if you only had 12 total, but only used 4 a year then you might be fine.</p>
