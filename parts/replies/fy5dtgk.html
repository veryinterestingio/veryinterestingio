			<div class="markdown"><p>Not so much that as much as it is rude/distracting. You wouldn't start chuckling after your opponent made what you thought was a bad move, so why would you do the notation equivalent when they can see your scoresheet?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't some moves considered &quot;strong&quot; based on like how many pieces or spaces are being attacked?</p>
<p>Especially during the first few moves of the game. There are defensive (&quot;weak&quot;?) openings and then aggressive (&quot;strong&quot;) openings.</p>
<p>A move might not be objectively better but it says something about the personality of the player or the type of strategy they're using.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. A move which places the threat of a checkmate might be stronger than a move which forks two pieces.</p>
<p>In the same line, a move might be stronger if you’re setting up a trap than taking a piece which commits a blunder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While you’re definitely correct, I think from a simple computer’s standpoint the above might be shown as strong and weak, with the grain of salt that they’re rough approximations that don’t look into the future more than a turn or two (although it could certainly weigh threatening checkmate as more valuable than threatening a normal piece).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually a move gets a ! if it's strong but also especially clever. Like if the opponent blunders their queen and you take it, it's obviously a strong move but not really worthy of a ! (unless the blunder was not obvious and you need a tricky line to take advantage of it).</p>
<p>And strong means good, not aggressive/defensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When a game is completed the computer retroactively generates the game from reverse to analyze the best possible outcomes or how to change the outcome of the game while also keeping track of who the game is in favor of. So when it finds moves that are questionable, illogical, or just plain blunders, it'll mark it accordingly.</p>
<p>Edit: since people here who apparently don't play chess online. Yes computers do analyze the game backwards and annotate the game as OP asked: <a href="https://lichess.org/v03xCVPu/white" target="_blank">https://lichess.org/v03xCVPu/white</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you move a queen in line with a bishop and a room of the enemies, that would be a bad move. Even though you’re attacking two pieces, your vulnerable. It’s very hard to measure chess pressure. Hitting pieces with lower value pieces is often beneficial but not that easy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well strong and weak isn't necessarily the same thing as good and bad.</p>
<p>Unless that's what the implication is understood to be.  Which I'm guessing might be the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chess isn't solved, so there isn't definite n and p positions. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So, yeah, no moves can really be dictated as good or bad, only analyzed afterward if it truly had no positive outcome. Ex: Losing your knight to a bishop you didn't see across the board and they have no real consequence of taking it.</p></div>		</li>
