			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! That confirmed my suspicions. In most movies they say that people die instantly when they get shot in the heart but i thought not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe. Probably. Not guaranteed. There's a story of a woman who was partially decapitated and disemboweled who was able to get up and walk to help. </p>
<p>Humans are infinitely vulnerable but also crazy durable. We can die from tripping on a curb, or we can do a Blackbeard or Rasputin where it takes preposterous amounts of damage to kill us.</p>
<p>There's really no 'guaranteed' way of killing someone, short of maybe decapitation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a rule, a heart strike is near-instant. There are other killing blows that similarly kill via rapid massive loss of blood pressure, but involve a few seconds before loss of consciousness. Carotid artery is about 6 seconds for instance. That said, medical and military records indicate that sufficiently motivated persons can not only retain consciousness but function at high enough of a level as to remain a threat to others after the destruction of the heart. The limit at that point seems to be the oxygen available in the blood, muscles, and brain before loss of consciousness, which can be as much as 30 seconds. These however are not as extensively documented as I would like and may indicate more of a grazing shot to the heart that lead to rapid blood loss but not rapid massive loss of blood pressure.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the other extreme, which is probably the closest to instant death - hydraulic shock. Blood doesn't compress very well, and the massive (and very short-lived) pressure induced by the bullet is enough to essentially explode your small vessels all over the body - including the intricate structure of vessels supplying your brain. Your brain is essentially squished from the inside, and right after that, entirely deprived of oxygen. It doesn't even happen just with hits to the heart either, a hit to a major vessel is enough, or a high-powered bullet elsewhere. It's probably the closest thing you get in real-life to hollywood's &quot;bam, you're dead&quot;, and according to statistics, might happen in about a third of all people who die of gunshot wounds (much of the rest is slowly bleeding out). You get the worst Hollywood lesson - no, you can't rely on a gun to reliably stop or kill a person, but at the same time, no, being hit with a gun can absolutely kill you even with immediate care (good luck saving a brain turned into mush).</p></div>		</li>

<p>One bullet to the heart and you’re dead.  8 bullets to the heart and you’re deader.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure it's the other way around. Most of them are firing real bullets and only one of them has a blank. But they don't say who has the blank so each one of them can think &quot;maybe it was me and I'm not a murderer&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly.   One is a blank and none of the shooters know who gets it.  If you ask me that’s a lame way to excuse yourself for killing someone. </p>
<p>I can’t imagine the mindset of those that volunteer for such a thing.</p></div>		</li>
