			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the energies are not really discrete. Any state with a finite lifetime doesn’t actually have an infinitely precise energy. The energy width is inversely related to the lifetime of the state. Infinite lifetime means zero width. Finite lifetime means nonzero width.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In actuality the difference between energy levels is not a single energy. Transitions have a lifetime and this thus leads to an energy distribution through the Fourier transform. You need to go back to the fundamental quantum mechanic equations with the electromagnetic interaction to understand completely. You might learn this in a second year quantum mechanics course. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes me irrationally angry. We've been teaching spectroscopy this year and key part of that was that each element gives off exact wavelengths. Are you saying that its actually very small ranges of wavelengths?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason it isn't infinitely sharp is inescapable but requires Fourier Analysis as a prerequisite to understand/prove. If the class requires Fourier Analysis then it should teach this, otherwise it's arguably an irrelevant complication when teaching the lower level basics.</p>
<p><em>After</em> taking Fourier Analysis, the issue with infinite/finite spectral widths and lifetimes becomes obvious.</p>
<p><em>Without</em> Fourier Analysis, trying to explain the point would basically digress into teaching the basics of Fourier Analysis.</p>
<p>Some particular course may decide to mention it anyway, but there's no question that it would lead to confusion for many students.</p>
<p>If you want the rule of thumb, without proof, it's that, in a continuous domain, it takes an infinite amount of time to establish an infinitely precise value, and conversely, in a finite amount of time, you can only establish a range of values -- a spread of bandwidth in the case of frequency.</p>
<p>This is true of the results of measurement/observation in the classical domain, and is true of actual existence in the quantum domain -- e.g. a quantum photon with infinitely exact energy cannot exist in a universe of finite lifetime.</p>
<p>That's the theoretical side. From an experimental perspective, naturally people regard it as obvious that you can't measure anything infinitely precisely, so pragmatically it isn't an issue anyway.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The prediction of a finite energy range for the transition comes from time-dependent perturbation theory. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and also the temperature will lead to additional broadening due to Doppler shift. Electronic transitions in atoms are still very sharp in comparison to e.g. IR bands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In (condensed phase) IR the inhomogeneous broadening is largely from the Stark effect, as different molecules see different electric fields, as emitted from other nearby molecules. Doppler broadening really only occurs in gases, where you have fast particles and few intermolecular interactions.</p></div>		</li>
