			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, that’s an awesome response - thanks for enlightening me! I live in SW England where some areas are affected by natural radon gas - something to do with the granite layers they’re emanating from I think? Had never understood what the potential danger was of living near it, I just knew it was life threatening and homes near known sites had to be radon checked before they could be sold. Fascinating how large an effect it can have on the human body. ??</p></div>		</li>
