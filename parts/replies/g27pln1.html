			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends what you mean by &quot;interesting!&quot; There are more than 5000 planets already discovered outside our solar system, so there's a lot to choose from. In terms of the search for life beyond Earth, one of the most intriguing planets is TRAPPIST-1e; it's an Earth-sized planet in the Habitable Zone of a very small, cool star that's relatively close to us. It's one of our best candidates so far for finding a planet that might host biology, and we hope to search its atmosphere for signs of life in the future. -Avi</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the most interesting worlds for me is a *very* different kind of “ocean” world: 55 Cancri e. It is an exoplanet which orbits so close to its host star (it completes a full orbit every \~17 hours compared to the Earth’s 365 days!) that its surface temperature is over a thousand degrees Kelvin (1300 to perhaps as high as 3000 degrees Fahrenheit). These temperatures are high enough that there is a good chance that a large *lava* ocean exists across atleast part of the planet’s surface. This exoplanet is about twice the size of the Earth so just imagine a world with an ocean larger than the Pacific that is made entirely of lava and/or molten metals. There are teams right now using data gathered from the Spitzer space telescope to determine if this lava ocean may be influencing the composition of 55 Cancri e’s atmosphere. – Joe</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of fascinating exoplanets. Avi and Joe already mentioned two of my favorites in their responses to your question. Another of my favorites is Proxima Centauri b. I like this planet because it orbits the nearest star to us (other than the Sun, of course!). Proxima Centauri b is in its star’s habitable zone, meaning it’s at the right distance from its star to be able to support stable oceans of water on its surface. (Some people call the habitable zone the “Goldilocks zone”: it’s the place where it’s not too hot, not too cold, and just right for surface water!) However, we don’t yet know what this planet is really like, or if it’s truly habitable. It’s good to keep in mind that we know very little about most exoplanets so far. We generally have just enough information to rule in or rule out different possibilities. For Proxima Centauri b, we know the planet is small enough to rule out a big, puffy, Jupiter-like atmosphere, so it’s probably a rocky world like Earth. We know its orbit in the habitable zone means oceans could exist on this world, but we don’t yet know if those oceans are really there, what the atmosphere of this planet is like, etc, etc. </p>
<p>Another fun fact about Proxima Centauri b is that even though it orbits the closest star to us outside the solar system, it’s a very dim star, and you wouldn’t be able to see it without a telescope or binoculars. So, the closest star outside our solar system is invisible to the unaided eye! - Giada</p></div>		</li>
