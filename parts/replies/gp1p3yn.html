			<div class="markdown"><p>Depression has long been linked with increased inflammatory markers, so Iâ€™m glad you brought this up. Stress increases inflammation as do many other things. Exercise can reduce inflammatory markers, which might explain why it helps with depression as well. <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315255" target="_blank">exercise reduces inflammation </a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is discussed in the article I posted. It is absolutely possible and speculated that chronic or long term depressive states in and of themselves do cause structural changes, by decreasing neurotrophins and increasing inflammation and glucocorticoids in the brain.</p>
<p>So this negative profile is both a result of a depressive state, and a cause of atrophy. Depression really does change your brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The extreme mood changes are definitely the cause of the brain damage. Bipolar disorder patients also see similar damage. There's more articles on the brain damage of those with bipolar, but it's caused by the extreme moods of those who suffer from it, and one of the two sides of the coin is depression, and it does structurally damage the brain and reduce white/gray matter and damage neurons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've done transcranial magnetic stimulation and it was really interesting. I did it as a research study participant, so I wasn't getting treatment for depression. The device is a kind of movable arm with an electromagnet on it and the technician positions it in the right place above your head and turns on the magnetic pulses. It feels just like someone tapping on your head and sounds kinda like someone snapping a rubberband. Not painful, it just feels a little unusual and made me blink. It seems like a promising non-invasive tool if they can target a certain part of your brain to treat depression!</p></div>		</li>
