			<div class="markdown"><p>I did that when I was a kid. My parents thought I was possessed because I'd fuckin BANG my head. It didn't hurt, but in the car or sitting on the couch I'd smash my head back on the seat over and over again lmao</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a cousin that would do that! He'd watch this kids video over and over and just rock so hard against the couch. It wasn't even in beat with the songs. We thought it was odd but he was happy! Turns out he a great artist and a normal person. He was maybe two when he would do this. I think the guy was Raffi or something like that. &quot;Bumping up and down in my little red wagon&quot;  was one of the songs. &quot;Baby baloega&quot; (the type of whale probably misspelled it sorry) was the other one I remember. Since he couldn't talk that well the red wagon came out &quot;apple wagon&quot; over and over!</p></div>		</li>
