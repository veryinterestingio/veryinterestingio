			<div class="markdown"><p>OP is absolutely correct.</p>
<p>Take the mortgage interest deduction. So benign. Seems like a race neutral thing, right? Encourages home ownership by letting home owners deduct mortgage payments. It's not a racist policy in word or in deed. Or is it?</p>
<p>Black people have historically been denied mortgages and the ability to build wealth that white people have. This was accomplished through a process called redlining which was a society wide conspiracy, backed up by the FHA, which strategically denied loans for black people to enforce de facto segregation.</p>
<p>So what happens is that the mortgage interest deduction helps white families further entrench existing wealth while black families who have had to rent have not been able to benefit from this government subsidy. The longer this has been going on, the further white families have been able to entrench wealth giving them an unfair advantage.</p>
<p>If we examine it through the lens of the outcomes, it's a law that clearly biases towards selected races even if we don't even intend that to be the case. This is how entrenchment of wealth and hegemony by certain social groups can persist even when we have, in theory, equality under the law.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my understanding this means that there is a bias against poor people, and people of colour happen to be poorer because of history.</p>
<p>Would two people of same poverty but different skin color face different outcomes? Or is this outside of the scope of Critical Race Theory?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is dangerous to use examples of two people because individual circumstances can result in different outcomes almost at random.</p>
<p>What critical race theory is saying is that two groups of people (not individuals) will have on average different outcomes based on skin colour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evidence shows that it is more than just bias against poor people.  Black neighborhoods tend to have higher valuations in terms of property but lower valuations by realtors.  </p>
<p>Which means it's harder for a black people to maintain their home (higher property tax) and if they sell it's harder to buy a new one; forcing them to rent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>School funding is a similar thing. Imagine a situation in which every parent sends their child to the best school they can afford, either in terms of tuition or in terms of real estate. It should be easy, as that's very like the world we live in. This is rational for each individual parent: who would want to deprive their child of the best education possible? But the aggregate result is that the existing wealth disparities in the population will be recapitulated in the resource disparity among the schools.  </p>
<p>Note well : <em>no individual racism or racial animus</em> is required at any point in this process. Just parents trying to make the best lives for their children according to the logic of the system. Yet, at the end of the process, students of color will be much more likely to receive an inferior education.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But the problem is access to mortgages, not the mortgage interest deduction. The mortgage interest deduction is benign, neutral, and not racist. The lack of access to mortgages is not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thatâ€™s what they are saying. By itself, the mortgage interest deduction is not racist but in the wider context of racist access to mortgages, it further creates a divide between the races.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The common thread is that they all agree that race is one of the important factors in creating and maintaining inequalities in society.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To expand on this it is also worth noting that the vast majority of proponents of CRT recognise the intersectionality of inequality and don't push race as the sole factor to the detriment of other factors such as class, gender expression, etc.</p></div>		</li>
