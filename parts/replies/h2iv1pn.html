			<div class="markdown"><p>The periodic table is a way to show how atoms interact based on electron orbital interactions. The internal structure of the nucleus isn't really represented, except in so far as it impacts the electron orbitals.</p>
<p>Neutron stars won't meaningfully interact with electron orbitals of a free atom. If an atom of oxygen (for example) was close enough to interact chemically with a neutron star core, it would be pulled in by the gravity of the neutron star and destroyed.</p>
<p>Note that atomic orbitals break down even for lower mass <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf" target="_blank">white dwarfs</a>, which are &quot;electron degenerate.&quot; What that means is that the mass density of white dwarfs is high enough that the electrons are too dense to be associated with any individual atomic nucleus due to Pauli exclusion. So even for a white dwarf, chemistry doesn't really apply any more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, one key distinction is that traditional nuclei have well-defined energy levels as predicted by the nuclear shell model. Neutron stars are better described as a soup of nucleons, more compact even than atomic nuclear matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a maximum number of protons for an entry in the periodic table?</p>
<p>What does it mean to &quot;fit&quot; in the periodic table?</p>
<p>I think it wouldn't be helpful to put <big number><other big number>neutronium in the periodic table, but it could fit the definition of a periodic table entry!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IUPAC requires nuclei to live for at least 10^(-14) seconds. That should set an upper limit to the number of protons because things beyond that will have a shorter half life. We don't know where that limit is, however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The research that looks for new elements past the point of short lived elements, are looking for a island of stability. That a region further down the table is capable of lasting just long enough or possibly much longer to classify it as a new element. This region may not exist, but why not check.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would the proximity which gravity initially causes not allow for the strong force to then become a  factor? </p>
<p>If not, why not? We're dealing with the same quarks, colours, spins, and almost everything else, just in different proportions within the nucleons.</p></div>		</li>
