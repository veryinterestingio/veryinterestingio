			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you explain in more explicit detail what you mean by “back”?</p>
<p>Does that mean towards the back of your head like the opposite direction of the way the nose points? If so, how would you do that? I feel like pulling on the lobe bottom where ppl get pierced is the only way to move the canal but that must be wrong based on what you say</p></div>		</li>

<p>So kind of like they're pulling it in this picture (obviously you're not needing to use ear drops to get this done). Grab the top of the ear, and pull towards the back of the head, and up towards the crown.</p>
<p>Grabbing the ear lobe works for young children because of their ear canals being a slightly different shape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, that's how you are supposed to insert ear plugs! Pull up and back, roll into smaller cylinder and insert. It actually blocks the ear canal at that point and you <em>can barely hear anything</em>. Watching people ball up ear plugs and stuff them in to have them stick out an inch is infuriating</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I generally push it in until the outer edge is about flush with the &quot;start&quot; of the ear canal. Def shouldn't stick out, but also shouldn't need surgery to remove.</p></div>		</li>
