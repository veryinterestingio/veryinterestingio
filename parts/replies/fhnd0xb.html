			<div class="markdown"><p>Addicts are inherently selfish, I have my own sharps box at home, and I know of a few around my “pick up” stops, I am clean but I use a sharps box when I can but risk of getting caught with one is just as bad as getting caught with drugs so some times they just get thrown, buried, or put in a regular trash can with the cap covering as much of the needle as possible. For a time I wrapped my needles in tape.</p></div>		</li>
