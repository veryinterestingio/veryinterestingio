			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not familiar with Juneberry/Serviceberry, but soil drying out should not be a problem you allow with any cuttings. If you are taking softwood cuttings I would keep the potted cuttings in a tray that you can fill with water. The soil will absorb the water through the drainage holes keeping the soil moist and limiting the how often they need to be watered. I would also keep it under a dome. If you don't have/don't want to spend $ plastic containers like what salad comes in work great. </p>
<p>If you are taking hardwood cuttings in the fall I would put them in dishpan with drainage holes filled coarse sand. Water them and bag them with a white garbage bag and keep them in a shady area. Put sticks in the corners to keep the bag off of the cuttings. Keep the humidity in and you will not need to water them at all.</p>
<p>I found this site <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/hg/2009/09/propagate_serviceberries.html" target="_blank">specific to Juneberry</a> suggesting to start with rooted suckers or root cuttings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are  you keeping the humidity up? If they're left out in the open air and it's dry-ish, then the cuttings will transpire moisture faster than they can accumulate it- because they have no roots with which to gather substantial amounts of moisture.</p>
<p>Put them into a bag that raises the humidity, with some care to keep it out of direct sunlight- the &quot;greenhouse&quot; effect might cook them. If you're starting from sections of cane, you can put some candle wax on the part that doesn't go into the soil to further reduce transpirative losses. Once you start to see growth, start opening up the bag stepwise (small hole, larger hole, eventually remove bag) so the dry air doesn't hit them all sudden-like.</p>
<p>A bit of rooting hormone <a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71t3RZ1p8yL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" target="_blank">powder</a> on the end of the cane that goes into soil might help get roots a bit faster, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The categorization of cellular and multicellular life is strange and sometimes there just simply isnt a proper way to categorize some form of life, like sure it has chloroplasts and a cell wall but something isn't right.  Similar to how fungus cells are way more similar animals cells than plant.</p>
<p>From what I learned in botany, there's an organelle in plant cells that grows and stays connected between plant cells even as they divide.  It controls electrical impulses and is a little bit beyond my scope.  My professor did agree when I asked if it was the closest thing that plants have to a brain, likely carrying signals from the many sensors that plants have in each cell.</p>
<p>Scientists in Singapore recently figured out how to read and send signals to a plant by simply attaching it to a low voltage circuit with some means to read and send specific electrical frequencies, making venus fly traps open and close on command.  I feel strongly they are in some way sentient, with many scientist performing experiments on how they communicated via their roots with chemicals/minerals resources, sharing relationships and helping others of a family of plants survive if able to, so I hope this doesn't turn into some dystopian future where we enslave them as chemical factories.  On the bright side, the news seems to be that they're able to use is to diagnose disease and malnutrition based on the signals received, prior to any symptoms showing such as yellow leaves and fungus problems so I'm real excited for whatever wild tech we get from that.</p></div>		</li>
