			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, is there any internal mechanism which would cause such volcanism as to resurface the entire planet, or can it only be a massive collision?</p>
<p>If a collision, shouldnâ€™t we see some debris still in orbit or has enough time passed for it all to collect on the surface?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just like on Earth, much of the heat in the Venusian mantle should come from the decay of radioactive material. </p>
<p>Scientists currently believe that due to the lack of plate tectonics on Venus, there isn't really an avenue for all of this heat to escape until it reaches a critical mass if you will. Once enough heat and pressure builds up, Venus allegedly undergoes massive, global to semi-global volcanic events that resurface large swaths of the planet, restarting the process. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to Venus extremely thick atmosphere and its intense heat, most of knowledge on Venusian geology is shaky (hehehe).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was under the impression that Venus had a solid surface. Is that correct?</p>
<p>And as a follow up, how powerful are these resurfacing events? Is it merely a gentle flow of material or an explosive reaction to the pressure build-up?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just the weight of the carbon dioxide. It's the chemical stability as well. Earth can retain it's atmosphere if it's just a physical process knocking the atoms around. However a large portion of the loss comes from UV rays ionizing water molecules. The hydrogen atoms can get knocked off at escape velocity and escape or carry larger molecules away as well.</p></div>		</li>
