<p>If it is processed in a hospital lb where it was collected then turn around is fairly quick but generally takes 2-5 days. There are devices that can do rapid PCR tests where collection occurs. Think those take about thirty minutes to run. There isn’t as much capacity with those as the labs have. </p>

<p>In Vienna we have PCR gargle tests. You get 4 per week at a drug store, then you gargle in front of a webcam (phone or laptop) if you want to use the result to enter restaurants etc. or without webcam if you just want to test yourself and afterwards you throw it into a box at your nearest supermarket.
Couple of hours later you get your result per mail.
That way Vienna with roughly 2 million people would be able to test 200-300k people a day (not counting antigen tests that are done by professionals in every other public building).
I'm pretty grateful about that system. The PCR tests are valid for 72 hours and before I got my first shot there hasn't been a day since March 2021 I wasn't officially tested negative.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I picked up a box of two at CVS for about $24 just in case I needed to test myself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I can buy those for 0.5 to 0.8€ per test here in Germany. They started expensive (at 3€ per test) but now they are everywhere.</p></div>		</li>

And still you can get a state paid rapid test for free at every other corner. Police state and socialistic health care is possible, at the same time. You can get it, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no they wouldn't. you are talking about serological tests. Serological tests check for a presence of <strong><em>an antibody against the viral S or N protein</em></strong> (depending on the test). Serological tests looking for an antibody against the viral S protein will give a positive result in vaccinated people. </p>
<p>Antigen tests test for presence of <strong><em>the viral S or N protein itself,</em></strong> so actually testing for the presence of the virus. This test will not give a positive result for uninfected vaccinated people since the test is looking for the virus, not the antibody against the virus. Hope this is clear.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, if you have just received a vaccine of a type that makes your body (temporarily) produce the S protein, then an antigen test could in principle give a positive result if it's set up to detect S protein.</p>
<p>But there are multiple reasons this is very unlikely to happen in the real world. Firstly, it's much more common for the tests to look for N protein rather than S protein. Secondly, the vaccines that do cause production of S protein don't make it where you get swabbed. If the vaccine is injected into a muscle, then S protein will be made by cells in that muscle and perhaps the lymph node it drains into. The S protein made that way will have a very hard time getting from there into your nose. The protein also won't last all that long, and the amount produced isn't necessarily that big to begin with. So it'll be that much harder to ever get enough to make an antigen test respond.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of the antibody tests look for antibodies to N (which isn’t in the US vaccines) as well as or instead of S.  Those tests could distinguish vaccination from infection. But tests that only look for antibodies yes/no, or that only look at anti-S antibodies,  couldn’t distinguish them.</p></div>		</li>
