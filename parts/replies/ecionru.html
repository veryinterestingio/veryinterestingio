<p>Pc - Light particles still have momentum</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you edit that for clarity?  At least one of your exponent markups got applied farther than intended.  Is it supposed to be this?</p>
<p>E^2 = (mc^2 + pc)^2</p>
<p>And if so, why isn't it just:</p>
<p>E = mc^2 + pc</p>
<p>Is it to prevent the possibility of negative results in the formula, which would be imaginary in this context?  (Nothing can have a negative energy, to my knowledge.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose I meant from a physical properties standpoint rather than equations. How do they have momentum while massless? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because momentum and mass are individual properties and aren't related to each other. Notice how it's (mc^2 + pc). If mass is zero you just have p * c which is momentum times the speed of light. Momentum is still a part of energy and as we've just demonstrated, it doesn't require mass.</p>
<p>We know E = hc/Î» (planck constant times the speed of light divided by the wavelength) so momentum energy in light shows up as increases the frequency. That's also why photon energies are measured in eV interchangeably with Hz.</p></div>		</li>
