<p>Each country has different laws that regulate trade union behaviour and this has a big influence on how they operate. British and American unions are very different for example.</p>

<p>People should read about American labor history and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_union_busting_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">union busting</a> regulations in the 20th century. There's at least two major labor related legislations people should know, which were around the time of the Great Depression and right through <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism" target="_blank">McCarthyism</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Wagner Act, 1935</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Act" target="_blank">National Labor Relations Act</a> (NLRA), often referred to as the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner_Act" target="_blank">Wagner Act</a>, was passed by Congress July 5, 1935. It established the right to organize unions. The Wagner Act was <em>the most important labor law</em> in American history and earned the nickname &quot;labor's bill of rights.&quot; It forbade employers from engaging in five types of labor practices: interfering with or restraining employees exercising their right to organize and bargain collectively; attempting to dominate or influence a labor union; refusing to bargain collectively and in &quot;good faith&quot; with unions representing their employees; and, finally, encouraging or discouraging union membership through any special conditions of employment or through discrimination against union or non-union members in hiring. Before the law, <em>employers had liberty to spy upon, question, punish, blacklist, and fire union members</em>. In the 1930s workers began to organize in large numbers. A great wave of work stoppages in 1933 and 1934 included citywide general strikes and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_factories" target="_blank">factory occupations</a> by workers. Hostile skirmishes erupted between workers bent on organizing unions, and <em>the police and hired security squads</em> backing the interests of <em>factory owners who hated unionizing</em>. Some historians maintain that Congress enacted the NLRA primarily to help stave off even more serious — potentially revolutionary — labor unrest. Arriving at a time when organized labor had nearly lost faith in Roosevelt, the Wagner Act required employers to acknowledge labor unions that were favored by a majority of their work forces. The Act established the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board" target="_blank">National Labor Relations Board</a> (NLRB), with oversight over union elections and unfair labor practices by employers.</p>
<p><strong>Taft-Hartley Act, 1947</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taft-Hartley_Act" target="_blank">Taft-Hartley Act</a> was a major revision of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Act" target="_blank">National Labor Relations Act</a> of 1935 (the Wagner Act) and represented the first major revision of a New Deal act passed by a post-war Congress. In the mid-term elections of 1946, the Republican Party gained majorities in both houses for the first time since 1931. With the Truman administration initially taking no stand on the bill, it passed both houses with strong bipartisan support. In addition to overwhelming Republican support, a clear majority of House Democrats voted for the bill, while Democrats in the Senate split evenly, 21-21.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taft-Hartley_Act" target="_blank">Taft-Hartley Act</a> was vehemently denounced by union officials, who dubbed it a &quot;slave labor&quot; bill. Truman vetoed the bill with a strong message to Congress, but despite Truman's all-out effort to stop the veto override, On June 23, 1947, Congress overrode his veto with considerable Democratic support, including 106 out of 177 Democrats in the House, and 20 out of 42 Democrats in the Senate. However, twenty-eight Democratic members of Congress declared it a &quot;new guarantee of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_slavery" target="_blank">industrial slavery</a>.&quot; </p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taft-Hartley_Act" target="_blank">Taft-Hartley Act</a> gave the National Labor Relations Board the power to act <em>against</em> unions engaged in unfair labor practices; <em>previously</em>, the board could only consider unfair practices by employers. It defined specific employer rights which broadened an employer's options during union organizing drives. It banned the closed shop, in which union membership is a precondition of employment at an organized workplace. It allowed state &quot;right to work&quot; laws which prohibit mandatory union dues.
<em>The act required union officials to swear that they were not communists.</em> This provision was overturned by the Supreme Court in 1965.</p>

<p>Business elites saw the direction their money was going after the Great Depression when Roosevelt came along with the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal" target="_blank">New Deal</a> with proposals for things we have today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His [Roosevelt] choice for <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Labor" target="_blank">Secretary of Labor</a>, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Perkins" target="_blank">Frances Perkins</a>, greatly influenced his initiatives. Her list of what her priorities would be if she took the job illustrates: &quot;a forty-hour workweek, a minimum wage, worker's compensation, unemployment compensation, a federal law banning child labor, direct federal aid for unemployment relief, Social Security, a revitalized public employment service and health insurance&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So much history leading up to current <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_unions_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">status of labor unions</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2016, there were 14.6 million members in the U.S., down from 17.7 million in 1983. The percentage of workers belonging to a union in the United States (or total labor union &quot;density&quot;) was 10.7%, compared to 20.1% in 1983.<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_unions_in_the_United_States#cite_note-Jan_24,_2014-1" target="_blank">[1]</a><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_unions_in_the_United_States#cite_note-oecdstat-2" target="_blank">[2]</a> Union membership in the private sector has fallen under 7%<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_unions_in_the_United_States#cite_note-BLS01272012-3" target="_blank">[3]</a>—levels not seen since 1932. From a global perspective, in 2016 the US had the <em>fifth lowest</em> trade union density of the 36 OECD member nations.</p>
<p>The academic literature shows <em>substantial evidence</em> that labor unions reduce economic inequality.<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_unions_in_the_United_States#cite_note-11" target="_blank">[11]</a> Research indicates that rising <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_income_inequality_in_the_United_States#Decline_of_unions" target="_blank">income inequality in the United States</a> is partially attributable to the decline of the labor movement and union membership.</p>

<p>Edit:Private planes used surplus WW1 and homemade bombs. The Army Air Corp provided surveilance. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Blair_Mountain?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">From Wiki of the Battle of Blair Mountain</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Private planes were hired to drop homemade bombs on the miners. A combination of gas and explosive bombs left over from World War I were dropped in several locations near the towns of Jeffery, Sharples and Blair. At least one did not explode and was recovered by the miners; it was used months later to great effect as evidence for the defense during treason and murder trials. On orders from General Billy Mitchell, Army bombers from Maryland were also used for aerial surveillance.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Current unions today are still bringing in balanced benefits when working with a company. I work in a closed shop style, you get hired, you get into the Union model. We are under extreme work load this time of year and regulations used to be 60 hour workweek max. Last contract opened up the option for a 70 hour workweek, however, this had to be approved on a week by week basis, and the company had to go to the Union to request it. The Union only says yes if it is justifiable. And the benefit for the worker came into the picture as for regular overtime was paid at 1.5x pay rate for the 40th to the 60th hour, and when approved, the 60th to the 70th hour are paid at 2x pay rate. </p>
<p>Had a Union not been in place in this situation, the company may have the option to force work over 60 without the additional benefit to the worker.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Something you didn't really mention is OSHA and safety standards, which also came about because of unions.<br />
Before we had safety standards and fire codes, people died in fires and industrial accidents all the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being from Canada, the closed shop model sounds strange because you called it extreme, but that's actually the norm for unions here. It obviously applies per department or job level.</p>
<p>What I find weird is that in some parts of the world, you can have union members and none union members working along side. It's not an all or none situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was the case for some unions in the US too until very, very recently. </p>
<p>A recent supreme court decision <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_v._AFSCME" target="_blank">Janus</a> v. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3mw49mk_x0" target="_blank">AFSCME</a> forbade that arrangement. </p>
<p>It's kind of fucked up since the union, once present at a workplace, is legally obliged to bargain for everyone regardless of membership. Before, the union could take an administrative fee from nonmembers to supplement their finances. After Janus, they cannot take that administrative fee anymore, but they're still left with the legal duty and obligation to bargain for everyone.</p>
<p>This'll lead to a spike in freeloading, since people who don't or can't afford union dues are now simply not going to pay. Why should they, they get the same benefits. The downside is that once the union represents less than half the workforce, the employer can move to have it removed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Japan unions work a little differently. While in the west unions are typically comprised of workers from a particular industry, in Japan they're for the company. Everybody at the  company from a bricklayer to VP of sales is in the union, and the union fights for <em>the company</em>, not the workers. Believing that what's good for the company is good for the worker. </p>
<p>Modern westernized unions are appearing, but they're far from the norm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean I'm as unionist as they come but you'd agree the two extremes are &quot;everyone is in a union&quot; and &quot;no one is in a union&quot; and that therefore it is simply a statement of fact,</p>
<p>I have to say, coming from the UK, I don't find it particularly weird that some employees are in a voluntary political association and others aren't. I feel like what's happened in Canada is that the union has become so much more than the voluntary political association it started out as - and as with all bloat there are pros and cons to that</p></div>		</li>
