			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh that actually makes a lot of sense. So basically the energy from the exhaust is used up while turning the driveshaft like the thermal energy in a cars engine is used pushing the pistons. Thank you friend!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. It's actually the fan at the front of your car that pulls it along...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Semi-related trivia, but some F1 cars used to have its exhaust blowing at its diffuser (wing on bottom of car), this sped up the air going through the diffuser and produced more downforce with more RPMs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) the more efficient the design the less 'push' out the exhaust and more and more energy to turning the rotors = fuel effeciency.</p>
<p>2) See NOTAR.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOTAR" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOTAR</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this passenger jets  use turbofans theses day. Basically you put a turbine that turn the big blade at the very front. With only about 8 to 9% of the air it pulls in making it to the combustion chamber. The rest bypasses the combustion chamber and provides up to 70% of the thrust.</p></div>		</li>
