<p>Survivorship bias is partly to blame, but a lot of planned obsolescence and corner cutting has happened in the meantime too. Things are rarely designed to outlast their warranties these days because manufacturers cottoned on to the idea that BIFL wasn't as good for the bottom line as selling the same thing to the same customer every few years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes of course. That's why I put a big PARTIALLY true on there. It's a non-perfect analogy but there is some survivorship bias, in a context people can hopefully relate to more than cave paintings.</p>
<p>But yes things were built more to last then than now. The bias is thinking <em>everything</em> from then lasted because we have quite a few things from then still working now. The majority didn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean that's true but future archaeologists will have a ton to work with when investigating our society.  We may not build to last, but we make a lot of trash that doesn't biodegrade and then bury it in landfills.  They'll be a gold mine for future archaeologists  (that is if literal gold miners don't dig them up first for trace gold in the electronics)</p></div>		</li>
