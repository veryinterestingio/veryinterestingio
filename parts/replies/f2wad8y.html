			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. Never had a physics class in school. Opted for bio/anatomy. Is 30% more gravity something that humans born on earth could eventually adapt to or would it be too taxing to live on for any long duration of time?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Constant, it would be bad for your bones and joints and put strain on your heart but probably no worse than being very obese and unfit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any insight as to the effects if someone were born on Kepler 442b and experienced the 30% more gravity as a constant from birth? Could humans adapt to it or would it need to be an adaptation that takes place over generations similar to evolution?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not even very obese. An healthy man at an average 5'9&quot; height is roughly 160 pounds. 1.34x gravity would make him roughly 215 pounds. That's techinically obese, but not by a lot (31.8 bmi). Not enough to be what you'd picture as an extremely obese person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's all hypothetical. We simply don't know what the long-term effects would be. Experiments of up to 1.5gs over a week didn't have any effects, but there hasn't been much real long-term study on this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm... I know humans can withstand a certain amount of g-force before passing out due to blood not being able to be pumped to the brain. I assume that threshold is more than 1.3x earth’s gravity. I’m also curious as to how it would affect joints and cartilage wear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The radius being 1.34x Earth's results in the density being almost identical to Earth's which makes it a plausible estimate</p></div>		</li>
