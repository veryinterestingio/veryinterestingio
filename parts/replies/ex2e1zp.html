			<div class="markdown"><p>Conversely, if you are overweight and older, your body will use more energy as it begins to exercise, because it is heavier and less efficient. Yes, you will gain efficiency over time, however it's still going to be very effective to begin exercising from a sedentary lifestyle as an adult. </p>
<p>Furthermore, there is a lot of recall bias here. People think they ate so much back in the day and they were still skinny, but studies of skinny people have found that by and large, they are NOT big eaters with huge metabolisms, they simply don't eat as much. Individual variation in metabolism is a lot less important than variation in lifestyle and eating behavior. Many teens skip meals, sleep very long, eat bizarre diets, exercise a lot, and this may be interpreted as a wildly different baseline metabolism.  </p>
<p>Lastly, I will say that one of the main reasons people are fatter as they age is because of time. If you're adding 1 pound a year from age 13 onwards (assuming height is constant from there), you'll be 5 pounds overweight at 18 but 35 pounds overweight at 48.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As I get older I see this all around me - that cumulative effect of a little weight gain over many years.  I work hard to maintain my weight because I know it would be a hell of a lot harder to lose a bunch right now than to simply eat well, keep moving and maintain a healthy weight.  It may sound obvious, but there is an entire diet/lifestyle industry out there betting against people doing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotally, I've seen a fair number of skinny people that claim to eat big, and it's true. But it's not everyday. Typically during the week they eat next to nothing, then on Saturday and/or Sunday they eat ONE big meal. Or when they go out to eat, which is rarely, they eat big then. </p>
<p>But it's never a constant thing. As a big guy myself, I've never been out eaten by any smaller guy that says they can. Typically they don't even get remotely close.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish others people realized this. I'm 5'6, 140 lbs, and 14% body fat. I'm 17, and stopped growing 2 years ago, so growth isn't a factor. I certainly CAN eat BIG (5,000 calories in 30 mins, easily), but as you said, I only really do that when I go to McDonald's, which isn't often. Because of this, everyone around me at school, for example, thinks I'm just a &quot;bottomless pit&quot; with a &quot;fast metabolism&quot; as if I possess some sort of physics-defying magic that keeps me in shape. It annoys the hell out of me. I put the work in, and I'm fit because of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A fair number people who think they're not eating a lot are actually snacking quite a bit without thinking about it. Also, the physical size of a meal doesn't necessarily correlate into how many calories it contains. It doesn't take a whole lot of candy and fried food to add up to an awful lot of calories, especially if the person eating it isn't thinking about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another factor is general decline in strength+fitness as you get older, both from physiological as well as lifestyle changes (kids/job/life happens). In crude terms, after your primary growth phase during your teens, you enter into a “if you don’t use it, you lose it” phase. For those that do fall behind, that decreased overall muscle and fitness means that calorie expenditure when you do exercise is much smaller for the amount of perceived work you put in. For example, I’ve stayed pretty fit so far in life (only mid 30s right now), mostly through a high volume of exercise. If I go for a bike ride in the morning, it isn’t difficult to burn a few thousand calories over a few hours and then continue on with the rest of my day. For someone that doesn’t have a good base and is trying to get back, that many calories would either take 2-3x as long to burn due to general output being significantly lower, or would be flat out unrealistic for how much stress it would put on their body. Bottom line: being fit makes it a LOT easier to stay fit (one reason why I give huge props to anyone who is able to progress from non-fit to fit).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also dont forget that as people age, they tend to have a large decrease in muscle mass. Less muscles = less energy usage. I know you alluded to it, but I just wanted to say it as black and white.</p></div>		</li>

<p>the path of greatest efficiency</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anecdotal: i have to throw 10kg bags about 20ft for three hours, twice a day, as part of my daily tasks at work. I keep telling new starters that it's quicker and easier in the long-run to stand still and hoon the bags one at a time than it is to pick up two bags, walk them 20ft then walk back again. Nobody believes me, and they get tired after the first hour or so.</p>
<p>I've been doing this for a couple of years. It got to the point where i'd throw back-handed with my non-dominant hand, as it was less efficient and slowed me down for the sake of my colleagues. Now i can bowl left-handed as well as i can right-handed. My build hasn't changed at all - i'm still lanky and scrawny - but now i'm an old man and my work rate is higher than guys half my age purely because my body has found the path of greatest efficiency.</p></div>		</li>
