<p>I'm very glad that you said this. I have nothing against massages, my wife swears by them (she visits a therapist). They help her a lot, she <em>feels</em> great after having them, but there is no completing <em>scientific</em> evidence to what really happens and how it's fixed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. Studies have shown that patients get relief from massages. Yes. Same with chiropractic Care. </p>
<p>However, to the original post, no, science hasn't shown anything about &quot;knots&quot; and how massage fixes them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any source on science saying massages work? Having listened to a lot of medical, physio and training podcasts, videos etc there is no great evidence of what a muscle knot is or that massages do anything at all</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an interesting point, and I think it's important to note that you can have valid evidence of efficacy without evidence of mechanism (that is, when it comes to medicine, we can know that something works without knowing how it works).  </p>
<p>Doctors knew aspirin was effective for over a hundred years before it's mechanism was discovered in 1971.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This should be the top answer. It's like answering &quot;what does a chiropractic adjustment do?&quot;. </p>
<p>No one KNOWS scientifically whether the question is even a valid one, much less the answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The muscle contraction that causes the knot to form is stuck in a loop. Unconsciously your body thinks it needs to keep the contraction going and isn’t able to break out of it. Blood flow is important but what releases the knot is compression and cross fiber friction. I believe it works as a signal to the muscle spindles that they are too tight and need to return to normal. What keeps the knots coming back is posture and habits throughout the day. For ex) I can release the same area over and over again but if you don’t change how you sit in your chair at work or how you sleep curled up then they will keep coming back.</p></div>		</li>
