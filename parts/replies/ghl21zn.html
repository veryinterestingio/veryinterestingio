			<div class="markdown"><p>This. People who speak to the media / press on a regular basis have a sense for which reporters will faithfully convey their message. Trusted reporters use direct quotes in the correct context, and bad reporters will get the message wrong through incompetence, malice, or bias. I once had a reporter quote me indirectly in a way that put words in my mouth the exact opposite from what I had actually said! I called his supervisor and informed him that they better not send that guy to interview me ever again, that I would refuse to speak to him. They honored my request and assigned a cub reporter right out of school, and she was great, a good listener and she always used direct quotes and managed to correctly convey what I was saying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A long time ago (80s and 90s) I was a spokesperson for a well-regarded community nonprofit organization that was involved in a handful of antipoverty initiatives, including the first homeless shelter in our city, and the founding of a nationally-affiliated regional foodbank. I was interviewed for local newspaper and radio on a regular basis, I kind of had a knack for giving them pithy and printworthy quotes.</p></div>		</li>

Every time an incident, in the biz called “A Close Shave,” happens, he is bombarded with interview requests.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don’t need to be a politician or city worker or something like that to get interviewed often.</p>
<p>I work in environmental conservation as the director of a small NGO and am asked to do a lot of interviews for print and TV.</p>
<p>I know folks in other industries that get interviewed often as well.</p>
<p>Once you’ve been interviewed once and if it went well (the interviewer found it easy to work with you, your information was solid and well represented, the article/episode was heavily engaged with, etc) word spreads and you’re likely to be contacted by other journalists in the future.  It can become a pretty regular thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's weird to me how some journalists will misquote sources and not expect it to come back to bite them when there are two obvious solutions: voice memo and similar apps and the simple question: &quot;can I repeat back to you what I think you meant, just so I'm sure I've got this right?&quot; Saves a ton of trouble later on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure the &quot;off the record&quot; being honored has a lot to do with what you say afterward.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Off the record, I think that this guy that blew himself up was a wacko, but I just don't know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>vs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Off the record, we don't like serving black people at our restaurant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One will definitely be honored, one will not.</p></div>		</li>

<p>if you do make an agreement and the reporter goes back on their agreement, there are no legal repercussions</p>

<p>It depends:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen_v._Cowles_Media_Co" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen_v._Cowles_Media_Co</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dan Cohen, a Republican associated with Wheelock Whitney's 1982 Minnesota gubernatorial run, provided inculpatory information on the Democratic challenger for Lieutenant Governor, Marlene Johnson, to the Minneapolis Star Tribune and St. Paul Pioneer Press in exchange for a promise that his identity as the source would not be published. Over the reporters' objections, editors of both newspapers independently decided to publish his name. Cohen consequently lost his job at an advertising agency. He sued Cowles Media Company, who owned the Minneapolis Star Tribune.</p>
<p>In 1988, a jury of six found in Cohen's favor. The Minnesota Supreme Court reversed. The United States Supreme Court, while refusing to reinstate the damages, remanded the case to the Minnesota Supreme Court, which reinstated the jury's original verdict of $200,000.</p>
<p>The Cowles Media Company was found liable based on a theory of promissory estoppel.</p>
