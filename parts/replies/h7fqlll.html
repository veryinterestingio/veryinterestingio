<p>Keep in mind that the data that you're looking at is collected by VAERS, which is a voluntary self-reporting online tool.</p>

<p>On this note, here's a guy who successfully submitted a report to VAERS that the Flu vaccine transformed him into The Hulk: </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130419004549/http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/14/chelation-autism" target="_blank">The chief problem with the VAERS data is that reports can be entered by anyone and are not routinely verified. To demonstrate this, a few years ago I entered a report that an influenza vaccine had turned me into The Hulk. The report was accepted and entered into the database.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130419004549/http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/14/chelation-autism" target="_blank">Because the reported adverse event was soâ€¦ unusual, a representative of VAERS contacted me. After a discussion of the VAERS database and its limitations, they asked for my permission to delete the record, which I granted. If I had not agreed, the record would be there still, showing that any claim can become part of the database, no matter how outrageous or improbable.</a></p>

<p>It is most definitely not voluntary for healthcare providers.</p>
<p>They are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/hcproviders/reportingadverseevents.html" target="_blank">required by law to report</a> serious adverse effects to VAERS after COVID-19 vaccination.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The providers wouldn't be a self report though. You as an individual person can sign up to self report and they will send you periodic surveys that you fill in about how you're feeling. Its not even just severe effects, it even asks about more minor ones toovlike redness or soreness at injection site. Id imagine a lot of that data (if its saying 60+% had adverse effects) is most going to be those more minor adverse effects.</p></div>		</li>
