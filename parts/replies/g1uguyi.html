			<div class="markdown"><p>It may be that what you actually like isn't the game, but the novelty of the game... exploring something new, figuring something out, wondering about what will happen next.   Once you've played it enough to have a good sense of how it works, the novelty you liked isn't there anymore, so it no longer has anything you like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very possible. It only applies to video games, and usually after the first two or three days. It's unusual and annoys the heck out of me.</p>
<p>I'll be more mindful of your post and will remain more cognizant of my feelings toward the game at varying stages of satisfaction with a game. That was a terrible run-on sentence but it'll have to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been the exact same for years now. I'll play the hell out of a game for a couple of days, then come home from work one day really excited to play... And it just won't click. And I'll never play that game again. It's really frustrating some times. I've started gaming a lot less now because I know any new game I get into I'll be over in a week. I'm 31 and only have a handful of games I've spent over 100 hours on. I've never understood people who finish game after game, or spend thousands of hours on the same one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A long work week and additional ‘spare time’ responsibilities did this to me. </p>
<p>I think I enjoyed the escapism of gaming, and I could quite easily finish a 30 hour game in 1 or 2 sittings. </p>
<p>Now? I have to be aware of my phone at all times. I have work commitments I need to fulfil before that deadline tomorrow. I have a billion more things swimming around my head to the point I can’t immerse myself anymore, and the mechanics of whichever game I’m playing just seem like another list of chores. </p>
<p>Weirdly, embracing the ‘chore’ ideology, I picked up Animal Crossing - bite size enough for 5 minute sessions, you can’t die, if I put my switch down to take a call, worst I’ll miss is a balloon. It’s kinda reminded me what I enjoyed about gaming, and pulled me away from the Skinner box ‘grind fest’ games I’d ended up mired in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bingo! I'm 32 and it's been this way for only a few years. It's so weird. I had thousands of hours on d2, wow, runescape.. Single player games like need for speed underground 2, etc.</p>
<p>It's such a weird experience to be playing a game for 2 days, turn it on then think 'ehh..' then off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm 43 and there's a bit of Danny Glover in me that's getting too old for this shit. Especially recycled or bad game designs, like JRPG tropes. Something has to be done really well for me to take notice. That being said, I will finish games to get closure. I have lots of stuff to do or play, but I just don't get stoked about anything like I used to. I'm way more focused on children now, largely because they can learn much more quickly than me. Their lives will change massively in the next five years. If I can fight of certain entropy in the next five years of my life, I'll declare victory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've spend so much money on games that I never finish. It's absurd. It's the same cycle, see advertisement on game. Game look freaking awesome. Great reviews, check. Ok I'll get it.  Play for a few days, then either one of three things happen. Get bored of the game, intending to come back to it but never do. Get to part in the game that is tedious, stop playing with the intend of coming back later but never do. I ask myself that question, &quot;do I really like this game?&quot;.  Lastly, in the rare occasion I really do like the game and keep playing but this is rare, like 1 in 5.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is somewhere in the question that you ask yourself. I get the same in another situation. I do a lot of idea development and enjoy exploring the ideas. The moment I explain my idea to others I somehow loose interest. It is like the thought process is enough and when I explain or plan how to do it from a to z I loose interest because from now on it it &quot;just&quot; a job to be done. I am so aware about it now so I avoid talking about ideas I love to explore. Crazy, I know.</p></div>		</li>
