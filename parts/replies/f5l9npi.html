			<div class="markdown"><p>So far you're the only one who answered the question. Everyone else seems to be explaining WHY an &quot;equivalent&quot; standard even exists (saying that methane traps a lot of heat, is weird, we need a standard, co2 is it etc.), still not explaining in WHAT SENSE.  Standard with regard to what?! Volume? Mass? Greenhouse effect? How much it heats up the Earth? What?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a scientist but I think mass would be the appropriate measurement as it measure the amount of matter/atoms regardless of weight, volume or pressure. I can point you to the Global Warming Potential / GWP of a gas which measures how much a given mass of a gas would warm the earth over a fixed time through the greenhouse effect. There should be a precise definition of that somewhere.</p>
<p>CO2 has a GWP of 1 and methane is 25</p></div>		</li>
