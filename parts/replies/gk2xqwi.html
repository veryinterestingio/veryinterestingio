			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't tested out my cold sensors yet, but I recently discovered that my legs feel much less heat than other parts of my body. I tried blowing a hair drier on my thighs, and I hardly felt any heat, but when I blew it on my stomach or my face, I felt the hot heat instantly. It was a pretty interesting experiment finding out which parts of my body are more sensitive to heat.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you expose your skin for too long or if you go too close to your skin you rsik burns. Putting it down and leaving it turned on will set stuff on fire, too...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a bunch of nerve damage, especially on my back and feet, it's weird having showers where I feel hot water on my body except for in spots where I just feel nothing but like it's all scattered about, like 45% of my back feels nothing and 65% is totally normal.</p></div>		</li>

<p>compare it to touching your lips with that same ice cube,</p>

<p>because another ice cube might be hotter thus ruining the comparisson?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, yes. The maximum temperature of water ice (in a &quot;normal&quot; pressure environment) is 0 degrees, it's temperature can be lower though...</p>
<p>you have one freezer set to -5C and another freezer set to -20C, an ice cube from freezer no2 will of course be colder, therefore one could say <em>&quot;ice cube from freezer no1 is hotter than ice cube from freezer no2&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>Ice is not limited to 0C!</p></div>		</li>
