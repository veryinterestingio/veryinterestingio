			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been several years since my Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma diagnosis, so I could be a little off. This could also be specific to NHL. </p>
<p>Stage 1: you have a tumor</p>
<p>Stage 2: you have multiple tumors on one half of your body (the belly button is the Half way line)</p>
<p>Stage 3: you have multiple tumors on both halves of your body.</p>
<p>Stage 4: it's in your bone marrow</p>
<p>Personally I caught my cancer quick and only had 1 tumor, but they found traces in my bone marrow so I jumped from Stage 1 straight to Stage 4. Got 3 extra chemo treatments and called it a day. Been in remission for 4 years.</p>
<p>PSA time: Please check your body for lumps, both men and women. And not just on your balls and boobs. My Lymphoma was in the middle of my bicep of all places. My Oncologist had 30 years in the game and had never seen start in a bicep. My lump went from a bug bite to a golf ball in a few weeks. If I ignored it he said I'd probably be nearly dead in a few months. Luckily I got it checked early and killed the fuck out of that cancer.</p>
<p>Bonus fun fact: none marrow biopsys fucking hurt like hell. You can't numb bone and they literally hand drill a hallow needle into your hip. That's not even the bad part. You know how when you drink a milkshake and something clogs the straw so you pull harder and the straw collapse? You get to experience that feeling (without the collapse).</p>
