			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on, despite good evidence suggesting it is a real post-viral syndrome, the existence of genuine ME/CFS was doubted by many in the medical community (not for good reasons, mind you) for a long time. Something that has gone a long way to changing this however, is the unfortunate induction of an ME/CFS-like state in patients in large RCTs treated with high doses of interferons, a family a cytokines that fundamentally underpin antiviral immunity and induce many of the acute behavioral manifestations of viral infection, including acute fatigue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I was originally pursuing a degree to specialise in autoimmune disease but had the fortunate opportunity to work under a team specialising in antiviral immunodeficiency and abnormal antiviral responses for my dissertations. There is increasing evidence for a link between a set of diseases called “interferonopathies” and autoimmune diseases like SLA. It’s very interesting to see an interferon component being implicit in both immune dysregulation like autoimmune / autoinflammatory conditions and also antiviral responses. This link is interesting because we know the drug Rintatolimod was fairly successful for CFS in double blind clinical trials (potentially the only drug that made it this far with promising results for CFS) and as an RNA based drug seems to act on the interferon signalling pathway to kickstart something that improves patient symptoms with CFS. Theres also a much higher incidence of autoimmune disease with people who have CFS compared with the general population. There’s a weird link here where I can’t fully see the bigger picture but I swear we are onto something and I hope I can push my own research into this direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't plan to make any sudden forays into CFS research so here's a stress neurobiology perspective: my personal belief is that one of the core, evolutionarily conserved purposes of neuroimmune crosstalk is in bidirectional signaling of metabolic demands and resource availability, both in the context of infection but also is normal life/behavior without any significant and explicit immunological aspect. My guess as to the substrate here is interferon-mediated reprogramming of T-cells or perhaps monocytes prior to their invasion of the CNS. Trafficking of T-cells into the CNS appears to regulate not only things like neurodegenerative disorders but also behavior in otherwise healthy animals (e.g. see recent paper on transfer of anxious phenotype between animals via T-cells, and older papers wrt memory, neurogenesis, etc). It would also be interesting to do metabolomics of amino acids, derivatives, related metabolites in these patients. I imagine that has a role in whatever immunometabolic reprogramming is occurring, even moreso than cytokines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know that this is not proven yet, but is Fatigue Syndrome thought to be &quot;caused by a virus&quot; in the sense of maybe one day &quot;scientists have now discovered <em>the virus</em> that causes Fatigue Syndrome&quot; ?</p>
<p>Or is it more that  Fatigue Syndrome is a thing that happens sometimes after infections with some different viruses? Possibly fairly common ones? Is &quot;Long Covid&quot; related?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have ME/CFS (Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome). </p>
<p>It can be caused by any virus, a common one is EBV (mono), but the virus I had was just a flu. Long covid is definitely seeing a percentage developing me/cfs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The latest theory for ME/CFS is the metabolic trap hypothesis.  Usually a virus causes onset and the body can't return to normal function afterwards.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The latter. The most common cause for CFS is a trigger from Epstein Barr Virus infection (mononucleosis / glandular fever) but other viruses have been implicated in onset of the disease. Apparently even chronic stress and burnout has been linked to the condition. My bet is that CFS is a mix of immune dysfunction / poor antiviral response and metabolic issues. There has been evidence for all three. CFS is closely linked to autoimmune disorders (rate of incidence for autoimmune disease in people with CFS diagnosis is far higher than the general population), the Epstein Barr virus trigger suggests poor reaction to viral infection combined with links to immune dysregulation / autoimmunity and there has also been recent evidence from Stanford suggesting metabolic issues with immune cells. All point to a poor immune function and consequential reaction to a strong stimulus (virus / stress) that further propagates this dysregulation out of whack.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got a nasty cut and got a tetanus vaccine for it a couple years ago. A couple weeks later, my POTS and other dysautonomia issues flared up really badly for the first time (I’d had mild issues prior, but this fully disabled me for more than a month). </p>
<p>It was far better than getting tetanus, but my running theory is that the combination of physical/immune stresses on my body, plus a couple big emotional stressors at the same time basically hit me hard enough that my body couldn’t properly recover from them. It took going on short term disability, starting a medication to increase my blood pressure and stop the acute drops, and physical therapy to retrain the autonomic system that was failing me the worst (ventricular-ocular reflex) to get back to semi-normal. At this point I take the blood pressure increases as-needed, but any major injury I have makes my disautonomia flare up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep thats all it takes. And POTS is trash, mines from my thyroid. Im glad youre in a better place but Im also sorry for the fact you have POTS. Hope youre doing well weather is trash</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oof, I had oculomotor difficulties for almost a year due to a concussion. It’s hard to take a shower when you have to keep your eyes open the entire time or you’ll fall over. Getting soap in your eyes isn’t fun. I hope you’re doing better now. Physical therapy cured it for me, though my left temple still aches randomly on occasion.</p></div>		</li>
