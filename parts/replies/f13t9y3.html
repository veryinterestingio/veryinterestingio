			<div class="markdown"><p>Due to the wave nature of light, there is an absolute lower limit on the angular resolution of imaging optics that is imposed by the aperture of the instrument, not the &quot;pixels&quot; in the detector. It's an issue caused by diffraction patterns in the image that obscure the source information. For a circular aperture, the formula is</p>
<p>Θ = 1.22 x λ/D</p>
<p>Where Θ is the angular resolution of the instrument, λ is the wavelength of light that you are focusing, and D is the diameter of the aperture.</p>
<p>This means that there is a lower limit on the angular distance between two points of light that can be resolved (distinguished) by an instrument. This is called the resolving power of the instrument, and it has nothing to do with the detector (pixels) that record the image. It's all dependant on the wavelength of incident light and the diameter of the aperture.</p>
<p>As an example, you are unable to notice with the naked eye that the north star is, in fact, two stars because the diameter of your pupil is too small to resolve the double. You can easily resolve them with a pair of binoculars, though. It happens that Polaris is a triple, a fact not discovered until 1929 by analyzing the spectrum of light from the system.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Resolution is how close two things have to be in order for you to no longer be able to tell that there are two objects there.</p>
<p>In the case of a telescope, you point the telescope at some angle. How precisely can you determine the angle of an object you're looking at?</p>
<p>If you see two objects 1 degree apart, can you tell that you have two objects, or will it look like one combined object? What about 0.1 degrees? Or 0.01 degrees? The minimum is your angular resolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add, basically, objects look &quot;big&quot; or &quot;close&quot; when their edges are at large angles from your eyes. Push you face against a wall and it looks infinitely big because the edges are perpendicular to the direction of your vision. Back away and it gets smaller as the relative angle between the center of your view and the edges of the wall shrinks. Eventually that angle gets so small that the object effectively disappears.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hold a dime close and a quarter further away and they will look the same size.   And a manhole cover even further away will look the same size.  Those three objects at those different distances have the same angular size. </p>
<p>Angular resolution is the minimum angular size at which two things can be resolved as separate objects rather than blurring into one mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not any traditional telescope we currently have, but an interferometer could do it. The most powerful optical interferometer on Earth is the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHARA_array?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">CHARA Array</a> in California, with an angular resolution of 200 microarcseconds. At the distance to the Moon, that translates to a resolution of 1.22 feet.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: Yes, we can do it, but there's only one facility on Earth with the capability. The cool thing is that anyone can apply for time on this telescope, so you could go on their website and actually ask them to do this experiment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, interferometers of this kind need some sort of point source to “lock onto”. The surface of the moon is an extended object, but if the astronauts put a laser on the moon as they landed and pointed it towards CHARA, then a slight perhaps?</p></div>		</li>
