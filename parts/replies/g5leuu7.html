			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it be reasonable to say that effective public health measures make it harder to determine the effectiveness of the vaccine, since you have to wait longer to get a sufficient sample size?  And would it then make sense for these vaccine studies to be performed in areas that are experiencing a surge in COVID cases?</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The company, which is enrolling 30,000 participants in a late-stage clinical trial, had hoped it might have interim results in October, Bancel said. But a slight decline in the average number of coronavirus cases in the country recently has made it harder to reach the minimum number of infections among participants to assess whether the vaccine works better than a placebo.</p>
<p>“The infection rate has slowed down the last two weeks, which is great for the country, but the readout in October becomes less and less probable,” he said. “We’ve said November,’’ he added, and if the infection rate slows down further, “it could be December.”</p>

<p>That was a particular concern for the UK Oxford vaccine trail, since they started their phase 3 as transmission seemed to be damping down in the UK. They responded by adding higher-risk regions (like Brazil) to their trial. </p>
<p>In the US, as the quote above shows, the change in transmission isn’t so great that the trial is at risk, just may be delayed a little. </p>
<p>A few years ago, the phase 3 trial of an Ebola vaccine ended up not quite getting as much statistical confidence as they had hoped, because the vaccine was deployed as the epidemic was coming under control for other reasons. They were still able to get decent answers to the main questions, though</p></div>		</li>

<p>If another ebola outbreak were to occur now, would they be able to resume the vaccine trial in phase 3, or would they need to start at square-one?</p></div>		</li>

<p>If the vaccine works you will know soon and if it doesn't work you will know that soon too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  That is why they select test areas which are high in cases, and those areas are often outside the US.   I have seen articles that try to spin this into a racist theme, but for testing you want areas where there are high positives and for the vaccine to be safe across all people, not just one group.   Until reading more about it, I did not realize how complex the process is.  It is not like giving medicine to someone you know is sick to see if it works.  Vaccines are given the healthy people and then statics are used to determine if viewer then expected go sick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, that's a very clear explanation. Is there a probability figure for the confidence that efficacy has been determined with 151 cases? In other words, when they say, &quot;high confidence&quot;, that is what, 90%?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually hard to say without looking at their data. There is a statistical value called power, which is used to assess how confident they are in their findings. But that can only calculated iteratively, which requires a program to do. Generally results are only acceptable if power is &gt; 80%, but that level of confidence will vary by how stringent you need your data to be. In clinical trials, they usually want a bare minimum of 90% power.</p>
<p>You can get a rough idea of what your power might be if you have an estimate of your results (one of the purposes of phase I/II studies). To increase power, you can increase sample size. So biostatisticians will run a simulation to figure out the minimum number of patients needed to achieve that power. For clinical trials that regularly ends up being in the thousands because the types of circumstances described in the other comments and because data from humans are super noisy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the year. I recall one recent year, the Northern hemisphere flu region vaccine was only 29% effective. And as high as nearly 70% effective. I believe the low year was 2012 (top lazy to pull up the CDC data.) Because each year there are hundreds of different flu strains and the immunologists need to essentially guess which will be the most dominant strains for the flu season 6 months in advance in order for production to produce enough doses for the population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These are great questions!</p>
<p>With regards to the flu vaccine, you must consider both morbidity (getting sick from a disease) and mortality (dying from a disease) when evaluating effectiveness. The goal of the flu vaccine is not only to decrease the incidence of flu, but also to decrease hospitalizations and death by flu. Many years, the annual flu vaccines aren't so good at keeping people from catching the flu, but they are good at decreasing the severity of the symptoms and keeping people from dying. </p>
<p>Secondly, while we typically like to see efficacy rates above 80% to achieve herd immunity in a population, the context matters. For example, a malaria vaccine was just recently approved with a 30% efficacy rate. As malaria kills half a million people each year (often children under the age of 5), any protection is helpful. BCG, which is the vaccine given to protect against TB, is typically 70% effective, but because there is widespread drug-resistance to TB, it is given in areas where TB is endemic.</p></div>		</li>
