			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most underrated comment on Reddit right now. What have you got to lose with just starting something? Worst case scenario you actually are shit at it, and if you don't have the drive to continue learning, congratulations, you've found something you don't like, and that's completely fine. It's worth it for those moments where you realise you've found something you actually want to learn and you're properly passionate about it.</p>
<p>This goes for everything and everything, whether its cooking or football or learning the rubiks cube, or just becoming a more rounded person. Everything takes practice, and everything is a skill you can practice if you actually want to learn it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is such a great suggestion.  My problem is (maybe you have a great idea for that too), that since I have started doing that, I have learned that once I start doing something (e.g. one sentence) I am not going to stop, I'll probably write a good chunk of thing.  And you'd <em>think</em> that this is going to motivate me, but instead, when I think about writing the one sentence, my head goes &quot;but you <em>won't</em> just write the one sentence, you will <em>actually</em> write more, don't try to trick me&quot; and I end up doing nothing.  Ideas?  ... please?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe go for the 'shoot for the moon, you might still end up in the stars' mentality - ok; let's just fail out and <em>actually</em> just write one sentence then. F you brain!</p>
<p>You still wrote more than nothing, and beat both laziness AND your brain ;)</p></div>		</li>

<p>. . . and if that's all you do, good for you. I mean that 100% sincerely. A sentence is a start.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've found this to be very true. During this whole lockdown I've found it so hard to do anything productive, including university work.</p>
<p>Something that really helped was to list every single thing I had to do in the week/day, and break those tasks down into even smaller sub tasks.</p>
<p>I guess I tried breaking my todos into the smallest possible tasks that I had no opportunity but to complete them (for example, open my maths notebook). I found that once you start accomplishing tasks, it feels good and it's a positive feedback loop kinda thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds like a really great technique. The one I use is similar. Start with a list of all the stuff you need to do and then write down the next actionable task you need to do. A lot of the frustration about starting something is getting back in the mindset of what you need to do. If you know exactly what task you're trying to accomplish there is less resistance to start.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this! It's all about momentum I guess. Start doing easy things and it makes it easier to do the hard ones, simply because you're in that mindset.</p></div>		</li>
