			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that what it looks like?  I recently had a bit of food poisoning and eventually started to see a little bit of red, but I had strawberry frosted mini-wheats earlier in the day, so I wasn't sure if that's where the coloring came from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bright red (or frank) blood like you potentially saw generally indicates bleeding higher up, such as the esophagus or mouth. </p>
<p>Dark or black vomit or stool is blood that has been partially digested. This typically means bleeding in the stomach. It typically resembles coffee grounds.</p>
<p>You should see a doctor about bright red blood in your vomit or stool that is copious or persistent. You should go to the emergency room for black vomit or stool because of the potential for stomach perforation. </p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>
<p>Edit: It has occurred to me that I should mention that if you are a heavy drinker, particularly with suspected liver disease, bright red blood in your vomit can be from esophageal varices. If this applies to you, go to the ER.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends where the blood is coming from. If it’s the stomach (or further down the GI tract) it’s very dark, often described as “coffee grounds”. For comparison, bleeding from a tear in the oesophagus (can occur from frequent, intense vomiting) is likely to be a brighter red colour. But yes, red coloured food or drink can also give the impression of vomiting blood.</p></div>		</li>
