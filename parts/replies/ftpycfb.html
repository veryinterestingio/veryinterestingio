			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the opposite is true.  Veins get bigger and bigger as they move back towards the heart, and max IV flow rates follow those changes as you might expect (the bigger the tube, the more you can push in, more quickly).    </p>
<p>I imagine they were just administering a med in your hand that required a slow push.  There can be a lot of reasons why a particular med in a particular patient would require slow administration, but one of the most common is that many medications can irritate vessel walls.  Especially if it's being given through a small vein (like in the hand), if you don't administer those potentially caustic meds slowly you can cause some pretty significant problems...</p></div>		</li>
