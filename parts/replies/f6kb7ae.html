			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that is quite amazing to think about. I read about that when reading about some scientists who measured for any curvature in spacetime, and concluded that within the accuracy measured the universe is at least billions of times larger than the visible one. granted, of course, that we can actually interpolate what we know about the visible part to the rest. I find it quite baffling that the rest of the universe can indeed be different from our local region, no? It can be the same all over an infinite space, and that infinite space could still be infinite altough any finite part of it started out infinitisemal. But it could also be that, if you go trillions of light years away from the visible part, the laws of nature change. We cannot really ever know anything about that, can we?</p></div>		</li>
