<p>However, it's caused by the expectations of industry and the people who live in flood areas.</p>
<p>The insurance industry is going to, of course, fight to offload risks onto someone else. Money in politics ensures they get what they want more often than not.</p>
<p>Then there are people who invested in homes (or developments, looking to sell) in flood plains who demand low premiums, so they're on the side of the insurance company.</p>
<p>We're walking straight in to so many problems it's honestly one big joke at this point. Americans are incredibly entitled and short-sighted. Our systems continually bail out failing and harmful industries and offload the risk onto the tax-payer. Really, socialize the risk and privatize the gains.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Flood insurance is horrible. We recently went under contract on a beautiful, reasonably priced 4/2 1500 sqft house in a flood zone... It was high elevation but it was near, literally, a drainage ditch. No actual bodies of water for miles. </p>
<p>Looked at the mandatory flood insurance...  it was something along the lines of $500/month ($6000/year or so) for a very modest amount of insurance.</p>
<p>Half the living space, 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom, were in the (very nice) finished basement. </p>
<p>We discovered that this super-expensive flood insurance does not cover any belongings in the basement, and will not refinish the basement (literally half the living space of the house) if it gets flooded. </p>
<p>We terminated the contract based on the cost and terms of insurance. We realized that if we get a bad storm and the house floods, we lose half our house with no recourse. Just insane.</p>
<p>YSK flood insurance premiums and terms are set in stone by FEMA. Do NOT buy a house with a finished basement in a flood zone. Your basement and any personal belongings in the basement (beds, clothes, kids' toys, TVs, furniture, etc.) will not be insured, despite the fact you'll be paying out your rear end for insurance.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Massive amounts of water move through stormwater systems during heavy rain. A lot of flooding, even in areas of not zoned for flooding, is due to stormwater systems not being able to move that water fast enough. Hurricanes and tropical storms can overwhelm drainage, for example.</p>
<p>Of course, it doesn't help that people illegally dump their trash, brush, and lawn waste into ditches and storm drains.</p>
<p>(On a side note, there are some mosquitoes that will breed in any standing water in a ditch so you probably lucked out in not having one in your backyard.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>I’ve had situations where it’s very literally “my job” to assess a situation. And after providing proof in the form of data and calculations, people will remain unconvinced that things need to change.</p></div>		</li>
