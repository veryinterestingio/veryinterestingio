<p>And conversely the logic is during the cold winter seasons, low temperatures cause moisture to phase shift into ice, water vapor, etc. The winter months tend to have lower humidity.</p>
<p>When you cough a droplet into the air, the moisture from the droplet shifts to water vapor, leaving a smaller, lighter weight saliva droplet floating in the air for longer, which in this case is loaded to the brim with viable virus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are the survival rates for a virus in these conditions? I would imagine it could live for some time in a frozen state, but my thinking is also that it would die quicker than in normal conditions. I’m just a geoscientist, so my knowledge of this area is basically null.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah viruses can generally be preserved in cold conditions. The virus is itself a tiny lipid sack of RNA, so unless the sack breaks, etc; the virus will stick around. </p>
<p>Typically for scenarios like this we just think of everything statistically, not mechanistically because the particles exist in large numbers and calculating the outcome for each particle won’t make sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a virologist, but I took a pre med track before getting another bachelor's in nursing. I also worked with an infectious disease doc in an HIV clinic, dealt with ID stuff to various degrees. This is a great question, and it would be fascinating to look around for an in depth answer.</p>
<p>The factors: RNA virus vs DNA virus. Capsid structure, both the membranes of the virus, as well as the intramembrane proteins and the surface proteins.</p>
<p>RNA virus are more fragile than DNA virus. For reference look up how long Hep C can live on surfaces vs HIV. RNA viruses (HIV) can survive outside the body for a very short time until they aren't viable. Dna viruses are much more durable. Covid19 is an rna virus, but according to the CDC can survive on certain surfaces for up to 72 hours. But this one is different than others, and if I remember correctly there was an article about some structural differences in this  strain of coronavirus RNA from a structural standpoint.</p>
<p>The viral membrane and proteins (capsid) also lead to how long it can survive outside the body. Lots of variables there, and I'm not the best resource for that sort of information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We see about a 10X reduction in live virus with every freeze-thaw, but we do keep viruses frozen for long-term storage, just in 100s of small, single-use aliquots to minimize loss via freeze-thaws.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn’t high humidity= high water vapor concentration in the atmosphere though? So by your logic higher humidity means more virus should float in the air for longer?</p></div>		</li>

<p>This was exactly my layman suspicion back in 2011, when the CDC published a finding that human immune systems were not affected by cold temperatures. Everybody then said &quot;oh, cold weather's sole contribution to infection is by making people congregate indoors together so they transmit things more easily&quot;.</p>
<p>Perhaps cold temperatures don't suppress the immune system, but there are other reasons including the particulate stability reason you mentioned above, to stay where it's warmer. (Aside from just being uncomfortable from cold!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar to how rain clears the sky of pollution. If there is more additional water around the particles combine and fall down.</p>
<p>A disgusting example, in LA when it rains the skies are clear after and the world seems a little &quot;cleaner&quot;. However, the side effect is that it is completely unsafe to go surfing a couple days after rain because all of the pollution, living filth, sewage, etc wash out to sea and hang out in the surf. Surfers can get sick from swimming in this gross water.</p></div>		</li>
