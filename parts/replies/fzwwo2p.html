			<div class="markdown"><p>An educated guess is still a guess. It’s not the same as someone randomly guessing, but there is still a high degree of uncertainty when using techniques like this. I don’t envy the people who have to come up with data and protocols for the human sciences.</p>
<p>EDIT: I’m literally a scientist (geophysicist). I’m not saying don’t trust science. I’m saying that techniques where something is measured by proxy are inherently uncertain. I’m also saying I don’t envy the people who have to come up with these proxy methods, since it’s difficult and not something I have to do often in my field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We know things where there’s reliable data, everything else is basically a guess. We know #registered people, we know that not all people are registered and we suspect that we don’t even know of some people, so we take #known * suspected #unknown and that gives the number we use. The #unknown cannot be known, therefore it‘s a guess, a hopefully good guess, but a guess nonetheless, so when the result is based on a guess, it’s a guess. If we know we’re fairly accurate, it‘s an educated guess, but still a guess. So Tl;Dr: we guess</p>
<p>Ts;ns: we know our weaknesses and estimate how wrong we are and skew our data using our best guess based on decades or more of experience</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You want to know how many students are in your school. But there are 100 classrooms in your school and it would take too much time to go to every classroom and count every student.</p>
<p>So, instead, you randomly pick 10 classrooms and send them a note asking how many students are in that classroom. When they send their notes back, you add up all their answers and then multiply by 10 and say &quot;it won't be exactly right, but it's probably pretty close to the number of students in all 100 classrooms&quot;.</p>
<p>Sometimes you have other information that can help your guess. E.g., after lunch time, you can go through the cafeteria garbage cans and see how much garbage there is. If you're clever (and know a lot about garbage and eating habits), you can use that to help refine your guess as to how many students were eating lunch.</p></div>		</li>
