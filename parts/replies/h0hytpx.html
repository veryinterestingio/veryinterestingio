			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed with all of that, I'll just add on with my own information.</p>
<p>Most of these studies are spoken about with words such as &quot;May reveal&quot; or &quot;potential to indicate&quot; and etc. That's because millons of amazing experiments are conducted each day, but they are mostly &quot;novel&quot; or never done before. And while it is great to do a new experiment, we can't often just put something into the market because a single team of scientists found a certain result in their new experiment. It needs to be vetted by multiple teams. But no one really wants to do the same thing to see if it gets the same result. They want to do what will get them recognition and money.</p>
<p>The news media likes to talk about these new studies all the time because it's interesting and can be relatively easy content, but they RARELY follow-up when an old study was shown to use bad science, and to tell the audience that those weren't fair results.</p>
<p>That's something that I think should be changed. When a study was proven to be false/poorly done, and yet made waves in the public, it should be reported on.</p></div>		</li>
