			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you hit on something important, which is that modern religions that stretch back as far or almost as far back as the dead religions mentioned have the benefit of having been written down. Paper and eventually the printing press is a big reason why those religions are still religions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a major point to emphasize is that the majority of the scholars known about in the western world were followers of the abrahamic faiths. They believed their religion was true, and so cast doubt on every other one. Especially when a great many of them were priests themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, a lot would cast doubt on the faiths, but there was also some syncretism to make Christianity more palatable to northern pagans. Some Catholic saints are simply pagan gods integrated into the heavenly host so they could attract pagans without insisting their gods are false.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The contradictory nature of the scriptures of Abrahamic religions also gives them power. Those in the clergy can justify virtually any action by referring to the relevant passage. The OT/NT/Quran are extremely dry and difficult to read for the most part, which is why the vast majority who practice have never read them in their entirety. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, but most non-Abrahamic religions (living or dead) also have really contradictory elements.  It's the nature of the beast.  Life is complicated, morally and otherwise, so an instruction set that you can fit in a book is going to be pretty much non-comprehensive.  Stretching it out so that it applies to everything is going to involve some fairly intense calisthenics.  :-)</p>
<p>Naturally, this goes double for religions that have been around for a millennia or two.</p></div>		</li>
