			<div class="markdown"><p>in fact, i'd say, music is many languages. if you grow up with hearing and playing a certain music language you will understand it easily, where if you encounter an unfamiliar kind of music you might have to translate it into whatever music you best know.</p>
<p>so you can learn to jam (have a conversation) in a certain dialect or language by learning all the rules like you'd learn a language in school, or you might just listen very well and try to speak yourself (and probably make some funny mistakes) until it comes naturally. - or both of course</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d say music is universal but not a language at all. Languages have meaning. While music can convey emotion it does not convey meaning. Try asking “Where is the bathroom?” to another musician using a saxophone.</p>
<p>But yeah I agree with everything else.</p></div>		</li>
