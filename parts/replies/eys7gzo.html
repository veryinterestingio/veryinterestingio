			<div class="markdown"><p>I mostly drive my old pickup around these days, but I recall years in my dad's car learning that Front Right and Back Left was the window combination I wanted to get a breeze that flowed right through the car at maximum speed without blowing in my face.  Nice and cool, on those warm summer days.  Not hot, really... we didn't get many of those.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First car I had growing up I could roll the front windows down, but then if Iâ€™d just crack open the back windows it would create this vortex in the car and my hairs would start blowing in circles. Pointless but fun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't tell if serious, but ...with a vacuum cleaner? No amount of cabin airflow is going to remove the dust from the little nooks and crannies of a car's interior. You might just have to clean the bastard, sorry.</p></div>		</li>
