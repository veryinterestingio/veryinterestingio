			<div class="markdown"><p>We actually do have taste receptors in parts of the GI tract! They just don’t wire to our <em>conscious</em> perception of taste.</p>
<p>You at least have the same family of “sweet” receptors in there for sensing glucose concentrations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually not quite! Starches (though not cellulose) begin breaking down to some extent as soon as they make contact with saliva (the reaction is not fast/numerous enough to elicit a noticeable sweetness sensation), which continuous throughout the GI tract, to my knowledge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry for the pedantry but it's really anabolism (building up) and catabolism (breaking down) that both make up metabolism, which is defined as the set of all reactions that sustain life in the body</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Enzymes can do this, but that’s not what they’re for. They speed up reactions.</p>
<p>Essentially, they act at a staging area. The lock flys in and bonds to the enzyme in a specific way. </p>
<p>The key comes in and binds to the enzyme. Then, the lock comes in and either;
Slots itself right on the key, or
Bonds to the enzyme next to the key in a way that makes the key perfectly aligned and ready to be inserted into the lock.</p>
<p>So the enzyme makes reactions go by faster by making it easier for the reactants (the lock and key) to react.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, if you put a cracker or piece of bread in your mouth and let it soak, you’ll notice it begins to taste sweet. This is because your saliva is fully of amylase, an enzyme that begins the breakdown of complex carbs into simpler sugars. Once broken down, your recognize them as sweet!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true.  I do this when trying out a new grain for brewing.  The mashing process brings out natural amylases that will break down starches into shorter chained sugars that give the beer it's malty flavor.  Letting the grain sit in your mouth will give you an idea of the flavor profile before buying a whole batch's worth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It reminds me of a show I watched on Netflix called Chef vs Scientist or something like that. Where a scientist tried to outdo a chef in making various dishes. One of them was mashed potatoes. The scientist tried to skip the mashing part and use enzymes to break down the starch far better than you can ever do by hand. However the enzymes did too good and his mashed potatoes was as sweet as candy.</p></div>		</li>
