			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. The battery's plates touch and cause a short circuit which is usually what causes the explosions. The Samsung S7 was prone to it because it used curved batter plates that could easily touch to save space in the phone. The gasses that cause bloating also put pressure on the plates and can force touching leading to an explosion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When battery shorts, the main reaction occurs at full intensity, and since there's no useful work for the electricity, it gets all released as heat. This literally boils off the chemicals, the gases accumulate in the battery and rip it apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A secondary effect unrelated to the battery chemistry itself but that also affects battery time is the fact that due to increasing software complexity (unless you never update the OS/Apps maybe) the CPU is working harder (hence using more power) than on the day you got your phone so you are getting less battery life even if you get a new battery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tying in one more point, software is always getting more complicated and intensive. As is our use. Videos need higher bandwidth, apps are constantly calculating and sending data (thanks Google/Amazon), everything comes at a cost. I've had old devices that ran great, did an update, and the bloat (and ads) damn near killed their usability. At that point, you're supposed to go buy a new one.</p></div>		</li>
