			<div class="markdown"><p>The full answer is a little more complicated than that. people think of the immune system and an immune response to viruses as very binary thing. You have antibodies. They kill or not the virus. Right?</p>
<p>Well that's like saying all of law enforcement is beat cops. In reality, there's a lot going on. First of all, every one of us has different DNA, and some people will be less susceptible to a virus because of differently shaped or quantity of receptors for it. Also, past infections with similar pathogens confers some protection that can slow an infection. For example, people with prior infections of SARS demonstrated immunity to covid-19. There are four common coronaviruses in circulation that you probably contracted at some point. An infection from one 5 years ago might have given you just enough crossover protection to be asymptomatic while someone else who got it a year ago made different antibodies that are useless to it. In one study, they took a blood from 2019 that could not have been exposed to covid-19 and tested for t cell activity against the virus. In a fair number of the samples, they found such activity. In the case of covid-19, they even identified a specific gene that deals with interferon release. If you have one version of this, your body won't release interferon until very far into the infection and covid-19 is quite deadly even if you are young and healthy. They discovered this when two brothers both ended up on ventilators despite being young and healthy. </p>
<p>The truth is the immune system is extremely complicated with lots of tools in it's arsenal and the mechanics of viruses to invade cells is quite varied. Many infections are commonly asymptomatic. For example, hsv 1/2, CMV, west nile, and Zika are often asymptomatic or so mild you might mistake it for a hangover or allergies. </p>
<p>In the case of covid-19, the best data we have on asymptomatic rates is from iceland, but it's tricky because local infections with other viruses seems to matter. In one Midwest town, a food processing plant showed over 90% asymptomatic rates of covid-19 while in Iceland, it was shown to be 43%. In the USA, testing shows 20% asymptomatic rates, but it's likely we aren't testing many of them. On the diamond princess cruise, it was close to 50% and we were testing everyone on that. So it's incredibly likely that you can get this virus and have no idea while spreading it to others that may die from it. this is the main reason this virus has spread so much. If everyone was symptomatic, we very likely would have eliminated the virus already. This is why you need to practice social distancing and wear a mask. While you are fine, you might give it to someone that will die from it.</p>
<p>It's also why those storefronts buying all those temperature reading guns likely haven't stopped any infections.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a small sidenote, measuring forehead temperature is pointless as it doesn't indicate anything and depends heavily on environmental temperature.
You need to properly measure temperature but that's implausible for queues in front of a store when we look at accurate methods. Even if their weren't as many asymptomatic carriers.</p>
<p>Other diseases, such as the flu, also have asymptomatic carriers, just in much smaller percentages, Covid-19 just has an exceptionally high amount of asymptomatic carriers.</p>
<p>Although I agree with most of your explanation, I'm not convinced that even if the percentage of asymptomatic carriers was similar to other diseases that we would have necessarily tackled it. Keep in mind there's still a lack of understanding and scientific discussion about how the virus gets transmitted exactly. The transmission by aerosols was only properly proven in a laboratory set-up (at least last time I checked). Strong suspicions aren't proof, and evidence based on surveys is problematic for many reasons (people make a lot of mistakes when filling those in).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haven't stopped &quot;any&quot; infections is probably a stretch. People can walk around with low-grade fevers without knowing it. I agree it hasn't stopped asymptomatic transmission but the question of whether asymptomatic carriers shed at the same or lower rates as symptomatic carriers is still unanswered. So it probably hasn't made a huge impact but there is likely some impact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A question I've had since the start of the pandemic is how COVID (and probably many other viruses too) can be kept in check so well it doesn't present any symptoms, but is also present enough to spread so easily? It just seems crazy that both can be true. If the virus is so well-contained the body doesn't even bother with a fever or cough, how can there be enough of it to spread?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that both a fever and a cough are symptoms your body creates to protect itself.</p>
<p>A cough will exist when your body detects stuff in the throat or lungs that it wants to remove.</p>
<p>A fever is a high-risk move to help curb an infection: the higher body temperature weakens and damages your own cells as well as the pathogen, though the goal is to hurt the pathogen more than your own cells. Fevers also burn a lot extra energy, which your body generally wants to save (part of why losing weight is so hard!)</p>
<p>For COVID to spread, all it needs to infect cells in the far upper respiratory tract, and if it has only lightly infected the nasal cavity, your body won't bother with a massive immune response as the illness will not be that dangerous to you, while mounting a major immune response could be. Partially this can be realized by thinking of your main immune response like an army: if you deploy all of your forces against one foe, another may attack from another direction while you're distracted and gain an upper hand against you, so you want to keep forces in reserve to defend against secondary attacks. Similarly, if you march an army across your lands, you will cause damage to the lands: your immune system does the same and will end up killing some number of healthy cells while diverting resources that could be put to better usage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do know that not having symptoms does reduce one's likelihood of spreading it (both because the symptoms cause one to spread the virus more readily and that generally someone showing symptoms usually (not always) has a higher viral load. The problem is that it's just a highly contagious pathogen and even the small amount an asymptotic person sheds can be enough to infect someone else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that the body keeps the virus in check so well - it's that the virus is designed to evade your body's immune system. Fevers and coughs are caused by your body detecting that the virus is there and reacting to it. That's why we say that fevers are a good thing after vaccinations (to an extent). It's a sign that your body is doing the right thing. So viruses have evolved to evade that system as much as possible so that they can survive undetected. They really just want to be left in peace to replicate in your body's cells and make more copies of itself. That's it's only purpose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How is the immune system prepared to fight a novel virus? Are some people's immune systems higher functioning/can create antibodies faster? Wouldn't the reaction still cause some sort of symptoms like fatigue (which may be written off as just a bad night's sleep or something, therefore making it seem asymptomatic)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all a bit speculative, not really my field, but having seen a sufficiently similar coronavirus before that means your adaptive immune system is partially effective could help. With COVID, the fact that younger people are less effected might mean that there's a tipping point where a slightly slower immune response means the virus can get out of control more often (again, I'm speculating). And I'd assume you're right about mild, short term symptoms sometimes (often?) happening</p></div>		</li>

<p>I am basing this off the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_phage" target="_blank">Lamda Phage</a> (a simple ex of a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysogenic_cycle" target="_blank">lysogenic</a> virus) and It looks like DNA because it’s literally spliced into the genome. </p>
<p>This guy only targets bacteria, but based on how much nutrients are in the cell, it can immediately go to work on recreating itself (“lytic”). This makes cells burst with new viruses. </p>
<p>The Lysogenic route occurs when the bacteria is perhaps NOT as nutrient rich. So the virus has evolved to be able to splice itself into the genome until the cell DOES start getting nutrients. Once the cell starts refueling so to say, some of its proteins will excise the specific sequence of DNA the virus provided. Then the dastardly devil goes into lytic mode and “activates”</p></div>		</li>

<p>The wiki you reference says <strong><em>&quot;The genome contains 48,490 base pairs of double-stranded, linear DNA, with 12-base single-strand segments at both 5' ends.&quot;</em></strong> Just the idea that a 48k bp segment has the evolutionarily built-in ability to turn on/off in certain conditions and defend itself to such lengths to perpetuate its existence is mind-boggling. They even show a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/LambdaPhage_Genome_Linear.svg/2560px-LambdaPhage_Genome_Linear.svg.png" target="_blank">photo of its sequence</a> and its like wow, there's the whole blueprint for it. Natural selection has seemingly optimized it quite well for something that doesn't even technically qualify as objective life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This depends on the virus itself.  Some viruses can integrate their genome into the hosts and when that happens viral DNA becomes very stable. These are called proviruses.  This way the virus can survive for a very long time and even be passed down when cells replicate. HIV is a great example of a provirus.  </p>
<p>Another way is when viral DNA is just hanging around in the cytoplasm/nucleus as an episome.  Most herpes viruses are episomes within the cell. Episomes can be circular (like plasmids) or linear.</p>
<p>In both cases there are no viral particles in the cell so it usually doesn't look like anything and the only detectible thing is the  genetic material DNA/RNA required to build new virions.</p>
<p>Hope that answers you question! Pardon any mistakes I've made :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A quick point of clarification: &quot;provirus&quot; is a bit of a confusing term, because it doesn't refer to the actual virus itself, but rather the genetic sequence that is inserted. The HIV virus is technically a retrovirus, and it <em>creates</em> a provirus when it infects a cell with its viral genome, which in turn can create more HIV retroviruses down the line.  </p>
<p>Retrovirus: a type of virus that makes use of proviruses</p>
<p>Provirus: genetic code used to make a retrovirus</p>
<p>Otherwise great info, and good explanation!</p></div>		</li>
