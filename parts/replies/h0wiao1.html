			<div class="markdown"><p>The most simple way to put it is that a key is just the order the notes are played in. Say you play ABCDEFG, thats A minor. Start on C, so CDEFGAB, and you've got C Major. </p>
<p>Now if you're wondering what happens if you start on another letter, say BCDEFGA, that would be B locrian. There are 7 different keys or modes and it really comes down to the order of the notes and how far away they are from eachother.</p>
<p>Its cool to think that you could play the same notes in 7 different orders and invoke 7 different emotional responses, but that's music.</p></div>		</li>
