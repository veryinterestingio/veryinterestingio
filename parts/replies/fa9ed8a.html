			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess one question might be how close can two Earth size planets be near each other orbiting a star, without disturbing each other's orbits in any noticable amount? Like in a way that they could continue orbiting for billions of years without harming each other.</p>
<p>Because OP mentioned &quot;multiple&quot;, so I was wondering if 2 or 3 million miles would be enough distance, or would it need to be quite a bit farther. Because they won't orbit at the same speeds if one is closer to the star, so at some point they will pass close to each other.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not sure if this works when both bodies are earth-sized, but you could definitely have an habitable mars-sized planet trailing behind a gas giant with habitable moons, or something like that.</p>
<p>As for separate orbits, that's still entirely possible. The TRAPPIST-1 system has seven exoplanets, three of which are in the habitable zone. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRAPPIST-1" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRAPPIST-1</a>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If both bodies are the same mass the system is not stable. But you can have a big planet (bigger than Jupiter) with two Trojan Earths, one before and one after. Or even better, two double planets (like Earth and the Moon), being four in the same orbit.
I know there are ways to make room for many more planets (there's an mental experiment of a system with a million habitable planets), but of course they cannot form naturally.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The Lagrange points are only for small objects, if the trojan gets into the size range of the main body the system becomes unstable.
Theory is that is how Earth got its moon.</p></div>		</li>

<p>See, Venus is 20million km from earth and it's fine... the goldilocks os Sun is about the size from venus to Mars... we could fit 3-4 planets on the zone (varying the greenhouse effect  on each) and end with very similar climates...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to it, there are false images and Facebook Susan's that will post something along the lines of that if our planet were 10 miles further or closer to the sun we would all perish.  This couldn't be any further from the truth.  The Earths orbit is elliptical so in July we are over 3 million miles closer to the sun than we would be in January.</p></div>		</li>
