<p>some biological reasons why you can't breathe 100% oxygen for a long time, even with the correct partial pressure. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mostly, you can breathe 100% at the correct partial pressure for a long time, as was done on the Apollo missions at 5 psi.</p>
<p>However, this causes other things- equipment heat dissipation is already impaired by the absence of thermal convection in a microgravity environment.  It is further worsened by loss of mass density of the air.</p>
<p>Other equipment and experiments may be affected by reduced pressure and lack of other gases in unusual ways.  For example, evaporation of liquids increases quite a bit based on reduction of absolute pressure, not partial pressure of O2.  </p>
<p>Dissolved CO2 in water in a ventilated container will go down to 0% in a pure O2 environment.</p>
<p>You would anticipate these problems and build a reduced-pressure test chamber on Earth to test them, but it's very expensive and cumbersome, and it may make the results of the test less irrelevant to your testing goals.  </p>
<p>That is, if you wanted to know how plants grew the plan for a space station planned for 10+ yrs out that would operate in a standard pressure and gas mixture, then the results would be useless, as 5 PSI 100% is not your goal.  Also, it won't even work under the conditions I stated, plants require CO2.</p></div>		</li>
