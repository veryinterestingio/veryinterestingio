<p>And please use Conjoined Twins. Siamese is not a pleasant term to refer to this situation.</p>

<p>How do you feel about the use of terms like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_connection" target="_blank">&quot;Siamese Connection&quot;/&quot;Siamese Valve&quot;/&quot;Siamese Outlet&quot;</a>? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are pipework terms, and I daresay there would probably be more accurate ways of titling them. They are likely derived from the same term.
The original &quot;Siamese Twins&quot; were actually Siamese, thus the term. They were Conjoined Twins, and the term stuck. However, not every Conjoined Twin is from Siam. Using the proper terms for things is generally preferred.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP but seems to me that if Siamese people and conjoined twins don't like the term &quot;Siamese twins&quot;, and this valve is names after the unpleasant term that all involved parties are offended by, when there's an alternative name available (splitter, it says it right in the first sentence), then the alternative word should be used. If something references an offensive word, than the reference itself is fairly insensitive.</p>
<p>But idk I've lived my whole life around minorities and there's always differing opinions depending on who you ask. Case in point, I identify as queer, but many other people in my community would rather not have that word anywhere near the community. Some black folks find &quot;white people dreads&quot; offensive while others really don't care. Some Indian folks think white girls wearing henna is gross while others are more than happy to share the cultural phenomenon. It's all about the individual. Personally, if given the chance I'd like to avoid a potentially offensive word/behavior until given the go-ahead by the people I'm with, and even then only around them. But to each their own.</p></div>		</li>
