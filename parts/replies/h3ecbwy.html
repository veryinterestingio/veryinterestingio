			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes you'll hear people say their kidneys are only 20% working or something like that, and so they need a transplant of at least one healthy kidney, or they'll die (dialysis buys you lots of time though).</p>
<p>However, if the malfunctioning kidneys aren't infected or dying, you can just leave them there and they continue to do their 20% along with the new kidney.</p>
<p>Plus they have numerous arteries in there that pump all the blood through, which are not easy to just cut and stitch up</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if the kidney isn't functioning, it's still connected to major blood vessels in the body (which makes sense since the kidneys filter ions and other solutes from the blood) so cutting the damaged kidney out has the potential to cause more harm than just leaving it there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Me and my mother have 3 kidneys. While my third one works perfectly fine, hers doesn’t. It just doesn’t do the work a kidney would do but it doesn’t cause any problems whatsoever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally unlike liver transplants, kidneys usually aren't transplanted into the same space as the native kidneys so it isn't as if you need to make room for the donor one.</p></div>		</li>
