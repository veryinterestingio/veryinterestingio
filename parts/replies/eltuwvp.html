			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! Was trying to find the correlation for smaller things. But this leads to my next question... Does their perception of time slow down? Ie us giant humans seem to be moving really slow to them? Is that why when I try to swat a fly, it is always just barely out of reach - like it's got all this extra previewed time to make adjustments as needed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To a small degree, yes--shorter nerves and a smaller brain means the round-trip is faster--but it's probably mostly because the annoying little bug can feel the movement of your hand far in advance of your strike.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if its faster movement means we looks slow to it WHILE it is stationary. Its eyes and brain don't run at a different wavelength that ours, I don't think. When it's moving, on the other hand, yeah everything we do looks slow compared to them.</p>
<p>By the way, I kill flies by sneakily move my hand very close to them, then I flick. It can evade my fat swinging arm, but not my snappy spring-loaded finger tendon...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another interesting phenomenon is falling. If a person, a mouse, and an ant all jumped off of a 3 foot high picnic table, they'd all be going the same speed when they hit the ground (in the absence of wind resistance).</p>
<p>The person could bend his legs more, acting as a pair of shock absorbers, but that would be more than offset by the difference in mass of the person relative to the smaller creatures. I just looked it up and a typical mouse weighs less than one ounce so the typical man would be more than 4000 times as massive. An ant, on the other hand is only a couple milligrams so a man would be something like 40 million times as massive.</p>
<p>Also, since surface area increases with the square of linear size and mass increases with the cube, the ant would be much more susceptible to wind resistance than the person.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that the ant could probably fall from almost any height without being injured while a field mouse would be no more likely to be injured than a human jumping from the same height. Probably less likely, despite its short legs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact, it would weight exactly one thousand times more...</p>
<p>10*10*10 to be exact.</p>
<p>Sorry to be pedantic but I feel like if there is a formula to calculate it, people should be made aware. </p>
<p>Also, for his strenght, he would be only 100 times stronger than the 6 foot tall person:</p>
<p>10 * 10</p>
<p>That is unless that muscle ratio is lower (for example due to needing bigger bones, not having ressources enough to sustain those muscles, inneficiency when muscle fibers are too numerous, etc.).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Add to this the fact that a big structure (being something alive or not), having a bigger surface, it also has a bigger drag. Regardless of how heavy it can be, you're going to be needing a lot more energy to make it move, and the movement is not going to be immediate and constant, as everything else, it will have to achieve certain acceleration to win over the drag and move fluidly and constant.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>One of the pretty awesome movies that really applies this logic to the movement is Pacific Rim (the first one, the second one doesn't give a shit about physics).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly?</p>
<p>Exactly???</p>
<p>Just because there's a formula... Doesn't mean things will be &quot;exactly&quot; that outcome.</p>
<p>Good luck finding a 60' tall man that's exactly 1,000 times the weight of his 6' counterpart.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another issue for large animals with cardiovascular systems is being able to pump blood up against gravity. <a href="https://www.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physiol.00016.2016" target="_blank">This paper actually analyzes this including for large dinosaurs</a>. They speculate that sauropod's long necks may have actually been used to reach down to food underwater since it seems unlikely they could have held their head up vertically and been able to pump enough blood up to it.</p></div>		</li>
