			<div class="markdown"><p>There's not enough doctors partly due to high tuition fees and restricted access to the curriculum. In a perfect academical world with enough seats for anyone willing and able to follow the classes and free university, this wouldn't be a problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the bottleneck is residency spots. Congress dictates the number of spots, and hasn't raised it in a while. That's where our doctor shortage comes from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, I don't even think it's that. My undergrad's not med and not even close to being as overwhelming in curriculum but is still one of the more challenging ones out there and I can say I have about 4 hours a week of true free time. I couldn't imagine always being in a free time deficit for 5 years straight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn’t an answer to the question. Splitting 24 hour shifts into 3 eight hour shifts each doesn’t reduce the total number of hours worked by doctors or the coverage. </p></div>		</li>
