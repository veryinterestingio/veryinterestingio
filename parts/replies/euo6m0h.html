			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to be an avid scuba diver, and in the tropics have seen coconuts floating in the ocean a number of times. Sometimes these coconuts have sprouted, and a tiny green shoot points straight up out of the top of the coconut like nature's own buoy. Pretty nifty little invaders, these.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus many plants try to target specific hosts. Like hot peppers target birds as their potential seed distributer since mammals have molars that can crush the small seeds. So they evolved chemicals that activate the heat receptors in mammals and cause the sensation of burning if the fruit is consumed. Birds don’t have these same receptors so the peppers don’t taste hot to them. This is a neat way of deciding who gets to eat your fruits/seeds. </p>
<p>An opposite example is the avocado. It evolved a large fruit with a massive seed. Fruits and seeds of avocado were intended to be consumed by the now extinct megafauna like the ground sloths. The plant would have gone extinct as well, as no animal alive today (within range) is big enough to swallow an avocado whole and disperse the seeds. Lucky humans found the plant and liked its fruit. We basically became its seed distributor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bird thing is kinda funny in application, like how premium egg farmers (in Japan especially) use red peppers in their chicken feed since the chickens don't care.  As a result the yolks have a more lustrous golden-orange hue thanks to the chickens passing those robust red pigments from the feed to their eggs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good way too keep squirrels out of the bird feeder, too. Add chili powder to the seeds. The first day of this is.... entertaining.</p></div>		</li>
