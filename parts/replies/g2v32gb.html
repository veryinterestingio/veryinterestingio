			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's worth mentioning that that the authors of the linked study do <em>not</em> believe the graft vs host disease they observed was due to genetic histocompatibility differences between the identical twins. Rather, this appears to be an early case study on &quot;auto-immunity&quot; resulting from an imbalance of suppressing vs. auto-active lymphocytes, which would be unsurprising to find in the wake of a bone marrow transplant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point. I am having a brain foggy day and didn't want to get deep into details in that light, so thank you for that. Also, it was eons ago in terms of immunology research.</p>
<p>I took immunology in 1997, where one of the lecturers was working on GvHD, but I haven't followed it deeply since then. I just remember thinking that I'd always thought bone marrow transplants were so simple before that and was quite horrified to find out how difficult they were.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've done some upper-level immuno myself, which demonstrated that I will never be able to keep up with the field! It really is stunning how something new seems to pop up every couple of years that completely alters the course of immunology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An everyday example of cells making their own choices is one you've seen examples of, just haven't been aware of. This isn't in an immune context, but it's still cool, and sort of shows the kinds of mechanisms that go on in the cells.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHak9EZjySs" target="_blank">X Chromosome inactivation animation</a>, including the relevant parts that happen in a woman's body <em>for each cell</em> to have one or the other X chromosome inactivated. When those cells divide, they keep the same decision.</p>
<p>It's visible in cats! The color coats (red/orange or black) in cats are carried on the X chromosome, so (tri-color) calico and tortoiseshell cats are female.</p></div>		</li>

<p>a woman who thought she was non-identical with her twin. She was surprised to find out that sequencing showed they were identical</p>

<p>So... what made her believe they were non-identical twins?</p></div>		</li>
