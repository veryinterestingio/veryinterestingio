<p>I would also add that cars (and houses) are the only things we purchase with an intent to resell. </p>
<p>When I buy a car, I fully intend to trade it in and get some of my money back, whenever I decide to purchase my next car. </p>
<p>Sure, you might be able to get a few bucks at GameStop if you trade in your ps4 for a ps4-and-a-half... but that value wasn't a part of your initial purchase rationale. And most everything else you buy (food, clothes, gym memberships) have absolutely zero trade-in value. You buy a thing, use it up, and throw away whatever husk remains. </p>
<p>Every prospective car buyer is showing up with a trade-in of nebulous value, so the entire transaction starts with a haggle.</p></div>		</li>
