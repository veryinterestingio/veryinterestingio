			<div class="markdown"><p>Roosters and hens both have cloacas - one reproductive and waste tract. Based on the post above, we might infer something about dinosaur mating from chickens. Here's a description (<a href="https://animals.mom.me/reproductive-system-of-a-rooster-7896371.html" target="_blank">source, emphasis added</a>) </p>
<p><strong>Reproductive Process</strong></p>
<p><strong>When a rooster mates with a hen, he will climb on top of her back and place a foot on each of her wings, forcing her tail feathers upward so he can press his cloaca to hers.</strong> The rooster ejaculates and transfers the sperm, and he hops off. <em>Often he will perform a victory dance of sorts, hopping around and strutting</em>, while the hen unruffles her feathers, flaps her wings and walks away</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that is my issue with that theory... the vertebrae of sauropods did not allow a large angle of movement at each joint... it’s unlikely they would physically be able to mover the tail out of the way, not entirely anyhow. Perhaps subtending a small angle to the side would suffice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing I never understood about this- </p>
<p>Birds are descended from dinosaurs, but at the same time dinosaurs went extinct, probably through an asteroid striking the earth or something. </p>
<p>So wouldn't that mean that there are many dinosaur species that don't have living descendents? If they went extinct they couldn't evolve right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Birds are only a specific branch of dinosaurs, and the only branch that survived...think of it like this:  Imagine all mammals went extinct except for a handful of species of bats.  Then 65 million years from now there are still a bunch of bats flying around, descendants of those few species of surviving bats  But none of the other mammals left descendants.  Birds are like the bats of dinosaurs.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Extinct is one of those complex terms, I joked to a friend once that humans stopped evolving not because of any biological process but because we are to vain to call ourselves anything else.</p>
<p>My question would be more what dinosaurs did birds evolve from and did all birds come from one group. There is definitely a line that probably looks like gallimimus(butchered name), moa, ostrich and emu.</p>
<p>But what about chickens, peacocks etc. Did different group of birds come from different dino stocks.</p>
<p>Wait can different bird types mate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally, the family of dinosaurs called the Theropods are the only ones likely to have evolved into modern birds. So sauropods (like the giant plant eaters) and most other dinosaur families do not have any living relatives. </p>
<p>Here's a family tree of the dinosaurs.

			<div class="markdown"><p>To answer that last question: no, different bird species are almost always non-interfertile. </p>
<p>The general rule is dogs, cats, horses and cattle can generally breed among variants of their own species, but birds, fish, and lizards cannot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Birds are dinosaurs, full stop. They’re theropod dinosaurs in the same way monkeys are all mammals. Not all dinosaurs are birds, so many groups of dinosaurs are extinct and don’t have living representatives. But yes, dinosaurs aren’t extinct. That extinction event wiped out a lot of things that weren’t dinosaurs, and it didn’t kill all the dinosaurs. It’s far more complex than is popularly portrayed, and we don’t fully understand the patterns we see. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a research topic posted at reddit some time ago, perhaps a year or two, that pointed out that genetic analysis and fossil evidence shows that several lineages of birds, at least four, survived through the K-P extinction event. It kind of blew my mind because I had always thought the diversification of birds happened later.</p>
<p>The big question, that we really don't have a good answer to, is why several species of birds, some of them not very flight-worthy (chickens, for instance), survived the extinction event, but non-avian theropod dinosaurs did not. What were the key differences that made the avians capable of surviving and the terror beasts not so much?</p>
<p>From the descent, it appears that only one species each of monotremes, marsupials, and mammals survived. That too is curious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to add that birds don't show up well in the fossil record because they have weaker bones that don't hold up as well over millions of years.</p>
<p>So the link between true birds and the larger group of dinosaurs is a little hazier than you would expect from another group, say mammals. We have a better record for the evolution of mammals (heavily based in jawbones and teeth) than we do for birds. In fact, teeth are so important that one group of proto-mammals, the cynodonts, are named after how they were first identified:</p>
<p>New Teeth. They have diverse teeth instead of a more reptilian single tooth which is just repeated over and over.</p>
<p>We could look at teeth for birds, too--when did dinosaurs start losing their teeth and getting true beaks? It's hard to tell because it's harder to find those teeth without a skeleton along with them.</p></div>		</li>
