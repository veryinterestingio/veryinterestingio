<p>Water is a poor conductor, it's the residue it leaves behind that causes issues. Alcohol like you say dries without a trace and is far superior.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can wash electronics with soap and water without damaging them, so long as there is no current running in the device.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can submerge electronics in water and sometimes; they keep running just fine. </p>
<p>I actually used to work at a place where the networking group had a particular site that flooded a few times and they definitely had a case of a router that was still passing packets while completely submerged. </p>
<p>Water isn't THAT conductive if it doesn't have a lot of salts in it.</p>
<p>For my own part, I had to replace a home router after the cat puked on it. She managed to get the power section of the board too; so I opened it, cleaned it in distilled water.... then bought a new router. After giving the old one time to dry, I tested it...and it works again. It is now my spare that gets used for testing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In principle, deionized water will not damage any electronic.</p>
<p>In order to measure temperature sensitivity of some electronic devices/components in our physics lab, we would often submerge simple circuits in deionized water, since water conducts away heat better, which allows the circuit temperature to rise slower.</p>
<p>Even though water doesn't stay that way for long (it starts producing H3O+ and OH- right away), for most purposes there aren't enough ions to conduct electricity, since current will find much less resistance through the metal components of the circuit itself.</p>
<p>Submerging circuits in water still gives me some pause (I jumped into a hot tub with my phone in my pocket once, it died for a while and then came back to life), but when I learned you could do this, I was quite surprised.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electrical engineer here: What you say is right in spirit, but mostly wrong.</p>
<p>“...so long as there is no current running through the device.” Voltage. Water breaks most devices because there is a voltage differential between pins of chips and the voltage itself causes current to flow through parts of the circuit it shouldn’t.</p>
<p>“Capacitors that still have a charge can cause shorts.” ....eh.... The capacitor doesn’t cause a short, the dirty water does. That the capacitor may be charged is not itself an issue with most electronics nowadays as very few have capacitors without bleeder circuits OR the capacitor doesn’t go above a couple volts. Should a capacitor come into play like this, you are likely dealing with a CRT monitor or a novel high voltage application.</p>
<p>“Alcohol ... [is] a better solvent.” ...for SOME things. If you are trying to get off cigarette tar, some solder fluxes, certain adhesives, or anything oily, this is true. Water is used for a other contamination like the sugar in spilled drinks. As a fun experiment, try dissolving sugar in pure alcohol vs water - you can barely get any sugar to be dissolved in the alcohol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your first point literally just restated what he said. We KNOW that voltage differential induces current and that current is the result of a voltage differential. It doesn’t have to be stated every time something like this is mentioned as some sort of “gotcha”. They are two parts of the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While current and voltage are related to one another via Ohm’s law in the context of a complete circuit, stating one does not always imply the other. You can have very high current with very little voltage in which case something getting wet would not do much. Conversely, you can have very high voltage with little to no current. </p>
<p>Damage to wet electronics has nothing to do with current in normal operation. It 100% has to do with the voltage from the power supply/s finding its way where it shouldn’t. That voltage is what induces a current that fries things. In some instances, if the voltage is higher than the operating voltage of the component, the voltage can also damage the component.</p></div>		</li>
