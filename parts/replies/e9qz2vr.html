<p>The only thing I'd add is that the brain and other bodily systems also consume energy as well as oxygen.  Dropping a patient into a  coma lowers energy demand, sparing it for healing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Curiously enough, the patients we leave &quot;awake&quot; have better outcomes (less PTSD and acute delerium).  While it's terrible what we do to you, it's even more terrible if you can't actually process and deal with it appropriately.  I commonly hear patients recount being repeatedly raped while sedated, less so if we use less sedation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok wow! </p>
<p>Interestingly I’m on a ward with a few other patients who are on stronger pain killers than me (morphine etc) and they’ve complained a lot of waking hallucinations. One threw her phone at a hallucinated spider that was on the wall! </p>
<p>So I know I definitely don’t have it the “worst”.</p></div>		</li>
