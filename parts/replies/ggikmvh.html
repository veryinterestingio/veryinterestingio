			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the density of a material will play a role (to some extend). Thermal Conductivity equals thermal divusivity (inertia) divided by density and heat capacity (thermal mass). So heavier materials conduct heat worse.</p>
<p>But for metals it mostly depends on the electrical Conductivity (eg aluminum is lighter than copper, but has a lower thermal conductivity)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, density has an impact on thermal conductivity. It's one of many factors, including molecular structure, metal vs non-metal, temperature, etc. For wood, you'd also get a different thermal conductivity depending on water content as well. Also for woods, you see thermal conductivity rise with more density. </p>
<p>Even the most dense woods are order of magnitudes lower than metals. Lithium is around 80 W/mK whereas any wood is generally under 1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, exactly.  In fact, you don't really &quot;feel cold&quot;, what you can sense is the heat loss from your hand.  So the colder something feels doesn't necessarily correlate with temperature.  This is why they say &quot;feels like x degrees&quot; when talking about weather, because wind speed and moisture can play roles in extracting heat from you quicker.  And in the heat, same principle applies, a room at 68 degrees F can feel very comfortable with little airflow, or you can have a 72 degree room with a draft or a good fan and feel about the same.</p>
<p>This is also why jumping in 45 degree water feels infinitely colder than a non-windy 32 degree air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, touch a piece of foam insulation, it invariably feels warm. That warmth is your own body heat. Google the term thermal break, we add a thin line of thermally nonconductive material to aluminum windows and doors to keep cold from getting to the interior. A thin strip of material makes a huge difference to the interior facing surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good ELI5. But the clever reader should now be asking, &quot;But wait! Doesn't the sun heat the earth? If there's no air or water between the sun and earth how does the sun's heat get to earth?&quot;</p>
<p>The answer is: Light. Hot objects also let off forms of light and light can travel through the near vacuum of space and when light hits things that absorb the light it will heat them up.</p>
<p>EDIT: A lot of people are replying saying the sun emits radiation not light. Light is a form of radiation. The sun emits many forms of radiation: X-rays, ultraviolet, visible light, infrared, radio waves, neutrinos. Technically, the sun creates gamma rays but they don't even escape the surface of the sun. Visible light is the strongest output from the sun that reaches earth.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So, if you stood on the moon, in view of the sun, without your shirt on, and assuming you didn’t have to breathe and the vacuum of space didn’t hurt you, would you feel warmth from the sun’s light? Or, because no atmosphere, it wouldn’t work the same way it does here?</p>
<p>Or, say you had sealed glass of water and you placed it on the moon in the same spot, in the light. Space themed movies/shows tell me it would freeze. But, if the sun is hitting it with light, wouldn’t it absorb enough heat from that to not freeze?</p>
<p>Is there something about the insulating properties of our atmosphere that is the difference here?</p></div>		</li>

<p>If we're assuming you're vacuum-proof, then yes, it'd be pretty much like on Earth.  Just with less shielding in the high UV range so you'd burn really quickly.  And I think it also interferes with IR, so there's another bit of heat coming in that way.</p>

<p>Sealed is the key.  If it's not sealed, it'll evaporate and that will cool it quite effectively.</p>
<p>FWIW, the moon's surface temperature swings <em>drastically</em>.   Like, from +260F to -280F.  The difference being the sun.  If you leave your sealed object there, it will follow a similar thermal profile (depending on color and thermal mass).</p></div>		</li>

<p>would you feel warmth from the sun’s light</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh yeah. I don't know how different the sensation would be from the same situation on Earth because of the no atmosphere thing, but you would feel the radiation, just like standing at the other end of the room from an infrared heater or sunbathing in the middle of winter in the mountains (bad for your skin, wear sunblock).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Regarding the glass of water, it would likely not freeze during the day, no. If you left it alone, it would be frozen for about two weeks every month (the lunar night) and then get various shades of cold to warm during the day. In fact, lunar soil temperatures can exceed 100°C in some regions when in sunlight, so if carefully positioned, the water temperature may even exceed its boiling point on Earth for a while (it wouldn't boil in a sealed container, obvs).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not instantly. The heat builds up, but there's nowhere for it to go. If you keep adding heat and it can't radiate away, it just keeps getting hotter and hotter and hotter.</p>
<p>Incidentally, which is what a radiator does. It takes heat and dumps it somewhere else (into a liquid or into the air).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, spacesuits reflect most of the sunlight and have their own thermal regulation systems (I think most designs have a layer with channels that water circulates through and transfers heat to an evaporative cooling system in the backpack (?)). But if that system failed, you would have to get inside ASAP or risk slowly overheating to death inside your suit - not so much from the sun heating you up, but rather from your own body heat having nowhere to go to.</p></div>		</li>
