			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not something you typically learn about nutrition, that the same foods may vary in their nutritional content. How is one to know if their store-bought food is nutrient--rich or not?  In an age of lots of factory farming and mass production, it seems likely farmers/producers would want to grow products at the least cost, e.g. regular soil without much selenium in it.</p></div>		</li>

I’m not an expert but a quick google search showed research from the last ten years generally agreeing that modern factor farmed produce is less nutritious than historical produce data, but I’m curious how much variation there is between crops from the same farm.</p></div>		</li>
