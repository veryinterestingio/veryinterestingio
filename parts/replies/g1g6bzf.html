			<div class="markdown"><p>haha, I never snored until I turned 35 or so, was a bummer to have it sneak up on me.</p>
<p>I'm relatively fit as well, thought I might be able to go snore-free for my whole life.</p>
<p>Now I wear a cpap every night to bed like some old man just to stop the snoring even though I don't have apnea.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The end.</p></div>		</li>
