			<div class="markdown"><p>The heat capacity is undefined at a phase transition because you can add energy and have no change in temperature.  This in true in general for all properties related to a second derivative of the internal energy (thermal expansion coefficient, compressibility, heat capacity, etc) for all first order phase transitions.  In simpler terms, there is a cusp in the internal energy at a first order phase transition, so derivatives get wonky.</p>
<p>Instead, we quantify the properties of a phase transition with the total amount of energy (per volume or mass) to complete the transaction.  This is called the latent heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heats required for phase changes are NOT part of the specific heat capacity of either phase.</p>
<p>You are right that it is a large amount of energy, in the case of water at least, but it’s not strictly relevant to this question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The latent heat of fusion for water (energy to melt ice) is 334 J/g, as opposed to 4.18 J/g*C. You could raise the water temperature 80 degrees C with the amount of energy it takes to melt it at the same temperature.</p>
<p>Not that the ocean temperature change isn't alarmingly fast. There's vastly more water in the ocean than in ice, so when that entire mass raises in temperature, it takes a very large amount of energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really, what matters is the number of degrees of freedom your system has. How many ways can you put energy into the system? </p>
<p>In a solid, the only place you can put energy is into the intermolecular bonds themselves. You can't move your atoms.</p>
<p>In a liquid, you've got the most options. There are still some intermolecular bonds to put energy into, but you can also move the molecules around or make them spin relative to eachother.</p>
<p>Molecules in a gas are free to move and spin as they wish, but aren't bonded to one another. So you lose a degree of freedom - a place to put energy - and your heat capacity goes down.</p>
<p>There's more nuance to it than this, gasses really have two measures of heat capacity. But it's been a few years since I took thermodynamics. This is called the Equipartition Theorem if you want more information.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Gases in general have pretty low heat capacities because there's little to no molecular bonding.  Molecular bonds are another place to deposit heat into.</p>
<p>Generally the phases with the highest heat capacity are phases where there's a lot of movement, but still a lot of inter-molecular bonds as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But liquids have more/stronger intermolecular bonding forces than gases due to them being closer together. So to aggitate a liquid you have to overcome those stronger bonds which requires more energy.</p></div>		</li>
