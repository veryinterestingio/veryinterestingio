			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that it's not known whether our universe is in a false vacuum or true vacuum state. If it's the latter, we have nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>If it's the former, then <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.97.056006" target="_blank">this paper</a> points out that if the Universe is infinite, calculations show a high likelihood that there is &quot;a bubble of true vacuum already out there, far away. It is sobering to envision this bubble, with its wall of negative energy, barreling towards us at the speed of light. It seems the long-term future of our Universe is not going to be slow freezing due to cosmic acceleration, but an abrupt collision with one of these bubble walls.&quot;</p>
<p>However, they also calculate that our universe has at least 10^(58) years to go before it meets this fate, and more likely around 10^(139) years. That should give you enough time to put your affairs in order.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Our observable universe, while growing at the speed of light, is also shrinking as a percentage of the total universe. Things furthest away slip beyond our ability to see it as the expansion between here and there grows too much for light to keep up. Note, this isn't saying that we or they are moving faster than light, there's just a lot of expanding space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would only apply to large scales. If the bubble is close enough, no expansion rate would prevent it from reaching us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The paper I linked takes the Hubble constant into account, but I'm not sure of the details.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that what's being calculated is the probability of a random quantum tunneling event triggering vacuum collapse. Given enough time, such an event could happen near enough to our vicinity to reach us. However, heat death will have occurred by about 10^100 years, so it becomes something of a moot point after that.</p></div>		</li>
