<p>Evidence that immunity can last up to 7 months =/= evidence of no immunity after 7 months, just that the virus is 7 months old.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm really tired of the narrative that immunity doesn't last long term. The scientific community said it might not be long term a couple months ago and now the story has become &quot;there is no long term immunity.&quot; We won't no there is no long term immunity until we are a while out from the beginning of this pandemic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Further, we have pretty good evidence that immunity does exist and does last by the fact that there are very few reported cases of people becoming sick a second time.  The very few cases that have been reported are mostly considered to be relapses from an infection that was not fully fought off.  (Though, admittedly, it is possible that some are second-time infections;  but the rarity of those is still strongly suggestive.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the multiple large studies showing stable titres over time plus multiple studies identifying memory T and B cells... we have no <em>proof</em> that people are immune after infection or that immunity lasts long term because it's been around like 6 months. Unless all the animal research we've done in numerous species in that time is not predictive of the human situation, the clinical picture is wrong, this disease behaves nothing like any previous disease including other coronaviruses, and the aforementioned studies are wrong then the evidence is much stronger for a robust, long-lasting immunity and probably lifetime resilience. The only &quot;good&quot; evidence of short-lived immunity is the one nature paper using unconventional methodology to measure antibodies in a small group, which conflicts with the all other evidence we have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That said, immunity to many other coronavirus species does drop after 6 months. So it would not be surprising if immunity to covid19 was also temporary.</p></div>		</li>
