<p>Would the object not have to be traveling away from us at speeds greater than C for it to be more than 27.6 billion light years away in this case?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of! The expansion of space isn't really the speed of the object, it's the rate of recession due to the expansion of space in-between us. It's not a property of the object itself. This means it doesn't really behave like a &quot;normal&quot; speed. So you can get objects receding from us faster than light. This doesn't break relativity, because no objects can actually move past each other faster than light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you expand upon what you mean by &quot;so thick and dense that light doesn't actually travel through it.&quot;  That seems like a large simplification.  Was the medium of this early universe such that light just couldn't move at all?  Was the wavelength of the light such that it wasn't visible?  What gives?!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Interesting!</p>
<p>Does that imply that &quot;speed&quot; is only meaningful at nearby distances?</p>
<p>I always thought it strange that &quot;the speed of light is constant&quot; but at the same time &quot;nothing falling into a black hole ever reaches the event horizon&quot;, so when you shine light at a black hole 1km away it takes far longer than 1/300000 second (at least from your point of view).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're looking for a layman's explanation:</p>
<p>Imagine that for every mile of space, you add a milimetre. Between us and the moon, it's a tiny amount. For us and the rest of the galaxy, it's significantly more but still... only a couple miles, right?</p>
<p>But when you're talking about the distances between galaxies? It adds up really really really fast. Faster than the speed of light, in fact. But nothing is 'travelling', just things are getting further away from each other.</p>
<p><em>All</em> of space is expanding at the same time, and the rate it's expanding at <em>in between</em> us and distance objects is such a high number that is outpaces the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think where a lot of people get hung up is the concept of &quot;space expanding&quot; itself. They think space expanding means objects are moving away from each other, thus more space is in between them. But that's not what space expansion is. The space itself is <em>growing</em>. It helps to imagine space like it's a substance that is multiplying itself. Like hypothetically two distant objects could be in motion towards each other but be getting further apart because space is expanding faster between them than they are traveling towards eachother.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. Maybe best to say in your example, imagine now that every milimeter is now 1/10th bigger.  The fabric of space is expanding.. everything would shift and things that are further apart from each other would shift even further at the same time. But none of the them is moving very fast compared to its surounding</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an excellent write up.  But I take issue with one point.<br />
&quot;The universe appears to be infinite in size&quot; -  </p>
<p>We don't know this, and there are various theories as to the nature of the observable universe vs the universe.  We can surmise that the unobservable universe is (probably much) larger than our observable universe, but beyond that we don't know.  </p>
<p>We do know that if the universe has been expanding for a finite amount of time and it did not start at infinite size, it should be finite in nature.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Surmise is when you have no evidence, so I'd use a different word there. For example, we observe that the Universe is spatially flat, to a precision of 0.25%. If we assume that our current laws of physics are correct, we can set limits on how large, at least, the Universe must be before it curves back on itself. </p>
<p>Observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Planck satellite are where we get the best data. They tell us that if the Universe does curve back in on itself and close, the part we can see is so indistinguishable from &quot;uncurved&quot; that it must be at least 250 times the radius of the observable part. This means the unobservable Universe, assuming there's no topological weirdness, must be at least 23 trillion light years in diameter, and contain a volume of space that's over 15 million times as large as the volume we can observe. If we're willing to speculate, however, we can argue quite compellingly that the unobservable Universe should be significantly even bigger than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but the issue was with the wording &quot;infinite in size.&quot;</p>
<p>Significantly bigger than trillions of lightyears is not infinite in any sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alan Guth memorably concluded chapter 10 of <em>The Inflationary Universe</em> by estimating that the size of the <em>entire</em> universe - if finite at all - ought to be at least 10^23 times the size of the <em>observable</em> universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Einstein's model predicts that while gravity is almost always attractive, it must also be repulsive at times.</p>
<p>IIRC, Theory is that this would only happen if a certain amount of what we call &quot;dark energy&quot; aligns perfectly. </p>
<p>Imagine a pot of boiling water, the surface is &quot;always&quot; uneven. However, if you had infinite pots and they boiled for infinite time then eventually some of them, just for a microsecond, would have a surface that would be perfectly even and flat with all molecules precisely aligned. </p>
<p>When the equivalent perfect alignment happens to dark energy gravity would repulsively push outward with insane speed and power, creating a &quot;Big Bang&quot;. If this is how our visible universe was created, and there is infinite dark energy in the universe outside our visible universe, then this would happen infinite times, and there could be infinite universes the size of ours in existence at all times.</p>
<p>To be clear, you are right, we don't know the size of our universe for sure, or whether the greater universe exists and is infinite and made of infinite lesser universes like ours.... But it is a real possibility, which is kind of cool to think about.</p>
<p>Edit: One thing I forgot to mention/be clear about is that a repulsive gravity dark energy big bang would really help explain why our universe is  &quot;inflating&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
