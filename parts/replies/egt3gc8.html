			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there is also a large historical enertia associated with model organisms. It seems that researchers lose sight of curing diseases after decades of working on the murine model. I work on histocompatability between species, and it seems like every week there is something amazing in mouse immunology that doesn't translate to people. Then if you go talk to the people doing the research, you never hear &quot;Oh, it's time to start over and cure the human disease.&quot; Almost every time they double down and continue to pursue the novel mouse immunology. Eventually, the human disease just becomes lip-service to get funds from the NIH.</p></div>		</li>
