<p>In some <em>very specific</em> niche applications this thing will undoubtedly be very useful - medical implants where changing the battery means opening the person up for example - but I seriously doubt this thing is likely to scale up to power a phone or a car or anything like that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oddly enough, that's not a goal for artificial pacemakers. Doctors <em>want</em> to open you up and get back in there every few years.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I got the impression that they don't quite <em>want</em> to, but they don't mind it  as much since it lets them upgrade. The last line is a really good point though. There's not a huge incentive to making batteries that last that much longer when the batteries would outlive most of the patients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's kinda my point - if it's currently orders of magnitude too weak to run a digital watch that demonstrates just how far it is from being viable for almost any consumer application.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry, what?</p>
<p>My (mechanical, with moving parts! with date!) watch uses (1) SR626SW battery, which wikipedia says is 26 mAh at 1.55V, or 40 mWh.</p>
<p>I can't remember the last time I changed the battery, but reviewing my purchases, it must have been some time in 2018 or earlier, so at least 820 days ago. This about matches up with the Amazon reviews and manual, which advise \~2 year lifetime for this watch. (The next model up is supposed to get \~5 year battery life, IIRC.)</p>
<p>40mWh/820 days = 2.05 uW</p>
<p>These nuke cells are supposed to have a power density of like 10uW/cc, right? Volume of an SR626 is 0.12 cc... which would be 1.2 uW... which is just about what my watch needs.</p>
<p>(Yes, 1.2 &lt; 2.05, but there's extra space inside the watch housing. You could fit a 2x bigger power supply if you needed to—or you could use more efficient electronics.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Did we not stop using &quot;eternal&quot; nuclear powered pacemakers and the like in the 60s?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At first I thought you mixed up Tritium (a gas) and Radium (a metal that was made into a paint).</p>
<p>But I learnt something new: Tritium was also made into a paint!</p>
<p>You can still buy watches that use Tritium, but today they use very small glass tubes filled with the gas, so in case a breakage it won't stick around to poison people.</p>
