<p>The U.S. Flammable Fabrics Act is an act that was passed in 1953 to regulate the manufacture of highly flammable clothing. It was enacted after a series of tragic deaths in the 1940s involving <strong>children who were wearing long rayon pile cowboy chaps</strong> or brushed rayon sweaters.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have known more teenagers who like to play with fire than be interested in how finances work or help abuse victims, myself included. I got a burn scar on my hand from when I set fire to a plastic oranges net and it dripped down on my hand. My best friend at the time and another friend set a tree on fire when they set newspapers on fire inside of it. The same friend that almost blew his face off when he lit a firework stick in his mouth because he was taking a call with his other hand.(he managed to throw it away fast enough).</p>
<p>What I al trying to say is, fire is just a thing that is fun to play with and also teenagers are dumb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s funny, I teach high school classes on both financial literacy and relationships, and those units do tend to get a lot of attention from my students, particularly the abusive relationship signs. After 12 years of teaching it still surprises me that they pay as much attention as they do. </p>
<p>But they do pay even more attention to anything involving fire in culinary arts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't really call playing with fire edgy. Unless you make a big deal out of being a firebender or smthg. I mostly hung out with guys, so I can only take myself as an example for a teenage girl. Most girls I knew, weren't into fire. They were more into healthy things like music or art or sports.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool fact: when in a stressful situation your brain remembers easier in 3s. When not in a stressful situation your brain can usually memorize 5 to 7 things. So stop drop and roll is done with 3 words so you cant forget it. In the military when our weapons jam we do tap rack bang so it's easier to remember how to fix our weapons. End cool fact</p></div>		</li>
