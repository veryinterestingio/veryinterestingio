<blockquote>
<p>Muscle diversity in the development and the evolution of cephalopods appears to be characterized by modulation of the dimensions of the myofilaments, in contrast to the relatively fixed myofilament dimensions of vertebrate muscle. In addition, the arrangement of the myofilaments may also be altered, as has been observed in the extensor muscle fibres of the prey capture tentacles of squid and cuttlefish, which show cross-striation and thus differ from the obliquely striated pattern of most cephalopod locomotor muscle fibres. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Boiled down: the shape and arrangement of muscle fibers differs quite a lot from vertebrates. In general, vertebrates muscle fibers pull in a single direction, and multiple muscles can work together across joints. Being jointless, squid muscle has varied shape and direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mammal muscles are like corduroy pants pattern and squids are like a Burberry scarf. When the fibers don't need to connect to anything they are just everywhere in any direction free to expand and contract entire surfaces rather than pulling on bones like a marionette.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was led to ask the question, &quot;What about octopuses?&quot;  The article differentiates between the 8 arms of all three types of cephalopods have in common from the two more specialized tentacles found in squids and cuttlefish (the longer ones with suckers only at the club-like tips).</p>
<p>The muscles of the arms are obliquely striated muscle, very similar to that found in the voluntary muscles of vertebrates, but they're staggered in a sort of helical, spiraling pattern, which is depicted later in the article.  It's not cross-linked like the tentacles.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Squids are protostomes and we're deuterostomes, which means our ancestors diverged before they even settled which end should be the mouth and which end should be the ass. For protostomes the first hole developed in the embryo is the mouth and the second hole is the ass; for us it's the other way round.</p></div>		</li>
