			<div class="markdown"><p>Knots that are more related to scar tissue or fibrotic adhesions should be worked out with deep soft tissue work, trigger points can be released easily with the help of a skilled clinician (or on your own with the proper tools/knowledge), and hypertonicity (muscle tension) can be improved with stretching, relaxation techniques, soft tissue massage. However, you’re right, the cause of the knots needs to be corrected. Most of the time what’s needed is stretching, strengthening, posture corrections, ergonomic changes, and use of proper body mechanics during functional tasks. However, there are a lot of factors to consider, and every case is different. Best thing you can do is go find a skilled physical therapist that knows their stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can speak as someone who has made what I consider to be an enormous amount of progress in getting rid of knots.  To keep it brief, I play a cardio heavy sport ~4 times a week (except for corona) and have done so for ~17 years.  I played for many years and built up a lot of knots before trying to fix them.</p>
<p>For me, the following things have worked. Sometimes just one of them and with some of the more difficult knots I've needed to combine multiple.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>very deep massage on a regular basis (preferably 1.5-2 hours weekly). The deeper the better.  But also, the pain (and/or ticklishness) you feel during a massage is connected to being tight. So you might need to work up to going deeper. The more you loosen up, the less pain you will feel and the deeper you can go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rolling. Rollers, lacrosse balls, the R8 recovery roller, dock n roll are all good devices to help you release your own knots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>stretching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical therapy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>magnesium supplements.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>massage guns. I like the hypervolt myself but I will also say that it is one of (if not the) most expensive guns out there. There are plenty of guns that will probably be 90% as good for 50% of the price.</p>
</li>
<li>cupping can help a little. I find that it helps loosen up some of the surface (fascial) tightness but not the deep knots. Can be good to do before some of the deeper stuff.</li>

<p>I totally expected them to be a gimmick or a covert masturbatory device. But my god they're good once you get the hang of how to use them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but.... yes short term, not so much in the long term.</p>
<p>Massages can help alleviate the pain and get the body started/guided towards removing <em>that</em>  particular knot. However, its going to show up again.</p>
<p>A very common one is tense/painful shoulders and back, because all (many) of us spend too much time sitting with poor form at a computer for many hours.</p>
<p>The arms being outstretched with droopy shoulders and neck are going to keep tugging at the &quot;table cloth&quot; no matter how often you try to smooth it out with a massage.</p>
<p>Once you've straightened out the cloth/muscle, you want to distribute the ketchup and other condiments (load) so that there isn't an imbalance. This is correcting your posture. Straight back and neck, arms at the right level, this keeps the back muscles from getting too stressed and end up knotting up again. Maybe you add those clips or elastic thingies that look like suspenders to keep it from crumpling up. This is strengthening the surrounding muscle. If you have a stronger core (abs, hips, lower back) its easier to keep your back straight. If you have stronger chest and upper back, your shoulders won't droop as much. If you have stronger shoulders (deltoids and company) and arms, you'll be able to hold a shitty posture for longer before the pain returns.</p>
<p>In my case I can get really bad knots on my glutes (butt!) from running. The only way to relieve the pressure is sitting on a softball and rolling around until it tickles and/or hurts. Then I know that I need to slow down (lower/balance the load), and do glute exercises like hip bridges, squats, bulgarian split squats, lunges (strengthen the entire table cloth).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s basically impossible to determine what it could be from sensation of pain alone. Often times pain is presented in areas that have a hard time contracting due to the imbalance previously mentioned. Think about trying to curl a 50 pound weight with your arm fully extended versus in a shorten position with your elbow next to your body. This simple example can be applied to the entire body not just in agonistic/antagonist relationships (bicep/tricep) but also in more complex kinetic chains and beyond. If I had to take a shot in the dark and I am not willing to stick my professional reputation on this, I would try to use a yoga ball or foam roller on the opposite side while attempting to contract the muscle that is giving you pain. Once again, there is “no simple fix” and a train clinician in person can probably get a much more accurate read.</p>
<p>Luckily due to Covid zoom call assessments have become much more common and that can get one step closer to that assessment that could help you.</p></div>		</li>
