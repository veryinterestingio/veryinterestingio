			<div class="markdown"><p>I have not had the luck the other dryer ball user has. We have 2 long haired cats and a malamute so hair is a constant battle. Plus I shed too. I have lint rollers in my house, car,  and at work. I wear a lot of black,  it's a problem. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't use dryer sheets. 3 cats, 3 dogs (2 of the dogs are of the  large variety). The hair all gets off the fabric and gets in the lint trap effectively.</p>
<p>Not sure wtf all the fuss is about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey! I have 2 dogs including a husky shedding all over me plus I pet and farm sit. All the hair! I use the wool dryer balls and they work fine. Just don't overload the washing or drying machine. Don't over dry your clothes either, you want them just dry! Clean your machines and balls. If you want smells you can add a few drops of essential oil to the wool balls. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here, I stopped using dryer sheets because of allergy issues. The wool balls so a great job of preventing static cling, and help keep the clothes from wrinkling up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're sheep testicles. You can buy them in packs of 6.</p>
<p>They're compressed balls of wool. I don't know the science behind it, how they neutralize static (in theory but not always practice), but they help the clothes dry faster and keep comforter innards fluffy. </p></div>		</li>
