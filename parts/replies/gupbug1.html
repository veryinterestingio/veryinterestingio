			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. Can you find a link to the actual study rather than a news article out of curiosity? I can only find links to other articles on the CNBC site and they don't name the researchers</p></div>		</li>

<p>As someone working in academia, news coverage of research articles is so annoying because they -never cite the source-...</p></div>		</li>

<p>From the Pfizer vaccine, you are 52% protected after the first dose and 95% protected after the second.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's not what efficacy means.  52% isn't <em>your</em> level of protection, it's the population's level of protection.  It would be more accurate (but still not quite right) to say that 52% of the vaccinated population is protected.  Also that number is too low, the current data shows much higher % on the first dose.</p></div>		</li>
