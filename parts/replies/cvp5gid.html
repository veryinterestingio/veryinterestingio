			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to start by saying... Excellent overview. More fair than the average redditor would give the TPP (Although not as rah rah as Economists would like). Few notes...</p>
<p>Your Benefits... also worth noting that as labor standards improve in countries outside NA, it makes it easier for NA workers to compete, which means we won't lose jobs to low-wage workers as often. This is, admittedly a long-term benefit, because this won't change overnight, but it is a benefit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not unreasonable to suggest that any given country is trading away the success of industry A for success in industry B, which, if all things are equal, should come down to a zero-sum game. Economics does not, of course, work like that, but it's still a fair question to examine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Economics &amp; Globalization is NOT a zero sum game because as you increase free trade it is a +Sum game. Remember, sacrificing the success of Industry A for the success of Industry B may lead to a zero-sum jobs gain (In theory), but prices for goods A &amp; B will be cheaper in both (Or in this case all) countries involved. Therefore, to truly lose at this game you would have to lose enough jobs that the lower prices on many, many things would not be worthwhile, which is a failure on the part of the negotiators, not free trade. It is also important to note that when evaluating the Free Trade Treaty, you must consider what would have happened instead of just what did happen. America is in a position where we are bleeding jobs in several industries (Manufacturing comes to mind). NAFTA is often judged based on the manufacturing jobs lost but I've never heard a convincing argument that American workers making &quot;$15-20 an hour&quot; as Bernie likes to quote, would have been able to hold onto those jobs with or without NAFTA.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The TPP's intellectual property provisions, which have been the subject of several leaks, are harsher than existing law, a product (again) of corporate involvement in the deal. They aim to crack down on several ways people use intellectual property, fairly and otherwise, and their scope means there is significant possibility for abuse and harrassment.
• More damagingly, the TPP applies those laws to drugs with an eye to preventing cheaper medicine from being available on the market - products that by rights should be subject to competition as their prices are heavily inflated beyond the cost of production.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leaks are rumors, and the ones I've read suggest that while globally IP protection for medicine might be getting buffed, it will be hurt in North America. The number I've heard is 6 years across the region (Down from 12 in the USA if I remember correctly). This is a meh for American pharma. On one hand, they can't fuck the richest people in the world so thoroughly, but they now have profit incentive in the other 8-9 states. </p>
<p>It is important to remember that the vast majority of pharmaceutical costs come from Research. The Development side is cheap, 10 pills may cost $1.00 in a competitive market, but if the research costs $3,000,000,000 then what motive do researchers have in a competitive market, knowing their competition will simply quickly produce an exact copy. While I think 12 years is clearly too high, there does need to be a protection (Either patent protection, or government buyout of said protection) which gives firms a profit incentive to develop these medicines, or else we will see progress grind to a halt. This would be very good in the short term for those who need new medicine, but in the long run, when there is no new medicine, or it is the lucky find of a grad assistant at Concordia University Chicago, humanity will be far worse off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AFAIK you're totally right about the high cost of researching and creating a <strong><em>totally new</em></strong> class of drugs. But again AFAIK that isn't where the pharmaceutical industry makes the lion's share of their profits. Most so called &quot;new&quot; drugs are created by taking a working drug, changing a molecular bond or two, and selling the patented result as a new &amp; improved version, and is child's play compared to creating a drug from scratch.</p>
<p>As for new from scratch drugs often, like so much technology we take for granted, the heavy lifting is done by a research group funded by a government body, or an institute of higher learning. Pharmaceutical companies often, but not always, do the human trials, dosage research, and of course they do the manufacturing and marketing of the drug. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually ~70% of drug development costs come from clinical trials, which are always undertaken by the company that wants to market the drug-this happens even when &quot;a molecular bond or two&quot; is shifted around. So in technical terms, it is much easier to do this than to discover a completely new molecule and develop it &quot;from scratch&quot;, but clinical trial costs are always going to be there, and overall  cost isn't that different either way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, zero sum games are on the macro scale.  It is entirely possible it is a net positive gain, with all of those gains and more going to large corporations/lenders/ect as a move to weaker bargaining abilities of the working class.  If you want free trade, we need to begin to set more realistic global control of money to prevent tax havens and dummy businesses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah 12 years isn't that high. The amount of time that goes into a drug production is pretty long. It's not fair to watch someone's hard work over some 10 year period get literally stolen by a free rider in China, which does not have the same patent/IP protection. Also that company in China might use dangerous substitutes while putting the drug together; we've seen how companies were faking nitrogen content in milk by adding in Melamine. That's why everyone I know is glad for TPP because it ensures drug safety and patent protection</p></div>		</li>

<p>?</p>
<p>Maybe in some countries? I'm not even sure of that. In Canada, our food and drug regulations really seem quite safe (more so than in the US and other countries outside Europe), which I'm immensely grateful for. Our environmental regulations took a hit (thanks Harper), but our labor laws held strong (I think?). I'm really, really not looking forward to see these standards lowered, and to see my country <strong>sued</strong> if God forbid we try to ban certain products or practices we deem unsafe and destructive. This looks like barely disguised deregulation. TPP advocates don't want stronger regulations and labor laws, it seems like quite the opposite actually.</p>
<p>Except when it comes to patent laws, of course. Pharmaceutical companies aren't going under anytime soon, and as per their corporate structure their profits for their shareholders are more important than their social mission (healing and saving lives). It's farcical really. I don't think abolishing all patent laws would be a wise move, but I certainly won't advocate for <strong>stronger</strong> patent laws. I would much rather see tax incentives and grants than this, if they really need the money which I doubt they do.</p>
<p>I fail to see any benefits, at all. I can't for the life of me think of any. This looks like a race to the bottom.</p>
<p>I want to be wrong. </p>
<p>I would love to see strong, uniform laws and regulations across trade partners which respects the worker's wealth and health, aims to build and maintain a sturdy middle-class and insures sustainable practices which won't wreck the environment. </p>
<p>All I see are measures to strengthen existing monopolies, and it makes me sad.</p>
<p>I would love to be proven wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great write-up! I really look up to your style.</p>
<p>That being said, I feel compelled to share my views on the Canadian supply management system as very little has been said in the media besides relaying the producers' unions messages. For reference, I'm a beef producer, I've dabbled in the milk production since 2012 (while never successful at obtaining quota) and I'm currently writing a book about financial planning for agribusinesses.</p>
<p>First of all, one of the most important burden on newcomers to the production is the cost of quota. When production costs are discussed, those include returns paid on the amounts invested in quota, which are massive (over $25k/lactating cow in Quebec, more elsewhere). If producers were able to reallocated the amounts tied in quota to productive assets, that would go a great length toward making them competitive with imported products.</p>
<p>Also, Canada has an important comparative advantage in milk production as most of its agricultural lands are ill-suited for corn and soybean, while being ideal for alfalfa and other dairy cow feed. For this reason, it should be looking forward to more competitive market, not the other way around. Moreover, many currently abandonned lands could potentially be reclaimed by new producters if it wasn't made so darn difficult by the quota system (the story of my life...).</p>
<p>Finally, (Canadian) milk producers are notoriously poor at controling costs (as are most monololists). It is for this reason that phrase &quot;hay for milk&quot; and &quot;hay for beef&quot; are used by some farm financial analysts: the cost of hay and other crops produced by dairy farmers is often so inflated by capital and other costs that it is treated as a completely different product, even though it's the same plants harvested the same way (I'm not talking about fiber content and other nutritional issues but strictly about production cost analysis).</p>
<p>To tie that up to the TPP discussion, handing out  bits of quota to importers may not ultimately serve the goals pursued by the dealmakers the way authentic economic liberalisation could, especially for a country with as much win as Canada.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While the tpp does have many, many issues I still think it is a deal worth pursuing. Free trade and the lowering of economic barriers between countries has been the foundation of the relative stability of the post ww2 world. As countries integrate their economies more tightly together they inevetibaly become closer politically and socially and a large impetus to go to war (securing economic dominance over another country or region) is removed. By passing the tpp we are linking the east asian countries more tightly with us (the us) and offering their people an escape from crushing poverty. (the movement of us manufacturing jobs to china has been one of, if not the greatest mass uplifting of people from poverty in the history of the world. By doing this you improve the stability of these countries and bring them into the existing world order by allowing them to share in the fruits brought about by capitalism. The alternative is the creation of a second economic zone, one led by China, that will compete directly with the western world. This will lead to rising tensions and a greater risk for a catastrophic war. Yes, jobs from the US will be lost but that is the nature of the global economy in which we live. What we need to do is to offer job re education programs like Germany has to ameliorate this negative effect. Also, the ironic nature of this agreement is that the more that people fight against it, the more the negotiators have to cater to special interest groups to ensure the requisite votes in congress. I could go on and on about this, but my comment will probably get buried anyway. If ya'll are.interested in learning more about this id highly recommend reading the magazine foreign affairs. They have a great, in depth analysis of this treaty and all its ramifications </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Economists such as Paul Krugman are against this deal because depsite being all for free trade and lowering tariffs they point out very little of this trade deal actually involves these things at all.</p>
<p>&quot;First of all, whatever you may say about the benefits of free trade, most of those benefits have already been realized. A series of past trade agreements, going back almost 70 years, has brought tariffs and other barriers to trade very low to the point where any effect they may have on U.S. trade is swamped by other factors, like changes in currency values.</p>
<p>In any case, the Pacific trade deal isn’t really about trade. Some already low tariffs would come down, but the main thrust of the proposed deal involves strengthening intellectual property rights — things like drug patents and movie copyrights — and changing the way companies and countries settle disputes. And it’s by no means clear that either of those changes is good for America.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While some of the ramifications of the intellectual property provisions are troubling, it is important to note that this deal actually decreases the length of time drug companies can hold an exclusive patent in the us from five to twelve years. Of course, this raises the length of said patents in other countries which may cause some people in places like vietnam to lose access to generic drugs. But I'd say it's disingenuous to say that this deal isn't about tarrifs. Some of the greatest sticking points were Japanese tarrifs on rice, american ones on sugar and Canadian ones on livestock. All of these areas have seen at least some tarrifs reduction. Reading through what little of the text I have, I thi k the deal is a win win for everyone involved. Yes, there are some flaws but then that is the nature of politics: you can't let the pursuit of perfect stop you from obtaining something good right now </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you please expand upon your point about catering to special interest groups? I completely agree with you, but I am having trouble phrasing my thoughts and explanation in a concise manner. I would love to see how you went about it.</p>
<p>Also, could you please direct me to the article you are talking about in the Foreign Affairs magazine? I found a few regarding the TPP, and I was wondering which one you are referring to specifically. If possible, is there any chance you could please post the text or pm it to me? Unfortunately, I don't have a subscription right now, but plan on getting one as soon as I can. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the one titled trade trials by Richard katz. The gist of it with regards to special interest groups is that the bi partisan consensus that free trade is good has evaporated in the years since ww2. This is because most of the benefits of growth in the economy have gone to a narrow slice of society while the pain from globalization has hit a relatively larger swath of people. Many people on the left blame free trade for this and many on the right want to protect their business out of patriotic pride and short sighted self interest. Because of this the trade negotiators have to placate certain groups such as the pharmaceutical companies to insure that they will lobby congress to pass the bill. It's really just another manifestation of our dysfunctional political and economic systems rearing their ugly heads. There are ways to ameliorate the pain of globalization but so far the political will to do has not appeared </p></div>		</li>
