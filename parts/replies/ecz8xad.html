			<div class="markdown"><p>Ugh, I feel you. Sometimes I'll have a half day at work. I can plop right on my bed then or really anytime during the day and fall asleep in 5 minutes flat. But I just don't understand if I force myself not to take a nap, when it's nightime, and I go to bed, sometimes it takes me an hour to fall asleep, tossing and turning. I know I can't be the only one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The anxiety of needing to sleep prohibits it. The trick is to not try and just embrace lying there. Actually try to enjoy it to the point where you hope you <em>don't</em> fall asleep. You'll be off in seconds. Also, try to focus on the back of your eyelids.. it really works if you do it properly and it feels really good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moving from the couch to bed gets you blood pumping, at least a little. (More so of your bed is upstairs from the couch.) You need another relax and calm down period after that in bed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because you walk to bed, actually. You kind of turn yourself on and become more awake, just a primal human thing.. So it takes time to get into the doozy sleepy mode again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is it I can be dead tired all day long, then around 9pm or so I all of a sudden feel more awake  and want to start getting stuff done?</p>
<p>Pretty much every day I'm tired and thinking I'm gonna get to bed early, but then that time rolls around and I'm wide awake and don't end up falling asleep til midnight. </p></div>		</li>
