			<div class="markdown"><p>I can attest to disease having an impact. I grew up in urban India in a middle class family. However out apartments were built on unsanitary conditions (waste filled canal). I had good nutrition growing up but I was always sick as a toddler. I thought always coughing was normal for everyone. Consequently I ended up stunted (5’6”, shorter than my dad and grandfather). On the bright side my immune system is rock solid.</p></div>		</li>

And your father's diet?</p></div>		</li>
