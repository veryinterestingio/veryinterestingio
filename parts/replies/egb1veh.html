<p>When we talk about stars &quot;igniting,&quot; we're usually talking about nuclear fusion &quot;switching on.&quot; But the rate of fusion increases smoothly as the temperature in the star's core increases.</p>

<p>It is important to note that this is also due to quantum tunnelling. </p>
<p>Even our own Sun isn't nearly hot enough that we can explain the reactions simply with temperature. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting. On another note I went from wikipedia of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling" target="_blank">quantum tunneling</a> to how nuclei have to overcome the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb_barrier" target="_blank">coulomb barrier</a> with it, which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatics" target="_blank">electrostatic interaction</a> they have to overcome, which includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cat_demonstrating_static_cling_with_styrofoam_peanuts.jpg" target="_blank">this wonderful &quot;cat demonstrating static cling&quot; picture</a></p></div>		</li>
