			<div class="markdown"><p>Boy oh boy! The question around COVID and thrombosis has been very challenging and it has consumed my time for the last six months. We know that these patients appear to have very high rates of hospital-associated blood clots. They have high rates of DVT and PE. It’s not clear whether they have lots of risk factors. They tend to be the ones in the hospital who are very sick, and may also be older and/or overweight, diabetes, and/or other risk factors. Is it that or is it the COVID itself that is making the blood so sticky? That’s the problem, but it’s not clear yet. Secondly, a lot of clinicians looking at COVID patients have found that they’ve given bigger doses of blood thinners and patients are still having clots. That’s because we’re trying to reduce the risk. If we give a blood thinner, we reduce the risk by about 50%. The second problem is in those who have pneumonia/long failure and need ventilation. They have a lot of inflammation int heir lungs and that tends to cause clots. That really needs treatment with anti-inflammatories; anticoagulants will not help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! As a follow to this my question is if you have a clotting disorder like Factor V Leiden does this make you more susceptible to the clotting complications of Covid 19?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s such a great question. Thanks for asking this question. I get it asked it a lot at the moment. The first thing to say is if you have an inherited sticky blood such as Factor 5 Leiden, you haven’t had a higher risk of COVID pneumonia. I don’t think that we are seeing any patients who have very sticky blood, and having a bad time with COVID and clotting. That’s because everybody who is in that situation is already getting anticoagulation, and the other thing is that it’s the COVID making the blood more sticky rather than the underlying inherited sticky blood.</p></div>		</li>
