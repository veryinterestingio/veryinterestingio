<p>So we have a pretty classic square/cube situation going on here, with small objects being highly resistant to further destruction.</p></div>		</li>

It's of course a highly simplified explanation, but it already works very well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add onto this, I'm willing to bet there's an extra factor for ocean plastics: <strong>bending and twisting (i.e. torsion) from differential flow of the water</strong>.</p>
<p>Even/especially across fairly short distances, at any given moment, there are likely to be variations in the direction and speed that water is flowing. There are a lot of variables like the size, shape, and strength of the plastic as well as the characteristics of the flow field, and I'm not sure whether this process alone could stress the plastic enough to snap or rip it. But, repeated flexing of the plastic could weaken it, and/or a piece of plastic being flexed would be more susceptible to external damage.</p>
<p>This would have the greatest effect on anything thin, whether flat or curved, and would likely have the least effect on anything spherical. As things break apart and get weathered down, they tend to become spherical.</p>
<p><strong>So <em>if this process is a factor</em>, microplastics would tend to be the right shape to not be affected by twisting and bending, and would be small enough that they aren't really subject to differential flow in the first place.</strong></p></div>		</li>
