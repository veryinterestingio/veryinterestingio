			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting take.  I suffered from bright, bright red blushing throughout my school days.  It was especially bad in middle school.  Only then the &quot;group&quot; didn't back off, they fanned the flames and my face grew beet red as a result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that was my experience in my younger days.  While I still suffer from blushing, it doesn't happen frequently and nobody brings attention to it these days, thank goodness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was at its worst in middle school.  It can still happen, though the last time I recall it happening badly was about four years ago.  I'd say it started happening less as I became a working adult.  It seems there is a correlation, at least for me, between becoming more comfortable in my skin and being around like-minded, friendly people.  Also, if it happens in adulthood, it doesn't 'linger' like it did in school days, since no one is bringing attention to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ha! Not in my life. I've had people blow up my spot over it. Pretty sure they found enjoyment in belittling me further.</p>
<p>I suppose it could also be a means of attempting to terminate a member who doesn't fit in. I can't imagine a more vulnerable position to be in and when a groups reacts negatively to it it can be crushing.</p>
<p>Luckily, we live in a time when we can reinvent ourselves and social groups can change.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If that was the case, it probably would've been &quot;selected against&quot; a long time ago. More likely is that it's a physical indicator that you know you've made a (social) mistake which would be important for the group to know. It's essentially acknowledging that you messed up or did something inappropriate; the opposite of which would be a group member that can't or doesn't understand that they've done something inappropriate, which would not be good for the group. Blushing indicates that you are aware of the group's observance and what is acceptable or unacceptable to that group.</p>
<p>But also, ascribing evolutionary significance to things is a dangerous game so what I wrote could also be bullshit.</p></div>		</li>
