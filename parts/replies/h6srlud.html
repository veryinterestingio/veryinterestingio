			<div class="markdown"><p>Your welcome.</p>
<p>It is a very loaded question. This is because the answer leads to more questions.</p>
<p>I could’ve said “the rich get richer by buying assets” but it wouldn’t have made sense unless you had a good amount of economical knowledge. </p>
<p>And, if you had a good amount of economical knowledge, you wouldn’t have asked this question at all.</p>
<p>But it is really good that you asked this, because this little knowledge may mean that you, yourself would make better financial decisions in your life. </p>
<p>Or it could mean that someone else could read this 5 or 10 years from now and become the politician that stops this or the financial accountant that furthers this.</p></div>		</li>

It seems that taking form the rich leads to even worse conditions for the poor (e.g. less taxes to government, fewer jobs..).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Imagine a room, a dollar and 3 people. Bob borrows 1$ from Alice, Bob then buys 1$ worth of homework from Charlie, Alice borrows 1$ from Charlie, and the above repeats 3 times.</p>
<p>Now only 1$ exists in the room but the rich each 'own' 3$, more than they started with.</p>

<p>YouTube, when it was first made available as an app on smartphones, couldn't play in the background. Smartphones just didn't have enough power to run apps simultaneously. However, when smartphones did get more powerful, you could start a YouTube video and keep it playing in the background. This allowed savvy individuals to use YouTube to play their music, for free, in high quality, with custom Playlist and shuffle and everything.</p>
<p>Go try it now. Sure, android phones have the feature where the video player shrinks and continues to play, but it doesn't work for music, or children's videos. YouTube pauses those things automatically, regardless of the mini player.</p>
<p>You'll also conveniently get an advertisement for the new YouTube Music App! Curate a playlist and listen to your songs in the background ad free, for a small monthly subscription.</p>
<p>In this example, YouTube artificially created barriers that made it harder for people to do what they wanted. They could have kept things the same, and it would have been far easier. Changing features in any program is bound to introduce problems and issues that have to be worked through in order to actually make the change effective.</p>
<p>But they did change it. And now, people pay YouTube each and every month for something they used to be able to do for free.</p>
<p>However, looking back at your question, I realize that I may have jumped the gun. You seem to be asking what happens when there simply isn't any more money left in circulation.</p>
<p>That, I don't know.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I think I can construct an answer to this from what I know and other things that have been mentioned in this thread:</p>
<p>The money in circulation is a moot point to these ultra-rich, they aren't taking physical money and literally hoarding it. Their wealth comes from the assets they have and which keep rising in value because they are completely decoupled from any tangible value.</p>
<p>To give a concrete-ish basic example: Say a company has 10000 stocks, 6000 are owned by the owner and 4000 are owned by people who are interested in trading them. Say the company has record profits a few years in a row so the stock is rising and the owner gives himself a few millions in bonus and buys a new house or whatever. Meanwhile the stock price has also risen from 1000 to 5000 per stock because of the 40 public stocks being heavily traded/desired.</p>
<p>Now those few millions aren't 'out of circulation' because they have been re-inserted via the building company. Meanwhile the owner's overal value did raise from 6 mil to 30 mil without him actually getting any tangible money because the perceived value of his owned stocks rose.</p>
<p>(Also note ofc he still has a lot of ways to leverage this increased value without just selling them, like borrowing money at low interest against them)</p></div>		</li>

carefully planned out malicious plans like most people think, i don’t remember if it’s was apple or google but apparently since their company works in the US and they keep their money in Ireland, both countries can’t tax them bc of their policies, it obviously goes deeper than that but that’s all I remember dumbed down for ya</p></div>		</li>
