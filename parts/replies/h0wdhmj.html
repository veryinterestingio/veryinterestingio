			<div class="markdown"><p>I felt the same way. Played piano for 8 years, did theory, played the French horn in junior high and high school. In all those years was this ever explained so clearly. The lightbulb definitely lit up today for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea i can see that but it is a pretty good explanation. I  never learned theory just picked up a guitar and learned chords from tabs and while i cant grasp all of what he is saying i can understand the basic ideas and it kinda opened my eyes to hard i made theory seem in my mind. Wish i never put down the guitar</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's basically a set or rules making order out of disorder. </p>
<p>It doesn't matter what the rules are, as long as everyone knows and follows the same rules. </p>
<p>A note does not have to be perfect, as long as all other notes are tuned off of it.  When tuning a guitar, you tune one string, and tune the rest off  of it.  So if you're a little off on the first, the rest will be equally off and you get harmony. </p>
<p>Likewise, every instrument in a symphony will be tuned against one instrument, usually an Oboe playing an A-note.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the kind of things that is difficult/long to explain, but makes so much sense when you experience it. </p>
<p>I'm sure if someone blind-tested you different run up and down on a piano, you would be able to tell which are in a key and which are not (sounds good or bad). You might even be able to tell which sounds happy and which sounds sad (major and minor). </p>
<p>It's actually surprising how these concepts are intuitive when you experience them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're not intuitive. They are learned from being exposed to music that is meant to make you feel that way.</p>
<p>What was considered happy or sad, or even normal in the 1400s is completely different than today.</p>
<p>This is actually a problem, as there are less people these days that are experimenting and trying out new musical ideas (look at most American pop music these days).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth noting that if you look closely at the Ws and Hs in the major and minor scales, the minor is simply a shifted version of the major.  And so for every major key, there's a minor key that uses the exact same notes (called the relative minor).  For instance C major uses all the same notes as A minor.  So why does one sound &quot;sad&quot; and the other &quot;happy&quot; if they both use the same notes? It's all in how you write the melodies and chord progressions, along with what instruments are used and how they are played.  A &quot;sad&quot; song might use the A note as its &quot;home&quot; note and a happy song might use C.  But even this is an oversimplification.  Lots of &quot;funky&quot; songs are written in minor keys but nobody would call them sad.  So whether a song reads as happy or sad or something else entirely all really depends on how the notes are used in context.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was demonstrated to me very well in jazz band way back in the day. The song was this rip-roaring high-speed fun fest of all sections just going mad together in a major key, but then my teacher split off the brass to individually tune their harmonies together, one note at a time. And when you drew out the arpeggios singularly, rather than punching them out in staccato, the minor harmonies were all gut-wrenchingly somber, while the major ones were contented and relaxing. So while it is also not a hard and fast rule (as there are almost none in music to begin with), tempo and dwell often have a lot to do with how a chord or melody progression elicits emotion as well.</p></div>		</li>
