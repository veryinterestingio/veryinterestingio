			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah. a lot of math teachers aren't very good at relating the maths to the real world that we experience so it just seems pointless.
but math is for modeling the real world so we can better understand it. so approaching it from &quot;you have a problem, how do you solve it?&quot; is much more useful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I played a game where you have to map the region in a similar fashion, you started with a known point and identified multiple unique landmarks, identifying them as a line from your position.
Then at a different position you would use them to identify their exact location, meaning you now can use multiple known landmarks to map your surroundings (including landmarks)</p>
<p>The game was miasmata, the best &quot;walking simulator&quot; I have played so far.</p></div>		</li>
