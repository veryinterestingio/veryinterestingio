			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition, even the most tiny pieces of debris, tiny on a human scale, can still cause a major amount of damage to other satellites and anything in orbit. This is because despite their small size, they are zipping around insanely fast since it's space, meaning that once they hit something they can cause a crap ton of damage which can release even more tiny pieces of debris.</p></div>		</li>

<p>and from a Chinese test shooting down a satellite with a missile in 2007.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reporting of that story was woeful. Both the US and Russia have had anti satellite tech for some time &amp; both have used them on many occasions, first as initial tests, then later to take out their own malfunctioning vehicles. It was old news by the time the Chinese joined the party but that didn't stop our media presenting it as if they were the first to take this &quot;provocative&quot; step. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the nonsensical idea that the Chinese are responsible for <em>half</em> of the debris out there only goes to show how pervasive that propaganda was. Especially with the USA being responsible for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_West_Ford" target="_blank">Project West Ford</a>, something that makes that one Chinese crap up there pale in significance. America once tried to <em>deliberately</em> do what OP is asking, it created an international outcry and they only stopped doing it <em>after</em> the rest of the world went absolutely livid. Many are still up there, <a href="http://stuffin.space/?intldes=1963-014DJ&amp;search=westford" target="_blank">there's a cluster of them flying over Texas right now</a>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You appear to have failed to pay attention to those articles. The relevant part wasn't that China had anti-satellite missiles or even that China had tested them. The issue was the altitude chosen at which to destroy a satellite as part of the test. The most disruptive anti-satellite test prior to that was conducted by the US at ~525km in 1985 with debris believed to have nearly completely de-orbited within a decade (although a single outlier was tracked all the way up to 2004 before finally losing orbit). China chose to conduct its 2007 test at an altitude of ~865km, high enough that most of the debris will remain in orbit for decades to centuries.</p></div>		</li>
