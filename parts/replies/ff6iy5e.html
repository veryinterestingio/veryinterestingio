<p>Throw a normie at a free lobster and prime rib buffet and they’ll gorge themselves to sleep in excitement. For those working the buffet it’s like “don’t get too excited you’re gonna pass out....and you did. That was stupid”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The notion that an &quot;adrenaline rush&quot; itself causes a drop in energy is not necessarily the case. We actually experience &quot;adrenaline rushes&quot; multiple times a day. The adrenal glands produce cortisol, otherwise known as the stress hormone. The body sees different things as a stress. Exercise, lack of food, lack of sleep, etc will all stimulate cortisol. In order to reduce cortisol in the body, the stress needs to be removed. So in many cases, it's not the extended use of cortisol that will cause a drop in energy, it's more along the lines of, we need rest and sleep in order to properly regulate the cortisol we use during the day. If you're experiencing a severe drop in energy after hyper-arousal, it is more likely it's from the physical (or mental) exertion put forth. For instance, if you went at an all-out sprint, you will eventually build up an excess of lactic acid in the muscles, causing fatigue and soreness. This would happen regardless of how the sprint was initiated.</p></div>		</li>
