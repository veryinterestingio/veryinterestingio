			<div class="markdown"><p>Also fun fact the wax can actually heat up enough that the whole surface ignites. I did that accidentally trying to use a candle to heat up something. Having the object above the candle trapped enough heat in to cause the surface of the wax to vaporize and the flame became huge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An easy way to replicate this is to place 2 tea lights (with the metal cups) next to each other, then stack a third one (also in the cup) on top (between the two wicks). Light all three, and at some point the top one should become hot enough that the entire surface starts burning.</p>
<p>Also: please be careful and don't burn your house down. The is stuff is HOT and flammable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's very hard to turn off once it's really going (best to take the oxygen away by putting a pot or something over it). Please be careful and don't burn the forest down either.. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why you don't keep a bunch of candles too close to each other. Lots of house fires have started when too many candles have been too close to each other</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did that at a memorial service. Each person came up, remembered someone, lit a candle, then put it into a tray of sand. After 20-30 candles the wax that had melted into the sand caught and the whole surface of the tray was burning. Scary, but contained.</p></div>		</li>
