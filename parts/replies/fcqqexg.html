<p>Also everyone should have a carbon monoxide detector in their home. You don’t want to mess around with that silent killer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doctor here and honestly not really, the symptoms of chronic low level CO poisoning are extremely non-specific and could be caused by hundreds of different things honestly. Standard ED screening does not detect CO poisoning and it would often be missed if someone comes in just feeling malaise, myalgias, and lethargy;  there are many other causes of such symptoms that would be far more common</p></div>		</li>
