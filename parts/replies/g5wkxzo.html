			<div class="markdown"><p>plants growing toward light is not simple. When I was a kid, it was thought that the roots grow toward the Earth due to gravity (geotropism). NASA has taken plants to outer space, growing them in zero light and zero gravity conditions, and The Roots still go towards soil, the leaves and stuff go opposite direction regardless of light. It is unexplained as far as i know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I am wrong but hasnt science proven hard wired survival memories have been shown to be passed down to offspring via DNA. So turtles who go towards the light and live can pass this info on down the hereditary line.....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Hard wired&quot; is a bit of a misnomer.</p>
<p>The majority of your day to day behaviour is &quot;hard wired&quot; and genetic.</p>
<p>You have a natural tendency to wake up in the morning because of light, dictated by melatonin cycle, largely genetically controlled. You got this by being a predator that hunters during light.</p>
<p>You go and eat your breakfast, this is likely to be food that is high yield in energy (or tastes like it is) this is dictated by genes that select for you getting a massive pleasure boost for eating efficient foods.</p>
<p>When you read the paper on the way to work the only way you are able to read written language is that humans and many mammals brains have developed as pattern recognition machines (spotting predator movement in periphery, hunting patterns, facial recognition, social interaction).</p>
<p>People complicate things by thinking genes &quot;know&quot; something. A gene/trait is either survival wise advantageous, disadvantageous or neutral. It really makes absolutely no difference whether the gene is for a physical characteristic or modifies behaviour.</p>
<p>How does any animal know that having sex procreates? The ones that don't, didn't procreate. You can replace &quot;having sex&quot; with pretty much any behaviour outside of human recreation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do our genes tell us to take our hand off something that’s hot? It’s just instinct, think of it like a computer: their brain is wired/programmed in a way that their response to light is to move towards it. Light -&gt; photoreceptors -&gt; nerves/brain -&gt; response, with a bunch of biochemistry in between. We haven’t mapped out their brains, nor humans’, so I don’t think the exact mechanism is known, and it would probably take an entire paper to explain the biochemistry involved.</p>
<p>Even plants have phototropism, where they grow towards a light source and rearrange their chloroplast to maximize photosynthesis. It’s all through highly specialized proteins, hormones, and/or neurotransmitters.</p></div>		</li>
