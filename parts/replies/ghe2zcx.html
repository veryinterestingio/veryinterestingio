<p>The article says “scientists don’t really know how”, so I’m not sure what you expect Reddit to tell you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Articles often say things like that when the writer doesn't understand the established science well enough to explain it or when they can't be bothered to find out what the current consensus is among scientists. The real answer is likely what you've indicated, basically it's complicated and there are a lot of factors, so the answer can't be pinned down to one simple thing. OP was right to come ask it here, because your comment and others like it provided a much better picture than the article.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, though the article may still be right. Essentially the headline is saying “scientists have not come to a consensus view on...” such and such a thing a lot of the time, not that no one has ever proposed an explanation that at least they individually were happy with.</p>
<p>Then once we get to Reddit and get a helpful thought through explanation by one person we may well not be getting a consensus view or even majority view as far as the scientific community as a whole is concerned even if that one person is a good quality scientist and is pretty convinced by the argument they’re making - they could still be wrong, and the majority of people on Reddit, who aren’t subject matter experts, will know no better.</p>
<p>(Newton was a pretty good scientist, and yet he was convinced by the corpuscular theory of light, which has since been discredited - being wrong about something and even arguing aggressively for it doesn’t make someone a bad scientist)</p></div>		</li>
