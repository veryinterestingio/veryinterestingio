			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact you are also left or right dominant eyed. </p>
<p>Pick a point like a lamp/door/etc far away and with both eyes open and hold up a finger to cover it.... then close one eye and then the other.  </p>
<p>When your dominant eye is open it will still seem covered, with your non dominant eye it will move a few inches.</p>
<p>Edit: if this technique doesn’t work try
/u/Rugged_Twink suggestion</p>
<p>“The way I prefer to do it is to overlap my hands on top of each other (kinda like you are trying to catch a football, albeit very poorly) so that the grooves between my thumb and index finger on each hand form a hole a little larger than a quarter. I then look at an object through that and see which eye allows me to see the object when I close one or the other.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Got a fun fact about that one. Here in the UK, people playing pool often adopt the stance of Joe Davis, who was snooker world champion for 15 years running. Joe, just like you, had a different dominant hand to his eye, and so he held a cue in a manner suited to that, which nobody at the time realised. As a result of him dominating snooker, everybody copied his technique (despite it being technically wrong for most people) and it became so culturally ingrained that today you'll see people in pubs using it, despite them having no idea who he is</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Practice shooting with both eyes open. Allows for better situational awareness and target acquisition. Doesn't work as well when using a scope if your hand/eye dominance is crossed, but I've started shooting with both eyes open the past couple years and its helped me double and triple up when varmint hunting--coyotes especially. Then again, I'm right eye and right hand dominant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IDK what they're on about, with both eyes open and focusing on a distant object, you should see two semi-transparent fingers.  I don't know how you're supposed to cover the object you're looking at. </p>
<p>Instead, hold your arms out and put your hands together to form a little triangle/hole between your thumbs and index fingers, and look at the distant object thorugh the hole with both eyes.  Now slowly bring your hands closer to your face, while keeping the object you're focused on in the center of the hole between your hands.  Your hands will come towards your dominant eye.</p>
<p>EDIT: People seem to be having trouble with this, but it has always worked for me.  I messed around with it and I see what people are saying about having the same problems as covering it with a finger. </p>
<p>First, focus on the object, then bring your hands together and frame them around it, while still focusing on the object.  It does not need to be a teeny tiny hole, just get your hands around it like a frame, and then bring it slowly towards your face. </p>
<p>Don't form a hole between your hands and then try to find the object, look at it first and bring your hands together around it.  That should do the trick.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: Realistically, it probably means that you have a significantly stronger or weaker eye and that your non-dominant eye gets a notably more different picture than your dominant one. Your finger appears to be in line with the object from your dominant eye, but your non-dominant eye is focusing on the object from a different angle where your finger isn't in the way, so a combination of both images lets you &quot;see through&quot; it. I see the same thing when I do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've ridden horses for 20 years. Most seem to have a dominant lead and weirdly they mostly seem to be lefties. I've speculated that could come from most riders being righties so the left lead being easier to work on. But it's awesome other animals can have dominant sides</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh interesting! It's definitely a thing that the left lead is easier for rightie riders to ask for, ride on, and work with. And definitely a thing that horses tend to pick up the left lead more easily and often default to the left lead, and they're more supple, comfortable, and easier to work on to the left.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I started school in the late 80s, they tried to force me to write right-handed. They tried to self-diagnose me with dysgraphia. </p>
<p>At some point they convinced my Mom to have me tested and that test allegedly took all of like 15 minutes because they watched me perform other tasks with my left hand dominantly and asked why I didn't write left handed and said it was cause they wouldn't let me.</p>
<p>So then they let me write left handed and things magically got better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes sense anyway. We write from left to right. If you’re left handed, you’re just going to smudge your writing and get ink on your hand.</p>
<p>If you write in Arabic, you go from right to left though. I’d be interested to see if Arabic people tend to be lefties but if iirc, their writing direction had something to do with writing into stone with hammers and chisels. The predominant hand held the hammer, and the left held the chisel so you could see what you have written so far.</p></div>		</li>
