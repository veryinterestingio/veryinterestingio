			<div class="markdown"><p>Well disappear? No. Likely fade away. </p>
<p>However, if a civilization came to exist in the sufficiently far future, they may think they were the only galaxy because all the other galaxies had receded below the detectable limits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theory: given that on a long enough time scale, all things are possible.. And that on a long enough time scale, all galaxies may fly out of view and in fact all protons evaporate... Could the universe as we know it simply be the latest iteration, in a long line of eventually inevitable big bangs?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Galaxies over the &quot;horizon&quot; are ones where the photons would take longer than the age of the universe to reach us. The material just on the other side of the horizon is where the photons would take <em>just</em> the age of the universe to reach us.</p>
<p>What that means is that as we approach the &quot;horizon&quot;, we see the earlier and earlier universe. We see the entire history of the universe back to its origin. So we see galaxies in earlier and earlier stages of evolution - messy early galaxies with lots of gas and really irregular structure. Then we don't see galaxies past some stage because <em>no galaxies had formed yet</em>. And in the end, we reach the point where the universe was dense and hot and smooth, and that's the cosmic microwave background.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. In fact eventually it will get to the point where the only galaxies we will be able to observe are the ones in our own local group. Possibly even to the point where the only galaxies a future version of humanity is aware of is the Milky Way and Andromeda, should the universes expansion be exponential as some predictions show.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very simplified:</p>
<p>Imagine three dots A, B, C. Move dot B 1cm away and dot C an additional 9cm (so 10cm in total). Now, every minute move dots B and C 1mm further away from A for every cm they started. At 10 minutes, measure the distance of B away from A (It'll be 2cm). Now measure C (It'll be 20cm away).</p>
<p>Now, do it again. </p>
<p>After 10 minutes, B will now be 4cm away and C will now be 40cm!</p>
<p>Nothing has moved and yet C is apparently speeding away from A faster and faster. But it's not, like dots on an inflating balloon, the fabric on which they sit is growing and more  space equals more space for space! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The expansion rate of the universe is measured in speed per unit of distance. At the current time it is measured at 67 km per second per million parsecs (3.2 million light years).   So, the further away something is located, the faster it is receding. At 13.2 B ly distance, the speed of recession is 280k km/sec. The speed of light is 299k km/second, so the most distantly visible galaxies are receding at better than 90% the speed of light. Except, by now, they're more than 30 B ly distant, and yes they are receding from us greater than the speed of light. Someone can do the math to estimate how much longer before the light they emitted some billions of years ago will no longer be able to reach our location. I'm sure the calculations have some non-linear components, both because the universe was expanding slower, earlier in its history, and because the rate of expansion in increasing due to dark energy. </p></div>		</li>
