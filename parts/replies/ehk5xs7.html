			<div class="markdown"><p>This is due to the head shadow effect, where low frequency sounds have longer, wider wavelengths that can wrap around your head and hit both ears. Higher frequency, shorter wavelengths are blocked by your head so only one ear hears completely - telling your brain the direction it comes from</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But I thought you could locate things due to the timing of the sound hitting both ears. I would think two ears picking up a sound are critical to being able to locate where it's coming from. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s another part of it. It’s the interaural time difference. But this is less accurate the closer a sound source gets to directly in front or behind so there are other ways for the brain to compensate. There’s also intensity differences between sound hitting one ear first </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The above comment is slightly wrong. Very low frequency sounds are hard to locate because the wavelength is very long. This makes it hard for your brain to estimate the times of the peaks and troughs, which is normally what it compares between the two ears to determine location. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably linked to your comment - In 1999 Leeds university proposed changes to ambulance sirens which included a burst of white noise which allow you to get a directional fix on where it is coming from.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the UK most trucks/wagons/lorries have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa28lIGuxq8" target="_blank">white noise reversing beeper</a> instead of the usual &quot;beep&quot; sound for this very reason. </p>
<p>The only thing is when I first heard one I didn't instantly recognise it as a vehicle reversing, although the momentary confusion was outweighed by being able to instantly look exactly where the sound was coming from and get out of the way</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This plus a helicopter is generally lower and therefore reflecting off more buildings, hills etc.</p>
<p>I work at a hospital (regular helicopter operations) with an airport nearby (regular landings of small turboprop aircraft). When they're low, it's very difficult to locate either. When they're higher, it's reasonably easy to locate both. But generally the helicopter is lower than the plane and the sound is bouncing around much more</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you think the fact that planes only make the noise in one direction where as a helicopter makes a chopping noise on all sides so the sound spreads out and bounces around more?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking this too and I’m sure it definitely is a factor but the further the helicopter gets away from you the less this becomes a factor yet they are still hard to locate at a distance.</p></div>		</li>
