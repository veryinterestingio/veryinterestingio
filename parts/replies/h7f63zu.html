			<div class="markdown"><p>You clearly know a lot more about this than I, so could you check my reasoning in the following?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Rain is always at least as cold as the air around it, so water into which rain fell tends to be colder than water at the surface air temperature. So if the river is at surface air temperature (i.e. not spring-fed) rain should cool it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also: OF COURSE RIVERS CHANGE TEMPERATURE WITH THE SEASONS! sometimes they even freeze.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This assumes a quick response and that rain enters the river immediately, which is more the exception than the rule. This is why the effect noted by Brown and Hannah is at least in part specific to small, steep, mountainous catchments. In these settings, the lag between precipitation and discharge (e.g., in the sense of a classic <a href="http://blackpoolsixthasgeography.pbworks.com/f/1265744759/Storm%20Hydrograph.png" target="_blank">storm hydrograph</a>) may be very short such that this is the case. However, when lag times are longer and depending on where the rain occurs within a catchment, this does not necessarily have to be the case. </p>
<p>Also, more generally the relation between air temperature and stream temperature does not imply that stream temperature = air temperature (as shown in many of the graphs in the linked papers in the original response).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess would be that the effect would be really small for two reasons:  </p>
<ol>
<li>The volume of water in the river prior to the rainfall would usually be significantly greater than the the volume of water that was added from rain  </li>
<li>While it is true that the rain drops would be colder than the air around it, it's not necessarily going to be <strong>much</strong> colder than the water in the river itself</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In OP's case it's likely the opposite, mountain streams are fed by springs and snowmelt which is almost always colder than the air or the rain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to add on a little sub level, non scientific response to address the main issue. Boy scouts take the polar bear plunge all the time (supervised by trained individuals.) They train themselves to overcome shock as a means of learning survival in emergency situations and then take a 2 minute dip in a lake with freezing temperatures. So I don't think it's a major concern if the river is a bit colder from a rain storm, but you can definitely look into ways to be prepared for hypothermia should an issue arise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad you mentioned snowmelt here. If the mountain stream is partially snowmelt-fed, it does seem a reasonable guess that a rain event would lower the temperature of the stream, since it will produce a sudden influx of cold snowmelt into the stream.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is predicated on the assumption that the rain occurs in a part of the catchment that has snow, but yes, rain-on-snow events can often produce large meltwater influxes and in this case it would be reasonable to expect a response in stream temperature (depending on the background details).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the rivers and streams I encounter are snow-melt and more specifically glacier melt fed. These seem to be coldest (although they are always cold) on sunny and warm days. My personal hypothesis is simply increased snow and ice melting, which means a smaller contribution from water feed that has warmed up from time in marshes etc. Is there data to support falling stream temperatures in hot days in these conditions?</p></div>		</li>
