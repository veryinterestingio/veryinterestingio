			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, but if you go <em>towards</em> the clock tower, you would see the light right away, but time would still be passing slower for you than other people. How does that work?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it's like that episode of Phineas &amp; Ferb where they went around the globe in 24 hours to create the longest summer day ever? Because I feel like that should have been brought up sooner in this thread. I mean, the sub's called ELI5. Examples from cartoons seems perfect for this very specific thing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the same reason, any information being transferred to anything is relative to the amount of time is spent transferring it. we're all moving, our current experience of time isn't the true speed time moves at</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may as well be frozen from the clock's perspective as well, because neither would be able to communicate with each other as they cannot move faster than light. The way causality was explained to me was, even though light left the sun 8 minutes ago, it may as well be instant since no information can travel to me faster than that. If the sun disappeared 8 minutes ago, it may as well have happened instantly right now from my perspective because 8 minutes ago nothing as an effect from it's disappearance could have reached me during that time. In other words, how would you know it happened 8 minutes ago. Literally nothing could communicate that info to you until you experience it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If he actually was able to go the speed of light while moving away from the clock tower wouldn’t he actually just see darkness since no light would be able to get into his eyes? </p>
<p>Meaning it wouldn’t stay looking the same to him until he slowed down, it’d all just vanish until he slowed down and was finally able to get into his eyes again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you don't mind, I'll answer your question with a question</p>
<p>If that were true, how do we see the far away galaxies,  that are moving away from us faster than light?</p>
<p>Because remember the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate! Hehe I love this stuff these are the days I love reddit</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the ones moving away from us at the speed of light would still be visible because the light that came off of them isn’t being pulled away with them it’s coming towards us. </p>
<p>The only way we wouldn’t see them is if we were also moving the exact opposite way from them at the speed of light. making the light never able to reach us.</p>
<p>Which may already be a thing and we’ll never get to see since the light can’t catch us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't this question assume speeds that violate rules? Last I heard, nothing could move faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>...Or did things change on me when I wasn't looking?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This actually has practical applications in GPS satellites, among other things. The satellites use their clocks to figure out how far they’ve travelled, which is used to figure out position (from what I understand. Totally possible that I’m wrong).  Satellites have to move so quickly, that their built-in clocks change at a sliiiiightly different pace than on earth. It’s not much, but it’s enough where over a couple months, the accuracy of the satellite can be off my miles, making them very expensive garbage in space. By taking into account the time-dilation because they move so quickly, the engineers were able to compensate for that and keep accuracy indefinitely. Without understanding Einstein’s theory of relativity, we would never have been able to get accurate gps.</p></div>		</li>
