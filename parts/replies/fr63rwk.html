			<div class="markdown"><p>A question, then. For a male with impaired testosterone production, might it be possible for these natural fluctuations to wind up having a much more pronounced effect by tipping his hormone levels above and below critical points?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really, there's no &quot;critical point&quot;.  </p>
<p>The hour-to-hour fluctuations aren't that large, and totally normal.  </p>
<p>If you have a genuine low-t problem, it may cause symptomatic complaints.  The fluctuating nature is there regardless.  Do the immediate-effect symptoms (that is, like things other than long-term weight gain) get worse later in the day as testosterone declines?   Probably, you'd expect it to follow the drop in testosterone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another tough question. When it comes to physiological changes, apart from a few specific processes there isn't as much a 'threshold' as there is 'more cells in the tissue/group are doing X than Y so the overall measurable trend is X.&quot; The point where physiological change becomes detectable is always a moving target. For a male with primary hypoandrogenism you typically get an upstream increase in signaling hormones (LH for testosterone) as your body tries to increase the downstream product. Increasing LH from the pituitary requires GRH release from the hypothalamus. GRH also increases FSH production from the Pituitary, which increases Sertoli cell activity in men (the cells that produce sperm.) Sertoli cells are also responsible for creating (or rather altering from testosterone) Estradiol (Estrogen). This means that, depending on the cause for the low T, you can have a rise in estrogen that has more of a physiologic (telarche, lipogenesis, ect) and Psychologic effect on an individual than just the low testosterone. Because low T-levels often leads to cells throughout the body over-expressing the Nucleic receptors, an acute release of testosterone could signal more cells but because the effects of testosterone take a while to be expressed anyways, it's likely that some other transcriptional regulator would inhibit the effects of testosterone once the high levels of Testosterone are cleared from the body. It would take a regular, periodic increase in <em>frequency</em> of release to cause any notable effects. This is why bodybuilders that use Testosterone analogues are so anal about when they take it.  The endocrine system is a super complex web and I have mucho respecto for MD's who want to spend another 5 years specializing in it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the simple version:</p>
<p>The pituitary generates FSH/LH when blood estrogen levels are low (more in a sec to complete that loop).</p>
<p>The testes produce testosterone and sperm when they see that FSH/LH.</p>
<p>Aromatase enzyme turns a small % of circulating testosterone into estrogen.  Most testosterone is metabolized by the liver however.  It is normal and necessary for a male to have a small amount of estrogen.  This estrogen-from-testosterone is actually how the body regulates testosterone production.</p>
<p>That's the loop.  As testosterone rises, estrogen rises, which shuts down the pituitary's FSH/LH which shut down the testes.  Testosterone falls, estrogen falls, pituitary and testes produce more again.</p>
<p>When bodybuilders take testosterone, some % turns to estrogen, so estrogen rises, shutting off FSH/LH and thus shutting off the testes as well.  </p>
<p>Thus the reason many taking this have to deal with testicular atrophy and breast growth.</p>
<p>FYI, the whole Alan Turing thing, they gave him a long-acting synthetic estrogen to shut down the pituitary, so no FSH/LH, thus no testosterone production for weeks/months with the accompanying loss of libido, and side effects of high estrogen.  That is the &quot;chemical castration&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, I agree with everything you said.  I just want to add something.</p>
<p>Testosterone production increases and decreases when one succeeds or fails.  This fluctuation should be considered in this discussion.  And not just when the individual personally succeeds or fails, studies have shown that it fluctuates whenever any entity/organization/team the individual identifies with wins or loses.  Thus, the sports team, political candidate, party, company, or organization all contribute to the individuals testosterone production.  Admittedly, the effect of  vicarious experience is nothing like that of direct experience.  But still, men's testosterone levels do wax and wane situationally, and should also be a consideration.</p>

<p>Here's a dozen or so studies to support my claim for anyone interested in challenging it.  I usually have at least one or two.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only those around you whom you are rooting for or directly vying against.  For instance, winning an argument will boost your T.  But so would a friend winning an argument against someone boost your T, if you're rooting for him.  But two arguing coworkers you care nothing about will not raise or lower your T no matter who wins or loses - no matter how high the stakes or how high the emotions run.</p></div>		</li>
