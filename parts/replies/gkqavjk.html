I was thinking it was just good timing, but I think I've actually just been listening to it and it subconsciously trained me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had to check your post history to confirm that you are British.</p>
<p>Electric kettles in North America use 120 instead of 240 volts, so a lot of people just boil water on the stove top.    It doesn't take much longer and you don't need special equipment.</p>
<p>And of course tea is much less common.</p>
<p>I'd love a 240v kettle.</p></div>		</li>
