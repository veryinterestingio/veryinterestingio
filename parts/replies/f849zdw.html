			<div class="markdown"><p>This is classical conditioning! </p>
<p>A person wakes at 3am, gets rewarded with cheese. The next night the person is driven to wake at 3am so as to get some cheese.</p>
<p>The trick is not to start that cycle. Don't reward one's self if you wake in the middle of the night.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I can go an entire couple of days without eating a meal if I spent it gaming. Idk why it happens, but I don’t really have that much time to game now anyway.
College was great because there was a chick fil a across the street from my dorm and it was included in my meal plan. I’d just run over, grab it, and come back to continue playing. Now I have to figure out what I’m doing, so I just end up forgetting to eat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It happens because we are built to be able to not eat every day. You can go days without eating, our ancestors routinely did. The luxury of eating practically anything you could want three times a day is, relatively speaking, an extremely recent development in human history.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Playing wow for months back when I was student completely killed my sense of hunger. I don't think I've ever felt &quot;hungry&quot; since then.
This sucks because I tend to overeat, but on the bright side - fasting for days is easy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>nice job, just set yourself up so that you overeat on some really healthy sustenance, ie graze on shit loads of popcorn, or blackbeans and salsa, or hand fulls of spinach etc work for me... force yourself to eat only want to train your beast for.... then when your almost full and cant handled even 2 more mouthfuls.... then have whatever the fuck you want... reward yourself... let your fff....  recommend lots of one type of berry, you get lifted, litereally lifted from consuming a few too many of one kind of berry at a time...
