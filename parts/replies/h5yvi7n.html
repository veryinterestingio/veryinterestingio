			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my favourite endings to a news article is from like 20 years ago.
N'Sync member Lance Bass was all queued up to go into space on a Soyuz ship.
For some reason I can't remember, he had to cancel, just before he was scheduled to go, but the Russians couldn't very well redo the whole plan at the last minute.
So the last sentence of the article was (paraphrasing, from memory), &quot;The Russians will instead pack extra supplies, approximately the same size and weight as Lance Bass.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read Chris Hadfield's book recently and he detailed a lot of what went into packing those shuttles. They are very precisely balanced for every ounce of weight, so losing a passenger would mean they need to fill that space with the same amount of mass so the balance of the whole launch and operation isn't thrown off.</p></div>		</li>
