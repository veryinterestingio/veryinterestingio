<p>Not this time! The Dutch plural is informaties (but it's also almost never used). </p>
<p>More to the point, there are a lot of recent advancements in theoretical physics around the black hole information paradox. <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-black-hole-information-paradox-comes-to-an-end-20201029/" target="_blank">This</a> pretty approachable article is a decent starting point as far as I can judge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats one hypothesis. It has issues just like the &quot;information is destroyed&quot; hypothesis. (Read about the No-hair-theorem)</p>
<p>Since we can't look inside black holes, and our current theoretical models can't handle high gravity and high energy at the same time we won't get a theory of what exactly happens. We'd need to understand quantum gravity first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it is, then there's something we don't know about general relativity. Because it's been proven that all the info you've got about a black hole is</p>
<p>a) its mass (which gives you its diameter, and vice versa)</p>
<p>b) its electric charge, total, if any</p>
<p>c) its spin, its angular momentum total. if any.</p>
<p>There literally isn't any other info kept about the hole itself.</p>
<p>Now it IS true that we don't know how GR interacts with quantum mechanics, fully, because the math for the two is incompatible. And black hole evaporation, AKA the process that might be how information gets back out of a black hole, is entirely quantum-mechanical, depending on one of a virtual-particle pair getting eaten and the other escaping to infinity. So if this happens, the details are down in there, and are stubbornly not cooperating with how GR is supposed to work.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes this is considered, but it also leans into the &quot;the universe is a hologram&quot; theory, since the hawking radiation copying that information and escaping into the universe theory, requires that all the information blackhole has consumed be 2D on its surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yes, according to the No-hair-theorem the only information we can get are total mass, electrical charge and rotational momentum. But only the total and not wich swallowed object contributed what.</p></div>		</li>
