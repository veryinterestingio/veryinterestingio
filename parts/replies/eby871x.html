			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, sometimes chemistry does come down to &quot;cause shapes&quot;, particularly in the case of proteins, where that's usually the main effect.  That isn't what's going on here, though.</p>
<p>Carbon wants 4 bonds.  Oxygen wants 2.  There's no way to resolve this dilemma to get a molecule CO with neutral atoms.  The actual proper way to write CO is (C+)(triple bond)(O-).  Overall, it's a neutral molecule, but it's an ionic molecule, like water.  And like water and other ionic molecules, it likes to stick to things.</p>
<p>The problem biologically is that it sticks to haemoglobin much better than either oxygen or CO2, so that at a relatively low concentration level it deactivates your blood and causes you to suffocate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And that's the major issue with CO.</p>
<p>It's cumulative.  And odorless.  So a small dose over a week is the same as a large dose over an hour.</p>
<p>It takes a long time for your body to replace the contaminated blood.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For anyone reading this, this is a really strange and misleading explanation. CO is covalent, just as CO2 is. You needn't think of it as C+-O-. It just has lone pairs. If it were ionic in the way suggested, it would have a massive electric dipole, and it doesn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and that oxygen does not bind to hemoglobin perfectly is a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>After all, if it holds onto oxygen too well, how are your blood cells suppose to take it out of the bloodstream?</p>
<p>But CO managed to bind too well, and don't come off, so the effect of exposure is cumulative.</p>
<p>In other words, even if you take someone out of a room filled with CO, if they've stayed in there long enough, it could well be too late.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More to the point: CO gets wedged into the hemoglobin molecule permanently.  Oxygen can be given up.  Any red blood cells contaminated by CO are permanently damaged, until they are replaced.  The body CAN metabolize CO-contaminated hemoglobin safely, but not easily, and only in very small amounts.</p></div>		</li>
