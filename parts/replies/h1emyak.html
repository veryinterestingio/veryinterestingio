			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to piggyback off of this, there is research being done if certain vaccines for infections that increase risk of stroke helps decrease that risk. For example, there is a US Medicare population based study that was recently published that found <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STROKEAHA.120.032788" target="_blank">that the herpes zoster live vaccine decreases risk of stroke.</a> I’m currently researching this area of medicine. Recent herpes zoster infection (shingles) can cause stroke syndrome, up to a year after infection. Highest is within the first 30 days. It would be interesting to see if the recombinant vaccine (Shingrex) provided additional prevention since it has better efficacy than the live vaccine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciate the role of pre-print platforms as a way of discussing articles ahead of peer review and publication. I don't mean this as an accusation (and I appreciate you mentioning it's a pre-print), but I worry that a lot of folks don't understand the caveats associated with pre-print articles. It may be worth mentioning, as I've seen a fair amount of misunderstanding around this, both on reddit and in media articles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi mr guy person,</p>
<p>Could you explain that a little more? Do you mean caveats like they haven't stood up to peer review yet, or is there something else too?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure.  In science, researchers have to submit their work to journals for potential publication. However, when these papers are received, the editor of the journal assesses if the paper is appropriate for the journal. If they decide it is, they will reach out to other experts in the sub-field of the paper, and these experts review and critique the work. Sometimes the reviewers feel that a paper's quality isn't high enough or that it needs major changes, and the paper will be rejected. The authors are free to submit their work elsewhere after that to try with another journal. If the paper <em>is</em> accepted, the reviewers typically provide many comments and changes that the authors need to make. This is intended to improve the paper (in terms of clarity, content, etc.).</p>
<p>Services like <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/about-medrxiv" target="_blank">medRxiv</a> are platforms for completed manuscripts that haven't yet undergone peer review (known as preprints). These platforms allow for a loose back and forth between scientists to discuss the paper critically. There may be issues in these papers that the authors haven't yet caught (which is part of the point of the peer review process). But this isn't a substitute for peer review. MedRxiv has the following warning on their <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/" target="_blank">homepage</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Caution: Preprints are preliminary reports of work that have not been certified by peer review. They should not be relied on to guide clinical practice or health-related behavior and should not be reported in news media as established information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I'm not trying to discredit this paper in particular. I'm not a medical expert. I also don't want to give the impression that we can't talk about preprints (talking about them in this kind of context is kind of why these platforms exist). But it's important to keep this distinction in mind. I see preprints ending up in news articles all the time, despite the caution advised on the platforms own site, which makes it confusing for the general public.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add on this, as someone who has published a few preprints, the authors don't treat submitting a preprint the same as submitting an article for peer review. For a preprint, if I decide to do my analysis in a different way that changes conclusions, I just update the preprint. For a peer reviewed article, you'd need to submit a retraction and you'd really be sure your final analysis is done. Basically, people can change preprints and so the bar for pulling the trigger on submission is pretty low</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The review process and publication of a paper takes a LONG time.  In the meantime, the author makes available their paper (usually on the internet) with the understanding that it has not been fully vetted -- that's a preprint.</p></div>		</li>

<p>in the 30 days between administration and 30 days after administration</p>

<p>Is that a typo? The link says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comparing the incidence rates of CVST in <strong>30-day time windows before and after vaccination</strong>, we found no statistically significant differences for the COVID-19 vaccines or any other vaccines studied in this population. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>... which sounds more logical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that has to be a misinterpretation of the article. What really strikes me is that the sample size is massive and yet they still have to accept it would be unlikely to find even one person who suffers from VITT and CVST. </p>
<p>Additionally, of the few cases found some had a prior history of clotting disorders or recent trauma, and they don’t have enough data to even suggest whether the vaccines could have contributed, because the data aquired doesn’t have info like pre and post vaccination platelet counts.</p></div>		</li>
