			<div class="markdown"><p>They can't. Depending on the focal length you'd like to shoot at, you're looking a around $700 for the mount if you're going to stay below 500mm. Even then you're looking at another couple hundred minimum to actively guide it. Increase the cost to $2000 to reliably track most amateur sized rigs (say 600mm to 2000mm) and add thousands of wasted shots due to uncontrollable variable and <em>now</em> we're talking astrophotography!</p>
<p>As for telescopes, again focal length comes into play. Cheaper optical designs like f/4 reflectors start at $300 for a 600mm. Refractors that lack chromatic abberation start around $700 for 400mm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Appreciate the info. Maybe I should clarify that I’m interested in looking through the telescope, not so much the photography part. Does that improve my options? I always thought that even for viewings by eye, a motor was helpful to keep your subject from constantly disappearing from view.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can get some motor drive ones for around $300, they're not the biggest but they'd work for seeing Jupiter, Saturn, and definitely the moon.</p>

<p>The 6&quot; and 8&quot; ones are better for looking at Nebula and whatnot, but you also need dark skies and good conditions to get the most out of them so a smaller one that's not a pain to move can be better than a big one that only works at home</p></div>		</li>
