			<div class="markdown"><p>Does not work with flat screen TVs (maybe OLED but I doubt it). Edit: only works on CRT TVs</p>
<p>You could actually point the gun at a white wall and &quot;shoot&quot; the duck every time.</p>
<p>Also fun note if you use a controller in P2 slot you can &quot;control&quot; the duck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Due to another part of the tracking, it does rely on an old CRT.</p>
<p>Because a CRT draws an image one line at a time and not in digital Picture Elements (PixEls!), the old CRT is required to tell which duck you are aiming at, if I recall correctly. It's simply due to how fast an electron gun works.</p>
<p>Later versions, to thwart the lightbulb trick, blanked the entire screen, then drew a white box over the first duck on screen, then the second if present, then returned to normal on the fourth frame.</p>
<p>These three frames happen incredibly quickly and are too fast for most digital displays to display. Some higher refresh rate monitors might be capable, but another issue is contrast. A backlit LCD screen is not going to have the same deep black as a CRT because a CRT merely stops shooting electrons there and so it emits no light. OLED is closer, but it simply seems to be an incompatibility between the old hardware, software, and modern displays as even OLEDS seem thwarted as far as I have seen.</p>
<p>Edit: Afterthought:</p>
<p>The NES also sends these frames at specific times and expects to &quot;see&quot; them through the Zapper at a very specific time as well. We're talking milliseconds. Throw that off even a little and it will assume a missed shot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah Nekura has it. # frames tell which duck it was. Black screen &gt; black screen with one outline &gt; black screen both outlined. Depending on when the it sensed a light this is how it knew which duck (if any) got shot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CRTs still shoot for black. Otherwise they would have insanely phenomenal contrast. And they don't necessarily.</p>
<p>Everything else you said is right. </p>
<p>A bright black ain't very bright compared to a bright white.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would actually be possible to design a flat-panel display that has little enough input lag to work with a Zapper lightgun. It is mainly that TVs are designed for show and movie consumption in mind and those do not care about input lag. Many TVs offer a &quot;game mode&quot; nowadays, but they usually get away with &quot;less lag than the other modes&quot;.</p>
<p>A PC monitor, especially those designed for fast-paced gaming, will be better in that regard, but even then human reaction times are slow enough that they will usually just wait for an entire frame to come out, rather than just a set of lines (they need multiple lines to make the rescaling from NES resolution to monitor resolution look presentable), so even those are going to be a bit too slow. But it is less impossibility and more the fact that the engineering effort to get those results is generally more than the benefits you get from it that causes this incompatibility.</p>
<p>The SNES lightgun, the Super Scope, however, is a different beast. That thing literally tracks the position of the electron beam on the screen, relying not just on every pixel being shown in real time, but also on the fact that a CRT's light is made up of flashes that appear as the electron beam goes across the screen, rather than a stable brightness. Stuff like that will likely never be replicated on a flat-panel TV.</p>
<p>So, to TL;DR it, there are lightguns that could never work with a flat-panel display, but the Zapper in particular is one where in principle there could be a display that works with it, but there are hardly any out there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a controller extension cable. I could stand back as far as it would reach and never miss due to the broader angle of the lense at a distance. There was also a small click in the gun before the big click. If you released the trigger after the small click, it would shoot when you released.</p></div>		</li>
