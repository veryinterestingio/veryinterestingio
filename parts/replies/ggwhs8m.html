			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd guess that fire was the most common burning humans interacted with for a long time. So our language developed around burning associated with fire. Now that we have more technology and chemicals to burn ourselves with, we have transferred the word onto those processes as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems like OP meant “burn” as in “burn the toast” or “burn” a log. I don’t think there’s any connotation for that other than damage from extreme heat/fire.</p>
<p>Edit: changed bridge due to confusion due to colloquialism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve both suffered a 3rd degree heat burn that cooked the skin off, and chemical burns that changed the color of my skin. </p>
<p>From a qualitative view: they feel similar in the moment they are happening, though the chemical one takes longer to register. Afterwards, the 3rd degree burn was fully numb, and hurt around the area. The chemical burn is like a really terrible sunburn. </p>
<p>So, the sensations are somewhat similar even though the causes are different.</p>
<p>For curious people: the 3rd degree happened while I was working on a vehicle. I forgot to take off my watch and bridged a connection between the alternator and ground with my watch band. It was glowing red and to pull it off while it was hot took the top layer of skin with it. Got 2 other burns just from reflexively pulling my arm close to my body before I could get the watch off. It’s been 20 years and the area will still occasionally swell up and itch for no discernible reason. </p>
<p>The chemical burn happened while I was working with photography development chemicals (before the age of digital camera). The stop bath (an acid) was mixed incorrectly and I can’t clearly remember why, but it got over both of my hands. My hands yellowed and swelled up a lot. Felt like they were experiencing a terrible sunburn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The word &quot;burn&quot; is much older than the idea of chemical burns, and it's always been primarily associated with fire. It comes from an Old English word that means &quot;to be on fire&quot;.</p>
<p>The same word is used to describe injuries that weren't caused by fire because the damage is similar, not because that's the primary definition. That's why &quot;burn&quot; is (mostly) specific to fire and an additional word (&quot;chemical burn&quot;) is added when the injury is caused by acids/bases.</p>
<p>The word for acids/bases damaging a substance would be attacking/corroding/dissolving.  Not burning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Though you are correct in the origin of the word burn. In modern definition 'burn' is not a tangential relation to the other methods of damage. To use Wikipedia for speed:  </p>
<p>A <strong>burn</strong> is a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury" target="_blank">injury</a> to  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin" target="_blank">skin</a>, or other tissues, caused by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat" target="_blank">heat</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold" target="_blank">cold</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity" target="_blank">electricity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemicals" target="_blank">chemicals</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction" target="_blank">friction</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation" target="_blank">radiation</a> (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunburn" target="_blank">sunburn</a>).   </p>
<p>The ELI5 is asking why those terms are used, and my response is correct in that regard. It is the type of injury in question here, your specifics on historical roots are not wrong, but it wasn't the question asked.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Burns are when a forced chemical change takes place</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't even correct by the definition you looked up. Cold and friction damage aren't chemical changes. And if you look for a definition of &quot;burn&quot; (other than the wikipedia page for the the type of injury), you'll see that the definitions involve 1. fire 2. fire 3. fire 4. fire 5. also, some things that cause injury like fire.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Burns are not tied to fire, but fire is tied to burns. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not how the words are used. This is like claiming the word &quot;drown&quot; isn't tied to water, because you can drown in other substances (or metaphorically drown in e.g. incoming work). If you say &quot;burn&quot; (even in a hospital or chemistry lab), almost everyone who hears it will assume you're talking about heat injury, not chemical/cold injury, unless you specify otherwise.</p>
<p>Your answer is actively misleading. And OP <strong>is</strong> looking for an etymological/historical answer. They specifically asked why a word is used in a certain way. That's literally what etymology is supposed to answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, some of what you have said is true, but I can't believe you're doubling down and defending your original answer rather than saying 'yeah you're right, my understanding isn't the greatest'. I'm honestly impressed you tried to answer the question so confidently incorrect.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Burns are when a forced chemical change takes place  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>What the fuck? Chucking a lump of cesium into a bucket of water is a pretty fucking forceful chemical reaction, is that a burn by your definition? Heeell fucking no. The reason we call the vast array of burns people receive, burns, is because the tissue damage inflicted is incredibly similar to varying degrees of 'oh fuck that hurts' to 'wow I actually don't have any nerve endings left and feel nothing' whether they've put their hand on a hot plate or dipped their balls in battery acid.   </p>
<p>I'm amazed - I've never seen such a confident, fancily written response that says nothing but absolute hot shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Burn is absolutely not always associated with fire. Let’s go through a list.
If you work out you burn calories.
You could burn all of your bridges and have no friends,
You could burn some music to a CD player.
If I say your mother is fat we would call that a burn.
Going by only the historical definition of a word is retarded. What’s more important is how the word is used today. And burn doesn’t only refer to fire anymore.</p></div>		</li>
