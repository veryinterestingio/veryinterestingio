Boiling pasta, potatoes, broccoli, etc. absorbs the salty water around it. If you watch professional chefs cook, they use a LOOOOOTTT of salt in their boiling water. The water should taste slightly salty.</p>
<p>The boiling point thing is a myth. Edit: as in, that's not why you add salt.</p></div>		</li>

We indeed boil pasta in salty water, that's the basic, but if you like pasta and you want to level up further here's a tip: prepare your sauce in a pan while pasta is cooking, keeping it a bit watery by adding some of the water you are cooking your pasta with. This will add salt and some of the pasta's amid to your sauce, making it a bit more creamy! Drain the pasta a minute earlier (don't overcook it!), put it with your sauce and let it cook the last minute with it, to reduce the sauce and finish the cooking. This way the pasta will absorb some of the sauce and really bring the pasta and sauce together.   </p>
<p>This work with any sauce: tomato with basil, random vegetables sauce, ham and cream, ragout..</p></div>		</li>

<p>Lol what? It's physics, you don't have to 'believe' it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The melting point is lowered by 1.85 degrees Celsius if 29.2 grams of salt are dissolved in each Kg of water (called a &quot;0.5 molal solution&quot; of salt. The Na and Cl dissociate right away when dissolved, and so for a 0.5 molal solution of salt, there is a 1.0 molal concentration of ions). The boiling point is raised by 0.5 degrees Celsius for water with 29.2 grams of salt dissolved in each kg of water.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is neglible in cooking for sure since you can't add <em>that much</em> salt, but in no way it's a myth</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what they were referring to is the myth that flavor changes depending on if you put the salt when the water is cold or when the water is already cooking (both before adding noodles/veggies). At least that's a myth I have heard.</p></div>		</li>
