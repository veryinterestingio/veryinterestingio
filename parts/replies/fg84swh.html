			<div class="markdown"><p>More to the question of Mesopotamia:</p>
<p>While the Nile, yellow and Yangtze flood regularly and at the same time of year, the Tigris and Euphrates did not. Floods were intermittent, and more likely to flood and destroy a crop nearly ready for harvest than to irrigate and fertilize early in the season like the other rivers. This is a huge part of why Mesopotamian societies often collapsed every few centuries despite being the birthplace of civilization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly related to why it was the birthplace of civilization. Clearing out the current, possibly stagnant, possibly bloated society, and letting replacements fight out and promote their new ideas, which beat out competitors and inhabited the place of the old collapse? Only a matter of time before societal evolution randomly produced a leading society and civilization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, those rivers have a higher natural salinity than the Nile, so the repeated flooding would slowly cause salts to build up in the soil. It prevented a centralized system from building up the way the Egyptian and Chinese dynasties could.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick follow up question, what governs regularity of flooding? Why do the Nile, Yellow, and Yangtze flood regularly and have for all of history while other large rivers like the Tigris and Euphrates do not?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a very good question, one which I do not have the answer to. I do know that the Nile's headwaters are lake Victoria and Ethiopia, while the Tigris and Euphrates have theirs in Turkey and the Zagros mountains of Iran. Maybe there is some irregularity in the precipitation in these areas that causes times of drought and massive flooding downstream.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a really good explaination but it doesn't explain why Mesopotamia once sustained a high population, produced lots of food and later failed leading to its collapse.</p>
<p>In Mesopotamia (Land between the Rivers) the Euphrates and Tigris rivers act much like the Nile or Yellow River as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/veemondumps/" target="_blank">u/veemondumps</a> has explained but on a smaller scale and the floods are less predictable.</p>
<p>Just like Egypt, Mesopotamia is surrounded by desert but the rivers provided  fertile land in an otherwise unfertile region. After millenia of human usage the once fertile soil of southern mesopotamia became more and more salty leading to increasingly low food production. This could happen because there is a special type of soil and only the small surface layer could be used for farming. Millenia of irrigation and farming destroyed it and left behind a desert.</p>
<p>The  empires of mesopotamia grew weaker and weaker without enough food, then  they were plundered by their neighbours, conquered and after all  vanished.</p>
<p>The soil in this region is still too salty and dry to grow food up to this day even after roughly 3000 years passed.</p>
<p>Now Akkad, once humanities greatest city, is lost to the desert and we can't even find it.</p>
<p>Southern  China on the other hand is in a more fertile region where you can also  grow rice which provides almost twice as many calories per area. This  makes it possible to sustain even a higher population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're partly right, the soil became too salty to sustain agriculture, but this was not only because of overfarming, but also a change in climate. After the last ice age the forest in the mountains around the rivers crept closer to the now arid areas due to a higher moisture content in the air. This also had the added effect of making the land more suitable to farming. However after a few thousand years the climate became drier and so the region became what we know today. The area was more or less always doomed to became what it became, although human farming expedited it's eventual fate.</p></div>		</li>
