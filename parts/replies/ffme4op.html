			<div class="markdown"><p>I tried sleep cycle, and if your partner sleeps with hos/her head opposite from yours it works (even though it still picks up snoring from both of you) almost always. It doesnt work if you are sleeping next to each other, especially if your partner is closer to the phone than you are. I felt like I needed to mention that last part because Sleep Cycle &quot;tunes in&quot; on your breath for a few nights once you start using it, but I found out that it is unable to identify your breath or separate your breath from your partners.</p></div>		</li>
