<p>They actually send out 2 different wavelengths of light.Oxygenated hemoglobin (The primary blood carrier of the red blood cells (erotocytes)) and deoxygenated hemoglobin will each catch different wavelengths of the light.The difference between how much light is caught of each wavelength is used to calculate the exact SpO2 level.</p>
<p>Interesting fact: People who have been exposed to smoke (eg: burning building) will usually SAT around 100% because the Carbon Monoxide in the smoke actually binds more powerfully to Hemoglobin (Hgb) than oxygen. This is why even thought you get someone out of a burning building they still have a very high chance of dying since even with pure oxygen it takes a while to 'wash' the Carbon Monoxide of the blood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I’m wrong, but is it true that we don’t have a way to currently “unbind” binded CO from fires that’s already in someone’s system; thus saving them from the fire but they suffocate from oxygen deprivation + lack of flushing out CO2. (Only cure is to “wait it out”)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>50% True. 50% False.</p>
<p>What happens on a molecular scale is that molecules(ligands) will bind and unbind to their receptors/active sites naturally.  So CO will unbind itself.</p>
<p>CO has a higher affinity(200x) than O2 so the Hb will bind more to CO than O2 which means instead carrying O2 around, your blood carries CO around which means your tissues aren't getting O2. Which is the problem, hypoxia possibly even anoxia.</p>
<p>The treatment is to &quot;wait it out&quot; in that once you remove the victim from CO, they will naturally breathe out the CO over time.  But during that time, you may have periods of hypoxia or anoxia which you treat with O2.  This has the added benefit because since O2 and CO bind for the same site, they are competitive agonists and to outcompete CO with O2, you have to add more O2.</p>
<p>Competitive agonists compete for binding at the same site.  If A and B are competitive agonists, you can get A to bind more by making sure you have more A than B.</p>
<p>Caffeine works in the same way by blocking adenosine receptors(technically antagonists since the effect of caffeine is opposite of adenosine).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually a few ways to unbind the CO. One is essentially mechanical. 100% O2 reduces the the half life of CO poisoning.  Placing the individual in a hyperbaric (oxygen) chamber and running the pressure up alters the binding rates and drives CO off even faster. </p>
<p>The chemical treatment is still being investigated. But neuroglobin is showing some promise.</p>
<p>One of the other byproducts in a fire is hydrogen cyanide. We use a cyanokit to address issues from the HCN poisoning. I've used a cyanokit on a fire victim full arrest and gotten them back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's more than one reason. If the entirety of that 10% was CO then smokers would die or have significant brain damage less than a year after they started.</p>
<p>Blood saturation % is a logarithmic function so the difference from 80-90 is around 3x the difference between 90-100</p>

<p>Hopefully this link works. This curve basically measures O2 sat and the pressure of oxygen in the plasma. 10% purely from CO is more or less lethal for anyone hoping to perform activities of daily living</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my experience (nurse), most medical grade machines will simply not give a reading if nail polish/dirt/skin colour/extreme cold prevents an accurate reading.</p>
<p>It is also usually possible to spot an inaccurate reading because the sats will jump around - e.g. 82% - 87% - 94% and then back again.</p>
<p>I'm not aware of the exact error correction they use, but any sensible nurse will then use an ear probe where the skin is much thinner and an accurate reading can be made.</p>
<p>Of course home machines probably don't have sophisticated error detection - and rubbish nurses may record the highest reading they see rather than investigate further.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they absolutely are <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2029240" target="_blank">less effective in people with darker skin</a>. This has become a big issue with COVID19 since people are triaged for care based on their oxygen levels measured by pulse oximetry. Around 3 times as more black patients than whites have true blood oxygen levels that are dangerous when the pulse oximetry shows it to be normal. Once the oxygen levels get worse, the discrepancy becomes wider, with sicker black patients looking better than they really are. That's more important for patients in the ICU, but most of them hopefully have real-time direct oxygen measurements.</p>
<p>It turns out that there is quite a bit of variation between oximeter vendors as well. Some work quite a bit better on people with darker skins. This is how implicit racial bias sometimes pervades medicine in non-obvious ways. You can't validate your machine on all white people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the racial bias from oximeters wasn't enough, one of the other main ways they gauge if you are low oxygen is when your lips turn purple. This method is also not very effective on dark skinned people.</p></div>		</li>
