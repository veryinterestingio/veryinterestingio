			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say it's overblown. Raw chicken contamination of Salmonella comes from the bacteria being spread to the meat of the chicken via the gastrointestinal tract during processing.</p>
<p>There is virtually no way to ensure that cross contamination during processing doesn't occur, and from between the time contamination occurs to the time the chicken gets to you the bacteria has been multiplying. Especially if the product has been temperature abused.</p>
<p>I hope that makes sense. </p>
<p>Chicken is also processed to a much more lenient standard than say, prime USDA beef. Which is why you can eat steak pretty much raw, <em>as long as you kill off everything on the outside</em>. </p>
<p>I'm happy to try and explain this further if you would like me to, or answer anymore questions!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense, thanks! I was curious, because I was always taught to treat raw chicken and eggs both as highly contaminated. Hearing eggs were overblown was a shock, so I figured I might as well ask about the chicken.</p></div>		</li>
