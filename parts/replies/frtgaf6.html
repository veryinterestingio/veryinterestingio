<p>Fighting games have single player but it's generally not organized as a campaign because there's no story</p>

<p>I think we've been playing different fighting games :3 I'd argue your standard 'arcade mode' or w/e is just a campaign by a different name because it's super short. Or some will split arcade mode and story mode into different features in which case I'd say the story mode is 100% just a short campaign.</p></div>		</li>
