			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this explanation. Since you mentioned that all decays are possible, but with tiny probability, can you give some numerical example. For instance, if we take the element U238 that would normally decay with alpha emission, what would the probability be to decay via proton emission?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was mostly an addendum just to clarify that <em>any</em> possible quantum mechanical transition is possible - tunnelling through for example centrifugal or coulomb energy barriers, and potentially even spontaneously creating virtual states of a larger energy than what's actually available. This second point is fundamental to beta decay; the W^Â± boson has a large mass and cannot be created as a long lived particle in beta decay, so instead a virtual W is the intermediary vector between the decaying nucleon such that it exists for a time comparable to the reciprocal of its mass/energy (thanks to Heisenberg uncertainty, much the same vacuum states contain 'borrowed' energy fluctuations that actually define behaviour, described by QFT, but this beyond the empirical nuclear scope).  </p>
<p>The complexity of all this is deeper than I have summarised above.  </p>
<p>So for example <a href="https://www.gcn.us.es/files/14bwmc/113_uranium.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a> is performing a review of the U-238 decay chain. It doesn't (as far as I skimmed it) mention single-proton or neutron emission at all. Measurements of the rate of these negligibly small decay 'channels' are effectively impossible. Even my use of the word 'channel' would be dubious in any discussion other than this addendum on the quantum mechanical nature of nuclear decay. The only place unexpected decay channels need to be considered are exotic nuclei where they are measured (super-heavy, artificial short-lived).</p></div>		</li>
