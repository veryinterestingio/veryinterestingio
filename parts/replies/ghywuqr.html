			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think this addresses the &quot;12 evenly spaced tones&quot; part.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_tone_system" target="_blank">Arab tone system
</a> uses 24, which is just 2x12, so it's essentially the same, just with notes in between. There's something about a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17_equal_temperament" target="_blank">17-tone</a> system, but not evenly spaced.</p>
<p>I'm reading that Japanese 5-tone scales don't divide the notes evenly - it's just C–E–F–G–B–C. </p>
<p>That's the thing, is they're different <em>scales</em>, but still on the same <em>tones</em></p>
<p>I mean, the classical major scale CDEFGAB is just 7 notes picked the from the 12. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_scale" target="_blank">Jazz</a> has its own scale - and it certainly isn't an entirely different musical system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Traditional Japanese music did have more than one scale though and all scales function roughly to parts of our 12 tone scale. Pentatonic etc. scales mostly just leave stuff out. </p>
<p>There are some scales that sound truly foreign though like the byzanthian but it all comes down to 12-24 notes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Detuning/different tunings exists in western music. The difference between eastern and western styles are the intervals between notes, not whichever fundamental frequency you start on</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not always. Well-tempered scale where all 12 half-tones are equal is a specific Western invention. You can crudely approximate, say, pentatonics on a well-tempered instrument, but not many of the other scales and tuning systems.</p></div>		</li>
