			<div class="markdown"><p>I love this comment. I'm fascinated by what counts as &quot;slow&quot; in different disciplines of knowledge. As a sociologist, I'm aware of a number of cultural changes that take many generations to unfold. I would be comfortable calling this kind of process &quot;slow&quot;. Geologists will hear this and go &quot;Well, if it all happened after humans appeared as a species it can't really be that slow, can it?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha yeah being a geologist really skews your view of time. I remember learning a series of lava flows in Wyoming was about 1 million years old and thinking &quot;Wow, that's really recent!&quot; I think my view is especially skewed though because I worked on rocks older than 1-2 billion years old for a while, so the 70 Ma rocks at my current job seem pretty young to me too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To put it in perspective, the typical unit for time is 1 million years. Unless you're a <em>real</em> geologist, and then it's a billion years</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just ballparking it, but given the moon's size and closeness to earth, and increasing heat input from the sun, I'd be pretty surprised if earth will have contracted by more than a few km over the course of the sun's lifespan due to cooling contracting</p>
<p>Anyone please correct me if I'm off base</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is the Earth's crust broken up into plates and other planets aren't? Tried to Google this but it's just making me more confused. Example: <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2019/12/first-active-fault-system-found-mars2/#:~:text=Mars%2C%20however%2C%20doesn't,the%20planet's%20insides%20are%20today." target="_blank">Mars, however, doesnâ€™t have plate tectonics</a> vs. <a href="https://www.space.com/17087-mars-surface-marsquakes-plate-tectonics.html" target="_blank">The surface of Mars has been shaped by plate tectonics in the recent past</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lpi.usra.edu/education/explore/shaping_the_planets/tectonism/" target="_blank">This article</a> says the Earth has plate tectonics simply because it's hot...  but Mercury not having plate tectonics contradicts this doesn't it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a really difficult question, as the nature of plate tectonics erases its own history as old sections of plate are subducted, so theres very little rock from  3 billion years ago or more which is around the time its generally thought the crust broke into plates. </p>
<p>There are many theories on why our planet current has it while others don't which generally boil down to our planet being between some narrow &quot;goldilocks&quot; zones. We are big enough that we haven't cooled a lot internally like other rocky planets but aren't so big our plates get held down and together by extreme gravity. We have just the right mineral composition for plasticity of our mantle so convection there can shift the crust to break it apart but its not so plastic that it becomes overly volcanic. The early Moon may have had just enough tidal force to break apart our early crust into plate without destroying it completely so it re-cools as a single solid plate.</p>
<p>Overall we are the only planet we know of that we know for sure has ongoing plate tectonics, so its a sample size of one and was long enough ago that theres is very little evidence remaining in order to piece together any kind of &quot;why?&quot; answer.</p></div>		</li>
