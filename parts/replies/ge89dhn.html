			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because polio has been eradicated in the US and vaccination for it is only required if a person travels to an area where it is still extant.  That's a logical use of resources.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once a disease has been eradicated in an area (as polio has in the US), it doesn't make sense to do mass vaccination against it anymore, both from a PoV of resource use, and of the small risk that is associated with the vaccine no longer being worth the effect. If you travel to an area where polio is still endemic, you still need to get vaccinated first, but only then.</p></div>		</li>
