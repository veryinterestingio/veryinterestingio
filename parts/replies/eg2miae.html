			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some companies who are taking old drugs and just jacking up the price because there is no competition. This is what you hear on the news about pharma companies getting in trouble for.</p>
<p>There are other new medicines that are extremely expensive to develop and manufacture (basically any cancer treatment with a monocloncal antibody or any biologic treatment in general). Yes, in part, they are recouping the cost of their investment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Another part is that much of the rest of the world pays a discounted rate, so Americans are paying most of the cost of drug development.  It's also why the vast majority of pharmaceuticals are developed in the US, because there isn't much money for the development elsewhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Finding a drug that demonstrates efficacy is like winning a lottery. There are millions of millions of drug candidates, and even if you screen for candidates that on paper, show benefit based on the body of scientific evidence, it can go through late stage clinical trials and still fail. Why? We do not always know. For example, PD-1 treatments have been a huge breakthrough to treat lung cancer, there are several on the market now, some demonstrate good efficacy. But other companies are trying to develop them own PD-1 and they fail in late stage trials. Pharma companies and poured tonnes of money to test and develop drugs and they failed. So when one comes out that is effective, it's recouping the cost for it's own development and partly for all the failed drugs.</p>
<p>How expensive a trial is depends on the size, disease area, and amount of data you are collecting. For late stage cancer trials, you need several hundred patients. For respiratory or cardiovascular, you're looking at thousands of patients. Let's take a look at a phase 3 cancer trial.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Number of countries participating: Around 15-20</p>
<p>Number of patients: Around 500</p>
<p>CT/MRI scans to screening the tumour: Every 6-12 weeks. You need a centralized, external team to read and adjudicate them too. That's several millions of dollars right there.</p>
<p>Tonnes of blood test to screen for several kinds of biomarkers, overall just safety monitoring, see if there is circulating tumour DNA (to test if it's possible to develop a blood test for cancer) all these samples have to be shipped to a central lab that processes them and matches to the right patient in the study. Then the central lab ships them to specialized analytical labs to actually analyze them. This whole portion for a big trial is like $20-30 million</p>
<p>There's an entire database that has to be set up to collect and monitor all the data from the patient's participation through the study</p>
<p>Centralized ECGs at each hospital/clinic participating</p>
<p>Patient reported outcomes devices for each patient to fill out questionnaires about their progonosis</p>
<p>Training all clinical care providers</p>
<p>Checking that all the data entered is verified by the source</p>
<p>Drug supply and distribution to all centres</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I could go on even further. It's a lot of money. And after all of it, the drug can still fail. At this time, the reality is that this is really the only model the world has to develop large scale trials and collect data to see if new drugs are actually efficacious. Pharma companies take all the financial risk. So when we get something that works and can help people, we are so happy because we've worked so hard every day for so long to be successful. We're all people as well, we have loved ones that have cancer too. We want to help. But a company also has to price and sell so that it can sustain future research endeavours and keep the business going. The pure economics of that part though, I don't know too much about. But it's a business. It's doing what a business is supposed to do.</p>
<p>From a pricing perspective though, most countries, along with their national board to approve a medicine for use in their countries, have boards to negotiate pricing. i.e. Canada has the PMBRB (for all medicines but oncology) - name of the board may have changed, can't remember. And they also have pCODR (just for oncology drugs). The USA is this extremely odd, developed country who's healthcare industry is unlike all others around the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People need to know about it too, and there might be competing treatments - so you would need to tell people why yours is the better option. Now if it was a drug that was way beyond current treatments, a miracle, I assume marketing wouldn't be as expensive save getting the word out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coming out of school and just starting in the industry, yes, that's exactly what I thought as well. But over the years and the more I learned about the commercial side, the more I understand how necessary it is so market the medicine. If we exclude direct-to-consumer marketing of drugs, which is generally only an American phenomenon, marketing of pharmaceutical products is directed towards doctors, the prescribers. They are our customers.</p>
<p>Imagine you are a doctor. It's incredibly overwhelming to have to see patients every day let alone keep up with the changing and advancing treatments. Most cancers are usually treated along a pathway i.e. if it's very localized, you can surgically remove it, if not then broad spanning chemotherapy next, then you treat against the EGFR mutation first (lung cancer) or something the targets BRCA (breast cancer), once the cancer mutates against it, you treat it with something else that targets that mutation. It's a lot to keep track of.</p>
<p>One of the only ways to educate doctors of new treatments is through sales reps that visit them at their office. They have to meet around the doctor's schedule, pop in and out just for a brief chat to educate them about the new medicine and what it's indicated for to treat. In order to support those activities, you need to create a brand for the new drug, create promotional materials etc. All cancer drugs have a scientific name during development i.e. nivolumab (mab = monoclonal antibody) but who  on earth would remember that amongst other scientific drug names, which is why it gets branded to Opdivo. Even with all of this, it's just in human nature to forget about it too, or have it not be the first drug you think to use among other competitors in the same treatment class.</p>
<p>Even if the drug is great. It doesn't always reach the patients who would benefit from it the most. If you have a more conservative doctor, they may want to stick with something that is tested and true. Which yes, may be more safe because it has more historical safety data. But once in a blue moon, an incredible drug comes along. And if it does not have the right marketing team to get that message out, so many people would not have access to it because their doctors are not aware.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in this industry this a million times, the time from phas2 trials to phase 3 trials is quite large. But the cost is also immense, so some of these breakthroughs need financial backing. Then you add the issues with patient enrolment which can delay, and the fact that most trials fail leads to this.</p>
<p>If we want more of this, we need to improve the cost of trials, find ways to get patients to trials, and speed up find ways to get more governments involved in funding some of these small market breakthroughs where big pharma can't take the financial risk with the limits on patents. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are to many variables to actually give a fair average. If you make a few assumptions, like the drug maker did the investment, and not purchased after the fact there are still many variables. </p>
<p>Not all drugs are for all people.
Population size of an indication may be relatively small.
Patents are for 25 years, they start before the first trial is in. You look at around 10 to 15 years before it reaches the market.
You need to not only recoup the cost of research, but failed research.
Generics is a very good business, as soon as your product loses its patent, you lose most of your market.
Not all trials have the same cost, Oncology tends to be the most expensive, device trial costs are increasing however use to be some of the lowest. </p></div>		</li>
