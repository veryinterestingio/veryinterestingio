<p>Yesterday i pulled into a Walgreens, walked up to the drive through window (I'm in a big truck) swabbed and left. In less than 2 hours a result. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m a clinical lab tech who performs COVID tests once they arrive in the lab — this might be more so that there aren’t boogers leading to more invalid tests rather than spreading particles in the nasal passage. </p>
<p>PCR is very sensitive, we don’t need much virus to work with to get a positive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you speak to why some nurses feel the need to hit my brain with them? It is absolutely the worse minor medical procedure I have to take. I have a moderate needle phobia and I would still rather take 3 or 4 shots compared to 1 nasal swab. If it was just like halfway up the nose that would be fine but why does it need to go all the way up?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PCR testing is often trying to find pre-symptomatic cases, before people fall ill. An example is testing travellers. Viral load is low when people are incubating the virus and PCR is the only way to detect incubating cases due it it's sensitivity. And to do this you have to sample the back of the nose where virus is most abundant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PCR tests here are throat only. No nose at all. The quick tests (antigen) are nose tests though.</p>
<p>Edit: This is in Denmark. The tests are free and I'm sure thousands of people get tested every day. It's been running for a long time. The nasal quick tests have only been running for half as long. The PCR tests are 5 second throat swabs. The quick tests are one swab 2 cm into each nostril turned four times in each. I always assumed that since PCR tests are much more reliable, that the throat swabs were better.</p>
<p>Edit2: FWIW, I'm always at the brunk of throwing up during the throat swabs, whereas the nasal swabs don't bother me at all. It's a shame the nose swabs only give us a 72 hour pass whereas the throat tests give us a 96 hour pass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I wonder why they went that route. I guess just for patient comfort. It probably misses a few weak positives but still has a reasonable sensitivity. The hundred thousand PCR tests I've run on the last year were all either nasopharyngeal or nasal swabs. I've only run 2 throat swabs and those were exceptions accepted by our director in emergency cases.</p></div>		</li>
