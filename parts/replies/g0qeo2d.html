<p>Spacial metaphors vary across languages. For example in some languages the past is ahead of us and the future behind, because we can see the past and the future is unknown</p></div>		</li>

<p>Quick Google search later, Aymara (Indian language spoken in the high Andes) has this convention</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many years ago I read in a book that men look at their fingernails, they look at their palms with their fingers curled down. When women look at their fingernails they look at their hands palm away. I have no idea how true this is, but I wonder if OP is a dude, and thats where this &quot;top&quot; orientation is coming from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in primary school (U.K., age 5-12), it was a stupid joke: you’d say to someone “you’ve got dirt on your nail” and whatever way the person checked their nails was “gay” and the other way was the right way. There was no right way, you were always gay for checking though, invariably.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm more confused by the fact that you are confused about what OP is talking about...</p>
<p>&quot;White half moon at the top of our fingernails&quot;</p>
<p>He said top, obviously referring to the part of our nail that we trim, the part that goes white after growing a certain length because it is no longer connected to the blood flow. It is white and is shaped like a crescent moon.</p>
<p>Or maybe OP did mean the base of the fingernail and now I just look silly.</p></div>		</li>
