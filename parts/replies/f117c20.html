			<div class="markdown"><p>I mentioned this to someone else in the thread, this is my solution:</p>
<p>What I do when my eyes feel weird like that when going to sleep is to jiggle your eyes around (look around randomly all over the place really quickly) as you slowly close your eyelids. Once their fully closed you can stop moving your eyes. It seems like being able to close your eyes without knowing their exact positions prevents you from straining them and you can just allow them to relax to the most effortless position.</p></div>		</li>
