<p>I doubt it.  We may have longer nights, but we have artificial light and other distractions which keep us up later and wake us up earlier than the times our ancestors slept and woke to.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>It depends on the clock.  There are three types of clock: those which measure time by keeping track of seconds, those which measure time by keeping track of the rotation of the Earth, and hybrid clocks.</p>
<p>Atomic clocks are examples of the first type of clock. Various countries run standards laboratories.  These feed a statistical average atomic time called TAI.  TAI counts SI (metric system) seconds and does not care at all about the rotation of the Earth or variations in the rotation of the Earth.  Consequently, they do not adjust for it.</p>
<p>The clocks that measure time by keeping track of the rotation of the Earth do so by observing stars, quasars, pulsars, and other such phenomena to determine the Earth's angle to the location of the Sun.  The time from solar noon to solar noon is divided into 24 &quot;hours&quot;, each of which contains 60 &quot;minutes&quot;, made up of of 60 &quot;seconds&quot; each.  However, these &quot;seconds&quot;  are not all the same length as each other, nor are they  the same length as the SI/Metric second.  Official observatories all around the world submit their readings to the International Astronomical Union, which keeps track of UT0 and UT1 time standards: clocks based on the average rotation of the Earth.  These clocks are intimately tied to the rotation of the Earth and its variations, so they are constantly compensating for it.</p>
<p>Hybrid clocks are the official clocks most people are familiar with.  UTC is an atomic clock based time standard but it is periodically adjusted so that it is never more than 0.9 seconds out from UT1.  This is done by occasionally adding or subtracting leap seconds. UTC is the basis of civil timekeeping in most of the world.  Each of the time zones uses UTC as its base, but with an offset, so when UTC gets a leap second, all the time zones get a leap second.</p></div>		</li>
