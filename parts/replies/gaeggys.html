			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, but I'd also add that anti-bodies/B and T cells are only part of the immune system too. You have Macrophages and such, which just envelop and destroy pathogens, therefore creating no anti-body response, so many tiny infections die that way too. </p>
<p>Also, everyone's body is different and the worst symptoms of Covid, including severe inflammation which is the leading cause of hospitalisation and death, is basically your body overreacting when fighting it. Although Covid is so new we aren't sure, as we also think it is much more damaging to other organs than other Coronaviruses and flus which mostly just affect the respiratory system</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't necessarily want to medicate a lot for a 100 degree (F) fever.  Your body can cook the viruses out with that temperature, which is why we evolved to do it.  It's a good thing.</p>
<p>At around 107* degrees, however, your body starts damaging its own organs.  That's when you consider the ER and strong medications.</p>
<p>Remember that your body can overreact to freaking pollen.  Of course the same stimulus will incur different responses in people.  Sometimes it's not enough response, and the virus takes too much control.  Sometimes it's too much response, and you need protection from yourself.  Never know what you'll get, even from a healthy adult.</p>
<p>*Edit - temperature to seek medical care at 103+ is lower than the actual damaging temperature of 107, changed to reflect that</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Macrophages are professional antigen presenting cells, which are an important link between the innate and adaptive immune system. A macrophage phagocytosing an antigen is one pathway to creating an antibody response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok cool this helps a lot. I wasn’t aware of the fact that the body could scale up or down and the immune response like that although I suppose it makes sense. It kinda reminds me of the star system in GTA to be honest lol. You wouldn’t call in a tank to deal with a minor break in</p></div>		</li>

<p>It can scale up to the point that it starts attacking it's own host (the human) and you die or lose organ function from your own immune system. Also known as systemic inflammatory immune response syndrome (SIRS) or sepsis (SIRS in the presence of infection).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what autoimmune diseases do. For example, rheumatoid arthritis attacks the patient's joints &amp; psoriasis attacks the patient's skin.</p>
<p>It's also similar in effect to allergies. There are many people who are allergic to specific antigens but are unknown until a later date. Their body is reacting by releasing eosinophils &amp; histamine, but many people (me incl) won't show allergy symptoms (anaphylactic shock, asthma, hives, etc) until years later.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is an old video now but Kurzgesagt does a reasonably good job of showing how the overreaction of the immune system can lead to awful results when someone has covid19.</p>
<p>I imagine some of the information in that video needs updating but just focus on the immune response section.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two more (at least):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQGOcOUBi6s" target="_blank">One</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSypUV6QUNw" target="_blank">Two</a>  </p>
<p>I think my favorite thing about Kurgzegaszt is how well they qualify the unknown. Scientific literacy is dependent upon stitching your understanding together around these great big holes in what you know. </p>
<p>At best you can become really knowledgeable about a few topics and competent in some of the rest, but even your field of expertise will be more unknowns than knowns.</p>
<p>Here we have two highlighted segments of our overall immune system, and they do—I think—a good job of informing you of just how much the video doesn't cover while also not letting that intimidate your understanding of what they <em>do</em> talk about. </p>
<p>And I think that's a key perspective for being scientifically literate: you must make friends with both the spectres of doubt and the unknown. Welcome them into your heart, for they will ever be with you. And they're actually pretty chill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, there are many comparisons between covid and flu that you could draw. For example, social distancing and hygiene can slow the spread of both. Both spread faster in winter when more people are indoors in close proximity. Both are infectious diseases that can be fatal for certain populations, so stay home if you are sick. </p>
<p>Just because you don’t like one particular comparison, doesn’t mean you should go all anti-science just to show everyone how righteous you are.</p></div>		</li>
