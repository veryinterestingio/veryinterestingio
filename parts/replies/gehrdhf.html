			<div class="markdown"><p>While there might be resonances set up I don't believe the inside of a microwave is intentionally setup to have a resonating field in it. In fact I believe they do everything possible to prevent resonances because those result in uneven heating. The walls do reflect the microwave radiation back into the middle though, just not in a resonant manner on purpose</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By generating a resonant standing wave the you get constructive interference which increases the power of the radiation instead of destructive interference which will weaken the power and can change the frequency.</p>
<p>A standing wave will have hot and cold spots because the nodes don't move. The tray rotates to agitate liquids so they don't erupt when you break to surface tension, and to move the food through the hot and cold spots to attempt to heat it more evenly.</p>
<p>You can destroy a bridge with a tiny, weak occilator if you can have it occilate at the resonant frequency of the bridge. Each occilation constructively adds power to the vibration till the bridge cannot handle the force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. Nicer microwaves will have a microwave stiffing fan where the microwaves enter the chamber to try to keep the energy evenly distributed and prevent uneven heating caused by interferences nodes. This is similar in principal to the spinning fan water sprinkler design.</p>
<p>From a cost stand point controlling the alignment and dimensions of a cheap stamped metal box to intentionally create a specific pattern doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>Microwaves have a length or around 1 foot so even if patterns were intentional static nodes every 3-4 inches (\~25% of the wavelength) would not evenly heat food.</p>
<p>I wonder if one day there will be microwaves with antennas that can changed the shape of the energy spread to match the shape of the food. Sounds like something Elon Musk would sell. Use your AutoWave(TM) microwave while AutoPilot(TM) takes you home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Without the resonance you won't have a standing wave. A standing wave has a more energy than a travelling wave, so you actually do want resonance. </p>
<p>Nowadays they do use stirrers to prevent uneven heating.  (Still the heating is not uniformly)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because it's not a function of volume, but a function of surface area. </p>
<p>If the antenna is a single point, you can model the radiation as a sphere. Which makes sense, the waves will travel outward from the transmitter equally in all directions. Sounds pretty spherical, right?</p>
<p>The receiving antenna can be in several shapes, but it has a fixed area. Your total received power is down to the surface area of the sphere that you can cover.</p>
<p>Imagine you have a 1cm^2 antenna. You will <em>always</em> capture all the energy in that area. As you move closer to the transmitter, the effective radius of your sphere gets smaller, and the surface area of the sphere gets smaller, but the area of your receiver stays the same. </p>
<p>However, as the area of the sphere decreases, the <em>percentage</em> of the surface area you can capture increases. Since the energy is more concentrated, you get more energy.</p>
<p>The surface area of a sphere is given by A=4Ï€r^2, which is where the square term comes from. This is called the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law" target="_blank">inverse square law</a>. The Wikipedia page has some handy graphics that really get the point across.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the explanation! Happy to have learned something. I always thought of antenna as 1D but that's clearly not true.</p></div>		</li>
