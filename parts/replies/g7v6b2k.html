			<div class="markdown"><p>A great mechanical example of doing similar is the needle on a vinyl record.</p>
<p>The wiggling channel on the record wiggles the needle, which wiggles a magnet in a coil, creating the oscillating electrical signal. It can be fed into a speaker, or an amplifier...or in the case of an aux cable, it's just an electromagnet that transfers the information to the read head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Wiggle&quot; is really a helpful analogy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Sound is just wiggling air that wiggles your eardrums.</li>
<li>You can wiggle the air by wiggling other stuff, like wiggling your vocal cords, or plucking a string, or tapping a bongo.</li>
<li>If you wiggle a magnet next to metal, it will create wiggly electricity that can travel across a wire. That's what a microphone is.</li>
<li>If you put that wire with wiggly electricity next to another magnet, that second magnet (a speaker) will wiggle the exact same way, making the same sound that was put into the microphone.</li>
<li>The aux port of a phone or other device just connects the wiggly electricity to a new wire.</li>
<li>The cassette adapter changes the wiggly electricity to wiggly magnets, so that the tape player gets the same wiggly electricity in its wires to the car's speakers.</li>
