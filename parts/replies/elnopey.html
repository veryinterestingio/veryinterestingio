			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I get stuck in the weeds almost daily, and it's not because I can't do things, it's because when I start to plan out how I'll do everything (or try to do it when the time comes) I get distracted because then I'll go down that rabbit hole. </p>
<p>For example, when I get off work tomorrow I need to take some boxes to the recycling and take out the trash. But when I get there, I see that the dishwasher needs to be unloaded, I'll need to make dinner and eat, then do the dishes, oh I just got a text from someone and need to reply, then oh yeah I need to text this other person too, now I need to shower and brush my teeth, and I also need to wind down for the evening so I'm not amped up before bed.</p>
<p>And it starts all over again the next day, so the only way I will actually end up taking the boxes to the recycling is if I'm going to do something else and the boxes distract me because I'm close by.</p>
<p>Edit: Wow, I didn't expect this to get so much attention. If any of the above sounds familiar to you, a mental health professional should be able to evaluate you for it and hopefully come up with some ways to handle it. I'm not a big of medication for it, but that's just me. Find the right treatment for you, good luck everyone!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. I had the day off on Monday and had many, many errands to run and things to do. I don't get flustered or overwhelmed, but I'm aware of everything I need to do. Instead of just getting one thing done at a time I get half way into my first task and break off and start another.   </p>
<p>Example: I had to do some laundry and wash the dishes afterwards before going to the grocery store. I walked into my bedroom, dropped my unfolded clean laundry on my bed, went back to the washing machine and started another load. I began to head back to my bedroom and thought about the dishes again, so I washed the dishes. Clothes stayed unfolded until the end of the night. I got everything done, but out of order instead of just staying on-task.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A while ago I read some productivity &quot;hack&quot; that was something like &quot;if a task takes under 3 minutes to do, do it immediately instead of putting it off for later.&quot; &quot;Sounds great,&quot; I thought. About to make dinner and notice a cabinet handle is loose? Cool, just pop over to the hall closet and grab a screwdriver and come back and tighten it. Crap, one of the hall closet hangers broke and there's a coat on the floor. NBD, just grab a new one from the bedroom to replace it. But oh boy, look at all the drinking glasses on the nightstand. Those definitely need to go in the dishwasher--fuck, there are still clean dishes in there. Whatever, unloading them is only going to take a second. Glasses are in, better do a quick sweep to make sure there aren't any other dishes sitting out--what's that, the electric bill? Ok, that only takes a minute to pay, just need to open my laptop and--oh man, why do I have 32 Facebook notifications? That can't be good, better check and see what's going on...</p>
<p>Yeah, fuck that tip. There are always ten million things that need to be done, and they're still going to be there in an hour. There is no such thing as relaxing because you've taken care of everything you need to. There is only relaxing because you've taken care of the most urgent things, and are choosing to ignore the other stuff for a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I sometimes literally spin in place trying to decide what the most effective order to do my tasks is. Even if it's brushing my teeth, peeing, getting breakfast and getting dressed, LET'S SPEND 25SEC THINKING OF HOW TO DO IT because god forbid I need to wash my hands again or walk across my room an extra time. Gonna need this 100% effectiveness if I wanna waste 3h on reddit</p></div>		</li>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>When I'm doing stuff, I always get distracted by random tasks along the way and end up doing like 4 things at once. I can't sit down or I end up not doing anything. I have to do something immediately or something else takes my attention sometimes and I forget about the thing that I was originally supposed to do.</p></div>		</li>
