			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup - I found a little more on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>It's a devils bargain - yes the lobster can keep growing and refresh it's DNA, the water shields it from radiation and  as long as it can hide from predators it can keep growing.  But the Devil will have his due - their exoskeleton gets too big, parasites and disease take their toll.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't really answer the question for the most part. Hiding from predators and finding food to eat are not concerns for a lobster being raised by humans specifically to see how big they can get. The enormous size of some exceptional lobsters found in the wild also suggests that the square-cube law is not holding them back yet. We do also know that now-extinct arthropods have been much larger and heavier than even the biggest modern ones, so while arthropods will run in to square-cube law issues quicker than vertebrates it is not the deciding factor here.</p></div>		</li>
