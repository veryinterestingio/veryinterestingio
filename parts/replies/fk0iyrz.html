			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are doing the right thing by learning Python! It is the code that my lab uses for most of our work.</p>
<p>The best advise is to do during-semester and summer research stints. Find a lab or labs that carry out research in those areas and try to do research with them. There are summer programs that pay you for it as well.</p>
<p>I think classroom-based learning is great but nothing like undergraduate research. Having some paper(s) under your belt will also help you get into grad school easier if that is your goal.</p>
