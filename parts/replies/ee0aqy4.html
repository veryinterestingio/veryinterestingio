			<div class="markdown"><p>The speed of light is also the speed of gravity and is better described as the speed of causality. At the expected rate of expansion, the space between black holes expands at a rate exceeding the speed of gravity and causality, so they will never influence each other by the time the universe blacks out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Even gravity obeys the speed of light. It takes about 8.5 minutes for light to reach us from the sun. So if the sun, poof, disappears. Then it will take 8.5 minutes before the earth stops orbiting where the sun used to be.</p>
<p>So if gravity from a galaxy really far away is effecting our galaxy, but the space between our two galaxies starts to expand faster than light (space is expanding faster and faster) then once that space expands faster than light, gravity won't move fast enough to reach our galaxy and we won't feel it's gravitational effect any more. in fact the vast majority of galaxies in the universe have no gravitational effect on us. They're said to be gravitationally unbound to us. </p>
<p>It also means we'll never be able to reach them, even if we travel at the speeds of light. It's sad to think we're stuck in only a tiny tiny speck of the universe. Never able to go outside of it. :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is still up for debate. Gravity seems to “travel” but it also seems to have instant impact across vast distances. At least, this is still being sorted out with gravity strings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The concentration of mass doesn't change the amount of mass that's in the universe. The pull wouldn't change from collapsing all individual galaxies into individual black holes.</p>
<p>If you collapsed the Sun into a black hole right now, the orbits of the planets would remain unchanged because the mass of the Sun/black hole remained unchanged (if you ignore the natural formation process, which usually has stars shed some of their shell, ergo lose mass, not gain it).</p></div>		</li>
