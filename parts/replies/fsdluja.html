Capsule landed normally, only for the recovery team to discover that the crew were dead. There was an air leak and they suffocated. If they had suits they would be ok.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I donâ€™t have any examples that come to mind where it actually occurred but say there is a small tear that causes depressurization of the cockpit. Already having the suit and helmet on would save precious seconds and save your life</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. In the event of catastrophic failure the suits would be all but useless. I was just giving 2 famous examples of when things did go wrong.</p>
<p>The suits are useful as another layer of protection. If there is a minor problem like a leak, or a small rip, then the suits would protect the astronauts.</p>
<p>The most likely case that they would be necessary is if the capsule ejection is triggered (a problem with the rocket is detected and the part with the people is ejected). This puts HUGE forces on the capsule and could potentially damage it.</p>
<p>Additionally, until they get to space the life support systems on the craft are really not to be trusted because they could be damaged or fail.</p>
<p>I guess my greater point was that once they are out of the atmosphere, there really isnt much to go wrong, so they no longer need the suits.</p></div>		</li>
