			<div class="markdown"><p>Because of my english i might missunderstand you, but we do not treat adhd, as in cure. It is the diabetes of mental health. You keep the symptoms in check so you dont develop worse symptoms. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Treat and cure have slightly different meanings in English. When we treat a disease, we're just making it better, but when we cure a disease, we make it go away. Some treatments lead to cures, but not all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that’s an oversimplification. We have been trying to go top-down with mental illnesses and conditions. Trying to get those with them back to what we define as a normal state, instead of trying to understand how and why a normal person thinks the way they do and addressing the root deviance in the mentally ill. I.e. we’re treating symptoms, not the cause. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your comment. I'm aware of all of this but I just wondered whether that theory could explain circumscribed interests and obsessions as well. </p></div>		</li>
