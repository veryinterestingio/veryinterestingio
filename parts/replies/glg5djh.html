<p>Your question made me curious: how long would it take to build up 1 atmosphere's-worth of CO2 at our current emission rate?</p>
<p>Humanity's currently releases about 30 trillion kg of CO2 per year. The mass of our atmosphere is 5.1 quintillion kg, and the same mass would be required for CO2 at a partial pressure of 1 atmosphere, so...</p>
<p>(5.1 x 10^18 kg) / (3.0 x 10^13 kg /yr) = 170,000 years.</p>
<p>That's long...but not as long as I expected. 170,000 years ago, homo sapiens were inventing clothing. (I'll also note this calculation sidesteps the issue that the atmosphere would run out of oxygen first.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why same? The density of CO2 and the whole atmosphere is different right, so to occupy the same volume shouldn't mass be different?</p></div>		</li>
