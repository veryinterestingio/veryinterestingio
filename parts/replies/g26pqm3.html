			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most accurate scientific answer, but there are bits of truth in several other answers as well.</p>
<ol>
<li>Calorie deficit: If you don't eat enough during the day (and at regular intervals each day), you will crave more calories at night. High fat, high sugar items have the most calories, so it's natural to crave those items.</li>
<li>Emotional eating: Also a valid explanation. You may be bored in the evening, or trying to relieve the stress of the day. Eating releases endorphins, one of your brain's &quot;happy hormones&quot; that counteracts those feelings. Eating carbs, sugar &amp; fat also releases serotonin &amp; dopamine, two more types of &quot;happy hormones.&quot;</li>
<li>Triggers: Ads on television, which you're probably watching more of in the evening, display lots of fast, high craving foods like pizza, and that acts as a visual trigger to prompt you to eat.</li>
<li>Food scarcity: Evolutionarily speaking, we're wired to crave high fat, high sugar foods to keep energy levels up. We haven't evolved enough to contend with the massive amount of high fat, high sugar food that is always available.</li>
