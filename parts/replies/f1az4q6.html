			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I just can't do napping I find. If I get tired enough to lie down for &quot;30 minutes&quot; after dinner or something I just zonk out completely and setting an alarm rarely help, I just snooze it without really waking up or remembering I did it and then wake up 4-5 hours later when I should be going to bed cursing myself.</p>
<p>Granted I haven't made a consistent effort at it for an extended period. I work rotating shifts so my sleep schedule is all over the place, but more often than not I sleep during the day and sit up at night and just zombie though the relatively few day shifts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TIL.</p>
<p>I too am not a napper. If I wake up earlier than usual, that is my getupandgo moment. Time to get the day started!</p>
<p>I find naps are not my thing. I was tired enough to nap once in recent memory. I slept for 4 hours during the middle of the day!</p>
<p>Sleep time is heavenly! Hit the pillow and it is lights out time. I woke up and it is my rest day right now, so I should try to sleep again since it is 5, but I have been up since 4 and no way am I getting back to sleep. My day-clock says it is time to go. My mind is on. What exactly do I do to knock myself out? </p>
<p>Also, the uber man sleep schedule is supposedly for lucid dreaming. I had a buddy who tried it out. He was very much into lucid dreaming. I've only had a few of those.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>15 minutes is the magic number for me. Just enough time to let the sleepy brain juices drain out and not enough time for them to sneak back in. I don’t even have to feel that I fell asleep in order to feel dramatically less sleepy. 10 minutes is too short and 20 minutes is flirting with sleep again.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I know I've had 5 minute naps between alarm snoozes, that felt like half a days gone by.  Then other that feel instant and an hour has passed.</p>
<p>Is that literally just a toss of the dice rem or not rem?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No you’re right, it’s drifted a bit.  I’m hoping something comes along to hit at the difference in effects and results of those power naps.   </p>
<p>Usually I take a 5-10 minute siesta and I’m good to go and feel completely refreshed.  Other times I feel like I blinked and I feel like I got robbed I don’t understand why there’s such a huge difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So this is semi-accurate, but not really. The truth is that &quot;deep REM&quot; isn't really a thing, and REM sleep is not deep sleep at all. The brain activity you see during REM sleep is most similar to being awake than to anything else, which explains why this is where you dream. Sleep is categorized into stages (I-IV), plus REM. Generally you have to first pass through the first 4 stages, ending in very deep sleep (IV), before you reach REM, which then shows a spike in brain activity. If you wake up and go back to sleep for 10 minutes you will not reach REM sleep unless you have a sleep disorder. More likely you may be able to drop into stage II or III. The &quot;life hack&quot; sleep method you describe is certainly possible, but you will not just &quot;jump into REM sleep&quot;. And you wouldn't want to either. All the stages of sleep serve an important function, in reinforcing neural networks, memory consolidation, and other key activities that occur during sleep. Someone who gets only REM sleep and not an appropriate amount of the others will not be functioning properly over time.</p>
<p>The heightened brain activity during REM sleep also supports the notion that this is where you dream. This may explain why it is so hard to wake up from a dream and then resume it, because you can't just jump back into REM. If you happen to wake up during REM sleep, you will be able to much more vividly recall your dreams than if you wake up through the usual pathway of ascending back up through the stages.</p>
<p>Have you ever been dreaming and suddenly kiclked your leg or &quot;fell&quot; in the dream and woke up? Well, when you're in REM and dreaming, you're brain is as active as when you are awake, and as such is processing motor signals as if you were. But your body cant just run and jump in place and move around while you sleep, because it's impractical and wastes energy. So during REM sleep, pathways are triggered which inhibit most motor outputs from the brain, so that you can freely dream while not kicking your legs around with every &quot;dream step&quot; you take. However, evolution does it's thing and can kick you straight out of REM if it has to if your brain processes something such as &quot;falling&quot;.</p>
<p>However, if you're awakening from REM is desynchronized from your body, well that's how sleep paralysis happens. Your brain is &quot;awake&quot;, but isn't quite on the same page as the rest of your body resulting in the brain continuing to &quot;dream&quot; while awake, while the body is still inhibited from movement.</p>

<p>edit: I just realized I didn't answer his question at all. The real answer is that we still don't really understand the perception of time in the different sleep stages because it's hard to quantify a subjects perception of time passage because it's so variable. It is generally theorized that time &quot;seems&quot; to pass more quickly in the deeper stages of sleep due to the lessened frequency of brain activity. So if you fall back to sleep and dive back down to stage III or IV, it may feel like an instant, where as if you just stay on the surface level, time may seem to pass in &quot;real time&quot;. This is generally thought to be the case, but it has yet to be proven.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a very successful close family relative that sleeps on average like 5 hours. I spent my 3 month internship with them and I could barely keep up (and I was downing Ritalin plus monsters all day). He just kept working, ironing, tending the kids, driving the kids around, then even more work... and I'm like &quot;yeah, I suck at life&quot;. Granted he fell asleep very quickly after sitting down to watch TV and stuff. My gf is similar. She falls asleep very quickly. It's like they have a very efficient sleep. I envy them.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All stages of sleep (I-IV, REM) are vital to reinforcing neural pathways and memory consolidation. REM is not a magically type of sleep that fixes all your problems. Deep Sleep (Stage III and IV) are just as vital. Starving yourself of sleep and forcing your body to dive into REM sleep is not healthy and can and will have significant affects on cognitive function, mental stability, and ultimately mental well being over time.</p>
