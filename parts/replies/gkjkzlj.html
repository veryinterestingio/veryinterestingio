			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for posting that article, it really brings out good facts.</p>
<p>My work experience says yes, coal power has more toxic waste, plus coal ash, smoke, etc is <em>airborne</em> with plenty of radioactive byproducts... it's a little bit better since the mandates for &quot;cleaner coal&quot; (that term still makes me chuckle).</p>
<p>Radwaste is so much more controlled, and the power plants are so green.  It's shameful that we are abandoning nuclear power yet continuing to dig &amp; burn coal for electricity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All three have resource usage problems. Lots of energy to making all the steel etc for a nuclear plant, but longevity plays that out.</p>
<p>Wind and solar require a LOT more maintenance, and consume large amounts of plastics and oil in fabrication, and continued operations. They're not nearly as carbon free as you'd think.</p>
<p>It boils down to the same basics as always. What it takes as initial investment and continued operation, vs longevity to balance the costs out. Generally put, even old tech nuclear still ends up better for the environment. The initial costs are just the highest due to the size. Europe however has a great many newer plants that are more advanced and working towards smaller and smaller, mitigating these issues, especially compared to power density</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. When looked at as a cost/benefit, nuclear wins hand over foot both cost/energy and pollution/energy</p></div>		</li>
