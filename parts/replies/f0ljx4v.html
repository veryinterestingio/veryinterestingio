			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a little hard for me to answer, though I'm really grateful for the question. Normally, I think the go-to is to suggest citizen science projects in astronomy (<a href="https://astrobites.org/guides/citizen-science-efforts/" target="_blank"><a href="https://astrobites.org/guides/citizen-science-efforts/" target="_blank">https://astrobites.org/guides/citizen-science-efforts/</a></a>). That's probably the best way to directly participate and flex your logic muscles. I will say that I think we need to start having more of a conversation in STEM about citizen science and how it can sometimes have the effect of minimizing individual contributions. Done right, though, these projects are great (and as far as I know all the astronomy ones operate responsibly). (I'm super open to other suggestions here!)</p></div>		</li>
