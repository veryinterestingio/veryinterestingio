			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I guess since you work for a casino you actually <em>don’t</em> want to dispel myths. If they believe in the power of the winning streak or that bad luck can’t last forever it’s all better for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, we are <em>legally obligated</em> to do so. In every way. That's not to say we don't actively encourage gaming, but if someone shows the hallmarks of addiction, it begins to be our responsibility to <em>hopefully</em> prevent or slow that addiction.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's successful, sometimes it's not</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ha! I feel like there's a movie here. Adam Sandler's character from Punch Drunk Love has to explain probability to drunk morons then goes home and punches a hole in the wall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, I'm not criticizing you, I understand you're just trying to make a living, but casinos are so scummy to me. Like, the science of addiction is so well understood that they are able to craft the ideal environment to let that addiction thrive, to the point these laws probably make no difference. Logic does nothing in the face of addiction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Curious what you believe about those that have unusual luck and those with unusual bad luck? I find myself being one of those with exceptional luck. I literally &quot;win&quot; every time I go the the casino which means at some point I am up at least several hundred dollars. Now, if I overstay or try too hard to 'beat' a machine that's not paying obviously the money ends up going back to the casino. I tend to feel it out and float from machine to machine. I know there are people who can go to the casino and literally NOT win and it baffles me because I have an expectation of winning and that's what happens.</p>
<p>Do I just happen to be a human that falls constantly into that winning probability spectrum? Can consciousness alter probability on the quantum level?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you take a random population of humans and they do exactly what you said, there will always be someone who will win everytime or lose everytime</p>
<p>Same analogy as a coin toss with only one side of the coin appearing.</p>
<p>You cannot alter probability since it is math. However, you may be able to stop yourself from further wins or losses because you hit your threshold of risk.</p></div>		</li>
