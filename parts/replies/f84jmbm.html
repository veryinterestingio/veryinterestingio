			<div class="markdown"><p>The exact reheating mechanism is model dependant, but basically as you decrease the inflaton field energy density, it has to go somewhere, and thus it pumps energy into all the other fields. This is different from the concept of false vacuum decay as we don't have bubbles forming, but the inflaton field decaying everywhere at a finite speed. This is referred to as &quot;slow roll&quot; inflation.</p>
<p>What would this look like? You'd be in an empty cold low density universe that has accelerated expansion. Then rather quickly it would get really hot as particles pop up everywhere. The accelerated expansion then ceases.</p>
<p>As far as entropy is concerned, I would need to think really hard.</p></div>		</li>

<p>otherwise inflation leads to a cold dead universe. Inflationary spacetimes supercool the matter and radiation within them</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How do we know inflation cools matter and radiation? If we don't even know the mechanism, how can we be sure about that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is more or less because all inflation models need to satisfy certain requirements set by observation. Inflation has to do the following three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Explain why the universe is in thermal equilibrium. Despite never &quot;touching&quot; due to the finite speed of light, opposite sides of the universe are at the same temperature. Why is this?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain why the universe is spatially flat. The amount of matter and radiation and their kinetic energy determine the spatial curvature of the universe. This spatial curvature can easily be all kinds of numbers, why is it almost exactly 1 (flatness)?</p>
</li>
<li>And lastly (and potentially least important), explain the lack of observable magnetic monopoles that most grand unified theories predict. If the early universe (just after the Planck era) was chocked full of monopoles, where did they go? We should be swimming in them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two issues essentially have two solutions: (1) Either the universe is incredibly fine tuned, like a pencil standing on its head, or (2) some process causes the universe to be thermalized and flat.</p>
<p>Okay, let's go with option (2). We want some process that does these things. But we can't just invent arbitrary physics as by this point in the universe's history, gravity is already acting like Einstein says it should. Therefore we should restrict ourselves to models of inflation that can coincide with general relativity. And lo-and-behold if you have a huge cosmological constant for a very short amount of time, it does exactly what we need.</p>
<p>So in short: Even though we are completely ignorant about the details &quot;the inflaton field,&quot; we know what properties it has to have to fit observation. And these properties have consequences in general relativity like supercooling. To use an analogy, we have a puzzle piece missing, but we know what some of the pieces edges have to look like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your explanation! You made a good case for the inflation through higher cosmological constant. I couldn't really get the crux though:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Where does this consequence come from? I'm kind of at a loss how 'spreading something out' causes temperature loss, where does the energy go?</p></div>		</li>
