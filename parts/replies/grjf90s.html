<p>It applies to a lot more than just nuclear reactors.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Rickover is the father of nuclear power for electricity in the U.S.</p>
<p><em>“An academic reactor or reactor plant almost always has the following basic characteristics: (1) It is simple. (2) It is small. (3) It is cheap (4) It is light. (5) It can be built very quickly. (6) It is very flexible in purpose (’omnibus reactor’). (7) Very little development is required. It will use mostly off-the-shelf components. (8) The reactor is in the study phase. It is not being built now.</em></p>
<p><em>“On the other hand, a practical reactor plant can be distinguished by the following characteristics: (1) It is being built now. (2) It is behind schedule. (3) It is requiring an immense amount of development on apparently trivial items. Corrosion, in particular, is a problem. (4) It is very expensive. (5) It takes a long time to build because of the engineering development problems. (6) It is large. (7) It is heavy. (8) It is complicated.&quot;</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but at the end of the day, given these two options, why was uranium chosen to be used and reactors using it to be developed and simplified?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of outstanding challenges with molten salt reactors. Molten salts are corrosive, and solid reactor fuels hold fission products in place, unlike molten salt systems that allow fission products to float around. Plus, uranium (or at least U-235) <em>is</em> fissile, so while we still needed enrichment technology, we didn't need both enrichment and a thorium supply chain. Much of the light-water reactor supply chain was developed from the Navy's decision to use light-water reactors. In short, there were a lot of reasons ranging from unresolved technical issues with salt systems to the existence of a supply chain for light-water reactors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Enriched Uranium is a dual use technology. It was chosen because it was the most direct path to a bomb. The navy then saw the potential for powering ships and their initial investment and research paved the way for the light water reactors we use today. On paper Thorium molten salt breeders are an elegant solution but there is no one willing to pay the initial mover cost so it remains an idea. I think in a saner universe the green potential of thorium would have massive interest but unfortunately environmentalists are decidedly anti nuclear and the technology languishes in obscurity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Light-water reactors were created before molten salt reactors were. The first commercial nuclear power plant (Shippingport Atomic Power Station) came online in 1957. The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment didn't come online until 1965. We went with light-water reactors because we knew how to build and operate them. The idea that uranium was chosen for weapons reasons is <strong><em>also</em></strong> addressed on the <a href="https://whatisnuclear.com/thorium-myths.html#myth1" target="_blank">thorium myths</a> page</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of all the isotopes of all the elements that occur in nature, there is only one fissile isotope: U-235.  Uranium was chosen because initially, it was the only possible choice.</p>
<p>It's still the easiest and least complicated choice because you can dig uranium out of the ground and fuel a reactor with it.  It doesn't need to be transmuted into something else.</p></div>		</li>
