			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Connections&quot; by James Burke is the classic book. Also an excellent BBC series by the same name.  The subtitle on the first edition was &quot;A history of civilization according to technological change&quot;. It's not an exhaustive reference for all technologies, but it does demonstrate rather empirically that this technological change was never in a very straight line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t have any good resources on-hand, but the topic you’re looking for is called ‘History of Science’. If you’re looking for a broad overview, the barebones summary of ‘recent’ technological development goes something like this:</p>
<p>Development of non-segmented Steel -&gt; Development of Steam Engine -&gt; Development of Locomotion -&gt; Development if Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) -Development of Flight-&gt; Development of Electricity -&gt; Development of the Integrated Circuit -&gt; Modern Computing. </p>
<p>This obviously leaves out lots of branches like chemistry, material science, medicine, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very roughly, perhaps. The development of most technologies rely on many other previous advances. It’s certainly not a linear process, and sometimes technologies from centuries prior is combined with modern understandings to produce altogether new technology. If one were to make a diagram, it would be much more like a web than a ‘timeline’.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The beyond earth civilization spin off game has a better guide but all of that is made up tech. If that was the tech tree they used for ALL civ games then yes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure how technical of a read your looking for, so this might be a little too relaxed of a recommendation, but if you're just looking for something out of a layman's interest, &quot;Convergence: The Idea at the Heart of Science&quot; by Peter Watson sounds like something you'd be interested in.</p>
<p>It gives a rough timeline of pretty much all the larger domains of current science and their accomplishments, and then has a few chapters about the ways they're all converging on to a lot of the same ideas and principles the farther the fields go. Like I said, it's not a super deep dive, because each domain and even each accomplished could be (and are) books of their own, but for a general layout of what you seem to be interested in, it was a very enjoyable read.</p>
<p>Honestly another one of Peter Watson's books  &quot;Ideas: A History of Thought and Invention, from Fire to Freud&quot; sounds even more relevant to your question but I haven't actually read that one, though, so I can't speak to it as much. Again, his books are for the layman. I have other suggestions if you're professional looking for something a little more rigorous.</p>
<p>Honorable mentions that seem like they'd be relevant but from more specific angles:</p>
<p>&quot;Energy and Civilization&quot; by Vaclav Smil. Talks a lot of about technology and how we power it. Starts with food energy and human and animal powered tech, ends at present day. Shows what energy harvesting methods proceeded and influenced what technological advancements</p>
<p>&quot;The Perfectionists: How Precision Engineers Created the Modern World&quot; by Simon Winchester. Gives a general history of measurement in mechanical engineering, and what precise measuring instruments/increasingly small tolerances levels for size deviations had to be developed to allow the development of our most high tech instruments like the modern processor</p>
<p>&quot;Infinite Powers&quot; by Steven Strogat. A tour of a lot of the history of mathematics, mostly focusing on the development of calculus. Discusses what mathematical ideas and techniques had to be developed for what advances in technology.</p>
<p>These are also books made for the interested layman.</p></div>		</li>
