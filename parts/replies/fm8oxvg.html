			<div class="markdown"><p>Viruses have a very difficult time tricking the immune barrier that leads into the central nervous system. The central nervous system is particularly well defended, because viruses that get into the brain are very deadly. Rabies obviously has a powerful array of keys to the locks which trick the central nervous biochemistry pathways of mammals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also there are a lot of viruses that can occasionally pass from animal to human but does not pass from human to human. Actually, while rabies can pass from animal to human or animal to animal, it rarely passes from human to human. For most animals, this virus makes them aggressive and very likely to bite other animals to pass it on. For humans, while aggression is a side effect, this aggression rarely leads to a person biting another person so this virus doesnâ€™t work well at having us pass it on.</p></div>		</li>
