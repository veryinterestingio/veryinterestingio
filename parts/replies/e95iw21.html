			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Add to that that a horse's body is so heavy and dense that if they're left lying down in any position too long their organs started to get crushed and blood can't flow properly. Most commonly, the weight put on one or both lungs becomes so much that they can't breathe. They're built to stand. Humans are smaller, lighter, and our weight is spread out across upper body, lower body, and limbs, so we don't have to worry about that sort of thing the same way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The horse would need to be lying down for weeks or months to let the injury heal. Cows are usually only lying down for hours at a time. If a cow got injured in this way they would be put down too. It's just not newsworthy, unlike a well known horse athlete.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Lying down for months at a time is pretty unhealthy for a person too - but for a cow or horse it's much more dangerous</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Horses lay down too, it's just that there's a big difference between laying down for a few hours to sleep and laying down for days (let alone months) to heal</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, their weight is a huge issue. They have special slings to help them stand in the stall and take the weight off. However, it severely limits movement and depending on how long the recovery time is, most vets/owners factor in quality of life. It is extremely expensive and time consuming to rehab horses, and not everyone has them insured. Especially in the racing world, where horses are commodities and quantity over quality is big in the lower levels. The more horses you have, the greater the chance that at least one will be good. The rest are disposable. Of course, not everyone is like this, but there are those that only look for the big payout. </p></div>		</li>

<p>And any pet that is in major pain that is incurable is usually put down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, when you immobilize them for so long, it can restrict blood flow to the laminae (which connects the hoof wall to the flesh underneath). This can lead to laminitis which, the best human analog I can give would be imagine all of your fingernails and toenails are being pulled off slowly, but you also have to walk on them at all times. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve heard, but can not corroborate (help me horse people), that immobilizing a horse long enough for a major fracture to heal would result in atrophy (like in humans) and likely cause more fractures upon re-mobilization. It seems to make sense physiologically, but I’m not an equine guy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. In addition to that it's a race horse, not a pet. It's more like life stock.</p>
<p>A broken shoulder (depending on type of fracture) may never heal enough to be pain free.</p>
<p>A horse that can't be rode and is in significant pain, is not something you want to keep around.</p>
<p>It is indeed possible to fix things like broken legs, if it is a clean fracture, but it's very complicated, and the risks of new injuries is large.</p></div>		</li>
