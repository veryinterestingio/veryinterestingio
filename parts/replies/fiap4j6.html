<li>Electronics depend on electricity going where we want it to go.  Unless it's VERY pure water will act as a conductor causing it to go places it shouldn't.  This can cause it to behave wrong, which can lead to the components getting overloaded and permanently breaking.</li>
<li>Water will likely corrode the electronics.  If it's not too bad it may still work, especially if an expert cleans it.  If it's bad enough in order to fix it you usually need to replace it (again, you need an expert for this).</li>

<p>Pure water is not very conductive and in a pure environment it would not cause much damage if any. However in the real world the water is seldom pure and these impurities make the water conductive.</p>

<p>I was reading about this Japanese science lab that's trying to detect cosmic radiation or something, anyway, they use ultra purified water that is actually so corrosive it dissolved a wrench. </p>
<p>Water dissolving stainless steel...</p>
<p>They also use some weird lightbulb things...</p></div>		</li>
