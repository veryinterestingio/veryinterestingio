			<div class="markdown"><p>I have been too, inadvertently. Which meal do you usually have? I skip breakfast and lunch and usually have a satisfying dinner. I’m a bit of a snacker if I have to do more than usual. Snacking on junk makes me feel terrible and causes cravings for more junk, so I stay away from them altogether.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One meal a day would be an extreme version of intermittent fasting.  But snacking kind of negates any benefits.  You body just sees it as a small meal.</p>
<p>Think about it like training your body's appetite.  If you snack throughout the day, your body will assume you are a forrager and that the next meal is not far away.  But if you eat one meal a day, then your body assumes you are a hunter type and that it might be a while before your next kill.</p>
<p>So it responds in different ways. By going into ketosis, it is using stored fat energy and you don't get hungry.  But if you eat frequently, especially sugary or carb heavy items, then your body just stores more fat, and instead burns the easy to process sugars. Then you get hungry. Eat more crap. Etc.</p>
<p>I have had the best success with fasting 20 hours and eating twice in a 4 hour window.  And I eat only whole foods. Meat and veggies basically.  When I am true to this diet, I don't get hungry, I have more energy, aches and pains go away, and I stay pretty trim.   When I go back to eating crap, I feel like crap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not fasting. Unfortunately if you consume any calories (even black coffee, tea, etc.) then your body doesn't enter ketosis. It actually may have the opposite effect, and lead to weight gain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP but... Dunno how much info you were looking for, but I started fasting March of 2019. I eat only once a day (right after work) Monday through Friday. I eat basically whatever I want Sat-Sun but I avoid high sugar foods in general. I (M 35, 6'0&quot;) went from 289lbs to 255lbs in that time period. 20lbs fell off from March to May last year. I've been losing about 0.5lbs a week since then. My weight spiked up 10lbs around the holidays when I fell off the wagon for 4 weeks. But it came right back off in January. I do physical work but don't exercise outside of regular stretching. It took about 4-5 months for me to really get used to not eating all day. Now that I'm used to it, I feel better on fasting days than feeding days. It's more of a lifestyle than a diet for me now. My clothes fit WAY better, my joints feel great, and I get more looks from the ladies than before. 9/10 will still be eating once a day this time next year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been doing IF for a year now, lost 35 lbs, 20 lbs in 3 months.  The first 2 to 3 weeks are hard and some people experience what's called Keto Flu (google it) but after that period I feel like I have a superpower now.  It feels so normal to go 20 to 24 hours without eating.  As someone else said it feels really good actually.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong I do sometimes get really hungry but that happens way more when I eat more carbs and I don't eat enough fats.  It's empowering to know that those severe hunger pangs are really just hormones like ghrelin spiking because your body is just used to eating at a certain time.  If you can ride it out especially knowing it's a false alarm your hunger goes away.  This whole youtube seriously was super helpful in me understanding all that.  Check it out if you're interested.  It's worth watching all the videos, they each touch on shared topics but IMHO you need to watch all of them to get the big picture about nutrition, hunger and weightloss.  It's eye opening.  Some things are a bit of a stretch but I would say it's pretty accurate scientifically, I even dug deeper into several referenced studies.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am 6'1&quot; and weighted 265lbs.  I wanted to be healthier for my small children.  I started 65 days ago and do a combination of 16/8 / 17/7 intermittent fasting as well as count calories using a tracking app.  I have never found a diet to be easier than this one.  I have gone from 265lb to 229lb in that time.  Its been great.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would need to look at your nutrition during your eating window. You still need a good caloric intake, along with protein, fiber, carbs and good fat. If you’re hungry, you need to eat more, or change what you’re eating to more filling foods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do IF and i have been doing a meal kit delivery thing (the ones where you cook the meal from scratch), don't know if i am allowed to name it.  Its only $4.99 per meal and my wife and i eat something different every night.  It definitely makes eating less and dieting way less boring.  I break my fast at 11am with a shake, then a snack in the afternoon, then the meal kit dinner then another snack in the evening around 6:30pm.  I feel like i am eating a lot during my window and i am never really hungry.  lost 37lb in the last 65 days.</p></div>		</li>
