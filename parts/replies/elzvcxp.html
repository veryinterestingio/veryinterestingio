			<div class="markdown"><p>There's more salt in your sweat than in your eyes.  Especially since the purpose of sweat is to cool you by evaporation, so the stuff getting into your eyes is saltier than when it comes out of your pores.</p>
<p>edit.  Damnit, again a topic I barely know anything about gets far more upvotes than anything in my actual specialty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently the salt concentration in sweat is hypotonic. The concentration of NaCl in isotonic saline is 154mEq/L. Sweat is somewhere around 60-90mEq/L. Interesting <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1363543/?page=5" target="_blank">study</a>  from the 50’s. But for sweat, you also have to consider what is on your skin that could get carried by the sweat dripping across your skin - lotions, oils, sun screen, makeup, etc. Those things could be irritating to your eyes as well.</p>
<p>Edit: there’s other stuff, like potassium, in sweat as well but my understanding is the total concentration is still hypotonic to cellular concentrations.</p>
<p>Edit 2: I was reminded that evaporation is a thing. Salt concentrations in the citation above I believe are initial concentrations and are estimates of what is actually secreted from sweat glands. So evaporation plus picking up additional solutes from the skin might actually make the sweat hypertonic. As mentioned by a couple commenters, any solution that is not isotonic could potentially cause burning sensation. This doesn’t happen to your skin because your skin has a layer of dead skin cells and keratin in addition to oils that insulate living cells from the environment. You also don’t get burning in your mouth from straight water because you have a layer of mucous protecting the living cells somewhat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct about the initial sweat concentration. But if you consider that you could be sweating for quite some time before forming a droplet on the skin, there will be a lot of salt on the skin from previously vaporated sweat. So when the droplet travels to your eye it can picks up a lot of salt and becomes significanly more &quot;salty&quot;!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Age and continued browsing of Reddit also increases salt content in your body drastically. For max effect become overweight and unattractive to the opposite gender.</p></div>		</li>
