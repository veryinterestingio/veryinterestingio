<p>In a small combustion engine you're only interested in the mechanical energy, created by expanding gases, that rotate the engine. <em>But</em> the majority of the chemical fuel gets wasted as heat energy and in a car you can't do anything useful with it, aside from using a little to heat the cabin in winter.</p>
<p>That's why fuel is always better used in a power plant, because you can build infrastructure around it, that requires heat to work and 'double dip' to maximize the efficiency of the power plant by utilizing the waste heat of the power generation for other industrial processes (that otherwise would have to waste more electricity/fuel to power their heaters).</p>
<p>For example a lot of cold climate countries have cities with centralized heating, so the electric power plants waste heat is used to heat buildings in the entire city, maximizing the efficiency of the fuel used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You were right without really intending to be right. In the simplest thermodynamic terms, both a power plant and a car engine are &quot;heat engines.&quot; </p>
<p>The higher the temperature difference between the operating temperature and the atmosphere, the more efficent the heat engine has the potential to be. </p>
<p>Its a lot easier to achive insanely high temperatures in a large-scale combustion turbine where your biggest limitation is the melting point of your materials rather than a vehicle motor.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What an odd response. He didn't mean to say what he said?</p>
<p>You are arguing the same thing (a (bigger) plant is more efficient than a car), except you provided more details.</p></div>		</li>
