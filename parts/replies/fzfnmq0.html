			<div class="markdown"><p>Being hacked is a good one. Now to mine:</p>
<p>I was playing the CoD 2 campain and wanted to avoid shooting in some church at all cost. I can't remember the specifics but I think the game wouldn't progress that way, I HAD to fight in there to continue, so I tried to lure the enemies out or only use the stab attack.. anyway I knew I had just cheated myself with that workaround.</p>
<p>This music started and I have opened the main menu - despite this stopping all the game sounds, the music kept playing.</p>
<p>I got really hot and frightened, this really really freaked me out, I knew I did something wrong. I quit the game but the music kept playing, it was haunting me.</p>
<p>My last straw was to turn down the volume knob to get the speakers stop doing whatever the fuck they were doing in this moment and that's the climax of the story: Due to how the transistor and the coil work* the music got LOUDER despite me turning it down. Like I physically made the speakers shut up but they sang this slavic opera in a foreign language even louder. I knew the universe just went against me with all its power - I should've just NOT killed someone in that church, I was gonna get punished really bad.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>A second later I powered down the speakers (with the actual ON/OFF button) which finally made it stop. Later I discovered that the louder you got the speakers the quieter the &quot;radio&quot; goes.</p>
<p>But these 15 seconds were probably one of the worst moments of my life. The menu not stopping it, the &quot;turning down&quot; making it even louder, just wow, that was an awful experience.</p>
<p>I still have these speakers, they aren't my main speakers anymore but WHEN I use them and its 10 PM, the show begins and it still freaks me out every time.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>*= I have absolutely not idea about why this is doing what it's doing with the volume</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything is an antenna if you're brave enough (applies to transmit antennas mostly). And yes, capacitor, resistor and diode and you got yourself an AM receiver. I'm an amateur radio operator and if I forget to turn my PC speakers down before transmitting I can hear myself with a lot of noise on top from the speakers. Transmitting with 100W at around 14MHz and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-sideband_modulation" target="_blank">SSB modulation</a> I can understand what I'm hearing from the speaker, with FM modulation (50W, 144MHz) all I can tell is someone is speaking but everything is garbled.</p></div>		</li>

<p>All circuit diagrams i’ve seen for even “basic” receivers have more parts that that.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>With the mere suggestion of a coil, a capacitor, a spark gap, and a switch you can really make amateur radio operators scowl and look cross.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Went to an Eagles concert ~1973. The venue was really close to a 50,000 watt radio station and between songs when they were quiet you could hear what the radio was playing.  At one point the station played &quot;Oh, Carol&quot; (the Stones version) and the band played along.  Fun stuff.</p></div>		</li>
