			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak for the IRS but this is definitely the reason in Canada. </p>
<p>As an example, up here we get a deduction for charitable contributions if we save receipts for them, ditto medical expenses if they're collectively a high enough percentage of our income. There's no way the government can inventory 100% of either of those.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here the equivalent of the IRS does our taxes. We have to check it and add anything they missed like private contract work or any income. But for most people who have only a single job for a company don't have to add anything (and most of the time they don't even have to pay, since it's already been deducted from the salary during the year).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that's how it works in many other countries.</p>
<p>In my country the tax official sends you a form like &quot;this is how much we're going to tax you, let us know within a month if it's not accurate&quot; or something like that. Then it lists all of your income and deductions. For me it has usually been spot on, but you can add some deductions or income if needed.</p></div>		</li>
