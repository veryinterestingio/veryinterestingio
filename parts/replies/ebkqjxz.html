			<div class="markdown"><p>In the DSM 5 there are a few different versions of movement disorders. Stereotypic movement disorder is one of them, but besides tourettes disorder you also have persistent motor or vocal tic disorder, and provisional tic disorder. I think a lot of practitioner still defaults to tourettes because this is what they're familiar with. Oftentimes it's the duration and severity of the symptoms that are the deciding factors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm also. I can hold in my motor tics but it’s very uncomfortable to do so and I often have to tic several times to get the feeling to go away. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. I can trigger my tics if my neck/back is touched in a certain way, so my bf and I decided to see how long I could hold them in for before going crazy. Pretty much he just pinned me down, and then lightly touched my back and neck to trigger my tics. For the first couple I could suppress them, but after that it came extremely physically and mentally taxing. He was holding me down, so I couldn't let them out. Once he released me after about 2 minutes of this, I think I ticked (ticed? ticced?) for 10 minutes straight, uncontrollable motor and vocal tics. It almost looked as if I was having a seizer...definetly not doing that again </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm gonna admit, until the seizure part, that actually kinda sounds fun. Sorry you had to go through that though. Do you mind saying what your tics are for a bit of context? I personally have a neck twitch, foot tapping, and, strangely enough, eye-crossing/defocusing, if saying mine means anything.</p>
<p>Edit: a letter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow that sounds scary! I only have motor tics but that would not be fun. I get this weird pressure/feeling in the back of my neck, almost like where my back and neck meet before I tic. I usually don’t hold them in, but if I’m in public or around a lot of people I try to do one of my tics that are less noticeable </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this, it's an excellent explanation. Most people don't get that tics are totally unlike like a twitches/muscle spasms. In typical Tourette's fashion, it's much weirder than that.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh shit! I didn’t even think to look for a subreddit for it. I was recently diagnosed with Tourette’s after 15 years of unexplained tics.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p></div>		</li>
