			<div class="markdown"><p>You can do it with tinfoil but also just a foil covered gum wrapper. As long as the metal is touching two fillings you'll be good. When you bite down and it's touching the one on top and bottom you'll feel it. If you get it just right you can do it biting on a fork or something too</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, you have to have fillings, and older fillings. Works best with silver ones, and dentists rarely if ever use silver fillings anymore.</p></div>		</li>
