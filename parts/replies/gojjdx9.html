			<div class="markdown"><p>In NZ (could be different elsewhere) diesel is cheaper because its not taxed anywhere near as much 'at the pump' . This is due to the agricultural and non-road use where the majority of petrol tax is spent. Instead Road users buy kilometres on their vehicle registration which makes up the tax difference. The end result is still slightly cheaper, but only just.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the UK we have ‘red diesel’ which is literally diesel that has been dyed red. It is much cheaper (half the price) but for agricultural / off road use only and illegal to use on the road (police have equipment to test random cars).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact.</p>
<p>If you do run out of fuel these can be used to by a nice policeman to give you enough fuel to drive a mile to the closest petrol station</p>
<p>Takes a few pumps as its a small container desogned to see the colour of the fuel but it works if your blocking the road and aa are taking 3 hours to get to you...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello fellow kiwi! Also, diesel drivers here should be aware that whether going diesel saves money comes down a lot to the K's driven and fuel economy of the vehicles, since RUC are based on distance while fuel tax is applied by the litre</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get 68mpg (real world, 79mpg on paper) in a 7 seater diesel MPV and no vehicle tax as its low emissions. Need to put adblue in it once every 12000 miles but worth it. </p>
<p>Also factor in the fact that diesel engines are heavier and generally last longer, the car should easily manage 200k miles without a problem which saves money too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes sense as an explanation between 2006 and 2017. However, in 2017 &quot;Tier 3&quot; gasoline emission requirements were put in place, lowering gasoline sulfur emission requirements to 10 ppm. This makes treating diesel and gasoline similarly difficult, with both types of fuel generally requiring expensive and high quality catalytic hydrotreating units.</p>
<p>Seals cracking in older vehicles <em>appears to be</em> because the hydrotreating process lowers aromatics, which has some sort of affect on the seal quality. I say &quot;appears to be&quot;, because almost all of the talk I can find about it is on car forums filled with people who seem very into fuel processing and have absolutely zero knowledge about it, including claiming that hydroprocessing increases aromatics (no) or that aromatics are an additive (not really).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was told the seals being destroyed was because ethenol was being added to fuels now and it just eats at certain kinds of rubber. That may strictly be in gasoline tho, I would love for someone to inform me on the truth tho.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The price thing is confusing me. In the UK (as far as I know) diesel has always been about 10% more expensive so you had to average over 20k miles a year to make buying a diesel worthwhile. </p>
<p>There is red diesel which is tax free but it's not for road vehicles(mostly farmers use it).</p></div>		</li>
