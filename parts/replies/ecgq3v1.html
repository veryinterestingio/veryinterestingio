			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hardly a record. People work in anechoic chambers; the common 45 minute quote is (as far as I know) just some reporter who mentioned feeling uncomfortable in one after 45 minutes.</p></div>		</li>

Anechoic Chambers are badass, but way over hyped. I've spent plenty of time in them. Ive never gone for a record because I have work to do, but I have no doubt I could spend a day in one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our department had one at work. The main sensation I remember is it felt like your ears were plugged up with a head cold. Clapping your hands sounded more like a thud.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So, the room is called an Â 'anechoic' chamber. Had one at university. It will drive you mad after a certain amount of time, so they say. They will have panels to absorb the sound waves and refract them into non existence. </p>
<p>If your interested in this sort of stuff look up holmsholt resonators and standing waves, too. Quite an interesting area</p>
<p>(I studied music physics at Uni, and then went on to work on a theory about how the ear works, where we (tried to) replicate the human ear with software using IR filters. Now I'm a radio engineer too. It's all about waves man lol)</p></div>		</li>
