			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be a lot of work, as is the electric grid.  Forest fires aren't the only issue though. Drought conditions are still a big problem that seems to be getting bigger. Maybe it could be a regional solution for the West Coast and Southwest rather than throughout the country?</p>
<p>Like others said, it seems like there's some kind of opportunity there for &quot;water arbitrage,&quot; if you could get past the 'small' hurdles of funding building and maintaining a bazillion miles of pipe for a technology that's not ready for prime time. ;-)</p>
<p>If someone figured it out though...</p></div>		</li>
