			<div class="markdown"><p>On earth, it would fade pretty quickly. The atmosphere does a good job of absorbing most UV as you get farther from the purple end of the visible spectrum, and the same is true in infrared (though infrared is less strongly attenuated than UV in air). <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/gftz35/do_rainbows_contain_light_frequencies_that_we/fpw20am/" target="_blank">Wazoheat's comment</a> below links to <a href="https://www.atoptics.co.uk/fz685.htm" target="_blank">this IR image of a rainbow</a> which really clearly shows the 'heat' of the infrared beyond the red, but you can see how quickly it dies out from atmospheric absorption (mostly water vapor, so humidity will effect this extinction a bit). </p>
<p>Ultimately it'll depend on the actual source of your light (sun's black body spectrum? a different star? an incandescent light?), how absorbent your medium is (ie, are you doing this experiment in air? under water? in Mars' atmosphere?) and the material you're using to make the rainbow (any weird structural effects resulting in interference? water droplets in air or a prism on a table? any nonsmooth trends in index of refraction as a function of wavelength?). </p>
<p>The answer I gave above seems easy to get your head around, but optics is highly nontrivial.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You may be interested to know that the human eye can actually see UV, though our lenses filter it out. Some people have had theirs replaced surgically and can <a href="https://www.itworld.com/article/2732596/real-world-superpowers--eye-surgery-lets-some-see-well-into-the-ultraviolet.html" target="_blank">see UV light</a>. <a href="https://petapixel.com/2012/04/17/the-human-eye-can-see-in-ultraviolet-when-the-lens-is-removed/" target="_blank">Claude Monet</a> famously had a lens removed and the colors of his paintings changed afterwards.</p>
<p>Personal speculation time: If you do some Googling of people's experiences viewing UV, while we may be able to <em>see</em> the UV, it's not clear that our brains are capable of understanding it. Most accounts I've seen of it describe it as gray or silvery.</p>
<p>Intuitively, I imagine that it's similar to when certain people that are essentially blind are able to regain their vision later in life through some medical procedure and have extreme difficulty interpreting shapes, depth, etc. I wonder how someone who was born without a lens and grew up with the ability to see UV would interpret it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>UV just triggers the blue cones in the eye, so it just shows up as deep blue (source: my artificial lenses and my uv flashlight).</p>
<p>So it doesn't create any new signals to the brain, it's just like taking off those yellow-tinted sunglasses that are meant to help with eye strain.</p>
<p>I wonder if you're referring to people who are also tetrachromic, who have an extra color sensor type in the eye.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered why near-UV like the kind coming from blacklights appears purpleish rather than very deep blue. Purple is typically a mixture of red and blue, yet the red cones are on the other side of the spectrum. Near-UV also appears blue on cameras, yet has a purpleish hue IRL. Why is this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>its so cool to imagine a world where something so &quot;simple&quot; could be so profound.</p>
<p>I know... it probably wasnt so simple at the time, but its still a bit depressing.  These days, scientific discovery probably involves 20 years of work and a few million dollars of specialized equipment.  Back then you needed a prism and a thermometer to put your name into the history books forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would be shocked how often discoveries are made with a year or less of work. Even if it's not a full independent discovery, citizen-scientists can make fairly large contributions. </p>
<p>There are also quite a few scientists &amp; engineers that go and simplify equipment so it's cheaper / diy. It will be good enough for 90% of what anyone would need. It might not be cutting edge equipment, but is often far better then stuff 20 years ago.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I really can't think of any recent examples. Especially compared to the industry-like scale science is run across the world nowadays, the contributions to science of people who are not professional scientists is, as far as I can tell, essentially negligible.</p>
<p>But I'd be delighted see some recent examples of at least somewhat important science that didn't come from within academia or industry.</p></div>		</li>
