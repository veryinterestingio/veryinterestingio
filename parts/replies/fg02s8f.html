			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the answer to that question, as to the relative amounts (mass/volume) of fallout material compared to the initial bomb materials.  But, rest assured that fallout is a big, big deal.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Bravo" target="_blank">For your review</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this, the initial radioactive fission products are the most intense and the the ones with the shortest half-lives.  If you can avoid them for a few days you've avoided the worst but you'd still be vulnerable to long term exposure to the other products.  The Japanese victims were exposed to the immediate fallout.</p></div>		</li>
