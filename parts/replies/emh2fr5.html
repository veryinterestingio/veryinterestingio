<p>The distance to things at the edge of our observable universe has always increased faster than the speed of light. Initially the distance to light emitted from it increased, but as the distance to the light didn't increase as fast as the distance to the matter emitting it the light could eventually get closer to us, and reach us later.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that the universe has any sort of edge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The edge idea is propagated by using the analogy of an inflating balloon.  </p>
<p>The little detail that matters, I think, is that in the balloon analogy, the universe would be a zero-thickness surface on the balloon, <em>not</em> the volume the balloon occupies.  </p>
<p>If you can imagine yourself living within that surface as a 2d life-form, there would be no edge to find.</p>
<p>It's better to think that the available space where things can exist is expanding, but from within that space, the expansion is everywhere simultaneously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. It has a speed. Nothing in space with mass can move faster than light.  There is no limit to expansion of space though.  It’s expanding in all directions (where gravity isn’t keeping it together)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's measured in velocity per distance (like the Hubble constant in km/s/Mpc), but this can also be expressed as inverse time or, as I like to think of it, fractional distance change per time. We can rearrange the units on Hubble's constant to read km per Mpc per second and work out at what rate the fractional expansion of space is happening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the affects of those objects could have already propagated to the observed star.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Star A is at edge of observable universe, star B is at slightly nearer to us and under the influence of Star A's gravity.</p>
<p>Star A is accelerated past the edge of the edge of the observable universe due to inflation.  Star B is still visible and is still under the influence of Star A.</p>
<p>This doesn't give us any information we couldn't have had in the past.  It does give us information about the past that would otherwise be unavailable now.</p>
<p>It also doesn't tell us anything about what that star is doing or how it's behaving after it's crossed the edge of the observable universe.</p>
<p>But we could know &quot;there was a star that was here in the past and crossed the boundary&quot;.</p>
<p>Practically this would be impossible with stars and seems unlikely to with galaxies.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You aren't using words properly. It doesn't make sense for something to be outside the observable universe but whose effects are still detectable. If the effect of star A on star B is detectable, by definition star A is still part of the observable universe. You for some reason think that gravity travels faster than light.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, I don't.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>You're right on this but it could use some explanation.</p>
<p>I was saying that at the point in time that the star crosses the boundary, it's gravitational effects are still propagating in the space between the stars.  The mistake I made was:  so is the fact that it just crossed the boundary.  At the same moment we become aware of it crossing the boundary is the same moment that those gravitational effects are also no longer able to reach us.</p>
<p>On a side note, you come off as aggressive.  Try concentrating on the issue instead of the person.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not sure that's correct. Consider: There is an object A outside our observable universe. Its light cannot reach us.  Now suppose there is an object B that is within our observable universe, and object A is within B's observable universe. Object A has a gravitational effect on B. We detect the gravitational effect on B from A because B is within our observable universe. </p>
<p>So while the gravity from A cannot reach us, it can reach and have an effect on B, which we can observe. B is essentially acting as a relay for the information from A.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What about inflation? If the universe went through an era of fast-than-light expension early on, then wouldn't that allow for variations in density to have asserted gravitational pulls on their surroundings, but then moved the source beyond the event horizon?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well the entire point of inflation is to explain why distant parts of the universe <em>don't</em> have variable density and/or temperature, and instead look uniform.  Inflation would have happened very, very early in the universe's history -- tiny, tiny fractions of a second after the big bang event (assuming that event actually happened).  If there were any variations in that extremely early state prior to inflation, inflation would have smoothed those variations out.  That's why inflation was originally proposed:  to solve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_problem" target="_blank">homogeneity problem</a>.  Distant parts of the universe look so similar to nearby parts of the universe because they originally were very close by, coming into thermal equilibrium with the matter we're made of, and then inflation happened which drove them apart.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Or just before the Big Bang, might be a better way to think of it. Because <em>if</em> inflation happened, we, almost by definition, don’t know how that part of the universe looked before. For all intents and purposes, then, the universe when inflation stopped and “reheating” occurred (even though there might not have been any “heat” before).</p></div>		</li>
