			<div class="markdown"><p>How can something be both behind and in front of you? If it's to one of your sides I get that, but in the image OP posted, the Earth is directly behind them; they are not positioned with their side towards the earth</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the earth was actually directly behind the astronaut you wouldn't be able to see space. </p>
<p>You're conditioned by seeing photos of the entire earth where you can see all of it at once, so looking at the image you interpret that curvature as meaning the earth is directly behind the person</p>
<p>but in reality if you are up there the earth will fill one entire side of your perspective. If you can see space then the angle is about 90 degrees, perpendicular to the earth</p></div>		</li>
