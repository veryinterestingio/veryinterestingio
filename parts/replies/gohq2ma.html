			<div class="markdown"><p>Plenty of immunisations use(d) weak <em>but transmissible</em> viruses to confer immunity to stronger ones. Smallpox inoculation used scabs from people who had a particularly weak strain of <em>variola minor</em> to give a mild case of smallpox to the patient, deliberately. Edward Jenner used related infectious disease <em>cowpox</em> to confer immunity to smallpox, and later used <em>vaccinia</em> to confer immunity similarly.</p>
<p>More recently (1960), the Sabin vaccination against <em>poliomyelitis</em> uses a weakened strain of polio to deliberately infect the patient orally and confer immunity to stronger strains. This is definitely transferrable, as it's considered one of the benefits of this vaccine that vaccinated kids will inadvertently infect kids that didn't get the vaccine (the transmission is f√¶cal-oral, and this relies on the fact that kids are not very clean). A downside of this, is that the vaccine strain can mutate as it passes between infectable people and become dangerous again. A non-negligible proportion of current polio infections come from mutated vaccine strains. This is why in areas where polio is no longer endemic -thankfully almost everywhere- the Salk vaccine (dead virus) is used instead. This doesn't have the benefit of passing from patient to patient, but does have the benefit of not mutating. If you're a kid in a developed country today, you probably get the Salk vaccine. If you're a kid in rural India or subsaharan Africa, you might still get Sabin because the risk to your unvaccinated peers is less from mutation than from wild polio. The opposite is true in developed countries.</p></div>		</li>
