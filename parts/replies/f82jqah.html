			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to say that it puts you in a perspective where it can feel like you're experiencing things for the first time. Instead of seeing just another tree, for example, you feel like you're looking at hundreds of years of growth and trillions of cells. I almost feel like I can feel the evolution it took for this beautiful thing to be in front of me. A good trip also feels, at least to me, like this is exactly what I should be doing in this moment. Truly a beautiful and dramatic experience</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. My first trip, I just looked at stuff and it looked wild. My third trip, though, I took 200ug with a friend, and the introspection was unbelievable. It's like I finally understood what it all meant and how it related to me.  You know, what, it's reddit, and we're talking about LSD so I'll give my own anecdote.</p>
<p>That one time on LSD, everything felt like a fever dream. Shit was happening and it was *very* intense. Near the level of full sensory overload, and I really hated it. I felt very off. I remember eating a slice of roast beef, looking down at my plate, and asking myself &quot;Am I eating correctly? Is this how normal people eat? Is there supposed to be this little bit of food that fell over? Why does it look so bloody? Fuck, everyone's laughing at me. Stay cool, stay cool.&quot;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So that wasn't very fun, but then I went to my room with my friend, and shit was seemingly more normal. We spent hours in there, playing (or trying to learn to play) new card games. I very intensely recall us both looking at the same splashes of gasoline of the ceiling (weird description, but you get it. The colors gasoline makes when it's on the floor. Like metallic-rainbowy.) There was also an epiphany of mine, in which I felt, truly, truly felt, that 4+1=3, and my friend claims he looked out the window and say a memory. Like, physically, saw it. To this day, I still don't know, but I completely buy it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Near the end, when we were coming down and both now becoming more coherent, we spoke a lot about what had happened and how calming it had felt. It was very surreal. There was like a disconnect between what was happening now, between who the people we were now and the people we were pre-trip actually were. I don't wanna claim ego death, but that's for sure how it felt. There was also a lot of nonsensical rambling about &quot;What it all means&quot; and about how &quot;Is it now? If now is not now, then is now not now and is it now then?&quot; A lot of thoughts around that line. </p>
<p>A good comparison is maybe weed. Weed, at least for me, gives me crazy thought loops, things like: &quot;Yo, that was a funny joke, lol, wait I'm laughing, what am I laughing about again? What is laughter? Oh it's like caused in the lungs. Lungs are organs, organs are biology, biology is a science. You like science. Your dad likes science, you don't like your dad. He never got you a puppy, puppies are cute.&quot; Stuff like that. I'd say LSD gives very similar, but much more focused thought loops. Like, you're kind of capable of staying on course with whatever it is you're thinking about, but you're brain is still gonna be going at 5000 MPH, and it's still gonna acknowledge all this other information, and you're just not gonna know what to say because it all conflicts, and your brain can't ultimately decide what it's going to say. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>That was long and probably very boring. But talking about acid is always subjective and very fun. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll counter this experience with mine. It was like everything turned the most awful shade of grease covered green, I couldn't make sense of my own thoughts or words or anyone else's. Time and events seemed to fracture and happen at random events. It seemed like it lasted forever and I couldn't wait for it to end.</p>
<p>I think it's a very subjective experience, and you should never take someone else's trip description as what it's going to feel like for you personally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think your experience will also depend on who you are with. My best blissful trips were with my closest friends in his dormroom. Doing it in unfamiliar surroundings with unfamiliar people is a recipe for a bad trip man</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, environment and the people you are with make a huge difference.  In a safe environment that is familiar is better than walking through the mall. My best ones were in nature or in a friend‚Äôs house/backyard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have anxiety my friend.  </p>
<p>This is why it‚Äôs imperative to have a plan for your trip.  At least when you‚Äôre inexperienced. Know what you‚Äôre going to be doing, where you‚Äôll be and who will be popping in and out.</p>
<p>Sometimes during trips, when something unexpected happens- something that normally might startle you for a moment but then you move on- will turn you into a bit of internal spiral to panic.</p>
<p>LSD emphasizes the emotions it is given.  If you‚Äôre happy, you‚Äôre ecstatic.  If you‚Äôre sad, you‚Äôre the lowest of the low.  And so on.</p>
<p>The good news is, this can easily be remedied by falling back on doing something that you know will make you happy.  That‚Äôs why music is such an integral part of tripping, at least to me.  I got caught up looking for my remote once, and what soberly would‚Äôve been a few minutes of frustration, turned into almost a half hour of me scurrying around my apartment in a full blown panic- to the point where I was no longer even worrying about the remote I was worrying about existential, reality-bending things I can‚Äôt even articulate.  Once I recognized this, and kinda got on top of the wave per se, I stopped, grabbed my phone and threw my headphones in, and in minutes it was like it never even happened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you're correct about him having anxiety. The problem is that it's not exactly easily remidied with happy things. Sure, it's dependent on the person. But I've tripped dozens of times, and it only got worse even when my anxiety got better. The first few times were great. But something &quot;unlocked&quot; and I would have bad trips every time after. Even with anxiety under control, it was physically too intense to ignore sometimes. Feeling individual organs move inside your body, and feeling your breath turn different temperatures vigorously. That stuff along with  visuals is too much to take even if you have light anxiety.</p>
<p>Tldr: if you have even slight anxiety, I would advise against lsd or mushrooms . A lot of people are helped by them, but if you're hesitant about taking them, just don't.</p></div>		</li>

‚ÄúYou hear colors and see sounds.‚Äù Its very hard to describe clearly but when music is playing colors become vibrant and pop or shimmer. When looking at colorful objects in reality it‚Äôs like you can hear them with a sensation in your ears.</p></div>		</li>
