			<div class="markdown"><p>Changing states is an incredibly energy intensive process. Changing the temperature of an object is practically nothing.</p>
<p>One of my favorite &quot;gee-wiz&quot; facts is the following:</p>
<p>You have two containers of water. One is filled with ice, and the other liquid water. Both are at 0°C.</p>
<p>The exact same amount of energy it would take to turn the 0°C container of ice into 0°C liquid water, you could heat the other container of water to 70°C.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And another neat fact, at phase changes, when heating water up, (edit: <em>as it starts boiling</em>), it doesn't increase in temperature at all, the energy 100% goes into phase change.  That's why a pot of water boiling is always the same temperature (except at different altitudes (edit: <em>pressures</em>))</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how rice cookers know when they're done cooking. The instant the last of the water is boiled away, the bottom heats to more than 100°C, and the rice cooker senses that and switches over to 'keep warm' mode.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This also means that, at least to the extent you can get pure water, you can use ice water (or boiling water) as a calibration for freezing (/boiling) temperature, if you want to check a thermometer or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This actually is not technically true. Boiling is a function of temperature and pressure yes, but also a function of availability of nucleation sites. So heterogeneous boiling occurs near 100 C at 1 atm assuming there are plenty of nucleation sites available. (Note that if you measure temperature more carefully you actually will find a thermal boundary layer of superheated water near the heating element). </p>
<p>However homogeneous boiling, or boiling in the bulk fluid, does not occur until the fluid is nearly 300 C!</p>
<p>Boiling is actually a very complicated process and understanding of it in a mechanistic rather than empirical way has only really made big strides in the last few decades. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would take more energy to ten that ice into steam but I imagine the surface area would mean that it’s actually absorbing energy more slowly than the water would. Water will spread out and eventually get a huge surface area relative to its volume if you’re spraying it around. It’s also way easier to move liquid water around. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surface area is reduced so melting or sublimation would take longer than with water.</p>
<p>You can however throw dry ice into fire and it'll quickly stop it, since that evaporates much faster, plus it forms a dense CO2 layer right on top of the flames, starving them of oxygen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The extra energy needed is for overcoming force of attraction between molecules, so its pretty much a potential energy.  Once that potential hill is climbed there's enough energy to overcome attractions.  Adding enough energy to ice overcomes forces of attraction and spreads molecules further apart due to the molecules being more energetic.  Same goes for adding energy to liquid water in order to change into a gas</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This also ignores the thermal barrier water provides on an object. For example, throw a wet log in a fire, you will find that the water has to convert to steam before the log will really ignite. Similarly in a fire, if you spray water on the burning material, the water has to evaporate before the material can start to pyrolize again. In the firefighting world we will spray water and sometimes water based gel onto structures or brush before they come in contact with fire to prevent them from igniting. </p>
<p>Also, water can act as a blanket to overcome the vapor pressure of a flammable liquid. Most flammable liquids will float on top of water, but use a water foam solution and you can make the water float on top of the flammable liquid preventing the flammable liquid from producing vapor (which is what burns). We use fluorocarbon surfactants for this type of fire suppression.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Covering a small fire with a blanket, practicing 'stop, drop, and roll', or using sand to put out a campfire works that way.</p>
<p>Liquid water can also have that smothering effect, but if the fire is so big and/or hot that it boils the water, the energy of vaporization additionally sucks heat energy from the fire and then carries it away as steam, making the remaining less-energetic fire (hopefully) more susceptible to being smothered. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both are true. Boiling the water you throw on it takes a lot of the energy it takes to sustain the fire and then the steam created means there's also less oxygen available. Can't say which is more important off the top of my head, though I'd suspect it's getting rid of the heat that dominates in this mechanism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the size of the fire. A small fire can actually be put out with gasoline if done correctly.</p></div>		</li>
