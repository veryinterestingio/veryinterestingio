			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know how much of a cause for concern it really is. Certainty in a conclusion like this is always something you <em>measure</em> in science, not something that you just have/don't have. The evidence supporting the conclusion (like the skull's size and robustness relative to others in its lineage) gets weighed against the evidence opposing it (like the relative lack of good comparison skulls) and the result is always some degree of certainty between 0 and 1 that you keep in mind moving forward.</p>
<p>The degree of uncertainty might only become a problem if someone tries to carry out an analysis with this skull the depends on it being from a male. Then the uncertainty in the original conclusion will carry through to this new analysis and become an issue for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you seem to be knowledgeable about this, here's a follow-up question I've had ever since I've read it: if only one or two skulls have been found, how do they know this represents a new species of hominid instead of just a single person who had a mutation/deformity?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That exact question was asked on this sub yesterday! <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/o8cmbg/how_do_we_know_weve_discovered_a_new_species_of/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/o8cmbg/how_do_we_know_weve_discovered_a_new_species_of/</a></p>
<p>For the question in general, the answers there are pretty good. Basically, if there's no signs that point to any known type of deformity, then we sort of have to assume that a fossil represents a good sample of &quot;normal&quot; for its population. That assumption could definitely be wrong and researchers will keep that possibility in mind while they work with the existing fossils and hope to find more. Scientists are generally very good at dealing with grey areas, so treating some fossil as representative of a lineage while at the same time harboring uncertainty is not a problem. Other responses in the thread yesterday bring up the &quot;lumping&quot; versus &quot;splitting&quot; thing, which is only important because there's still a perception that naming a new species is something special. So push researchers to name new a species even when the evidence is not great. Just because they try, doesn't mean the rest of the field will accept it, though.</p>
<p>In the case of this Harbin skull specifically, three papers have been published simultaneously, all by the same group of authors. One to establish its dating using isotopes, one to investigate its evolutionary relationship to other ancient human fossils, and a third to name it as a species separate from all those other fossils.</p>
<p>My interpretation is that the third paper is a grab at that old &quot;species prestige,&quot; but I don't think it will work. Not because people think the Harbin skull is just a person with deformities, but actually because it's not really all that distinct from several other fossils that have been found around the same time and place. Even though it's the one of the three papers that popular media are reporting on, the third paper will probably be ignored by researchers.</p>
<p>The second paper is the one that's getting noticed and will probably get the citations. That paper makes no claim at all the the Harbin skull is a separate species. Instead, it identifies a whole group of fossils that appear to be related to one another and distinct from others. That includes the Harbin skull, plus Jinniushan, Dali, and Hualong specimens, as well as the Xiahe mandible fragment. If anything is going to be recognized as a species, it will be this lineage as a whole. The Dali skull has previously sometimes been suggested as a species <em>Homo daliensis</em> or else <em>Homo sapiens</em> ssp. <em>daliensis</em>, so one of those names would have priority over <em>Homo longi</em>, which is what's suggested in the third paper for the Harbin skull. The Xiahe mandible was also previously shown to be probably Denisovan, which is also an already established group, either as a species (<em>Homo altaiensis</em>) or just informally as &quot;Denisovans.&quot; I think it's very possible that the informal naming will just be kept since the field as a whole is moving away from the concept of distinct species and towards a regional mosaicism model. This more recent view is described as a &quot;braided stream&quot; gene flow model in the second paper itself.</p></div>		</li>
