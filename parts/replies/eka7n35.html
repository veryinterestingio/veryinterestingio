			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, wash your wrists. I practice calligraphy and noticed the days I don't wash my arms when I wash my hands are the days I have feathering more then anything else causing it. Feathering is due to having a water based ink which flows easier than the oil based a ballpoint pen uses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>feathering is when you draw on the paper and the think spreads out in a blotch rather than a clean crisp line. Imagine if you tried to write on bounty paper towels. Note though that feathering =/= bleed through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read your comment multiple times and still can’t seem to grasp how the fuck washing your wrists has anything to do with it. </p>
<p>Edit: just realized as you write your wrist hits the paper where you’re about to write next. Never occurred to me at first because I’m left handed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you write, you drag your wrist across the paper. If the skin on your wrist is oily, it rubs off on the paper. Then when you try to write on that part of the paper, the pen won't work as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your wrist rests against the paper, which you eventually write over and the residual oil from your skin causes the feathering. At least, that’s what I’m assuming they meant!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure &quot;best&quot; is subjective, but to many gel pen aficionados, the Pentel Energel and Uni-Ball Signo are better options than the G2. If you are keen for hybrid inks, the Uni-Ball Jetstream and Pilot Acroball are highly recommended.</p></div>		</li>
