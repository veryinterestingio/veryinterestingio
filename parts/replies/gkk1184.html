			<div class="markdown"><p>I studied international arms security in university, and yes it is being done in some parts of the world, I believe France is the largest recycler. The main reason why other countries do not recycle spent uranium is that it recycled into plutonium and they want to prevent the proliferation of plutonium which can be used to make a much more powerful weapon, albeit much harder to successfully create.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it was as simple as this sounds, it would have been done long ago.</p>
<p>Business being what it is, your suggestion was probably expensive. It's too bad that long-term matters like the continued survival of humanity are weighed so lightly against short-term profit.</p>
<p>Might also be a matter of maintaining control over the process. Atoms don't split without a fight. All of the liberated energy and decay products need somewhere to go, preferably not a massive puddle or cloud of aerosols.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The short answer? Because of transmutation. Every element has a possibility of absorbing the neutron and becoming heavier. Leave it in long enough, and you end up in the superheavy elements that everyone freaks out about. To irradiate it like this, you'd have to purify it first, and irradiate each constituent. You can fission down, but transmutation is usually up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're kind of right. A good rabbit hole to use is <a href="https://whatisnuclear.com/thorium-myths.html#myth5" target="_blank">this site</a>, which links to alllll kinds of other resources/pages and explains things well.</p>
<p>In short, here's the story:</p>
<p>-Uranium mainly can make dirty bombs</p>
<p>-Plutonium can (and does) fuel big bombs</p>
<p>-Thorium cannot make a bomb effectively</p>
<p>-Spent uranium fuel contains depleted uranium and plutonium</p>
<p>-Spent uranium can be recycled to make uranium fuel again</p>
<p>-Spent uranium can be recycled to make thorium and uranium this thorium can use as more fuel</p>
<p>Any time you recycle spent uranium fuel, you can make enriched uranium again, which is great for reactors. But you are messing with a process that can be abused to make more weapons-grade plutonium, though it is not the same process.</p>
<p>If you instead use spent uranium fuel to recycle in the thorium-uranium cycle, a different tech, you remove a lot of this risk. It's not impossible to make weapons grade material here, but it's very, very hard, and the stuff you end up with doesn't last long. The biproducts of this reaction are also much less toxic and much easier to handle in emergencies, I recommend that link earlier for more info.</p>
<p>So it's not the use of the spent fuel that makes it weapons grade. That's plutonium, and in all cases, you have to do specific work to make plutonium for a weapon. But you are right that refinement is refinement, and it's possible a bad actor could use their recycling technology to produce plutonium if they're using gen 1, 2, or 3 reactor tech (which directly involves plutonium either as fuel or as a biproduct). This plutonium isn't pure enough to use in a weapon, but it could be abused in such a way. Uranium is not as heinous as this for many reasons, though still nasty, and thorium even less so.</p></div>		</li>
