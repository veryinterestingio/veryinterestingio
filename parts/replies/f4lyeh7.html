			<div class="markdown"><p>Binaural beats really are a measurable physical phenomena, although you definitely can argue whether or not there is medical benefit to it.</p>
<p>If you want proof, just get a good set of headphones and play a binaural beat video. Put one headphone in one ear,  then switch to the other headphone in the other ear. No beat. Put both in and you'll start to detect a rapid pulse.</p>
<p>Hell, you can even get a similar effect when tuning a guitar. As the strings get really close, but are not perfectly in tune, you'll begin to hear a pulse. </p>
<p>It's not pseudoscience until you start attaching medical benefits to it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a fantastic Asimov short story about a group of brain scientists trying to map patterns of activity of happy people, synching them with pulsing lights and sounds, and playing that to depressed people to see if their brain activity changes to match the pattern.</p>
<p>They ask a musician for help, and he just fucking gives them &quot;when the saints go marching in&quot; passed through the light thing translation filter so they can't tell. It works. I don't remember the name of the story but it was great.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mini-story time:</p>
<p>I think mushrooms are very cool so I hang out at /r/mycology from time to time for cool mushroom pics and facts. At some point I also checked out a different sub about growing mushrooms at home and the first thread I saw had the words &quot;medical benefits&quot; in it. I made some truck noises as I backed the hell out of that place.</p>
<p>EDIT: Before this gains traction in any way, this was not about any form of psychoactive mushroom. Just a boring household edible one.</p></div>		</li>

“Does that mean the plant likes hard rock?”, well no. But maybe the vibrations affect it. Maybe. But certainly, it knows nothing about hard rock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly it boils down to: your brain seems to have some very low-frequency waves (alpha/beta/theta waves) which can be picked up and reliably read on eeg systems, therefore playing audio with the same oscillations into your brain will... somehow... generate these waves.</p>
<p>It's about the same as telling someone the color 'red' and expecting their entire field of view to become overfilled with pure redness: obviously that's not how senses work, but there's some theoretical merit to this - it's hard to <em>not</em> think about red when someone says it to you, but that's not really how 'brain waves' work in relation to audio.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This started when people started associating brain alpha waves, at 11 Hz, with feelings of calmness and tranquility. There are some reports that inducing waves at that frequency on the brain makes people calmer. </p>
<p>This is a rather old claim, I remember seeing a note published on a Scientific American magazine from the 19th century (I read it in their &quot;100 years ago&quot; column) that mentioned people feel sleepy when an electric motor running around 600 rpm is attached to their heads. It was just around that speed, corresponding to 10 Hz, that the effect was felt, at other speeds there was no effect.</p>
<p>You can do mechanical or electrical stimulation at 11 Hz, but sound at that frequency isn't very easy to generate, it would take a rather big speaker to do that, so they tried to find some alternative. A beat of two higher frequency sounds was found to work well, according to some experimenters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The beat you get from one in each ear is its own thing because there's not any interference of sound.  It's all in your head.</p>
<p>Which is not to say I believe it is magic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is creepy. I just had a conversation today with a co-worker about recovery from back surgery (we've both had different types of back surgeries in the past 12-24 months) and she started banging on about  how solfeggio frequencies and binaural beats helped her recover and then she prefaced it with 'this is scientifically proven' and that instantly raised my bullshit detector. Go on reddit during and within a minute of browsing I find this thread.</p></div>		</li>

As you can imagine... in that genre of music, there are all kinds of wackadoos trying to take advantage of people right and left with their &quot;healing nonsense.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To give context for other non musically inclined folks,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solf%C3%A8ge" target="_blank">Solfège</a> is the term for describing notes of a scale by their (european tradition) syllable name. Literally Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do. Other musical traditions have other vocal sounds but the core concept remains the same. As such, there is no relationship to any specific frequency, it's a culturally contextual means of expressing the relationship to an arbitrarily determined tonic note. It's also not any more medicinal than the concept of noun-verb sentence structure. </p>
<p>Related Fun Fact - The verb &quot;to sol-fa&quot; means to sing a passage in solfège</p></div>		</li>
