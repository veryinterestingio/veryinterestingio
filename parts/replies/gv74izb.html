<p>Additionally, as citizens, we can become advocates for better AMR control strategies. Generating long-term political will is incredibly important to ensure that the threat of AMR is an important concern our our leaders and governing bodies. Talking with your local, state and national policymakers is another strategy to get involved in the conversation. </p>
<p>Volunteering to teach children about AMR at science fairs, schools and workshops is a great way to ensure that future generations understand why AMR is important.</p></div>		</li>
