			<div class="markdown"><p>You lungs, even at full exhalation, keep a reserve of void air. That void air keeps your alveoli open, which are tiny little air sacs where you actually absorb oxygen.</p>
<p>Getting the wind knocked out of you collapses the some of the alveoli in your lungs by knocking out that void air. When they're collapsed, the surface tension of the thin film of water/mucus covering them <em>keeps</em> them collapsed. You have to struggle to gradually open them back up.</p></div>		</li>
