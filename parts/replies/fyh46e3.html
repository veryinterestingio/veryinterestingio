			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably the best basic answer. Doctor here. I deal with a LOT of diabetics. Basically, when your blood glucose is over \~250, any damage done to your body that day will not heal. For my patients, that means a cut or injury will stay unchanged in the healing process that day, but it also affects the body down to the cellular level, including &quot;worn down&quot; organs, like you said, and it can be cumulative. It takes roughly a month for the body to catch up to an uncontrolled spike. Good glucose control is the key.</p>
<p>EDIT: I found a great article from a podiatry journal that gets into more detail but is easy to understand for non medical people</p>

<p>EDIT 2: A one-day spike is not something to worry about. There's not enough damage done to worry about. Even non diabetics get spikes. It happens and it's generally nbd.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Hold up - what do you mean by &quot;catch up&quot;? I'm a type 1 diabetic, and I'm generally well controlled with sub-6.5 a1c. But like any type 1, it's impossible to avoid big spikes from time to time, just as a matter of being, well, not perfect. If I'm reading you correctly, you're essentially saying that a1c is not the end-all of determining long-term success with being a diabetic. If you have a low a1c but still have a spike higher than 250 a few times a month, how bad is that in terms of damage?</p>
<p>edit: please don't construe this as asking for medical advice, I'm just trying to learn about the condition</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course there are small, minor spikes that you can't avoid. A1C is absolutely the gold standard in determining diabetes control overall, but if your averaging under 250 (really it's 200, but I try not to scare people) throughout a typical week, you're in very good shape.</p>
<p>A1C is absolutely the best barometer of long-term diabetic control. The day-to-day stuff is what I'm talking about. For example, it usually takes 2 weeks for a surgical site to heal. If you had a rough day with glucose control during that period, it could take an extra night to heal overall (if that). It's a <em>very very minor</em> setback. Healing potential is still \~95% of a similar non-diabetic, which is negligible given all the other factors that affect a person's immune system.</p>
<p>tl;dr You're doing fine. Nothing to worry about. Keep up the good work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could it have to do with the fact a good amount of people with say Type 2 Diabetes are more prone to obesity which can put strain on the cardiovascular system. Which is a huge issue with a respiratory disease/virus.</p>
<p>Genuinely curious because it came to mind a few days ago out of the blue</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tend to think diabetes is generally making people more prone to an exaggerated inflammatory response leading to respiratory issues. Not that diabetes makes this particular virus worse in a specific way. It seems people who get very sick have a huge inflammatory response that effects the lungs, blood and many other organs. Diabetes is pro inflammatory and promotes inflammatory cytokine release. It could just push the effect of the virus over the edge. To put it another way, diabetes makes any health condition worse not better, and this virus can cause a lot of health problems without diabetes, so together itâ€™s quite dangerous.</p></div>		</li>
