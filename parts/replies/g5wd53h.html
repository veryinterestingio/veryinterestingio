			<div class="markdown"><p>You aren’t wrong.
But for carbon chains the number of carbon atoms is proportional to the number of hydrogen atoms (give or take a few hydrogens because of the ends of the chain and other functional groups).<br />
The ratio is different for different classes of molecules but hydrocarbons for example have a carbon to hydrogen ratio of something like 1:1.85 ish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, they do if there was nothing else hanging on that chain but other atoms or groups change that ratio, as you said, by ends of chain, multiple bonding, or attached groups. It's only really meaningful in straight hydrocarbon chains like propane or hexane. Even then it is gonna change depending on the length of the chain as you'll have more hydrogens on the end than center carbons.</p></div>		</li>
