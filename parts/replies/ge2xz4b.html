<p>Additional question:  Do people actually buy non-philadelphia cream cheese?  Outside of vegan cream cheese I couldn't confidently say I've ever seen it in stores much less bought it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The brick is a lot denser. I used to buy tubs but switched to bricks because it was recommended in a lot of recipes (especially for baking), and now I just like how the bricks fit neatly behind the butter in my fridge, so I won't switch back.</p>
<p>And yes, generic cream cheese is pretty common, and cheaper without much loss of flavor/texture.</p></div>		</li>

<p>...huh? This <em>must</em> be regional (I'm in Canada?). Because I could walk into any random grocery store and easily find half a dozen common brands of cream cheese. And that's without going somewhere that might carry some kind of specialty/local brands or anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure the stuff in the tub is whipped, so has air in it. That is why it is softer and easier to spread.</p>
<p>I usually only use the full fat bricks, and usually buy generic as I don't notice a difference in quality. Usually use it in various recipes (my favorite home made ranch dip is crab cheese based).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll give it a try, though this is getting into molecular interactions, so low-level chemistry/high-level quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Take a box, and pour a bunch of little cubes into it (all the same size). If you shake the box around (side to side), the cubes will tend to settle into a grid, and not move that much.</p>
<p>Take another box, and pour a bunch of marbles into it (all the same size). If you shake the box around (side to side), the marbles will tend to settle into a hexagonal arrangement, and not move that much.</p>
<p>Now pour the marbles and cubes into a third box. If you shake the box around, the cubes and marbles won't settle into a stable arrangement, because the cubes want to arrange in a square grid, but the marbles want to arrange in a hexagonal grid. If there are basically the same amount of cubes and the same amount of marbles, and they're basically the same size and the same density, it won't settle no matter how much you shake it. Probably. I haven't actually tried it.</p>
<p>Now this is definitely <strong>not</strong> what's happening (as far as I know, I'm no expert), but it's not completely wrong, and I think any more correct explanation would be way more than ELI5.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's darn close as far as the mechanism of mixing dissimilar liquids (whether or not it's the explaination to the OP is beyond me) - to go eli20 each molecule essentially has a basic shape (for example H2O is basically a V ). Some of the atoms can wiggle around (H2O going from a /o\ shape to a /o/ shape), and because of things like temporary hydrogen bonds between molecules the molecules basically form a repeating structure not dissimilar to the cube/marble example.</p>
<p>It's also why if you mix different liquids, the boiling point goes down - there's less of the stacking neatly of molecules, so the hydrogen bonds are fewer, and there's less force holding the liquid together (imagine the cube/marble example, except the surfaces of each are slightly sticky) - making it easier to kick off a molecule from the liquid into the air as a gas</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! Breaking it down into simple, graphical shapes makes it much easier to envision mentally. Even if not 100% perfect analogy, it's a stepping stone - now I can relate the more complex explanation to something concrete.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different brands use different sugars, I don’t know the specific sugars each use but imagine you have sucrose (table sugar, “sugar”) and then a pack of sweetener (not necessarily a sugar, but it will taste sweet, and is different which emphasizes the point).</p>
<p>Assume each are dissolved in a different sauce at the same concentration. Now, mix these two sauces. The ‘sugars’ are different, so when you mix them you get half the concentration of each ‘sugar’ because they aren’t the same. Most people would likely perceive this taste as a reduction of the overall sweetness, because you’re tainting both with a foreign other-thing.</p>
<p>What people should be talking about is buying a jar of store-bought, and gently heating it in a saucepan on a stove. There’s a point it will start to become too thick to even really use well, but just before that point you’re going to get a more-concentrated tang because you’re not mixing something different into it, but thickening what already tastes good in it. Do this when ready to use, as you might ruin the storage length (or at least, I wouldn’t risk it).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my experience, BBQ sauce is often not primarily thick due to sugar as well -- it's a colloidal mess based on tomato paste.</p>
<p>So mixing it with honey would be dispersing the colloid and also diluting the syrup.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I think you have the right answer here... everyone trying to make some crap up about different sugars is so amazingly off base its funny.</p>
<p>Don't forget starches; corn starch is like the universal thickener these days in the same way HFCS is the universal sweetener.</p>
<p>Looking at a bottle right now... I see both &quot;tomato paste&quot; and &quot;modified food starch&quot;. Looking....thick.</p></div>		</li>
