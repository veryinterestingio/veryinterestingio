			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s common for delaying boosters to lead to higher-quality immunity. One important reason is probably that as B cells are pruned following the first exposure, the highest-affinity B cells last longest (as they can compete best for remaining antigen) and over time they’ll become a larger component of the second response. </p>
<p>Of course the problem with delaying boosters is that you have a much longer period during which you have much lower immunity (from the first vaccination only) before you gain slightly higher immunity from the second shot. Is the eventual higher immunity more beneficial than the added weeks of higher risk?  Only math can answer that, and it will depend on the precise details of all of those.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There would also be the consideration of whether the population as a whole is better to delay those second shots so that others can get a first shot. If more people have some low level of protection, depending on the balance it may be better than having a smaller number with higher protections.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given that there's very little evidence that the second dose does much of anything (nobody has measured, say, immunity at 16 weeks from 1st dose and comparing results between people who haven't received a second dose and people who received a second dose at, say, 8 weeks after first dose), first dose first is almost certainly best from a public health perspective</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A general explanation of boosting intervals - seems likely to apply to COVID-19 vaccines
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3760154/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3760154/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In determining the interval between the first immunization and the booster shot it is important to consider the differentiation pathways of memory B and T cells. Memory T cells with high proliferative potential do not form until several weeks after the first immunization so as a general rule it is better to have an interval of at least 2–3 months between the prime and the boost (Fig. 2). Boosting too early will give sub-optimal responses. Similar rules apply for boosting antibody responses since memory B cells have to go through the germinal center reaction and take several months to develop (Crotty et al., 2010).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While delaying longer than 3-4 weeks usually does give somewhat better immunity, most of the gains are made between the 2 and 3 week points. That is, if you boost at 2 weeks and get immunity of “1000” (in made up units), then boosting at 3 weeks might give you “5000” while 6 weeks might get you “7000” and 8 might get you “7500”. It’s better, but the shorter delay is already pretty good and doesn’t make people wait around with only a single shot (immunity of “250” arbitrary units) for 6 weeks.</p></div>		</li>
