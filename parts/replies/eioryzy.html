			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that other answers don’t add to the discussion, but Species Survival Plans are the answer to this question. These are plans, led by one appointed organization, that outline which individuals are going to breed with which individuals, and at what time to maximize genetic diversity. </p>
<p>As an example, the San Diego Zoo manages the SSP for the Jaguar (link below). There is someone at the zoo whose job it is to schedule and coordinate mating between Jaguars across North America. Cool stuff!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This certainly isn’t always the case, but a lot of animals in zoos are rescues as well. I realized recently that many animals in exhibits at our local zoo have suffered injury and wouldn’t have survived in the wild anyway. Instead of succumbing to natural selection, they’re providing educational opportunities (the main goal of our zoo) for so many. I hadn’t considered the research behind the scenes as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is the success of these monitored, to make sure we’re good at doing these breeding programs. </p>
<p>I mean,imagine doing it for humans, but without a lot of information about how humans decide who to fuck? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah! So to be considered &quot;green&quot; they need about 90-95% genetic diversity compared to the wild population. The majority of SSPs are yellow either because they don't have enough breeding individuals or they don't have enough information to prove that they're green yet.</p>
<p>They also track who was paired with who, how the two got along, how many offspring and the sex ratio, and health info for the offspring and parents.</p></div>		</li>
