			<div class="markdown"><p>yes. also, this brings us to a very interesting discussion about <em>natural drugs</em>, i.e. psychoactive substances found in plants, fungi, etc.</p>
<p>the reason this happens is actually not surprising at all. we are all made up of proteins, which are all made up of the same amino acids. there is only a finite number of ways amino acids can recombine, and a lot of that is constrained by evolution.</p>
<p>plants will build these simple chemicals to perform some task, or as an evolutionary response to a danger. tobacco will produce nicotine to fend off insects, peppers will produce capsaicin to fend off mammals chewing on their seeds. the reason this works is because the number of chemicals that can be naturally made to perform all the functions of life are not nearly enough to be unique to species.</p>
<p>therefore, it will often happen that a simple chemical that a plant would make also happens to have a psychoactive effect on an animal, which is advantageous for the plant, which results in more plants with that mutation to exist. most spices and drugs we use are just plants trying to kill animals trying to destroy them, and humans enjoying them because they will fuck up our nervous system, but not enough to kill us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>also why it's a really bad idea to take MDMA with antidepressants. both are SSRIs and they can cause <em>bad</em> serotonin syndrome, as well as the general bowel fuckery because of the enteric nervous system</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I seem to be the only person in existence who doesn’t get stomach issues from mdma. Or coke. Also coke just makes me a bit chatty, I really don’t see the point but other people love it. Speed just lets me focus well. Mdma doesn’t make me want to party i just want to fuck on it and smoke weed. It’s like stimulants don’t do the same thing to my brain or my gut.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that strong recreational drugs don't affect you at all or only very slightly sounds like a problem with the reward pathway or dopamine/serotonin/adrenalin signalling. Not a doctor, but maybe you should get screened for whether you have ADHD.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a lot but enough to know my way around if you get me. Couple of times a year average over time, some years barely anything, some years a bit more, but never excessive. It’s always been the same for me, I’ve always been pretty ‘me’ on most substances.</p></div>		</li>
