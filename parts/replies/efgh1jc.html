Rainwater becomes a light carbonic acid from dissolved CO2, reacts with limestone formations (calcium carbonate) to form calcium bicarbonate, which is easily dissolved in water and washed away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what you're asking is 'does the limestone dissolved in cave water ever give back its CO2?'</p>
<p>And the answer is YES! The reaction that dissolved the rock will work in reverse, giving the carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere and leaving a deposit of calcite that precipitates out of the solution in the form of stalactites! </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's roughly three or four arguments/phases</p>
<p>1.) It's not happening. (These are the truly stupid, conspiracy theorists, and liars). Look for things like &quot;Well it's cold outside right now!&quot; and &quot;those scientists just want more research funding&quot;</p>
<p>2.) It's happening, but there's no proof it's caused by humans (These are the &quot;moderate&quot; conservatives, including most of those in Congress). Look for things like &quot;We need to do more research first&quot;</p>
<p>2.5) It's happening, it's caused by humans, but overshadowed by other things. (lots of overlap with the people above) Look for things like &quot;Solar flare activity!&quot; and &quot;the climate is always changing&quot;.</p>
<p>3.) It's happening, it's caused by humans, but it's not a big deal, or too expensive. (suburban tax-cut conservatives, some congresscritters, centrist democrats). Look for things like &quot;regulating emissions will kill the economy!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>#2) You can see evidence of this in home aquaria, albeit on a small scale. I've seen lots of comments on salt water aquarium message boards about how the pH of tanks drops when they are in basements, or in homes sealed up tight in the winter due to people generated co2 levels inside. Opening windows or injecting fresh air in to the tanks to lower the amount of co2 makes the pH start to rise again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ocean acidification, while a monumental problem, is probably too nuanced an effect to even need to be on the radar of climate change deniers. Considering that they are effectively sewing doubt about the easy to understand and observe effects like atmospheric CO2 concentration and average global temperature they probably dont even need to touch the ocean acidification thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree, for a wholly extra-scientific, rhetorical reason. If the goal is to get people to endorse cutting carbon dioxide emissions, it doesn’t matter why they end up endorsing it. Ocean acidification is a second sufficient reason to endorse this action. This means you could potentially convince people who are climate change skeptics to endorse this action without needing to engage on climate change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not ignorance anymore when you choose to deny it. It’s just denial.  Now belief that your denial is the truth - that’s a little different.  It’s like anti vaxxers denial of the science - they believe they are right and their beliefs are factually correct.  I think many climate change deniers are in the same mindset.  They have some thin scientific basis (usually a minority position like “it’s cyclical and not man made”) and use it to discredit the majority position that Global Warming is real.   </p>
<p>On top of that you have interested parties like Shell Petroleum which has its own scientists prove they are contributing to global warming but due to profit motivation, hide these reports for decades and continue to lobby and influence governments to maintain oil friendly policies. All that because short term profit overrides long term harm. </p>
<p>This all turns uglier as unfriendly foreign adversaries will identify ANY social or political issue that is divisive or has the potential to be divisive and starts filling the now vast and confusing media with disinformation and attributions of espousing global warming to be a liberal democratic conspiracy.  Now the right must entrench into an anti position because it would be unthinkable to have any shared interest with the left.  </p>
<p>So these issues exist on their own but are amplified by forces like greed and malicious foreign agents seeking to destabilize a society.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have more source/info for this? I've kept a saltwater reef for 10+ years and never heard that increased CO2 (essentially lowered pH) inhibits coral growth. </p>
<p>Lots of reefers maintain reefs with specific corals at pH levels quite a bit lower than found in normal reefs (7.6-7.8 vs 8.0-8.4)</p>
<ul>
<li>just to be clear, I'm not denying anything about climate change and the oceans, I'm just curious about the CO2 and coral growth mechanism - the world's coral reefs are very much in danger right now. </li>
