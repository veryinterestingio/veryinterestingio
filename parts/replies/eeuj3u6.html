			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm learning Chinese and it's often easier for me to understand things (even if I may struggle to read the characters, remember how to say them).
If I confuse words it's usually when they're written in pinyin (eg. I can have problems with differentiating liu and jiu, but never 六 and 九, which are 6 and 9 in Chinese)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As another dyslexic who learned Chinese. Yes, it's no longer an issue of spelling, which is nice. However, because of dyslexia related poor working memory, the actual memorization is still difficult. Fortunately Chinese is so hard for everyone that it helps to level the playing field.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's why it is possible for Chinese dyslexics to read English without issue and vice versa for English-speaking dyslexics.</p></div>		</li>
