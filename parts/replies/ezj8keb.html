<p>( A really strange one was when the rights holder to older John Fogerty material sued John Fogerty for writing a song that sounded too much like a John Fogerty song. )</p>

<p>Very strange indeed! That was his previous record company. When he went solo (with another record company) and continued to make music that sounded like the type of music he makes (including the sound of his voice) they sued him for putting out a solo album that sounded too much like himself, that is, too much like Creedence Clearwater Revival. He won of course. </p>
<p>Tom Waits in another interesting example. He was asked by a car company (I believe it was) to let them use one of his songs for a commercial and he turned them down. So they went out and hired a sound-alike to write and sing a song for them. When Waits heard it he sued and won. It was an easy win for him since he had all the records of his requests from the company and his decline of their request.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing about the Fogerty case that I always thought was interesting was that the case itself wasn't especially noteworthy (was quickly decided by a jury), but afterwards, he went after the record company for attorney fees, and that portion went all the way to the Supreme Court - but the original case didn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lower courts rule on two things: matters of fact, and matters of law. Higher courts only rule on matters of law.</p>
<p>Whether the song in question was a copyright violation was a matter of fact. Whether Fogerty was entitled to attorney's fees in that situation was a matter of law that was in dispute.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SAME thing happened to Ray Parker Jr. for writing the theme song to Ghostbusters. Huey Lewis and the News sued because Ghostbusters had asked them to write the theme song, but they declined. So they hired Ray Parker Jr. and said, we really like the HLatN bassline from Want a New Drug. Ray Parker copied it note for note :-/ Oops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not surprised they wanted that song. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Tom Waits thing is interesting. I wouldn't have thought the fact he turned them down previously would even be relevant to the case. I suppose it goes towards showing they were trying to impersonate him, but is that illegal? Either it's legal to feature a sound-alike in an ad or it isn't. I would imagine that would come down to how similar the &quot;new&quot; song was to one of Tom's existing tracks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its about intent. If they accidentally made a song that sounds like Tom Waits thats fine, but purposefully trying to make people think Tom Waits was in your commercial is not legal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s definitely relevant as it adds context to the question of wether or not it was their intent to copy the work.</p>
<p>Whilst you absolutely can accidentally infringe on a copyright, if you can add context that shows it was their intention to copy your work it adds a bit more weight to all of the other evidence of similarities between your work and the person/group accused of infringing on your copyright.</p>
<p>This is actually happening right now with the Ariana Grande vs Forever 21 lawsuit. Forever 21’s advertising campaign looks very similar to one of Ariana’s music videos. Forever 21 could make the argument that it was unintentional and they’re not infringing on her copyright by having an advertising campaign that possibly looks similar to a music video (an entirely different form of media). Except that Forever 21 initially tried to hire Ariana for that very same advertising campaign and she declined. This means they were well aware of her work and had her in mind for the campaign and all of the similarities (even the ones that are only vaguely similar) seem much more obvious with that context.</p>
<p>Important to note: I am not a lawyer, everything above is only my understanding which may be wrong. Feel free to correct me if that’s the case.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I believe Queen and Vanilla Ice had a similar suit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was actually David Bowie vs Vanilla Ice.</p>
<p>Ice sampled Bowie/Queen's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a01QQZyl-_I" target="_blank">&quot;Under Pressure&quot;</a> for his hit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rog8ou-ZepE" target="_blank">&quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>Bowie sued.  They ended up settling out of court.</p>
<p>The settlement was, Ice bought &quot;Under Pressure&quot; outright from Bowie/Queen for $4 million.  He has since licensed the song &quot;Under Pressure&quot; for use in movies and commercials and profited from the purchase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>*It wasn't a hugly popular song to begin with. Bowie and Queen were both thought to be a bit out of their prime by the general public when it was released, so the whole Hot Space album was largely ignored. Most people didn't even realize Vanilla Ice had used a bass line from another song until the court case brought attention to it.</p>
