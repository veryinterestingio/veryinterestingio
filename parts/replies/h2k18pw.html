			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer is &quot;probably&quot;, but long answer is that real estate law, especially related to long-term residents, is insanely complicated and not very intuitive.  You'd be looking at lawsuits that could drag on for decades.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You hear stories of people use whatever excuse to move into a house (babysitter, house keeper, nanny etc), then refuse to do the job. The family will have enough issue kicking this person put already.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That depends.</p>
<p>So when a town is founded as well as over it's life it might get divided up into thousands of lots, those lots are then sold to people who live on the property and that's what makes a town.  </p>
<p>As mentioned, the most common way for someone to buy a town has to do with the town becoming abandoned.  This often happens to towns that get built around 1 single industry or employer, if that employer goes under, the town has no reason for being and normally it dies.  This was pretty common during/after the gold rush.  The gold dries up and so everyone packs up and leaves town, abandoning their old homes.</p>
<p>Over time, each plot of land builds up an unpaid property tax balance.  Eventually the local government will step in and auction the property off in order to pay the back tax.  This strips the old owners of any of their ownership rights. </p>
<p>So how do people get evicted.  Well there's a few options.  A Landloard might have been failing to pay his property tax.  So even though there are people living on the property, the local government considers it abandoned and sells the land at auction.  The new owners then need to go through the process to get the old tenants evicted. </p>
<p>BUT, and this is most important.  This whole thing almost never actually happens and is mostly used as fodder for TV show plots. It's very rare for someone to step in and &quot;buy a whole town&quot; out from under actual residents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does happen to some extent in cities. See Detroit. The NE part of downtown is almost completely gone, as new owners demo'd homes as a way to remove tenants. There are some very wealthy neighborhoods near there, and many of them grouped together to buy up property to demolish them, almost like a buffer around their wealthy property.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While they ultimately failed, a more current example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiryas_Joel,_New_York" target="_blank">Kiryas Joel</a>.  The town they formed as a result of it, Palm Tree, is the first new town in NY in 38 years (Teitelbaum means &quot;Palm Tree&quot;).</p>
<p>They've done exactly that.  They vote in a block, they vote for their own candidates, and they've radically shifted the politics of the area.  </p>
<p>It's a really strange town to drive by or through. This area of NY is beautiful Catskill foothills, and Bear Mountain State park, so lots of rural woods and scenic views, and then there's Kiryas Joel.  It's becoming very urbanized with lots of Semi-high rise multi family units and one of the highest densities of young families and public assistance in the country.</p>
<p>It's one of the fastest growing towns in NY.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't seem to be the case in Schitt's Creek, though. They're allowed to keep &quot;the town&quot; because no one wanted it, but they still don't seem to own anything when they get there (they end up staying in a hotel that they don't own [ownership of the hotel is discussed later] - you'd think if they owned any property at all, they'd stay there).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shockingly, Schitt's Creek isn't real.</p>
<p>I think previous answers didn't emphasize enough that buying a town isn't a real thing. </p>
<p>You can buy land and businesses in the town. You could, theoretically buy all the land in town, at which point it wouldn't be unreasonable to claim you own the town. But you can't actually buy the town.</p>
<p>The premise of Schitt's Creek is entirely made up with no basis in reality and cannot be effectively explained, other than to say it's not real.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, yes, but the OP specifically was asking about a situation &quot;like in the plot of Schitt's Creek&quot;, so I thought it was good to point out that this does not seem to be the way it worked in the show, since OP specifically asked about the show.</p></div>		</li>
