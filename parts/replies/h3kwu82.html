			<div class="markdown"><p>There are methods to capture carbon from plants before it leaves the smokestack. The problem is that those installations are expensive and those companies don't want to pay for the installation, they want taxpayers to front the bill on it.</p>
<p>There are projects that are trying to close the cycle a bit. There are major carbon capture projects that would create the carbon into fuel, it would be carbon neutral since we're burning carbon that's been pulled out of the air, but many see it as an excuse to allow fossil fuel companies to continue using said fuel. Personally I think we can use these methods to allow them to transition into cleaner energy so we don't collapse an entire industry with no backup plan in place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can pay for those installations with the RECORD profits these cunts are always bragging about making. Or do you suggest I feel bad that one of those idiots might not be able to afford yet another 7 figure expense if we take his bonus away and foot the taxpayer the bill?</p>
<p>The executives can go without a few bonuses in order to cut emissions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an interesting aside, there are power plants in development that use the CO2 has an additional power source. Most natural gas plants use the exhaust to heat steam to power another turbine. These new power plants are taking the exhaust, creating supercritical CO2, and using the CO2 itself to power another turbine. Then they plan to either sell the carbon or pump it underground.</p></div>		</li>
