			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not sure why this isn’t a higher up answer
This is one of those things that’s been unexplained and extremely worrisome amongst the community. </p>
<p>Colorectal cancer is still the 2nd most dangerous type of cancer to get, has extremely limited treatment options available, and to find an increased incidence in people under the age of 40 is super strange.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's right! That's why we call them screening colonoscopies. If we see any polyps, we can remove them before they turn into cancers. I should also note that because of the increase in Colon cancers at a younger age, the new recommendation is to start screening colonoscopy at age 45 rather than 50</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you explain this statement?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the overall rate of colon cancer is declining, mainly driven by better screening</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How is it possible that identifying a cancer early reduces the <em>rate</em> of cancer?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the question! I should have clarified my statement. The unique thing about colonoscopy is that we can find and remove the colon polyps that become cancer BEFORE they turn into a cancer. Its one of the few tests available to doctors that can screen, diagnosis, and treat disease all at once. Thats the reason why it is the &quot;gold standard&quot; when it comes to colon cancer screening.</p></div>		</li>
