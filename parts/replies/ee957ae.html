<p>This is shit for me when I need dental work, cuz she has to inject me several more times than her normal patients and even then I've sometimes had shooting pains when I should have been fully numbed by local anaesthetic </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Irish ancestry, redhead brothers (though I have brown hair) and we all have high pain tolerance.  I've had doctors, nurses &amp; physical therapist comment on my tolerance.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Growing up, I thought I was normal.  Wasn't till I was in a relationship that I realized I was the odd one.  For example, I had just moved a cooling pot around the stove, my then girlfriend asked me if it was cool, I said yes.  She touched it, yelled in pain, and accused me of lying to her.  I responded by casually picking it up again and just holding it for a while.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I also don''t get brain freeze.  Didn't even know what it was until I saw it referenced on some comedy TV show.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The  anesthetic  dosage I'm not sure about, though once seeing a dentist, I had to tell him several times it wasn't working.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a root canal recently and a few cavities filled, during my dental exam previous to the procedure the dentist asked if I was having &quot;extreme pain and tenderness&quot; in the tooth. When I said no, he replied, &quot;well... you should be.&quot; I had 9 shots in total, 5 of which went directly to the root canal. I gave up eventually and just told the dentist to go for it. </p>
<p>BUT! on the plus side, the numbness in my mouth and lips wears off super quickly. Usually after an hour I have feeling back or atleast most of it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something like that. I'm not a redhead but I've got a lot of Irish in me, and a lot of redheaded relatives. I've quite resistant to anesthetics - didn't really figure that out until I was in my 30s. I always thought that anesthetics just sucked. Woke up in the middle of surgery twice. Got to the point where I just told my dentist to skip the shot before a filling because it did basically nothing other than hurt getting the shot and then causing me to drool later. Did nothing to actually kill the pain.</p>
<p>It wasn't until I <em>very nervously</em> went in to get a vasectomy that I got a doctor that worked it out. Went with a different local anesthetic with a signficantly higher dosage and hey, it didn't hurt, for literally the first time in my life. I was so happy that I spent the entire procedure asking him about how I should talk to doctors and dentists about it in the future. He was the one who mentioned the redhead correlation, and since I'm one of the strange ones in my family tree that isn't a redhead...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was put into a chemically induced coma for 10 days after severe surgical complications.  When I woke up, my hand was bound to the bed rail.  It was explained to me by the head nurse of the ICU that I was violent with one of the nurses and had to be restrained.  I am not a violent person by nature and had no memory of this.  I did notice, however, irrational paranoia for two days after.  Is any of this a common reaction at all to the chemicals used to induce sedation for that long?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How long ago was this?
There are actually 2 parts to any &quot;medically induced coma&quot; today: sedation and analgesia. Sedation is the stuff that takes away your consciousness (as described above). Analgesia is what helps your body deal with the physiological responses to pain, be it pain related to your surgery, or the sheer extended uncomfortableness of having a breathing tube in your throat. I'm not exactly sure, but I think analgesia is way more dangerous during surgery because it can drop your blood pressure and make you die, so I think they use it sparingly. Unfortunately, until relatively recently (and I'm relatively young, so I don't know how recently) the markers that allowed us to see that a patient was experiencing pain were masked because they themselves were completely unaware of it and unconscious. But studies showed that their bodies would produce things like adrenaline (sympathetic activators, catecholomines) and cause them to have complications. So these days analgesia is prioritized over sedation in medically induced comas like you described and sometimes we even allow people to wake up slightly (although painlessly) to check on their mental status if they have been under for an extended period of time (think days or weeks, not during surgery). Doing this reduces the rate of &quot;ICU delerium&quot; once they come off of the ventilator. Sounds like this could be what was happening to you, but obviously this is just a guess without having been involved in your care. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds right I guess.  It was back in 2013.  I had severe infections in multiple organs, sepsis, temporary renal failure, severe hypoalbuminemia, etc...  When I woke, I had 8 or 9 septic drains coming out of my abdomen with muscular atrophy (more like critical illness myopathy) and drops in blood pressure.  I still have critical illness polyneuropathy and unexplained tachycardia to this day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m confused about one thing. Is the breathing tube because your respiratory system is depressed?</p>
<p>Or to deliver more drugs?</p>
<p>Or both?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both!</p>
<p>Respirations are depressed with general anesthesia, as are your reflexes to protect your airway (cough out any saliva or secretions so you don’t suck them down into your lungs). I may also have given you a separate paralytic agent that paralyzes your diaphragm and muscles so you literally can’t move or breathe (even if you were awake and wanted to). </p>
<p>The tube has a balloon at the end that inflates to seal off your trachea. This gives me a closed system that allows me control and augment your breathing,  accurately measure and dose anesthetic levels, protects your lungs from foreign incursion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I presume you are asking why people under general anaesthesia needs a breathing tube. </p>
<p>To be truly pedantic, the “breathing tube” refers to the endotracheal tube (ETT) which is usually a plastic tube around one foot in length which is inserted from mouth (less commonly from nose, especially for surgery that involves the mouth, teeth, gum etc) into the trachea. </p>
<p>This is just one of the two devices that we often use, the other one being laryngeal mask airway (LMA) which is an ear-shaped device that sits at the back of the throat which seals the opening of the larynx (ie where the trachea takes off from the back of the throat). </p>
<p>Each has its pros and cons although the endotracheal tube is considered the best to achieve full control of your airway (hence it’s also often called “the definitive airway”). </p>
<p>Without some sort of device like ETT or LMA, people who are under general anesthetic </p>
<ul>
<li>don’t respond to low oxygen and high carbon dioxide the same way as an awake person </li>
<li>quite likely blocks off the airway, making airflow stop</li>
<li>don’t have the reflex that stops food from entering the trachea and lungs </li>
<li>May stop generating physical breathing effort altogether eg when a muscle paralytic is used in the cocktail of anesthesia   </li>
</ul>
<p>These are why anesthesiologists use ETT or LMA to assist and control both the airway and the actual mechanics of breathing. </p></div>		</li>
