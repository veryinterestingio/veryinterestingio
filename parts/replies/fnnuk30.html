			<div class="markdown"><p>Loss/distortion of vision in seemingly random ways that change per person followed shortly by a pain in the head that cannot be subdued by medicine and must simply be withstood until it subsides, leaving you exhausted, annoyed and feeling like shit. More accurate sure, but more of a mouthful than &quot;It's like a headache but way worse.&quot;</p>
<p>Honestly I wouldn't even compare migraines to headaches, to me that's like comparing a dislocated shoulder with a shoulder that aches from working out too much. The pain may be in the same place, but every other factor is different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This thread takes me back. I had migraines as a teen before I found out I needed glasses. Thank goodness that was the solution.</p>
<p>Before that though, migraines would RUIN my day. Lights off, no noise cool room -- and that was just to make the experience somewhat bearable. I'd hit my head against the wall just making it worse because the physical pain was more acceptable than the intense throbbing and nausea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s why I got migraines too! Haven’t had one since wearing my glasses all day, everyday.. touch wood.
I’d get tunnel vision, then wouldn’t be able to make coherent sentences, and everything would just spin non stop until it was over. Also the pain. Makes me want to cry just remembering it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here is to hoping you never suffer a cluster headache. </p>
<p>I think I bargained having a migraine everyday for the rest of my life versus making the cluster headaches stop. </p>
<p>At one point I asked my own mother to suffocate me....</p>
<p>I also get migraines nearly daily if I don't take my medications twice a day.</p>
<p>All from hitting my head a few years ago. </p>
<p>They all suck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have TBI and unfortunately get both cluster and migraines as well.  Migraines usually make me want to curl up and die whereas cluster headaches make me want to seek death because at the time it's hard to see any reason to want to go on because you know next time will be just as debilitating.  I had to go see a psychiatrist solely due to the suicidal ideations I get from dealing with the cluster headaches so often.  The only thing the psychiatrist was able to offer that helped was Tai chi and Yoga.  If it wasn't for the mind exercises involved with both I probably wouldn't still be here.  I hope yours go away as quickly as you got them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you and sorry you also suffer from these. </p>
<p>I have medication that helps ~85% of the time (average across a year), and learnt meditation before. </p>
<p>I have learnt an avid avoidance of stress, but at the same time I like relationships - the two do not go together well in the current situation. </p>
<p>Am glad you found coping mechanisms</p></div>		</li>

<p>Pregabalin twice a day</p>
<p>Sumatriptan when that fails</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cluster headaches is one of the reasons that &quot;hurr, migraines are just severe headaches&quot; is naive.</p>
<p>Cluster headaches are worse than most migraines.</p>
<p>I have several migraine types (most people with migraine disorders have 2-6 migraine types within that disorder) and if it had to choose one to have, I'd pick silent migraines.</p>
<p>Silent migraines are another reason you're should never say &quot;hurr, migraines are just bad headaches&quot;</p>
<p>There's no pain with a silent migraine.</p>
<p>I'll get visual disturbances, my hearing will go funny, dizziness, nausea, constipation, fatigue and lethargy. I'll slur my speech, struggle to swallow, and have muscle weakness and hemiplegia, but my head won't hurt at all (well... I have chronic tension headaches, so it hurts, but not more than usual)</p>
<p>Then after a day, I'll get the postdrone symptoms of a migraine, feeling flu-ish, diarrhoea, brain fog, etc.</p>
<p>It comes on randomly, lasts 2-4 days, and is identical to a migraine in every way except no pain and therefore the photosensitivity I experience mostly makes me dizzy and nauseated and not increasing the pain.</p>
<p>I find it really hard to explain silent migraines to people who don't have migraines.</p>
<p>Since I have chronic headaches and occipital neuralgia, I'm pretty good at dealing with head pain - be it from a headache or a migraine with pain.</p>
<p>I struggle most during a migraine before the pain hits, when the visual, auditory, neurological and muscle symptoms are at their worst. Trying to explain that I physically can't see or hear, and it's not because it hurts to have light or sound, but rather my vision is so doubled and my tinnitus is so loud.</p>
<p>People tell me to take as aspirin thinking the pain is the problem. But managing pain in my head won't stop me from feeling vertigo or being stuck on the toilet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand the suffering.</p>
<p>I have been diagnosed with at least 4 different types of migraine. </p>
<p>My medication removes the pain but I have (on average) 300+ migraine &quot;days&quot; per year, so what you call a silent migraine I just call a normal day at this point. </p>
<p>I gauge how bad it is by how much of my vision I have lost or what my focal.point currently is (varies from seeing double from about 6 inches from my nose to 3m or so). </p>
<p>Am permenantly photophobic from the head injury (left tonic pupil) so also feel the pain on that one (metaphorically at least). </p>
<p>I learnt to control the nausea (you cannot stop the reflex bringing contents up, but you can stop the ejection part of it - not pleasant but stops people's reactions and allows me to not live near a toilet).</p>
<p>The best way I have learnt to describe it;
Imagine a red hot ice pick penetrating through your left eye ball and in to the roof of your eye socket. Every few seconds some person gives this ice pick a good jank. Now imagine while this is going on you are on a high-speed motorbike doing a wall of death. That is how it feels when it's not too bad. </p>
<p>Hope you find some peace in all this chaos and pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>May I ask how your hearing is affected with a silent migraine? I have what I’ve termed “tunnel hearing” as a migraine symptom but it doesn’t precede every migraine. Basically the best way I can describe it is: picture a dark tunnel with a small patch of light at the other end. That’s my hearing for these episodes. I don’t go deaf but what I can still hear is usually a singular noise (e.g. a person talking) sounding like it’s coming from far away. </p>
<p>The only problem is when I’ve tried to describe this “tunnel hearing” to a doctor I’ve basically been told “yeah no that’s not really a thing”.</p></div>		</li>
