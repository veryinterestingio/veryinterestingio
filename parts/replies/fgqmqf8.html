			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have a corn snake that didn't have a good grasp of death. She did a great job of latching onto the mouse and constricting.  She would start eating shortly after the mouse passed out leading to it waking up in her mouth/throat. I ended up having to prepare her meals by drowning them first, which was hard for me to stomach initially but in hindsight me drowning them is probably miles better than what my snake was going to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That may have been because he was a corn snake. I actually did some further research and it's been recently discovered that boas and pythons don't actually kill prey by suffocating them, they cut off all blood flow and actually feel for the preys pulse. When the pulse is gone they start to eat. A small corn might not have that same approach, they might actually try to suffocate the prey. Which they could just be not as good at as big snakes. And yeah, I had a picky ball python way back and a reptile show owner would sell me live, put it inside a bag, then spray that keyboard cleaner air in a can stuff inside the bag. That would kill it humanly. And its body heat would still be warm enough when I got home to get the ball python to strike. Eventually he came around to frozen thawed.</p></div>		</li>
