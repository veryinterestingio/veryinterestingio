			<div class="markdown"><p>More or less. A lot more modern technology is designed with this in mind. So leaving something on the charger all night or letting it sit at 100% on the charger generally won’t hurt it anymore. I’ve heard of more issues of people letting something die and when they eventually do try to recharge it however long later it won’t charge. But overcharging isn’t much of an issue anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s probably due to some phantom drain killing that 10% charge buffer while the phone is off for too long, yeah? That’s a pretty uneducated guess tbh but I’m curious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If letting it sit at 100% is no longer an issue, then why do pixels, iPhones and Sony phones limit charging to 80% until right before your alarm clock is set to go off? It's seems to me that for all the phones not mentioned above it is best not to let them sit at 100%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That happened to my laptop, the battery was already insensively used for a couple years but it got to a very low level while I had an energy intensive software running, so by the time it reached the automatic turn off level it didn't turn off fast enough and the battery reached a critical level, as I found out when I turned it on again. Now it may last a minute if I leave it idle and disconnected, but it does turn off randonmly when I'm doing anything battery intensive. RIP my battery, shouldn't have tried to do stuff away from my desk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. So long you don't abuse the battery (avoid letting it go down to zero, avoid extreme heat), it should last a good while.</p>
<p>But everything has a finite lifetime, so either get yourself a phone with a replaceable battery, or plan to get a new phone after a few years. Sealed phones can have their battery replaced, but it costs a good deal more. So weigh that accordingly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In an ideal world, this would be true. However, devices - especially smart devices (smartphones, smart watches, portable Bluetooth devices, etc) are still being designed with non-user-replaceable batteries and planned obsolescence.  </p>
<p>It's very easy to design a device that has &quot;great&quot; battery life when you buy it by stretching the capacity out to the safe limits of the battery. Some cheaper battery management chips may even have this as a locked-in default.  </p>
<p>The upshot is that companies know they can make more money off you if your battery is designed to wear out faster, just not quite fast enough for them to be subject to a class action lawsuit.  </p>
<p>Some devices, from reputable manufacturers, can handle normal consumer usage with excellent longevity. Most devices still are not engineered this way, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think it’s true that the phone ever runs off the mains. It is always powered by the battery. If you leave it on charge at 100%, the charger goes into “top up” mode periodically adding a bit of juice to keep it at 100%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is actually not true.</p>
<p>If a phone is charged 100% it _will_ run off of the 5V provided by your wall adapter. It will actually even do so while charging, using the excess amperage delivered by the wall adapter and not currently used by the phone to charge up the battery.</p>
<p>You can easily tell this by connecting a usb power meter between your wall adapter and your phone: Once your battery is charged 100%, the current drawn by your phone will go down to a low value, like a few 100mA maximum - but it will not be zero.</p>
<p>Also, the wall adapter you use to charge your phone isn't actually a &quot;charger&quot; in the direct sense of the word as it does not contain any charging circuitry - that is completely contained within the phone. Therefore, it cannot go into &quot;top-up&quot; mode or anything like that. It provides 5V DC and that is all it does. (not going into fancy techniques like QuickCharge and similar stuff - and even those adapters do not contain actual charging circuitry)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right that in truth the phone is it’s own charger. But just transfer what I said there. The phone goes into top up mode. The low current draw you’re talking about is part of keeping the battery topped up.</p>
<p>Someone did exactly what you said: attached meters and measured what the charger is doing while the phone is at 100%. It was all over the tech news. That’s my source; but I’m on mobile so I can’t (be bothered to) find the link. Check it out! It should come up.</p>
<p>The charging strategy may be different from phone to phone and model to model. The article I remember was testing iPhones and found that they cycle between 80-100% “true” charge when left on reported “100%” charge overnight.</p>
<p>I’m sceptical that the phone can switch power source fast enough to account for when the charger is removed without warning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Laptops are a truly awful special case for batteries. Often a given model of laptop has a bespoke battery design, meaning you can't get new replacements — many are all manufactured at the same time, and replacements are sold from the same batch years later. Lithium-ion cells suffer from age as well as wear, so if nobody's making new batteries in the right shape, then the only available batteries will be beyond their shelf-life.</p></div>		</li>
