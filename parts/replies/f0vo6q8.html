You should be just fine entering a supermassive, and especially an ultramassive, black hole, at least with regard to tidal forces. The whole &quot;you'll never be leaving&quot; thing might make you sad.</p>
<p>There's no reason to believe that an astronaut in an ordinary 21st-century ship wouldn't survive just fine (and for potentially years if they brought supplies) after crossing the event horizon of a large enough black hole.</p>
<p>Of course, every single direction they look at would be in the direction of the singularity. I'm not sure what that would look like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well to be clear, &quot;immense gravity&quot; by itself doesn't do much to you. Damage from a stellar mass black hole occurs because of the difference in acceleration due to gravity across your body. </p>
<p>The tidal force is proportional to the length of your body over the distance from the black hole. (and of course the strength of gravity itself). </p>
<p>You experience tidal forces, therefore, just standing up on earth. Your feet are closer to earth than your head, so your feet feel slightly more gravity than your head. Your feet are experiencing an acceleration due to gravity of about 9.8m/s^2, and your head is about 0.0000006 m/s^2 less. </p>
<p>However, the cohesiveness of your body far exceeds this minuscule tidal force, so you are fine. </p>
<p>In contrast, the distance between your feet and head is significant when entering a stellar mass black hole, and your feet would feel ~50,000 m/s^2 more acceleration due to gravity than your head. That exceeds the cohesiveness of your body, so you'd be pulled apart. And remember, because tidal forces are proportional to the length of your body, as you are pulled apart the effect amplifies rapidly. Within less than a second you'd be shredded, and as parts of you approached the singularity, even molecules could be torn apart. </p>
<p>A supermassive black hole, however, has a much more gentle gradient at the event horizon. It's a few times more than the tidal forces on earth, but nothing you'd notice. </p>
<p>Going even further, for an ultramassive black hole, you'd experience the same tidal forces as on earth. You'd have billions of kilometers to go after entering the event horizon before you'd experience significant tidal forces (assuming everything works like that within the black hole).</p></div>		</li>

<p>How many Earth-years would those few years be, though?</p>
<p>If time speeds up enough when you pass the event horizon, isn't it possible that in what seems like a few years on the inside, on the outside so much time would pass that changes to the black hole would occur?</p>
<p>Is it possible to fall into a black hole of an appropriate size such that (1) a person in a space ship could theoretically survive, and (2) the time elapsed on the outside would be such that the black hole dissipates before the perdon inside has died?</p>
<p>Is it possible to pass the event horizon of a black hole; spend what seems like a few years there; and exit at some time that we might think of as &quot;end of the universe&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, I'll make that correction above. But all the same, at some point within even the most massive black hole, there would be a point where the tidal forces are exceedingly great and eventually shred an object, no? It's a slightly different question than OP asked, but would one still see the entire future of the universe pan out if they're shredded somewhere in the black hole's interior?</p></div>		</li>
