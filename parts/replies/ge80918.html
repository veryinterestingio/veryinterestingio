			<div class="markdown"><p>There is almost certainly a lot of secret sauce in both the mRNA formulations. One of the things that makes the platform attractive to investors is that even if you know what's in them, it is not simple not straight forward to replicate.</p>
<p>The presence of environmental RNA degrading enzymes is pervasive. The whole damned world is designed to destroy the stuff. So even just manufacturing it means you need a super clean facility, even by pharma standards.</p>
<p>The lipid composition probably is more complicated than just throwing in ingredients and mixing them. How you mix them and in what order will influence particle size and stability. </p>
<p>Particle size and composition has a big impact of what happens to the stuff when it's injected into the body. Random bits of RNA are how a lot of viruses propagate, so your body is set up to destroy them. In order for the vaccine to work, the mRNA has to get to the right parts of cells to actually get translated into the Covid Spike protein. That's not simple or straightforward with just lipids. The Covid-19 virus has a bunch of different components that help make that happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not true though. Tons of investors get behind lower cost generic pharmaceutical manufacturers that produce easy to make medicine. Excluding that, the person you responded to's point is incorrect anyways. Investors are behind RNA vaccines because they're seen as the future for vaccines. <a href="https://www.phgfoundation.org/briefing/rna-vaccines" target="_blank">RNA vaccines are quicker and cheaper to manufacture and are have less side effects.</a> They're also easier to start production on them so it would be easier to make a new vaccine if another new disease hits.</p>
<p>Beyond just vaccines, people forget just how ludicrously expensive pharmaceutical development is when they look at how much medicine costs. <a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2018/cost-of-clinical-trials-for-new-drug-FDA-approval-are-fraction-of-total-tab.html" target="_blank">It costs from 2 to 3 billion dollars to develop a new medicine and bring it to market. </a> if they don't make that money back by the time their patent runs out and generics are available, they'll obviously eventually go out of business. <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-global-burden-of-medical-innovation/" target="_blank">This is made even worse for Americans because most countries have massive price controls on medicine, which has means that the massive financial burden for researching pharmaceuticals is shifted to the only developed country that doesn't, the US.</a> What needs to happen is that other countries need to start pulling their weight when it comes to research and start paying more for their medicines.</p>
<p>Sorry for the rant here. This just grinds my gears.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Transporting across the country is an entirely different situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not for facilities that already have the capacity. The whole damned world just put in orders for -80 freezers though. </p>
<p>Dry ice is probably going to become scarce as well. </p>
<p>To be honest, I wonder if it might not be easier to just store in liquid nitrogen. It's more stable than dry ice, and you can submerge stuff in it. The trade-off is that you'll need to train a whole lot of people to work with it safely and buy more safety equipment.</p>
<p>Still might be cheaper and faster than -80 freezers though, and definitely better for unexpected delays on shipping. Stuff that comes on dry ice that gets stuck in customs for a few days warms over a weekend if they didn't plan for it.</p></div>		</li>
