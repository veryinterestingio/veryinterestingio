			<div class="markdown"><p>the difference in weight between an empty mag and one with even 5+ rounds is pretty noticeable. I always knew when i was down to my last couple before the eventual distinct sound of the bolt locking to the rear confirms the last one. </p>
<p>if you're firing with a purpose, and you feel your mag getting light, you should be pulling out another mag with your off-hand while finishing the first mag, pop it out and get another in as quick as possible.</p></div>		</li>
