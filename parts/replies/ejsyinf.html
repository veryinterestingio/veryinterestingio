			<div class="markdown"><p>The brain knows and automatically releases adrenaline without you doing anything. Pain comes from the brain, not the body. When the body’s been injured, the amygdala sends pain signals to that part of the body to alert you it’s injured and to take action; but if the injury is significant or life-threatning, it will temporarily stifle that pain signal to allow you to get help.</p>
<p>This is why if you’ve been in a car accident, the brain does the opposite and gives you, oftentimes, bad pain so you will stay in the vehicle and not escalate the injury. It’s also why if the pain is too great, your brain shuts things down, as in making you unconcious, so you can fight the injury without adrenaline taking over and supressing healing.</p>
<p>Pretty remarkable.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This is why I tell people who call me for insurance claims not to describe pain following an accident. If you are asked, &quot;Are you hurt? Are you injured?&quot;, just simply reply with, &quot;I don't know.&quot; Your adrenaline shoots up and you may not feel pain at that moment but give it a few hours or a day and watch how quickly things change. That is why people who think car accident victims are scamming them recall people being 'fine' following an accident. Sure, they seem okay immediately after the accident, but that next day can be a totally different story.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your nervous system is composed of the sympathetic nervous system, and the parasympathetic nervous system.  Your sympathetic is responsible for fight or flight, and triggers the release of hormones that black pain and make you super-human for a short time, at the expense of a lot of energy.  Your parasympathetic nervous system is responsible for controlling things like resting and digesting.  </p>
<p>When in an intense situation, blood, nutrient, and energy are averted away from the digestive system and other unimportant system in the moment to better prepare you for whatever threat you’re facing.</p></div>		</li>
