			<div class="markdown"><p>The amount of data traveling through the infrastructure does not affect maintenance. The same, predictable maintenance is required whether the throughput is one byte per year or 100 petabytes per second. That maintenance is supposed to be covered by the usage fee. In many areas, it is also paid for by government subsidies.</p>
<p>Charging users based on the amount of data they use is a money grab.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm in the US where providers routinely charge you overages if you use more than x gigabytes of data. More gigabytes = higher fee. The throughput is fixed. My provider currently does not do this but there are a lot of fixed and wireless providers which do.</p>
<p>Edit: Before you reply, look up the difference between to throughput billing and usage billing. We're probably talking about different things. Of course it's fine to charge more for bandwidth. That's not my argument. My argument is that providers have no business charging me extra because I used the network more. Anything where you hit a cap (say 10gb) and have to pay, say $10 for each additional gigabyte or where if I go over 15gb and they suddenly decide to cap my bandwidth ath 512kbps for the rest of the month.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In some areas with insufficient hardware, too many people using too much bandwidth at a time can cause quality issues for everyone using the hardware.  By installing bandwidth caps, it causes users to not use beyond what they &quot;need&quot;.  </p>
<p>This is an actual issue in many rural parts of the US and not a money grab.  </p>
<p>In places that don't have hardware limitations, then yes, its a money grab.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your conflating throughput and usage. Throughput is measured in kbps and talks about the speed of which data is transmitted through the network. It's fine to charge for that.</p>
<p>What's not fine is charging for each additional gigabyte after a certain arbitrary threshold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get it for rural areas but most of their customers are actually in the urban areas.</p>
<p>My provider cancelled my unlimited mobile plan and placed a data cap yeara ago to &quot;prevent abuse&quot; of their network. Apparently 3GB per month is what they have determined to be not abusive. Except Covid, WFH and video conferencing became the norm and then suddenly they have no issues with data capacity. Oh, and they are actively selling data-intensive streaming services as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a limit to how much data can be used at any moment. But talking to most people in the need to limit total usage in any moment is a bit complicated. Data caps are an in-exact proxy for that limitation. </p>
<p>They could give us throughputs that are our individual fractions of total throughput, but then everyone's connections would be much slower than today connections. They give us higher thoughput that our individual fraction would allow because not everyone is using the network at the same time. If everyone is using it at the same time individuals can't get the listed speeds. </p>
<p>But if you tell people they have true unlimited they will use it as much as possible. Simple tragedy of the commons. Every few blocks will have one guy running torrent seeds or whatever and using up the entire neighborhood's physical throughput. So for the benefit of everyone else something has to be done to limit those people. Throttling is one option, data caps is the other.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They didn’t, though. All that happened was a certain small percentage of users now had to pay for their usage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Properly designed load balancing and QOS handles this. If the torrenter is the only one online, there's no need to throttle. Let him have the maximum of what the equipment is capable (the bottleneck would probably be the cable modem in his house).</p>
<p>The second someone else jumps on to download the page, you preempt transmission of torrenter's packets to deliver the web request. A third person jumps on and you do the same. In fact, you keep doing it until the tormenter is throttled to the contract minimum, the bandwidth throughput he's paying for.</p>
<p>You should be able to do this for everyone, even if everyone is saturating their connection. The problem is that most providers over sell their network. They'll have a 3gbps connection to a neighborhood and offer 100mbps connections to all 1000 houses and get maybe 2/3rds of them. The math doesn't work out for all of them to be able to get 100mbps. Does that stop them? No. Does that get them to run a couple more 3gbps connections? Also no. So now, torrenter would be getting (math)mbps and so does everyone else. If torrent get's a c&amp;d and stops torrenting, everyone else speeds up, fairly imperceptibly, by less than 1 mbps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't sell what you can't provide.</p>
<p>If you are selling to 100 people in an area, then you should be able to provide those 100 people the speed you sell them. Don't sell to 200 people when you are not able to deliver. That's what people pay for, it's not a free service.</p>
<p>I can't think of another industry that would get away with it. </p>
<p>Imagine paying for a monthly delivery of food, but then sometimes they only send you half because they had more people sign up...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Paying for speed makes sense, paying for actual data is dumb. If a company sells 100 customers in a neighborhood 100 Mbps internet, then they should have 10 Gbps service in that neighborhood, and the subscription should cove the costs. The speed is what costs money to maintain not the actual amount of data transfered. Paying for data is a backdoor way for companies to sell more bandwidth than they have. You sell people a high-speed, but over saturate your network to increase margins, so to make sure people can still get the full speed when they test you have to discourage usage of the network which requires high speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right that paying for data is stupid, but you're wrong in that provision dedicated bandwidth for every customer would be ridiculously wasteful. Peak bandwidth is usually only used for a few seconds at a time before you drop back to nearly nothing. 100 people can share 100Mbps and be fine most of time, and many businesses are in that boat still. 1Gbps for 100 people would be plenty.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>No neighborhood has 100% usage like that. So you are either asking for them to overbuild cables probably by a factor of 10x or more, forcing them to up rates, by the same  amount, or for them to start limiting customers to 1Mbps, even when the rest of the neighborhood is idle and the other 99Mbps is idle and wasted. </p>
<p>You are ignoring the real world in favor of a plutonic ideal that will have worse outcomes for everyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are you talking about? Anything that is still in use requires a constant influx of new money for maintenance. You don't just build a 3G tower and say that city is going to be good forever. There's both upgrade and maintenance costs so the current users need to keep paying for a service so that it can get better and improve as technology improves, reach more people, and maintain itself. So it may have been paid for at one point but your never done paying for something you want to keep using over and over again.</p></div>		</li>

We gave them the huge setup costs, and now that the infrastructure exists, they treat it like gold (because they know no one will ever get another mass of money to compete with their infrastructure; even google has trouble integrating fiber because of this), monopolize areas, and fuck us with ridiculous costs and customer-abusive contracts. What are you talking about? I'm not saying it should be free ffs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe he's saying that were paying for it twice. In the bills we generate, as well as tax subsidies. It just so happens that companies generally try to make as much profit as possible so even though they have had enough money to build out gigabit for instance, they instead found it more cost effective to lobby the government to get off their backs. I've been paying more and more for service that's just ok for many years and telecom profits are doing great, so take that as you will.</p></div>		</li>
