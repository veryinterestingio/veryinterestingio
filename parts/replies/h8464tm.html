Hold your shield up throw your pila when told to at the mass of troops in front of you and then draw your gladius and stab the enemy and keep stabbing until the battle is over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact though, there is a double star in the Big Dipper/Ursa Major constellation, and you need pretty close to 20/20 vision to differentiate them. My astronomy professor said that the Roman army would use it as a qualifying test to be put on the archery team.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly when it comes to crafting trades (let's say, pottery and weaving) you'd be surprised how little difference eyesight makes!</p>
<p>I know a lot of people who knit or crochet while watching TV or chatting, and I can see weaving being similar. Sewing required a bit more precision, but feeling and knowing where everything is plays a big part too. I've not done much pottery, but from what I have done, I can see it being doable with bad vision to make practical pots, just going through muscle memory.</p>
<p>Detail work you'd need a good eye, but that's doesn't mean you wouldn't just be short sighted!</p></div>		</li>
