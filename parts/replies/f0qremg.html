			<div class="markdown"><p>Sauerkraut is fermented, not pickled. Pickled foods are just preserved in acid (vinegar), pasteurized using heat; fermentation requires the presence of lactobacilli bacteria to feed on sugars and produce lactic acid, and is not pasteurized. The difference is small, but pickled cabbage is actually a different product from proper sauerkraut. And it's important to know which is which: pickled foods can be stored at room temperature since they're too acidic to culture bacteria, but fermented foods must be kept refrigerated to preserve the lactobacilli and prevent other bacteria from developing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's partially marketing. Manufacturers aren't under any obligation to specifically state if something is pickled or fermented, and that lack of distinction has trickled into common speak.</p>
<p>Generally, just store it however it's stored in the shop. If it's on a shelf, it's counter safe. If it's in a cooler, put it in the fridge. That applies even if a package says refrigerate after opening, as that's usually a quality suggestion: mayo, for example, will deteriorate in quality (flavor, color, texture) if left out but won't spoil for as much as a couple of weeks. Even then, make sure to close the lid and keep it out of sunlight and heat and it'll remain white and creamy.</p>
<p>All that said, if it says refrigerate after opening you might as well do it. You just don't need to rush it back in the cold or toss it if it sits overnight.</p></div>		</li>
