			<div class="markdown"><p>A router knows where to send information and routes it to the next hop (to be routed again until itâ€™s last network). </p>
<p>A modem just changes the information from one form into another. Think like text to morose code. </p>
<p>So old school modems took electrical pulses (1s and 0s) and changed them into audio (still representing the 1s and 0s). They also receive audio and translate it back to electrical pulses</p>
<p>Fiber modems translate electric pulses to light pulses (send) and light pulses to electric pulses (receive)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine that all of your devices in your house are people and they all speak english.  The cable or telephone system that brings internet into your house only speaks spanish.  The modem is the translator that converts the english messages into spanish so that the internet service provider can understand it.  On the other end another modem translates it back into english for the devices on the other side.</p>
<p>The equipment that sends internet traffic does not use the same type of signal that your home network does so it needs a translator which is what a modem does.</p>
<p>The router tags all of the messages going out to the modem with a marker indicating who sent them so it can match them with the inbound replies and make sure they get sent to the device that requested them.  It directs all the traffic inside your house, but unless it has a modem built in it can't directly talk to devices outside the house.  That's why you generally have both.</p></div>		</li>
