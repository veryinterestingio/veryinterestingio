<p>That made me wonder if the person (brain) would be in pain the entire time from having their nerves snipped. Amputees say that for a while after surgery (months) that feel a burning sensation. So a withdrawn brain must feel like you're in a fire.</p>
<p>Edit: For all those commenting that the brain doesn't feel pain, the brain tissue has no nerves, but the nerves from the body connect to the brain and it can interpret the severing of that as pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to have a mastectomy so all the nerves in my chest were cut and/or removed. It's a very odd sensation of nothing combined with fuzziness/burning/pins and needles and occasionally the nerves that terminate in the scars will &quot;zing&quot; me. I wish I could turn it off and just feel nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>May I add that there is also little use of doing it. It’s possible to keep a brain dead body alive too. But a brain without input etc. may simply not have any cognition. The cells in the organ would keep on “living” but there would probably be no cognition. So there will be no interpretation of pain, thoughts, etc. </p>
<p>Also, neural connections need stimulation otherwise they degenerate. Keeping the cells alive with blood flow only is not sufficient. If there is no body, how does the brain detached from the body receive input? (And as Darth_Mufasa said there is no sufficient knowledge or technology to “hook” it up to the internet. The brain is not coded binary etc.)</p>
<p>These is still too little knowledge of a brain inside our living body, researcher are focusing on that. There are real diseases and conditions we still need to grasp. The “brain outside body” research is not (at the moment) a real priority. </p>
<p>Just my opinion as a neuroscientist. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IMO this is the right way to formulate the question.  Can we replicate the I/O passing through one cross-section of the neck?  Very concrete, and definitely has medical applications.  Turns death into paraplegia, and bionics can catch up incrementally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It certainly would be better than only a brain. Assuming that you are able to replicate the entire body (blood flow, immune system, etc.) connected to the head, you’d still need to let the whole brain adapt to the new environment. It is not as simple as a “copy/paste”.</p>
<p>If it is possible to one day “preserve” the head and avoid further necrose or infections and so on, you’d still need to figure out inputs and so on. Or you can be satisfied of just having a head being hooked up to a machine keeping you alive. </p>
<p>You can look up locked-in syndrome patients to give you an idea. BCI are the future life them and there are a lot of scientists working on it. They do a great job!</p></div>		</li>

<p>What would the lack of sensory input have on a brain that had <em>previously</em> had sensory input (like once in a living, functional human being) vs. just a brain? </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not sure what you mean by “just a brain”, but basically every brain develops according to its inputs (external and internal). So if your brain has been built according to specific inputs and loses them, the brain will “degrade” the parts of lost inputs or may also repurpose the previously used region to another input. But only if there is a purpose of doing so (stimulations). </p>
<p>The brain is an organ that keeps changing (it has a plasticity) to best suit the conditions. (Outside certain pathologies of course). Making new connections and so on is an important process.</p>
<p>To be crude and overly simplifying, a recently deceased body with a lot of previous experience is still a dead body. Over time, it will decay. If you keep it alive, it may not, but we can’t expect the body to “continue doing what it has learned previously”. But with “just a living person”, we would expect just that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These are fascinating ideas. It speaks to the question of solopsism. Is there a reality outside of my thoughts? When I go to sleep technically my life disappears but I can exist in a dream world. When I wake up I assemble reality again by taking note of my surroundings and then construct my life again.
Just as an anecdote - this morning in that space between sleep and waking up I had a cat on my upper body and a mosquito flying around my face. It was most irritating. I don't have a cat and there are no mosquitoes in my room. Weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting!</p>
<p>What we see is always an interpretation done by our brain. While we sleep, a part in the brain stem will inhibit our body from actually performing the actions we dream about doing. (There are conditions in which this fails, which you can also observe in “sleepwalking”). When waking up, the transition of dream/reality may be less smooth sometimes or for some people. </p>
<p>The brain is powerful. Just look at all those funny illusions! Even more seriously, in schizophrenia (not to be mistaken with multiple personality disorder) patients actually “see” or “hear” what the brain creates. It would feel like being told the screen you are looking at right now is not real.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any doctor that did this would likely A) face jail time and B) be shunned from the medical field.  Even if someone provided informed consent, this procedure would serve no medical purpose. We don't do these things just for &quot;science&quot;.</p>
<p>Edit: for everyone saying &quot;brain transplants&quot;, we are nowhere near that level today. There is absolutely no justification for removing someones brain right now.  Doing so to perform a &quot;brain transplant&quot; would be futile, since we have no reliable way to repair/reattach nerves, let alone the central nervous system. Maybe (and that's a big maybe) we could preserve brain activity in a brain removed from a body, but without a (proven) method to repair nerves, this would just be an elaborate decapitation. There is no medical reason for a procedure like this today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically it could aid in research for brain transplants, and would serve a medical purpose. I am imagining a fully paralyzed patient having their brain transplanted into a “brain dead” patient whose family or prior consent elected for body donation. Probably pushes the bounds of medical possibility, and I am not even remotely qualified re medicine, but could be cool and legitimate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If your body is dying, why not bet on even a little chance that you, or at least your brain would survive? We may not have the option to reattach nerves now, but we may find a way in a few years or decades.</p>
<p>Even faced with the possibility of years of suffering as a disembodied brain, making that choice now I'd rather live like that than die (obviously, my decision might change during the actual suffering, and some way of communicating this would be preferable).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh for sure, it is a matter that lacks technology (Its never been done before, therefore there is no method or tech to even achieve it) and the research is inherently <em>hearsay</em> for the same reason. That said, there really is a plethora of research and tech that is getting us fairly close to this being an absolute possibility (An absence of evidence is not evidence of absence ). As far as <em>transplanting an eye</em>; It has been performed numerous times and has acquired a pretty confident success rate. A <strong>whole</strong> eye transplant has yet to be done but the procedure is literally limited to the exact obstacles as the <em>head transplant</em> is and is the reason that both medical breakthroughs are more promising <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/researchers-human-eye-transplant-decade" target="_blank">as they have ever been</a> (Not to mention the use of stem cells, gene splicing and donor animals are the same processes that lead both studies). </p>
<p>One could argue that even a vastly more simplistic procedure, like a penile transplant, has seen shit success rates even on recent accounts. Thats because the method that fruits such chaotic results is a night and day comparison to using the regeneration methods as mentioned. The amount of expenditures doesn't compliment the demand, so the tech hasn't been adopted. Whereas frontier medical breakthroughs get the lions share of funding and can afford to experiment with such procedures.</p>
<p>Anyways, it isn't debated that a lot of unknowns exist but it absolutely can't (and shouldn't) be counted out. Which isn't anything worth <em>losing your head over</em></p></div>		</li>
