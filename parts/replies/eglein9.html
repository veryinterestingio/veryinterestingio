			<div class="markdown"><p>Same reason, just a slightly different process. Water permeates the top layer of asphalt and washes out the soft underlayer. The pressure of cars rolling over the now unsupported asphalt eventually buckles the top layer until it completely collapses. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not, the base layer of roads is intentionally soft to allow for a smoother ride over uneven terrain. </p>
<p>Really the best thing the city can do is patch the potholes in a timely manner. In my city, they love slapping tire-shredding metal plates over the holes for literally months at a time, basically just ignoring the problem. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like you are most likely a civil engineer, so I’d be interested in you response. This is not doubting you but I’d to understand. </p>
<p>This may be my perception, but I grew up in PA and moved to Jersey. I find that the highways and roads in PA have far less if any potholes compared the NJ ones. Many sections of highway are concrete instead of asphalt. It seems like it holds up better am I wrong? I understand that NJ highways have a lot of traffic and volume so that may play into it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can use concrete tho, we have some roads that were made with concrete and they never get potholes in them. They have been there since I was a kid so, 25-30 years at least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To an extent. On secondary roads and highways, they should build roads in such a way that water can drain easily and never settle within the road structure. In city streets, you can't really do that because the road has to be at the same level as the buildings, and there is nowhere to send the water to anyways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, when ice forms vertically in the joints or cracks, it may expand and widen those gaps. The next thaw allows in more water to freeze. After a few cycles, a hairpin crack can easily become 1/2” wide, and loose enough to break off chunks.</p>
<p>This is why northern states will go a spread sealant over the cracks before they get too bad.</p></div>		</li>
