			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey while i agree with most of what you said here, humans are designed for endurance long distance running. A bear absolutely would not be able to outrun a human at distance, although in the short term i think it could catch one. If the bear were running from you, you’d eventually catch it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Our entire hunting tactic revolved around tracking wounded or sick animals for miles and miles at a brisk walk/jog until they collapsed from exhaustion meanwhile we were carrying food and water with us, and we sweat to regulate our body temperature on the go. </p>
<p>Only thing is that a bear will fuck you up <em>long</em> before you get to that portion of the chase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. But if you're chasing the bear than you're not likely in fight or flight mode. Chasing after something involves strategy and planning (like ensure pacing, keep track of target, avoid dangers). If a bear is chasing you, you're more likely in sympathetic mode initially. The goal is to bolt as fast as you can before the parasympathetic kicks in and reminds you of needing a better strategy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sorry for nitpicking, but aren’t humans optimized for endurance running? Could a bear really outlast a human in an endurance run?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if you Usain Bolt it out of there at 27 miles an hour for a 100 meters, the bear can do that speed for over 3,000 meters. While the human might be able to keep up 10 miles an hour till the cows come home, they’d be bear food long before then. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha fair enough. I guess TLDR: the longer you are in beast mode, the less you are in planning and thinking mode. Our ancestors had higher rates of survival with thinking and planning than with beasting out.</p></div>		</li>
