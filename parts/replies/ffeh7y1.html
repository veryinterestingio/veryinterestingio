			<div class="markdown"><p>An airline company was sued for misleading advertising by saying they'd improved their mishandling of loosing luggage by 100%, because many members of the public thought they meant they didn't lose luggage at all anymore. But merely cut their rate in half.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that doesn't surprise me at all. You're not allowed to straight up lie to your customers because that's false advertising but telling them the truth in a way they're too ignorant to understand is just good for business. Buyer beware. </p>
<p>I've seen almost this exact thing in ads for something else but I don't recall what anymore. It was way too long ago.</p>
<p>Edit: Hold up. The airline didn't lose the lawsuit, did they? I mean, I could see why they should but I'd be surprised if they did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wording is really important here too.</p>
<p>100% better is twice as good.
100% worse is twice as bad.</p>
<p>To fix 100% of problem does mean the number of problems becomes zero.  But nobody will ever say that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well no, if you fix 100% of the problems it goes away. But if you improve your handling of the problems by 100% then that means you halfed your problems. It's just that saying the handling of the problems inverts it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I like how this exact wording makes it sound like the airline was advertising that they now lose your luggage twice as often.</p></div>		</li>
