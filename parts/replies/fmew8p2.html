			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because it's infinite it's the same no matter how much it expands. There would just be more stuff in the same amount of space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always hear people talk about the universe being denser in the begging, but what are we actually talking about? And when we talk about the universe expanding is it just that the same amount of &quot;universe stuff&quot; just spreading more thin? But also how can something infinite occupy a finite volume? Is it just the amount of energy thats in the universe thats spreading?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Everything was closer together</p>

<p>Yep, space inflating.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this confusion comes from the fact that people think the big bang occurred at a point, it didn't, it occurred everywhere, although there's some pretty deep nuance there with the varied possibilities of inflation scenario's there are question there that due to the expansion itself we may not be able to answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My confusion is by everything i take it you mean all of the quarks, anti quarks, bosons etc.  formed when the big bang happened, but you said that it was infinite, but surely energy (mass) isnt infinite because we've calculated how much of it there should be, i say should because of dark energy and matter. I love physics and i want to do it in uni but i cant say i know too much about cosmetology so im sorry if im being very dumb here but i find it hard to wrap my head around how something can be infinite yet expanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's something I don't get here: if you draw a dot on a balloon, then the dot expand itself with the balloon. So it's not the same thing as another analogy I h heard of, which is sticking bits on paper on the balloon by their (dot) center: then the bit of paper do not expand with the balloon.
Which analogy is closer to the reality?</p></div>		</li>
