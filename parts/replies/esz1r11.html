			<div class="markdown"><p>And if they wanted to freshen up and get dirt off, they just hopped in a lake, river or creek. </p>
<p>While we use soap today, one can still get fairly clean by just getting in a lake and wiping/scrubbing with their hands. Some people in beach areas used sand to sort of “scrub the dirt off” if I recall correctly what I read long ago. </p>
<p>Toothbrushes existed in a form of chewed twigs from certain trees. The chewed ends would fray into a sort of brush that people would wipe their teeth with. Get bits of food out, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a kind of fruit, the sapindus or soap berry, which when saked in water gives makes the water soapy. This was used for cleaning stubborn stains and dirt. You will be surprised that if you use fine clay in your hair, it helps untangle your hair and acts like a shampoo.</p>
<p>Also do take notice of how primates clean themselves today.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I went camping for 3 weeks with a dozen people and we all left deodorant at home to avoid bears. None of us showered for the duration of the trip. None of us smelled much of anything at all until I came back and saw my dad--his cologne smelled crazy, and I smelled nasty! I had to shower 4 times in a row to get the dirt and stink out.</p></div>		</li>

But with marketing terms such as &quot;deodorant&quot;, and targeting masculinity in their ads, they were able to get the entire US to then decide it was obligatory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It probably depended also on availability.  In areas with good soil and rain and plenty of plantlife, gathering can be very productive but in other areas, large game is the easier route for calories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most, if not all, humans with available fish and game nearby would hunt/fish. </p>
<p>Its way too big of a calorie source to just ignore. </p>
<p>Humans struggle with protein deficiency without a meat source nearby, even modern day vegans struggle with this to some degree. Likely any human group who chose not to hunt, scavenge or fish would suffer horribly from protein deficiency unless they had a miraculous source of protein rich plants nearby. </p>
<p>Even that is iffy as agriculture wouldn't be have been available yet so good luck getting enough protein without agriculture, hunting, fishing or scavenging. </p>
<p>Doesn't mean hunting is what humans did all the time. It was likely very intermittent, only happening a couple times a month(for game, not fish) at most. </p>
<p>People would gather far more than they hunted but still hunting has been a part of pretty much every single human culture ever.</p>

<p>Nonsense, as most humans did both, hunter-gatherer is more than descriptive enough even though it can give the impression that humans hunted more often than they did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah we have brain cells, there are easier ways to catch things and our ancestors had the benefit of hundreds of years of developed knowledge and years of practice to catch things using traps and primitive weapons, along with gathering of native plant foods.  Many believe that in a well stocked natural forest or jungle, food would have been most of the time relatively easy to come by using tribal knowledge and skills.  It was only when tribes started outgrowing their resources that major food shortages happened.</p></div>		</li>
