			<div class="markdown"><p>A: Not necessarily. Some quantum processors may need to operate at very low temperatures. But the quantum internet is designed to transmit quantum states to different places. Scientists typically use photons as the vehicles to transmit quantum states. Photons are transmitted either in telecom fibers or in free space. The devices that handle photon transmission can typically operate at normal temperatures. (Wenji)</p>
<p>A: As Wu said, the transmission will very likely be at room temperature, apart if cooled superconducting wires become wide-spread across cities and continents. However, the quantum internet will require a quantum repeater to boost the signal across long stretches of fiber (if not using satellites), similar to a classical amplifier. This repeater is very much like a barebone tiny quantum computer, meaning that it will require low temperatures in most cases. (Gary)</p></div>		</li>
