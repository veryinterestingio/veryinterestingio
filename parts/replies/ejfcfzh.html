			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, the nictating membrane isn't very transparent, so wouldn't this make it hard for the cheetah to see her prey while dashing?  Got any close-up pictures of cheetahs running that show the nictating membrane?  It's not obvious in the pictures I can find on the net.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bunnies have a nictitating membrane as well. They use it to protect their eyes in a fight.</p>
<p>This can be problematic if you're trying to bond bunnies and they start going at it with each other which means you need to get in there and separate them. If they put down their membranes it messes up their already bad eyesight and means they can do stuff like try to ravage your shoe because they think it's the other bunny.</p>
<p>Good times.</p></div>		</li>
