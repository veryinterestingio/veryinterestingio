			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. It should be stacked with an organic vapor/acid/etc chem cart. With those you can’t smell anything and if you can smell it you know the chem cart is dead. Also for the fitment aspect; Read instructions carefully! A basic test is to block the intake and see if you get a strong vacuum when inhaling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right and there are a couple study that prove it. Yet everyone who talk about elastomeric mask spew this myth about the exaltation valve! They don't see the large gaps on n the side of surgical mask. Which have like a century of proven Effiency for protection sterile field in surgery...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm interested in the studies, and I believe you (if you cite them), but the comparison to paper masks is not apt. The vent is typically at an angle that is directed much more towards the person you may be speaking to, and, critically, virtually <em>all</em> of the air you breathe out is going to go out this hole, if the mask is fitted well. In comparison, much the air you breathe out with a paper mask is going to go through the paper, and the rest is going to get spread around a fairly wide circumference, and not angled towards the person you are talking to.</p>
<p>The valves on N95 masks were never designed to be used in health care settings. They are designed solely for protecting the wearer from particles in the air, so it was never a concern to care whether the vent was safe against spreading diseases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Realistically you can also cut a surgical mask into six pieces and use one piece to cover the exhalation valve (plus a piece of duct tape). It's what I was doing in my clinic in March, April, and May.</p></div>		</li>
