In 2013 we found the gene responsible for a disease called Steel syndrome which is a disorder of bone growth where patients are born with dislocated hips and other problems. This disorder is most frequent in Puerto Rico and not in other populations. Before we found the gene another study showed that patients with Steel syndrome didn't do well when they had surgery to fix their hips. It was actually worse for them because their hips would dislocate again and they would suffer from more chronic pain compared to patients that never had surgery. Unfortunately, prior to the identification of the gene it was difficult to know the accurate diagnosis for patients with dislocated hips, whether Steel syndrome or other disorder. Now that we know the gene and the approximate carrier frequency in the population, this can be tested early when a baby is born with dislocated hips and recommend not to have surgery, preventing an unnecessary procedure and lifelong pain.
This is just one example but there are many others where knowing the variants that cause disease in specific populations can help screen early for these and avoid unnecessary treatments, recommend effective ones, and avoid disability or other consequences of a late or innacurate diagnosis.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In contrast, genetic studies of individuals of African ancestry, as early as 2005, have been shown to be beneficial for many populations (18,19). Novel variants of proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9), found in individuals of African ancestry, were shown to reduce levels of low-density lipoproteins, which are known to increase risk of coronary heart disease (CHD)(18). This allowed the development of drugs to inhibit PCSK9 function (19). The benefits of these drugs are not limited to African populations as they are effective for populations worldwide.</p>
