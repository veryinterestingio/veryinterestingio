			<div class="markdown"><p>What if I'm using it to reflect heat out away from the surface of the food?  Shiny side out, as it's more reflective in the visual spectrum and therefore must be more reflective of all heat sources.^*</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to expand on this,  it's because of the size of the press.  When they run the last press they put 2 layers of aluminum foil through it.  The sides touching the roller are shiny.  The side touching aluminum foil are dull.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isnt it from being rolled flat or something like that. Like one roller is metal and one side is like rubber or wood or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, foil is made by flattening aluminium sheets between two rolls, one in metal, heating, the other in silicon, trying not to burn.</p>
<p>AFAIK the silicon produce the dull side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very close.... but not quite. Its passed between two metal rollers, but they feed 2 layers of the foil through at the same time (They feed 2 layers through at a time to avoid the foil breaking in the milling process). The sides of the foil touching the metal rollers are essentially 'buffed' into a shiny surface, while the sides of the foil pressed against each other dont get this and come out with more of a matte finish.</p></div>		</li>
