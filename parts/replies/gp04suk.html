			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, I have had this argument with many people. I feel like people don't understand absolute vs relative risk. It seems like radon abatement companies only advertise the additional risk to smokers because they are trying to sell more systems.</p>
<p>I generally show them this graph:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I take from this is that a high concentration of Radon gas is a notable contributer to lung cancer death in regular or heavy smokers. So there is probable an interaction effect. Am I interpreting this correctly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it is not an added risk from the radon, but it multiply your existing risk.</p>
<p>If you are a high risk smoker multiplying it is really bad, if you are a low risk non-smoker then doubling low risk is still not that bad.</p>
<p>I still think consumers should be educated, and if levels are high should take steps to do basic abatement. But I feel like the message from companies about radon abatement are not clear. When I hear commercials on the radio talking about radon they mention risk and percentages, but never mention that they are talking about smokers, and stopping smoking will reduce your risk substantially more. In fact they don't even mention smokers in their advertisements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am curious how they get the statistics. When someone has lung cancer, is it common to test the radon levels of where they live?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is epidemiological, not individual, in nature. You can't tell (even if there was high radon levels) why someone got cancer. You can't tell even if they were a pack-a-day smoker â€” that could be totally coincidental to whatever caused the cancer. What you can do is look at populations and look for the excess cancers, and then weigh different variables based on different lifestyles and exposures. Whether any given exposure causes cancer is probabilistic in nature, which makes attribution in individual cases essentially impossible, but with a sufficiently large population you can see these effects.</p>
<p>One interesting fact: radon exposure hazards were first developed using data from uranium miners in the American southwest, who did most of their mining in the 1950s-60s (during the &quot;Uranium Rush,&quot; when the US government put an artificially high price on uranium ore, and gave bonuses for the discovery of new claims, in order to incentivize domestic uranium mining for national security purposes) but were tracked throughout their lives afterwards by the Public Health Service. These people were exposed to a <em>lot</em> more radon than you get in your household. The miners came in essentially three &quot;flavors&quot;: Navaho, itinerant hardrock miners, and Mormons. The Mormon data in particular was highly valued because they generally did not smoke, creating a &quot;natural control&quot; for differentiating radon and smoking deaths.</p></div>		</li>
