			<div class="markdown"><p>To further this point there usually need to be an injury of some sort before the breaking down of the 4th wall actually begins to impact the health of a tree. Often you will see a tree lose a major limb or leader through weather-related events, the damage from which the tree is unable to compartmentalize before decay or other disease sets in.</p>
<p>I work as an arborist and one of the important things we stress is making proper collar cuts when pruning because if you cut to closely to the trunk then it &quot;breaks&quot; the 4th wall severely inhibiting the tree's ability to compartmentalize. </p>
<p><a href="https://agrilife.org/treecarekit/files/2013/02/3.6_2.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> is a good diagram of what a good collar cut should look like with the cut at a roughly 45° angle just below the branch-bark ridge. A proper cut should soon see a <a href="https://www.dirtdoctor.com/www/default/ckfinder/userfiles/1114/images/Newsletter%20photos/6.15.17%20-%20Pruning/010b_Proper_pruning_cuts_will_be_almost_perfectly_round_and_the_healing_callus_formation_will_be_uniform_all_around.jpg" target="_blank">ring around the cut</a> in a couple years where the tree is compartmentalizing over the wound, however on larger limbs especially those on slow-growing trees like beeches it may take decades for the tree to compartmentalize the wound leaving the tree vulnerable to decay and disease. </p>
<p>If you cut to close to the trunk, known as a flush cut, it breaks the 4th wall and you don't see that ring of healing around the wound. <a href="http://statebystategardening.com/images/uploads/article_uploads/13Jan_umwnews_1-H2.jpg" target="_blank">In this picture</a> the lower cut was a flush-cut as you can see there is no compartmentalization on the lower part of the cut so this wound will take significantly longer to heal as it would need to grow from the top down rather than from the outer ring inward. You can also see on the smaller cut above that the 4th wall was broken ever-so-slightly which creates that point on the bottom of the ring. </p>
<p>Lastly it is also important to not cut the limb to far from the collar <a href="https://www.todayshomeowner.com/images/article/how-to-trim-large-tree-branches-5.jpg" target="_blank">because that leaves a stub</a> which will never properly compartmentalize either due to the amount of time it would take for  the new growth to completely envelope that old wood. This can lead to decay and disease travelling down the dead wood into the heart of the tree and compromise the interior heartwood often leading to the hollow interior which /u/NatDPP alluded to.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that different trees grow at different rates so the way in which a fast-growing tree like a river birch responds to pruning and injury is very different from the way a slow-growing tree such as a beech does. So sometimes a tree may die from injury due to old age that would have otherwise lived another 50 or 100 years if it had remained unharmed. </p>
<p>Trees also eventually slow down in the rate at which they put on new growth which affects their ability to compartmentalize as well. A good indicator for this is the bark which exfoliates in a similar fashion to human skin. If a tree is covered in moss or lichen it is usually an indicator that the bark is not exfoliating very quickly. While it is correct that trees grow faster as they age that is largely due to the nature of how trees grow. As the limbs grow larger and larger adding an additional 1/4&quot; of growth to the diameter of a limb that is 2&quot; in diameter will add less wood than that same limb 20 years later when it is 8&quot; in diameter.</p>
<p>I also feel I should put this disclaimer that I never went to school for this so if there is an arborculturalist that has a more precise definition or explanation for these things I am more than welcoming of those corrections.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's one reason Bristlecone Pines can live for so long.  They compartmentalize extremely well. In some of the 4000+ year-old trees, 90% of the &quot;tree&quot; that you see is dead wood.</p>
<p>Another reason is how small they are.  They never grow fast, topping out at about 20 feet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really interesting.. thank you for explaining this. It really brings home the point that trees and plants are all living things, and will suffer injury and heal its wounds. I think old trees are really beautiful, and love seeing old neighborhoods with mature trees. Thanks for showing us the examples of how to take care of the trees!</p></div>		</li>
