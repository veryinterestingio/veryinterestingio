			<div class="markdown"><p>In the context of trying to reduce the manufacture of single use plastics, government regulation and economic pressure are really not that different. Either way, the word needs to be spread and people need to be educated and convinced to vote/pay for the desired result, whether through capitalism or democracy. Unless I'm missing something, logic dictates that the root of the problem must be some combination of ignorance and indifference throughout the majority.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, sure, but we don't regulate production of goods in 'murca in that way.  We let the market manage itself for the most part as far as consumer goods.  I'm not taking a side about right or wrong, just saying that the gov't is not likely to regulate production in that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a relatively new and recent phenomenon. There's also no reason we can't change. We used to have children working in factories. We used to use lead in all our gasoline. We used to insulate our buildings with asbestos.</p>
<p>Those things didn't go away because of individual consumer choices, they went away because of government regulations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's more realistic:</p>
<p>Convince not literally everybody but tens of millions of people (US alone) to stop buying plastic products. Including millions of people who don't care, or aren't educated in these problems.</p>
<p>Or.</p>
<p>Pass legislation to make the, by comparison, handful of manufacturers to disincentivise production of disposable plastic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Single-use plastics are used in all consumer manufacturing and shipping. Drink bottles and shopping bags are the thing we hear about the most <em>because</em> they give the impression that the problem largely results from consumer action. But for folks who don't work retail or consumer manufacturing, the sheer volume of plastic bags and shipping materials which are discarded on a daily basis goes entirely unnoticed.</p>
<p>This is a problem which rests squarely on the shoulders of companies.</p></div>		</li>
