			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember in the 90s when video just didn’t exist on the internet!? What a crazy time for us crazy kids. Sure had some bullshit with realplayer but that never seemed to work right. </p>
<p>Porn? Ok, if you wanna wait 2 minutes for a photo to load. You want video? Better keep that 56k connection going all night and hope it doesn’t fail so that 10mb ultra-low rez clip would be ready to check out in the morning. Oh you downloaded the wrong one? Sucks to be you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't really start messing with computers until like 92-93... we didn't really have internet until more like 95 or so... the usenet irc stuff was a touch before my time. I'm familiar with it and used it briefly, but it's really fuzzy how it all worked. I came along more with just internet chatrooms, webcrawler, netscape, then in my middleschool/highschool years it was all about ICQ then yahoo messenger and aim.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, the iPhone did not (and still does not) support flash when it came out. the iPhone was the earliest experience of it's kind, before the majority of Android phones and tablets were out. You had millions of users migrating to a new way to surf the web that wanted to watch video (or, really, do anything) on the phone but couldn't do so with the web browser. Sites like Youtube created an app for the iPhone, but many other video websites fell by the wayside as the smart phone became the more popular computer.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Flash was usurped by many other standards. Flash used to run the software to get the web browser to gain the trust of the website that played music in Spotify and Soundcloud (usurped by HTML5 with Google's Widevine and Microsoft's PlayReady), it used to play videos in Youtube and Crunchyroll (Netflix had Microsoft's Flash competitor Silverlight; again, usurped by HTML5 and how web browsers gain trust to play videos), it used to play games (replaced by the Unity game engine and graphical engines for the web, like webGL, although java is still used), and it used to be the interface for many websites (now buttons and pages are rendered with HTML5, CSS and Javascript).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The app store didn't exist when the iPhone was released and the decision to not include flash support in Safari predates the app store too.</p>
<p>The real initial reason was because even back then, flash was insecure and ill suited to being used on a touch device and especially one so small.</p>
<p>Sure in the time that followed once the app store existed it may have been decided to continue to not support flash but it wasn't the driving force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People keep mentioning Unity as a Flash replacement but they dropped their web player a long time ago. Best it'll do now is spit out a pile of JS+WebGL (if your project is fairly simple, otherwise it'll just spit out ambiguous errors).</p>
<p>At that point you could do the same thing with a game engine that didn't totally suck.</p></div>		</li>
