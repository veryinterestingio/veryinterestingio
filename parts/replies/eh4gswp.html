			<div class="markdown"><p>Who did you go to to have it done? I used to go to therapy a lot but i moved and the therapists in this state(that my insurance pays for) are awful and don't care. I feel like I could benefit a lot from this but I have no idea how to go about finding and making an appointment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Search <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us" target="_blank">Psychology Today</a> for your zip code then filter by therapy type (EMDR) and insurance.</p>
<p>Many therapists don’t take insurance. If the EMDR providers near you don’t, call your insurance co and ask about “out of network benefits”. You may be able to pay the therapist and submit as out of network for partial reimbursement. Example: Therapist charges $90 for session. Out of network benefit covers 50%. You are reimbursed $45, which means you paid $45 for your session. </p>
<p>It gets more complicated with deductibles and coinsurance etc but your insurance co can help you understand your benefits. They may even be able to help you find an in network provider. Another tip: the insurance company’s online list isn’t always up to date. Call the therapist and ask if they take your insurance or if they have a discount or sliding scale for the uninsured. Your FSA/HSA can also be used to pay for therapy. </p>
<p>Call now, since appointment wait lists can be long in some places. </p>
<p>I wish you all the best on this journey. You and I are on it together 💙</p></div>		</li>
