			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not a valid explanation. If this was true, turning your head underwater would produce air bubbles and your ear would fill anyway. The answer is anatomy. The ear drum seals off the outer ear from the middle ear. No water comes beyond that point. </p>
<p>However, you can get an infection in your outer ear from bacteria like Pseudomonas in the water. It’s called swimmers ear and is unfortunately common.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>This is Not medical advice</em>
If you have Acute Otitis externa (swimmers ear) it has to be treated with an antibiotic, preferably as a local application not a pill. </p>
<p>Pseudomonas has many „natural“ resistances to antibiotics. Not because we made it resistance with antibiotic treatment, but because the biology of this bacterium isn’t affected by the mechanisms our drugs use. </p>
<p>If you get Otits externa frequently, you could consider other options. Many people like special fitted ear plugs that seal the ear from water. No water gets into that bit of ear canal and you get less infections. Many audiologists/hearing aid technicians can make a mould of your ear and create this special waterproof ear plug. </p>
<p>Prevention is better than treatment, even more important with a bug that’s as resistant as Pseudomonas. If your son tolerates this (looks a bit silly) for showering/bathing/swimming and you can afford to make new moulds because he’s growing. At his age, it might not be an option already.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's wrong though. The outer ear floods with water all the way to the ear drum when submerged. Water normally cannot get past the ear drum into the Eustachian tube, which connects to your eyes, nose and throat. In some cases water can pass the ear drum, because it can open slightly to stablize air pressure and let fluid drain out and also into the back of your throat like in the case of an ear infection or water trapped behind the eardrum. The straw example used to demonstrate air pressure and hydrologic pressure may help keep water from entering the Eustachian tube if it passes the ear drum, but it is the seal of the ear drum itself that keeps water from entering the inner ear. There are some people who have a surgical tube put in their ear drum to help it drain because it does not drain on its own properly. The pressure isn't always constant as the tubes are open on the other end to the throat so the straw example would not always work.  Water can just harmlessly drain in and out but that increases the risk of ear infection. People with these tubes in their ear generally avoid getting any water in them.</p></div>		</li>
