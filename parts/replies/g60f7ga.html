<p>Bonus: they're Crocs, so they're so fugly that you're never tempted to wear them anywhere but work.</p>
<p>I'm an anesthesiologist. Working on floors covered with a mixture of saline and blood is par for the course. The Crocs have nonskid soles, no holes in the side, and they can be washed in a scrub sink to remove all the fluids and solids that end up on the floor of an operating room.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a woman, I was once written up at a job for not having completely black slip resistant shoes. They were composite toe Puma’s with a thin blue strip, they were also shock resistant. I had gone from working in a manufacturing plant to doing dishes at a breakfast chain. I didn’t feel like spending money on more shoes simply because a minimum wage job was upset when I already had recent shoes for the job. I asked the manager when she wrote me up if having a dishwasher with all black shoes was more important than having a dishwasher.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My small town fast food restaurant tells employees before they start that if you refuse to wear/buy slip res shoes, you're fully liable and responsible, I think it might have been in the application too not sure, I won't say where exactly but it was a part of the south usa where crackheads would work for like a week and then quit just to get a check</p>
<p>Some would even use our old system of buying food there would be deducted from your check but they used it so much that the management didn't notice and they end up owing money to the restaurant, and whadda ya know they're no where to be found.</p></div>		</li>
