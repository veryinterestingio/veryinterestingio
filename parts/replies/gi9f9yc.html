			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay I looked up a video on Khan Academy about Milankovitch Cycles which included precession of the equinoxes. Super interesting stuff, thanks for putting a word to the concept I was thinking of!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two different kinds of precession being conflated here.  There's axial precession, in which the orientation of the axis of rotation of a planet gradually changes with respect &quot;fixed stars&quot;.  And then there's apsidal precession, in which the orientation of a planet's orbital ellipse gradually changes with respect to those same stars.   One of Einstein's early successes was explaining the magnitude of Mercury's <strong>apsidal</strong> precession.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes,  thank you.  I think the original concept I was thinking is actually apsidal precession, e.g. the rotating of the perihelion around the sun, rather than precession of the equinoxes,  which I'm understanding to be like the &quot;wobble of a top&quot;?</p></div>		</li>
