			<div class="markdown"><p>I know you're joking, but it's smart that cold/heat/pressure sensations override pain.</p>
<p>Pain is usually a sign that you have already been injured. So, it's your body's way of telling you to be more careful in the future and to take care of the injured area.</p>
<p>Cold/heat/pressure are signs you are about to be injured. So it's your body's way of telling you to be more careful right now to prevent getting injured (burned, frostbit, stabbed/crushed).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the only time I did an Ironman 70.3, I was exhausted by the time I had to do the 21K run, my legs were cramped, they got stiffs as logs every time I tried to run, I saw someone putting some ice on their legs and I put some ice inside my Tri suit, in the legs.  The pain from the ice made the cramps go away, I could run and finish the race because of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also great for itching, but can dry out the skin, making it worse later. A hot shower can provide hours of relief, though, and feels amazing. Very good for a temporary rash like poison ivy or oak that you know will pass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The latest guidance actually suggests to avoid icing in the acute stages of injury. The inflammation/swelling actually aides healing. So, RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation) is out and PEACE and LOVE is in (<a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/54/2/72" target="_blank">https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/54/2/72</a>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And I have to agree with this on a personal level. I had a hip injury that didn't heal for 2 years with my protecting and barely using it.<br />
Then I got a job that forced me to use it. Pain was gone in two weeks. now when I get an injury, no anti-inflammatories because they seem to slow healing. And I use the injured part to promote healing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So swelling aides healing but they still recommend compression to reduce swelling? Isn't swelling seen as more of a protective mechanism VS mainly a physical pathway to introduce healing processes to the injury like revascularization is?</p></div>		</li>
