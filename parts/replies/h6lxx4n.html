			<div class="markdown"><p>In the west we had one a couple of days ago! </p>
<p>But you are right, it happens like once a year at best (now only because of the heat wave).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Classic terrain driven rain.</p>
<p>Steady (and humid) winds (atlantic jetstream) come from the south west, are driven over a terrain feature (Ireland in this case) and keeps releasing its rain over the same spot as air is driven upwards and lose its capability to retain moisture.</p>
<p>If ireland had taller mountains, more land (creating a climate zone more different from the surrounding sea) or if it was closer to the tropics (with the sun dumping in more heat energy during the day) the rain would be heavier (like Bergen in Norway, the monsoons around the Indian ocean or the afternoon rains of Florida), but as it is it's pretty gentle.</p></div>		</li>
