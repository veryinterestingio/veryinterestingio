			<div class="markdown"><p>they are also leptons and as far as we know only interact by the weak force.</p>
<p>the weak force is also called the flavor force since it is the only thing that allows things to change flavor, e.g. up quark to down quark. the classic example is the process called beta decay, where a neutron turns into a proton by emitting an electron. this is actually explained by the weak force, which changes a down quark into an up quark, turning neutron (udd) into proton (uud). but an electron has to carry away the extra charge, and it is accompanied by the small, nearly undetectable electron neutrino, only discovered because there was missing energy in the original studies of beta decay.</p>
<p>as far as we can tell whenever an electron is involved in a weak process, a neutrino must necessarily be involved as well. you can think of it in this way: the weak force connects two flavor changes, one being a quark flavor change (up to down) and one being a lepton flavor change (electron to electron neutrino). but it can also connect quarks to quarks or leptons to leptons.</p>
<p>in principle this also permits related processes like n + neutrino → p + e^- but they are rare because the weak force is very weak. that’s precisely what the earliest neutrino detectors were: a big vat of neutron-rich material in the hopes that a neutrino will eventually hit one and produce an electron, which is a lot easier to see.</p></div>		</li>
