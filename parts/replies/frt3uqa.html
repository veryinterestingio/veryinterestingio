			<div class="markdown"><p>Annnnnd I'm saving that to look at later when I start journaling again - I've always considered myself very self-aware, and very understanding and communicative of my emotions (at least, after 6 years of therapy!) but the &quot;dont feel vs don't express RIGHT NOW&quot; is a very important distinction that's never come up. I have ADHD and one of the major things is the lack of emotional regulation - I feel everything so strongly and have little control over my reactions sometimes. So I just learned not to feel. No feeling = no embarrassing myself by bursting into tears or hurting someone by being mean over something stupid. Might be time to dredge some of that crap up and look at it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is kind of something that has been on my mind recently. And I think one of the biggest things is just not <em>fighting</em> said feelings and emotions. Sometimes we have to brush them away but, when they resurface, we need to acknowledge them, maybe put them on a pedestal even, so that they can be processed and eventually fade away into new conclusions and patterns rather than merely becoming a reoccurring routine and form of thinking</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My therapist introduced me to a concept called &quot;riding the wave&quot;. It says the exact same thing that you did, using an analogy of a big scary ocean wave as your emotions. You can't run away from it by swimming towards shore, you'll never make it in time. You can't fight it by swimming at it, it just doesn't work, you'll get overpowered. You could try to escape it, by diving down and getting under it, but that requires very precise timing and if you don't do it right, you're screwed. So what you should do is accept that it's coming, accept that it will crash down on you, and just ride the wave and surf with it, go through it. A key part to remember is that <em>the wave will pass</em>, so even if everything's turbulent now, hold onto that and you'll come out the other side just fine.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. It's quite difficult to suddenly try and become more open with my emotions when I've lived long enough to get used to &quot;bottling up&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s very frustrating that they named ADHD the way they did. Very few people are aware of the emotional regulation difficulties, the rejection sensitive dysphoria, the executive dysfunction, the chronic lateness due to time blindness. Because all we have is “can’t sit still disease”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not everyone experiences the same symptoms with ADHD.  I haven't had difficulty with emotional regulation since I was a teenager, and I've literally never had rejection-sensitive dysphoria.  I'm honestly the opposite, even as a kid I had zero fucks to give about social acceptability and trying to be likeable.  I have time blindness and general executive function issues, but also don't fidget and hate it when other people do.  </p>
<p>I.e. no one name would suit everyone's experiences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great essay! ;) </p>
<p>I'm so open about my emotions and I can talk about the trauma I've been through pretty easily usually, but I still feel it's all bottled up but isn't affecting my mood/mental health now? Like I almost forget about it most of the time. Is this healthy? Does this mean I've dealt with it or I'm bottling it up and it will be worse in the future? I did have depression for years but had medication until I was better and now I don't suffer with depression at all.</p>
<p>I feel I have a good idea of my emotions, I usually know why I sometimes feel down and I'm able to communicate that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those things are cyclical, they come around again and again like a spiral and we take away and learn different things about them each time, or we may not need them right then or be able to handle them in the moment, so we don't pull them up and look at them at that time.The trick is not to dredge them up but to allow yourself to have awareness of them when they show up, take a look at them if it is relevant or helpful, and if not, just notice it and let it recede again.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I recently was researching why I have problems reading or watching shows the last few years and stumbled across that.</p>
<p>I plan to bring it up in therapy but it explains a lot. Especially how I can so easily talk about my trauma but I'm subconsciously avoiding triggers.</p></div>		</li>
