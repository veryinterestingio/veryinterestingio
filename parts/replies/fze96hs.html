			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the most exciting aspects of the science that Perseverance will do is to select samples that will ultimately be returned to Earth for study with state of the art laboratory based instruments. Curiosity can only do in situ work. On the other hand, Curiosity has two analytical lab instruments-- Chemin and SAM that can do quite a bit-- mineralogical ID and analysis of organic molecules and gases, either directly from the atmosphere or evolved from heating drilled samples. Perseverance has instruments that can rapidly probe potential targets for sampling and return to Earth, we can look at the chemistry and mineralogy via our arm and mast-mounted instruments, and we can also look at environmental conditions, the way Curiosity does. One novel experiment (MOXIE) that Perseverance will conduct is to try to extract oxygen right out of the atmosphere! – PC</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way humans have explored space so far is by taking *EVERYTHING* they need for the journey with them.  That's a huge burden, and an expensive one.  If we can utilize resources we find at our destinations, that's less material we have to launch from Earth, and push through space, and land at the destination.  </p>
<p>That's why NASA is developing technologies to do in situ resource utilization (ISRU) -- that is, to utilize the resources that we find in the original place (&quot;in situ&quot;).  MOXIE, which will produce oxygen from the carbon dioxide in the Mars atmosphere, is a first step in establishing ISRU capabilities on another planet.  </p>
<p>Initially, the plan is to use the oxygen that's produced in this way as rocket propellant (specifically, as an oxidizer to be burned in combination with a fuel such as methane), but eventually it can be used for other purposes.  And other ISRU processes that utilize water ice and resources from the soil, will also be developed. -JS</p></div>		</li>
