			<div class="markdown"><p>But you can't blame turbulance on the crash of AA587. After all it was clear that was the copilot inputs that was keeping the aircraft to not recover from the situation it was. If the copilot nor the pilot interfered, the airplane itself could had recovered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>wake turbulence clearly played a part though. </p>
<p>it was 23 seconds from hitting the wake to the stab failing, at which point the plane was likely unrecoverable. the copilot may have made the wrong call in his reaction, but he wouldn't have had to make that decision if he hadn't hit the wake in the first place, so it's fair to call it a contributing factor in the mishap</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wake encounters are not by any means vanishingly rare. Dozens of pilots report them to ASRS annually, and that means many more wake encounters happen that go unreported because they are unremarkable to the pilot and handled correctly.</p>
<p>As a pilot of a widebody, the copilot was in the best possible position to encounter a wake. /u/Lolpo555 is right that if he had done nothing, everything would have been fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wake turbulence played a part, no doubt, but it wasnâ€™t the turbulence itself that was responsible for the plane crashing. </p>
<p>Another thing to note is the majority of these crashes that are caused by turbulence happened decades ago. Aircraft design, safety mechanisms, and pilot training have all vastly improved since then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but encounting wake turbulence caused by other plane's engines may happen most times, despite proper separation between planes.</p>
<p>I find it good, if the chain of events includes turbulence as a thing that happened previous the crash, (as if for instance the plane crashed on a rainy day), but not it, as the main cause for this crash to happen.</p>
<p>After all, as I said, it was the copilot who made things worse, as he was trained to act aggressive at the controls when facing sceneries related to weather, and a possible <em>airplane flaw</em> since Airbus admitted later in the investigation, that the A300 tails fin was too delicate. </p>
<p>If the copilot applied same reaction at a different situation, probably his plane would still crash.</p></div>		</li>
