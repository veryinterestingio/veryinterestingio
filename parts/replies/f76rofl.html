			<div class="markdown"><p>I started BC (Yaz) in my early 40’s to help treat menorrhagia as well as combat hormonal migraines. My side effects were clearer skin, lighter finer facial hair, and my breasts filled out from a nearly B to a robust Full B, breast tenderness, and minor weight gain. I went from 10 days of migraines to a couple at most and a very light and short period if I choose to have one. I wish I’d done it 10 years ago, but my husband had a vasectomy and BC had just never crossed my mind.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I wish to say as a straight guy, with greatest respect, I second this so much, you have no idea. Soulful voices (as I call them) make my knees go weak. Please never be self-conscious of your deep voice!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always had a hunch because of my body type (Broad shoulders, narrow hips, collect fat around the waist, build more muscle easily, deeper voice, etc). I didn't know for sure until I went into the dr with what I thought was a UTI and came out thinking it was ovarian cancer. I went to a specialist who said the thought of cancer arised because my test levels were high, however upon further testing she agreed that it was just a cyst and that my test levels were always high. (They thought the cyst was secreting test, as some tumors can do). The ovarian cyst was caused by the hormonal imbalance, not the other way around. You can find out rather easily from any run of the mill blood test.</p></div>		</li>
