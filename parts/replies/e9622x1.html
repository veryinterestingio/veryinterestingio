			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm being super picky, but the energy you're describing would likely be released as light of some wavelength. The poster above who mentioned jiggling caused by relieved tension is likely right. Jiggling makes sound. Relaxing energy levels makes light. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Energy can also be released via vibration instead of light. There's also the issue that only a specific range of energies being released results in photons with wavelengths we consider to be light being emitted.</p></div>		</li>
