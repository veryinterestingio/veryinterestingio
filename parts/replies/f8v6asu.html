<p>Bad smell or not, I was glad the CO2 system did it’s job.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Isn't 7000ppm way above the amount documented to reduce cognitive ability immensely? Sounds like a really stupid concentration to reach on a research sub....</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meant to reply earlier but must not have hit the button... Yes, you can feel 7000 ppm by the end of the day - fatigue, possible nausea, headache. There have never been any serious issues, and one program has logged &gt;5000 dives times 3 people per dive...</p>
<p>Re: cognitive ability, on ships we try to design systems and procedures such that one person making one dumb mistake can't cause a serious problem. I'd also wager that mariners are a hardier bunch than the general population, poor working conditions and sleep deprivation are the norm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most common exposure to CO2 scrubbers that the average joe will experience is in anaesthetic machines which function to keep you asleep and to artificially ventilate you during anaesthesia. A “circle circuit” recycles the expired gas, which consists of some oxygen, nitrogen, water vapour, CO2 and the expensive vaporised anaesthetic (only a small amount of the anaesthetic is actually metabolised so the exhaled anaesthetic concentration is similar to the inhaled). A small amount of oxygen is added to keep up with the oxygen consumption of the patient and the CO2 is removed using a mixture of sodium and calcium hydroxide (Together called soda lime). The actual reaction is CO2 + Ca(OH)2 → CaCO3 + H2O + heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very similar use case with diving with a re-breather, especially when depth and dive profile involve a gas mixture with Helium. Helium is not metabolized and is used as padding to reduce concentration of Nitrogen mostly. So instead of simply exhaling gas out rebreathers circulate while absorbing CO2 and adding a bit of oxygen. As far as I know they use Soda lime as absorbant:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soda_lime" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soda\_lime" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soda\_lime</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sofnolime is the commercial product we use in rebreather diving. There are specific &quot;formulas&quot; optimized for for scrubber material and although anesthetic machines use a similar product, they have different CO2 absorption properties and cannot be substituted. Rebreather divers have tried and &quot;failed&quot;.</p>

<p>What is interesting about CO2 scrubbing is its not a direct conversion. The datasheet details the 3 step reactions that occur but simply, water vapor and warmth are critical and in a short closed circuit rebreather loop, this is faciliated by the breath of the diver.   </p>
<p>Many modern rebreathers monitor the temperature of the &quot;scrubber stack&quot; and provide realtime feedback on the health of the scrubber stack by inferring tempature differences across the stack with overall CO2 absorption efficiency.  Direct CO2 sensors/measurement is very new and is slowly being introduced, but that does not take away the need to monitor scrubber stack/temperature performance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Helium isn't just padding -&gt; due to its high vapor pressure, it disproportionately &quot;uses up&quot; a liquids capacity to dissolve gasses. This means that even though trimix is only 1% helium, the amount of total gasses in your blood is decreased by a lot more than that.</p>
<p>Breathing He mixtures is a similar process as degassing solvents by bubbling He through them.</p></div>		</li>
