<p>Your brain/body thinks you need to respond to a physical threat. We've evolved really well to do that - your body sends blood to different groups of muscles, it prepares to cool you down from exertion, etc, because...call it crossed wires between 'emotional threat' and 'physical threat'; you get some terrible news but on some level your body misinterprets that you're about to get into fight or run from a predator because those are the threats that came up most often during our evolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The concept of a &quot;you&quot; separate from your body causes all sorts of misleading ideas. You, literally, are your body.</p>
<p>The best way I've heard it described is: &quot;YOU is what your brain does.&quot; The self awareness is a result of the way your brain works.</p>
<p>It's a constant feedback loop. You have thoughts and emotions that originate from bodily functions, and you have bodily functions that happen because of your thoughts. If you think about eating delicious food, the chemical makeup of your saliva will change.</p>
<p>So, yes, mental processes that you experience as thoughts and emotions can cause the body to damage itself because your thoughts can be part of a larger process that induces the body to do things that it is only supposed to for short bursts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically yes, though your brain may be misidentifying the source of the pain itself, as it's more likely the muscles in your chest that are tensing up and not any actual pain in your heart. In that sense you could be imagining that it's &quot;in&quot; your heart, but that doesn't invalidate what you're feeling</p></div>		</li>
