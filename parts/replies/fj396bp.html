			<div class="markdown"><p>For Proteins, it's broken down into (and taken up as) individual Amino Acids.</p>
<p>Starches become individual sugar molecules (like glucose).</p>
<p>Fats (triglyceride) are broken down into individual fatty acid chains, and individual glyceride molecules.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are several known cases where people suffer from genetic DNAse deficiency. They suffer &quot;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160617302221" target="_blank">a wide range of diseases, including lethal anemia, parakeratosis, cataracts and systemic lupus erythematosus</a>&quot;. Digestion of DNA/RNA molecules is not really studied there.</p>
<p>Even disregarding all of that, DNA/RNA molecules can't penetrate cell membranes without assistance (usually in the form of viruses, or specialized channels in cases where such travel is supposed to happen).</p>
<p>So if I were to speculate, I'd say without digestion, DNA and RNA molecules would simply flush through the digestive tract without ever getting absorbed into the body.</p></div>		</li>
