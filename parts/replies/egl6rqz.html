			<div class="markdown"><p>All mammals need dietary salts to function. Sodium and potassium salts are macronutrients that are mainly used for electrical conduction in muscles (so for growth and healing) but also for the immune system. Calcium salts are good for bones, hooves, fur, and antlers. </p>
<p>But the larger the animal the more salt is needed. I couldn't find anything about how much an average moose needs but for a comparison; an average person NEEDS ~0.2 grams of new sodium salts per day to stay alive (recommended is 1.5 grams for activity) while an average horse NEEDS ~10 grams a day to live (and ~20 grams for activity).
[google]</p>
<p>The huge difference between recommended and 'necessary to live' is mainly due to mammals' ability to concentrate urine and reabsorb salts when they are scarce in the diet. (Humans sweat a lot so our active requirement is really high).</p>
<p>Plants don't use sodium to move and so don't naturally concentrate sodium to a significant level (actually toxic to most plants).  Since moose are herbivores they have to find it somewhere else. Wild moose eat saltwater reeds and find natural salt licks in the ground so a salt covered road is a wonderful opportunity to satisfy a craving easily and it's reliably replaced by the people using the road. </p></div>		</li>
