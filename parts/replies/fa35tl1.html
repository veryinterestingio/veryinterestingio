			<div class="markdown"><p>Gold is extremely ductile, and is one of the better metals for making a very thin balloon. I kinda want to pick up some gold leaf and try it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or simply a balloon of absurd volume.</p>
<p>Volume increases much more rapidly than surface area so really the meaningful factor at play here is the structural integrity of gold to sustain a structure of a given size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn’t even think of OP meaning floating in air; I thought they were referring to a liquid, which actually happens.  I do inspections for a gold mine and they have a flash flotation cell as part of their process to extract gold from the ore.  It’s an amalgamation of chemicals, not just water, but they’re able to get some of the gold removed by floating it on bubbles they make while agitating it before they do the carbon-in-leach process.</p></div>		</li>
