			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth mentioning here one of the reasons we use AC electricity as our primary supply is that is can overcome loss of power over distance.  That is, the reason the big power lines use very high voltage is because you lose some potential work thru resistance in the wiring.  Bigger wires and higher voltage compensate for this.  Example: if I run a rack of efficient musical speaker amplifiers off 150 ft of extension cords, I lose enough power the amps will thermally protect themselves and take breaks.  If I plug directly into the wall, the amps will stay running.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is because AC used to be easier to step up and down in voltage by transformers. Now, DC can be stepped up and down efficiently so high voltage DC lines with lower losses than AC lines are completely fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add a bit to other responses:</p>
<p>The reason we use AC is because making an AC step up transformer was easy to do when electrical grids were being built, and step up high voltage DC transformers basically didn't exist.</p>
<p>Higher voltage = lower current = lower transmission losses</p>
<p>*&quot;However**</p>
<p>AC lines are also subject to losses due to impedence (like &quot;friction&quot; against a change in electrical current) that functionally don't exist in high voltage DC lines. Both AC and DC lines deal with power loss due to pure resistance, but only AC lines see any significant losses due to impedence. That is why (as I understand it, at least) the most efficient long-distance, high-power transmission lines are now built using absurdly high DC voltages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ohms law is applicable to DC as well. </p>
<p>Current * resistance = voltage</p>
<p>The wires have a fixed resistance, so we cant change that.</p>
<p>Power = current * voltage</p>
<p>Ok so we want a low current, so that we dont have a large voltage drop across the wire. That means to carry the same amount of power, we need a large voltage. But we need smaller (120V in the states) voltages at the house. AC can easily be stepped down at the destination.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I disagree. </p>
<p>The path from the power plant will always be shorter than the one from the sun. /s</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say it is more like a (closed at the bottom) vertical pipe with (load dependent variable sized) holes vertically above each other, with the PV inverter pouring in energy at the top, 'own home' being the lowest hole and the local substation the top hole.     </p>
<p>When 'own home' can't use all of it then the voltage increases (level rises) until it pours out the next hole above it (your neighbour).<br />
It's not much but there is a small I^(2).R voltage drop over the 'distribution' wire between the neighbours, which must be overcome to 'replace' the utility supply at you neighbour's house.    </p>
<p>And yes, if you plug a voltmeter into an outlet then you can see the the voltage increase during sunny periods, and if there is not enough 'load' for the PV-inverter (or other issue) then at +10% nominal* the PV-inverter will trip/disconnect on 'high voltage alarm'.      </p>
<p>*Country dependent, where I live with 230Vac nominal that's at 253V.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>High voltage, low voltage, harmonic issues, masked load, etc. Lots of little problems. Not knowing how much actually demand there is on the circuit is probably the biggest. You think you're going to make it through a summer peak, then a cloud rolls over or the inverters kick off for any number of reasons and suddenly you have several hundred more amps on the line... stuff can burn down real quick</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's still more complicated, even with batteries. Like I said, not impossible, just have to be more careful. Going to cost us a bit of money to have more and different types of equipment to handle it all, but money well spent imo. My company was all for it, spending millions, but then the fire nation attacked. And by that I mean all of California caught on fire... which is another huge and complicated issue</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't pointless in modest grid penetrations. It offsets other dispatchable generation, offsetting fuel costs. It's also pretty much build it and forget about it, at least compared to the amount of labor needed to run fossil plants. There's definitely a tipping point where it's pointless without batteries, but almost nobody is at that point.</p></div>		</li>
