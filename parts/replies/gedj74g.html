			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a physicist and I always assumed this was the technology behind, but there is something I never understood about these devices. The way I see it, it would require very precise spectrometer or a smart approach for converting the raw data into a temperature, because variations in the order of fractions of a degree lead to tiny changes in the blackbody radiation distribution.</p>
<p>It seems from your comment that you know what you're talking about. Could you care to add more hardcore technical details?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I'll start by saying I've never actually used one, but I plan to use one in the near future as part of an experimental setup so I've been reading a bit about it. <a href="http://pyrometry.com/pyrometry-info/environmental-interference/" target="_blank">This company</a> has some nice web pages and links to papers discussing the topic (obviously biased towards spectral pyrometry...)</p>
<p>Those are expensive and less common though. For <a href="https://www.flukeprocessinstruments.com/en-us/service-and-support/knowledge-center/infrared-technology/how-do-ratio-pyrometers-work" target="_blank">ratio pyrometers</a>, a common setup is to have two detectors stacked on top of each other, each sensitive to a different band of IR radiation. (I may be wrong but in some cases I think they are even the same detector, but the second one has a filter in front of it that blocks a portion of the spectrum.) Manufacturers sometimes list what the wavelength range is. Different devices, designed for different temperatures, often use different wavelengths because the ratio is more sensitive over a certain temperature range. (Also, at lower temperatures you have to worry about not getting enough signal so overall sensitivity is another aspect, which might push you to choose a different semiconductor or something.)</p>
<p>Anyway, for a given temperature, you can integrate Planck's law over the range of wavelengths the detector is sensitive to in order to get how much power is being released (per area per steradian). If you integrate over the two portions of the spectrum for your two detectors, you can predict what the ratio between them will be, in which case the absolute value doesn't matter. You can mess with that equation to see how sensitive the calculation is to slight inaccuracies in your respective power measurements.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I have this <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/kl5zbxbxfi" target="_blank">desmos graph</a> I made at some point when considering whether a particular pyrometer would work well for my application. It's kind of a mess and I don't remember the details, but basically those two bands represent the wavelengths specified by a particular manufacturer. In my case I was looking to add a dichroic mirror that would reflect a 1064nm laser that is being used to heat the sample while transmitting the relevant thermal radiation, coming back, to the pyrometer. Since a dichroic mirror has some transmission/reflection spectrum (the black dots compared to the ideal black curve) it would mess with the light reaching the detectors and change the resulting measurement a bit.</p>
<p>With a ratio pyrometer you have one &quot;fudge&quot; parameter you can change to account for optical effects, emissivity dispersion, etc. that would change the relative amounts of power, whereas with a spectral pyrometer you can calibrate it to the optics exactly by passing a known light source through it. One thing to note: even spectral pyrometers will be difficult to use if your object of interest had nonuniform temperature. For a uniform hot object on a cool background the power contributed by the cool thing is miniscule and can be ignored, but if the object itself has a gradient then you're integrating different blackbody spectra for every little area of the object and you have to have some model for it; there are still papers being written about this. It just so happens that my application is like this, since I'm heating a small spot to high temperatures with a laser...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer, really. Thank you.
More questions now start to pop in my head, but I now learned enough to find the answers easily. Also nice that I learned about desmos. Seems a neat tool.
I've worked with a crystal growth technique called laser floating zone. Just curious: are you working on a similar topic?</p></div>		</li>
