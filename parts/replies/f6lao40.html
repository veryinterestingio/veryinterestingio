<p>Tried it, didn't work. What else do I need to do?</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for all the advice! I was just being silly though. No bags. The person who said exercise and stop eating so much had the right answer in my case.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But seriously, I'm one of those people who always have deep bags under my eyes when I don't get enough sleep, and smaller but noticeable bags under my eyes when I do get enough sleep. Sometimes they don't show up, sometimes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This simply causes the blood vessels to constrict.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the dark circles are due to lack of sleep, you can try to apply a cold compress in the region to reduce the size of the vessels. </p>
<p>However, since you also said that already tried to sleep well and it didn't work, your case may not be lack of sleep. Instead, it may be excess of melanin in the region (which may be caused by genetics or by the environment). In this case, you may need to look for creams that reduce the pigments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who works nightshift, usually four 12-hour shifts, I have a hard time sleeping during the day no matter what. Weird thing is, if I take a short 30-minute nap on my shift, it will tide me over for the whole 12 hours off that I should be sleeping. I feel absolutely wired and can function normally, but I always start to get bad skin (acne) before I get the dark circles. I will probably sleep a total of 2 hours a day for 4 days but the first day off, I can easily sleep 15+ hours. I figure I'm paying my sleep debt.</p>
<p>Edit: in no way do I encourage this behavior or think it's healthy. I can function I but still feel terrible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should be careful man, losing so much sleep like that is very unhealthy. Sadly our bodies are not banks where we can accrue sleep debt or build up savings.</p>
<p>There have been lots of studies into how it affects our performance too. A big thing is that we are bad at judging our own level of alertness/performance and tend to overestimate ourselves, see: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4809494/" target="_blank">Prediction of Vigilant Attention and Cognitive Performance Using Self-Reported Alertness, Circadian Phase, Hours since Awakening, and Accumulated Sleep Loss</a></p>
<p>I know night shift work is hard/impossible to integrate into a normal sleep routine but you aren't getting away with under sleeping. Even the very rare cases of people who can sleep 4 hours a night and &quot;feel great&quot; usually end up with rapid cognitive decline in later life, e.g. Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher being famous ones who both ended with dementia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn, I thought my night shifts were bad. I do 4 10s and I love my schedule but sleep is def hard to come by. I'll fall asleep a little after I get home but only for like 4 hours. Then I'll wake up and KNOW I need to go back to sleep but my body will be, &quot;hey dummy its daytime&quot; and this is in a dark room. So I get up and then inevitably take a nap an hr before I need to leave and I wake up groggy. You have to be really disciplined to get proper sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do.</p>
<p>Everyone is human, and therefore no one is exempt from the things that make us human. Sleep deprivation more so refers to actual lack of sleep, not just sleeping for 4-6 hours per night. They won’t show the standard signs as frequently, if at all. These people, eventually, will need to catch up on missed sleep. In other words, they need to pay off their “sleep debt”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve read on the Internet that catching up on sleep is a fallacy and actually counter productive,m. The solution is to simply improve sleep hygiene. Adding the hours you missed to a full nights sleep(say you slept 6 hours instead of 8 so you sleep 10 the next day) is not conducive to improving wakefulness. The Internet never lies so this must be true and you must be wrong
