			<div class="markdown"><p>my left eye is so bad even with glasses that unless i close my right eye i am fairly sure my brain just ignores it except for the part of my vision that my right eye canâ€™t see. i have 0 depth perception because of it. to give you an idea let us assume that with glasses my right eye is 20/20, which it obviously should be but my prescription might be a little old, that would make my left eye something like 5/20. if i am sitting in a car ANYTHING outside of the care is blurry to my left eye while my right eye can see and read mostly as well as normal i think. without glasses it has to be inches away from my face to read it with my left eye. but i can hold something at arms length and read it using my right eye with some effort.</p></div>		</li>
