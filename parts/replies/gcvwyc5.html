			<div class="markdown"><p>Cooked food has more readily available nutrients for us to absorb. This means that you can get more energy and nutrients from less food if you cook it. The process of cooking is like beginning the breakdown process of food outside the body. </p>
<p>When you have more nutrients available, you can sustain a larger brain. The human brain accounts for about 20% of our energy usage, that is to say, they’re metabolically very expensive. If you don’t have the surplus energy available to sustain a brain, then you’re less likely to develop it in an evolutionary sense. </p>
<p>So, cooked food = bigger brain (in a roundabout way)</p>
<p>Edit 20% not 40%</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, I guess &quot;not regular&quot; is kind of off the top of my head. I figured wildfires weren't an everyday occurrence, but then again I also don't know how often homo erectus/habilis ate meat in general, so I don't have the knowledge to say how much of their meat diet could have been naturally burnt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2mya is definitely the most ouside estimate. There are some chewed up charred bones here and there between 1mya and 2mya, but very few archaeologists in my experience actually think it's evidence of hearth building. There starts to be more signs of cooked foods in concentrated areas around 700,000 or 800,000 years ago, but even that is still somewhat questionable. The first clear evidence of hearths isn't until 300-400kya.</p></div>		</li>

<p>2 million seems cool, I would love to see a source.</p>
