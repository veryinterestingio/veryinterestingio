			<div class="markdown"><p>You should never just take someone's word for it, and it's part of the sub-rules. :) </p>
<p>I'm happy to find sources, I ended up reading a lot about elephant anatomy in the process. For example, they do not have a pleural cavity as most mammals do. The pleural cavity allows lung volume to change with the thoracic cavity volume. An elephant's lungs are actually attached to the chest wall, so inflating the lungs is reliant on chest musculature not negative pressure like our lungs. </p>
<p>While I knew the basics, this deep dive has been an excellent learning experience for me as well!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow that's amazing. Is crazy to think they don't have pleural cavity.</p>
<p>Is that in the book?</p>
<p>What to read about it.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what having a pleurodesis does to your chest/lung! Had a spontaneous lung collapse a few years ago and it was severe enough I needed that procedure. They used to do it with talc but apparently more recently they agitate the chest a different way to get it to adhere.</p>
<p>Either way it's really interesting to hear about the plural cavity outside of my little experience - I like informing people (when it comes up) of how our lungs actually use negative pressure and it's not just use expanding our chest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question - what about horses and rabbits makes them an obligate <del>basal</del> nasal breather? I mean from an evolutionary sense having an esophagus and a trachea be separated seems like a good idea but then again so many land mammals can breathe through their mouths so it can’t be a huge advantage.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5483604/" target="_blank">Excellent article about horses here:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>2.1. Upper Airway Anatomy and Obligate Nasal Breathing</strong></p>
<p>The upper airway of the horse includes the nostrils, nasal passages separated by the nasal septum, paired paranasal sinuses and guttural pouches, and the nasopharynx which extends from the nasal passages to the trachea [42]. The nasopharynx is located dorsal to the soft palate, which separates it from the oropharynx; the soft palate is the anatomical extension of the roof of the mouth (the hard palate) and extends from the end of the hard palate to the larynx (Figure 1 and Figure 2) [42]. It is tightly apposed to the base of the larynx, so that there is usually no communication between the nasopharynx and oropharynx, thereby obliging the horse to breathe through its nose; i.e., it is an obligate nasal breather [43]. Oral breathing can occur, but usually only when anatomical abnormalities or disruptive conditions such as dorsal displacement of the soft palate are present. The horse cannot breathe or exercise normally under these circumstances [42]. Swallowing disengages the larynx and the soft palate, allowing food and water to pass from the oropharynx into the oesophagus (Figure 2).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21601814" target="_blank">And a short explanation about rabbits here:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rabbits are obligate nose breathers due to their epiglottis positioned rostrally to the soft palate. Any obstruction within the nasal cavity will produce a respiratory wheeze with increased respiratory effort. Respiratory diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in rabbits. This article focuses on these diseases and their causative pathogens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3435269/" target="_blank">And rodents:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, in so-called ‘obligate nasal breathers’ such as rodents (as well as rabbits, horses and even human infants) the upper air passage actually meets the slightly elevated epiglottis in the nasopharyngeal area, thereby not sharing a common pathway with the food in the oropharynx</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting.  Even dolphins aren't <em>entirely</em> obligate nostril breathers, and their larynx (called a goosebeak) protrudes past the soft palate and is sealed by a sphincter!  Handy if you live in the water.   But a few dolphins have been found with some anatomical problem preventing their nostrils from functioning properly and disengage this system to breathe through their mouth, although it's definitely not something they do ordinarily.</p>
<p>I wonder what the driving selective pressure is in rabbits and horses.  Maybe the ability to breathe while grazing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is very interesting. I breed rats and they can be a bit prone to respiratory issues, I wonder if it's related.</p></div>		</li>
