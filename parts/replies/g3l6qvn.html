Being on the verge of pissing myself makes me zero nervous about the actual interview and have landed me jobs with an impressive sucessrate. Yeah, focusing on other things is sometimes a good hack.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have PTSD. I have a lot of noise in my head. If I want to really concentrate on a lecture or a movie or something, I take out my knitting or cross stitch. Letting part of my mind focus on that lets me put the rest of my mind on the topic at hand. </p>
