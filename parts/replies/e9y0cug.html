			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this; syrup is a “shear thinning” fluid, albeit a very viscous one. That is, the viscosity decreases as shear strain increases. An extreme example of this is honey, which would flow very very slowly out of a bottle tipped upside down but spreads easily once it starts getting elongated outward.</p>
<p>(I am pretty sure syrup would be a liquid, as states of matter go, because it is dissolved sugar in water, there isn’t any suspension; this probably holds for honey, too)</p></div>		</li>
