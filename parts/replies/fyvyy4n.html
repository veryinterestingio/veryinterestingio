<p>That would make a great deal of sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, and stuff you blow up doesn't just disappear, you still have to find a way to scoop it out of the hole after you kaboom it. Which is where you run into the same problem drills have. The hole is too hot and under too much pressure to get a tool down it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would there be some way to pipe in water to cool the softer material and create a type of shell?</p>
<p>Maybe manufacturer a shell out of something hard and heat resist.</p>
<p>Any of these shower thoughts seem feasible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to correct some expectations, /u/rhomboidus said that the rock would behave &quot;like a liquid&quot;, which is right, but they didn't mean that it was like molten flowing lava.</p>
<p>The pressure forces on the rock are so great that even though it's nowhere near molten, the rock slowly creeps in from the sides to fill the hole.  Imagine drilling a hole in clay, or bread dough.  Often this creep can take days or weeks to occur, but even so the rock flows in faster than the drill can cut it away, and eventually traps the drill in the hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for clearing that up. Would all of this rock be igneous granite all the way through, or is the crust made up of various types of rock?</p></div>		</li>
