<p>Why is this the case? I understand that it's more efficient to grab more air and push it down slower than less air and push it down faster for the same amount of lift (turbofan vs turbojet, due to the v^2 in E = 1/2mv^2). However surely as long as the tip speed of the props is the same they're equally energy-efficient, regardless of their size? The multi-rotors may have smaller props that do not generate enough lift, even when combined, so they have to spin at higher tip speed than a helicopter. Is that why?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have sound logic, but that's not how air behaves.    </p>
<p>So lets toss out the &quot;prop&quot; thing, and go with &quot;a wing&quot;.  Wings attempt to grab air, and throw it somewhere.  When it does this, there's leakage around the tips.  This leakage reduces the pressure differential across the wing, making the wing tips generate less lift.  The amount of lift that a section of wing makes, is proportional to both it's position spanwise (how close to teh tip it is), and it's length (chord).  The closer you are to the tips of a wing, the more air spills over the edge, and the less effective that part of the wing is.    </p>
<p>There's a few things that are done to counteract that effect, but that's probally not useful for our disucussion here.    </p>
<p>The part of a propellor that's making the most lift, varies based on incoming air velocity, but for the most part, the rules are the same.  The closer you get to the tip, the less efficent that part of the blade is.  Efficent airplane propellors follow the same rules as wings, and they get narrower towards the tips.    </p>
<p>Amusingly, because they're traveling faster, propeller tips can also be used to make a LOT of thrust, but it's also wasteful.  In quadcopters you can buy what's called &quot;bullnose&quot; props, and while you get more thrust, your efficiency drops greatly, by tens of percent.  Now, these tip losses happen at EVERY tip, so the fewer tips you can have, the better.  (Yes, planes have, and do fly with single blade props!)  </p>
<p>What's most important in propeller efficiency, is swept area, not tip speed.  So bigger disks always win out.  Slower, is often better!  Not so much at model sizes, but in real helicopters, you can start to run into ultimate speed problems, where the tips of the props are starting to operate in the mach range, at that point, everything goes very pear shaped, and efficency goes way, way down.    </p>
<p>So, to disassemble my statement, i was attempting to cover the reality of a quadcopter.  Quads typically fly in nearly still air, so they're not in a good spot efficiency wise. They also have high airflow speeds through their rotor disks.  This means the air approaching the hub of the prop is moving pretty slow, and may not work with the prop.  They also have thsoe nasty tip losses, as all props have.  So the most effective part of the prop is going to be somewhere in the middle.    </p>
<p>On a fast moving rotor disk, even the blade area near the hub is contributing to lift.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One correction to note: the inner 20-30% of a helicopter rotor contributes nearly negligible lift, because they are not twisted like propellers and high twist is bad for edgewise flight. Lift per unit span on a helicopter blade is quadratic with blade station until you get close to the tip. Tip effects tend to dominate only on the outer 10-20% of the blade. </p>
<p>On a side note, it's kinda helpful for a helicopter, anyway, since the body is underneath the inner portion of the rotor. </p></div>		</li>

<p>You have a very poor understanting of wings and lift. </p>
<p>Also a helicopter with an engine out doesn't become a glider, it becomes a brick with a parachute. That could mostly work in low wind conditions (you spin up the blades from falling and reverse the angle of attack in the last second to use the kinetic energy to get temporary lift and slow down before hitting the ground).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ex-Helicopter rotor design engineer here. Thank you for answering the question correctly regarding efficiency of fluid momentum transfer.</p>
<p>Just to clarify the wingtip explanation, the tip edges mix up the air and that mixing takes energy in the form of fuel. But the fastest part of of the blade (wing) is actually the tip, so the sweet spot for maximum lift is around the 3/4 span.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. He had me kinda twisted with that &quot;fastest part&quot; bit. I was like ummm if u swing a straight stick, the tip will be the fastest portion. (It will also be the noisiest lossiest portion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The grand advantage to multirotors is simplicity.  Once you throw variable pitch at it, you might as well just have a helicopter.  Because the RC community doesn't care about &quot;sane&quot;, we've built quadcopters with collective pitch instead of rpm control.  They work well, but have all the disadvantages of helicopters, AND quadcopters, with the only upside, of the ability to autorotate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weight and complexity. </p>
<p>You get all the downsides and few of the upsides. The blades don't have enough mass to maintain stable autorotation, all the gears etc are duplicates for each rotor set, there's even more to go wrong, etc.</p></div>		</li>
