			<div class="markdown"><p>What does it mean to ionize?</p>
<p>Edit Via Wikipedia </p>
<p>Ionization or ionisation, is the process by which an atom or a molecule acquires a negative or positive charge by gaining or losing electrons, often in conjunction with other chemical changes. The resulting electrically charged atom or molecule is called an ion. Ionization can result from the loss of an electron after collisions with subatomic particles, collisions with other atoms, molecules and ions, or through the interaction with electromagnetic radiation. Heterolytic bond cleavage and heterolytic substitution reactions can result in the formation of ion pairs. Ionization can occur through radioactive decay by the internal conversion process, in which an excited nucleus transfers its energy to one of the inner-shell electrons causing it to be ejected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The quick and dirty layman's explanation is that air can be turned from an insulator into a conductor by using a high enough voltage, creating an arc in the air. As the current flows through the air, it dumps a <em>ton</em> of energy into the air that it's passing through. This air gets rid of that energy by emitting light and heat. That light just happens to be bluish for nitrogen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not simply temperature</p>
<p>Black body blue starts to occur at 6000-7000K. Blue flames dont come from black body radiation but complete combustion. Less complete combustion prosuces more red/yellow flames.</p>
<p>Chemical reactions can also cause change in flame color.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The colors of a typical hydrocarbon flame (e.g. from burning wood, candles, fossil fuels, etc, basically anything you'd ever see on fire outside of a lab) get their colors for similar reasons.</p>
<p>If you've ever heard of fire being &quot;a plasma&quot;, that's usually only true of the bluish part. You only see the bluish part of a flame in day to day life if it's a flame that's burning very cleanly, like straight out of a well-oxygenated bunsen burner, or some gas-powered home utility such as a cooking/range, furnace, or water heater.</p>
<p>Some explanations will tell you flames glows blue because that part of the flame is hottest, and hot things glow blue instead of orange. Hot things glowing different colors based on temperature going from red to yellow to blue to white is a real thing, it's called blackbody radiation, but in a basic hydrocarbon fire things aren't nearly hot enough for the blue end to come into play.</p>
<p>Instead, the heat of the reaction is ionizing the things you burned. Usually carbon and carbon compounds. Different elements and compounds glow with different spectra and thus can have unexpectedly weird flame colors. This is how fireworks get their pretty colors, by the way -- they're laced with small quantities of very specific elements that burn with a desired color.</p>
<p>Most all of the things produced in a basic hydrocarbon flame create strong bluish spectra at common flame temperature. It's the same process that's making the nitrogen in an electrical arc glow violet, except electrical arcs are <em>way, way</em> hotter than a basic flame (something like ten times hotter than a propane torch flame). A hydrocarbon fire is nowhere near hot enough to make nitrogen glow this way. The similarity in color is a coincidence.</p>
<p>What's the yellow/orange part, then? It's fine soot in the air, glowing red-hot. Flame reactions are chaotic. Bits of whatever you're burning are being slowly vaporized into the air from all the heat. They get kicked off going so fast that they might bump into oxygen in the air and they'll react, releasing even more energy and vaporizing more stuff. That's what burning <em>is</em>. If you don't have enough oxygen present in the chaos, sometimes large chunks (relatively speaking) will get blasted off and won't find any oxygen to react with. Without that massive heat kick, it doesn't glow from ionization. Instead, it just glows with basic blackbody radiation, which at typical flame temperatures is an orangish-yellow. Electrical sparks are mostly the same thing. The only difference being that it's the metal itself that is the fuel, instead of a hydrocarbon.</p>
<p>Now, a side tangent about metals:</p>
<p>One wouldn't normally think of metal as a thing that &quot;burns&quot; in quite the same way a hydrocarbon fuel source would, but that's seriously underestimating the promiscuity of oxygen. Shit will attack damn near anything. The only reason all the metal on earth isn't constantly on fire all the time is because the surface of every metal on earth that reacts with oxygen already has a thin crust of &quot;spent&quot; material on it, forming an airtight seal. If you scrape this layer off, the fresh exposed metal you leave behind will come into contact with the air and will oxidize instantly. This is why metal things spark when scraped. It's also how flint and steel works to start fires -- the &quot;flint&quot; part has nothing to do with it being flint specifically, flint was just a very common, very hard mineral that was hard enough to strike steel to scratch it. These flecked off bits of steel would oxidize instantly, creating hot sparks that can be used to ignite tinder.</p>
<p>This &quot;crust&quot; of spent fuel on the surfaces of metals is also why welding, well, needs to exist at all. I'm not a welder, I'm not even going to pretend I know any of the intricacies of welding as an artform or profession, but in a very tough nutshell, welding is a game of trying to get the inner pure bits of two metal pieces to touch, while keeping oxygen out. If two pieces of pure metal in a vacuum touched, they would weld instantly. This is called &quot;cold welding&quot;. But since we live on Earth, with all this pesky oxygen everywhere trying to screw it up, we have to get crafty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not the oxygen is promiscuous, it’s that it’s extremely unstable and has an insanely high bond energy, at least as it exists in the atmosphere (O2). Oxygen brings most of the energy to combustion reactions, and FWIW the critical energetic reactions that power is as humans.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Poetically speaking, what's the difference? This is ELI5, not /r/askscience. Diatomic oxygen's high reactivity causes it to very eagerly bond with just about anything that can accept or lose electrons, thus, it's pretty talented at hooking up with lots of different elements and compounds. There's a reason the entire process of giving up free electrons is named after it, <em>oxi</em>dation. Isn't that what promiscuity means, sleeping around with many partners?</p></div>		</li>
