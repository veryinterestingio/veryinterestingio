			<div class="markdown"><p>Smoke inhalation of any sort is bad. COPD has been described in women from resource poor nations who cook over a fire. While nicotine and some of its byproducts are carcinogens, the greatest danger is from Inhaled products of combustion.</p>
<p>Cigars are typically puffed in the cheeks with minimal inhalation, which reduces some of the potential damage. Also, few people smoke a case of cigars per day.</p>
<p>Smoking marijuana can also result in emphysema, bullous lung disease, and COPD, since most people take a deep drag and hold it, which results in about 4-10 times the amount of tar as a typical cigarette drag.</p>
<p>As for the people who don't die, there are some people who smoked a lot and never develop lung disease. There are people with COPD or emphysema who survive a long time despite continuing to smoke. We're built with a lot of redundancy, and can survive with one lung. I've seen people with emphysema so bad, they were absorbing 20 percent of the amount of oxygen that they should have (DLCO) with saturations in the low 90s. I've seen people with lung function of 30 percent of the air they should be moving (FEV1), still doing well.</p>
<p>The diseased lobules of the lung get worse ventilation, and therefore the smoke may affect the healthier parts of a COPD'er's lungs.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If nicotine is burned or vaped, it produces several carcinogenic compounds. There is debate in whether pure nicotine is carcinogenic, but it's a moot point, since every method we have of delivering it is associated with cancer (inhaling, chewing, snorting)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about vaping? I have a pretty good sense that it is better than smoking anything by quite a bit, but my guess is that it still causes some inflammation and puts some extra strain on the lungs. The research is not in, and we don't have a lot of evidence yet, but I would think that we could at least speculate at this point. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference is the penetrating aspects of combusted organic material compared to what can be essentially described as steam.</p>
<p>Combustion breaks down chemicals to a very fine gaseous state, vapor is much thicker. For example, nicotine enters your body through your lungs when smoking a cigarette, where as with vapor is too thick to be absorbed by the lungs, nicotine mostly enters through your mouth and throat via saliva.</p>
<p>There is also substantially more chemicals in a cigarette. Of course it would be naive for anyone to assume vaping is perfectly safe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct. Vaping is probably safer, since there is no combustion. You do inhale volatile organic compounds, which can cause cancer, and the humectant in vape that gives the fog effect can cause lipoid pneumonia. There are no good long term studies, since vaping has only recently increased in popularity.</p>
<p>The studies that have been done suggest most people who try to vape to quit smoking end up vaping and still smoking, and the majority of papers will upgrade to more powerful heating elements and more concentrated nicotine, which can end up becoming more dangerous.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm assuming the mixture plays a part in that?  </p>
<p>What about pure marijuana, any idea?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What mixture? Tar is produced by heating organic material.</p>
<p>You know that black resin build up you get inside your bowl?  That's tar</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't the marijuana that's the big problem. It's the smoke, and the respiratory maneuver used to maximize the effect. If you smoked a joint like a cigarette, you'd get less effect, and get less damage.
No one has studied the effects of &quot;pure&quot; vs. diluted marijuana.
THC is actually a mild bronchodilator, but smoke will cause bronchoconstriction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cigars aren't inhaled, so you would have no effect on your lungs. Cigar smokers do have an increased rate of mouth and throat cancers, but I don't know how long you would need to quit for to return to the same rate as someone that never smoked cigars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What??? Not trying to like gatekeep cigars or anything, but you never inhale a cigar. It's just a mouth and slight throat puff. Especially when you smoke big butts that are like an inch in diameter, you'd get a massive headache and probably throw up from the nicotine influx if you tried to inhale that. </p></div>		</li>
