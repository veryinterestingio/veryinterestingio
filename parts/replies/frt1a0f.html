			<div class="markdown"><p>Would love your opinion on this - I feel isolated from my mother who I’m usually very close with because I can’t bring myself to tell her I think her new boyfriend is super obnoxious and I wish he’d stop being there for all our phone calls. She’s so happy, so not telling her feels like the kind thing to do. But if I do tell her, that risks permanently altering our bond since she will most definitely tell him and it will likely hurt her feelings. This has been going on 2 years. Thoughts? “Bottling up” this feeling isn’t that terrible for me, just slightly annoying and I feel more distant from her.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try writing down your feelings. Write a letter to your mother, spilling everything (do not send it). And just let yourself process things out. No one can tell you the right or wrong of sharing criticism like this. But it sounds like you've been following the best advice, kindness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a great idea. I’ll work on the phrasing. But he is very obviously trying super hard (he may sense that I don’t like him) and is always being extra over the top nice to me and going out of his way to send me “funny” memes via email, joining my mom when we FaceTime etc. I’m not sure how to politely tell him I really wish I never had to interact with him at all haha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;She's so happy&quot;. It's not unreasonable to ask her to have some time just the two of you. It may be selfish to hate on someone who makes her happy just because you think he's obnoxious. Sometimes supporting the people we love involves some tolerance on our part. But you have every right to tell her what you need for your relationship with her. If that means keeping him off the phone and giving the two of you a chance to talk in private, that's completely reasonable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely hear where you’re coming from. I just feel that I would be happier if I never had to interact with him at all. I find him disingenuous and rude. There’s obviously a threshold of how much I can tolerate but I wish at times I could just be honest with her and not have to “put up” with him and fake smile at him ever again. Luckily they live in another country so it’s just phone/FaceTime/emails.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That last paragraph you wrote is spot on. You cycle certain thoughts (especially when you don't realise it) which becomes the norm for your day to day narrative, and eventually your life. You start to see withdrawing as the most effective way of dealing with stress or problems and then that cycle repeats. Until you've withdrawn so much (over years and without realising) that you find you struggle to connect with your own emotions and other people in general.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm at that stage in the last sentence. It's not fun, learn to deal with emotions and not bottle them up. Young people in this thread, really think about this information here, it will help you be more happy in general.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To build on why bottling thoughts can be unhealthy physiologically is because mental health is connected to hormones, affecting the actual health of your body. For example, testosterone and estrogen can have triggers based on brain activity and stimuli, and is often affected by depression, suicidal thoughts, PTSD, etc. Testosterone and estrogen is tied to cortisol levels, and if cortisol is elevated, that comes with high blood pressure and stress on your circadian system and heart.</p></div>		</li>
