<p>It's mathematically equivalent to say that the car is perfectly still and the road is moving underneath of it. </p>
<p>One of my favorite facts is that if you assume the Earth is completely stationary, and the rest of the universe rotates around it, the math still gives Earth the same rotational bulge in the middle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting.  I imagine it's because, where the Earth is taken to be stationary, the mass of the universe rotating around it exerts a pull
on the Earth, deforming it into an oblate spheroid (analogous to the tidal bulge created by the moon except uniform).  Is that how the math plays out?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If he means a change of coordinate system then the math plays out the exact same as in a euclidean (the &quot;standard&quot; x,y,z system most people know of) coordinate system because the only thing that changes is the mathematical language used to describe positions. In this case a rotating spherical coordinate system with its origin at the earths center of mass. </p>
<p>If he meant a change in frame of reference then fictitious forces come into play. A stationary ball in a nonaccelerating (inertial) frame of reference is only subjected to the gravitational force and the normal force (the force of the ground on the ball i.e. the exact opposite to the gravitational force). In an accelerating (non-inertial) frame of reference it would appear as though the ball was being pushed backward by some ghostly force. This force is the exact opposite to the one which would be applied to the ball if it had the exact same acceleration as the frame of reference in an inertial FoR.</p>
<p>In the case of a rotating FoR, the ficticious force would point away from the origin, since rotation is an acceleration towards the center of rotation. This force would cause the earth to bulge from such a frame of reference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I reckon it's because the equatorial regions of the universe are moving rapidly around the Earth, and that velocity/inward acceleration manifests as extra relativistic mass with it's own gravitational pull. Meanwhile, the polar regions are mostly stationary and only act with their rest mass.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I know youâ€™re right and I also understand all the math and physics behind this. But I also am still puzzled about how it works this way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The high-level answer is that there is no fixed reference frame, because velocity can only be measured in relation to another object. Acceleration, OTOH, is a quality intrinsic to a single object. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the choice of reference frame. If a car is perfectly still and the road is moving underneath it, the reference frame is moving with the car. Imagine it being stuck to the car. In this reference frame the car never moves anywhere. Everything around it does instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if you are traveling 90 mph and hold your hand outside with a baseball. Why does it seem like in throwing the baseball it keeps going, but in the car if you drop it,  it would just fall straight down? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would fall straight down at 9.81m/s per second plus forward at whatever speed the car is going.  When you drop the ball in the car, it's still moving forward alot, it's just that the car is also moving forward.  The movements cancel each other out from your frame of reference.</p>
<p>Now if you dropped the ball inside the car while you were accelerating (fast enough to notice it because there is not much room in a car for long observations) you would notice that the ball goes towards the back of the car.</p>
<p>The reason being, it's going forward as fast as the car is while it's connected to the car (connected meaning ball-to-arm, to body, to seat, to car frame), but when you release it and the car suddenly goes faster than it did while the ball was connected to it, you will clearly notice the ball can't keep up with the car anymore, and moves to the back. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if I understand what you mean, but I'll try to explain what happens.</p>
<p>If you drop it inside the car, it looks like it's falling straight down because your eyes are  moving at 90mph along with the car and the ball.</p>
<p>If you drop the ball outside of the car, the second you let it go it will be going 90mph in the direction the car is going, but will start to slow down because of air resistance (since it's not being pushed forward by the car's engine anymore), if you're inside the car this makes it look like it's going backwards, but if you were standing outside of the car you would see the ball actually keeps moving forward, just not as fast as the car.</p>
<p>If you mean that when you drop it outside it seems to keep moving forward, that's probably because when you look outside you instinctively take something stationary as reference, so the balls seems to be moving quickly, but when you're looking inside the car your references (probably your hand or the back of the seat or whatever) are moving at 90mph too, so the ball moving at 90mph seems like it doesn't move</p></div>		</li>
