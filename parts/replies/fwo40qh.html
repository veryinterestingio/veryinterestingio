			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to mention that, my old boss lived in a high rise on the Gold Coast here in Australia, he was 12th floor and had never had a mosquito or fly, they had a resteraunt/bar etc for the residents and he asked them whether they had any.
His consensus was they were rare from 3rd to 5th floor and virtually unknown above that.
He used to get praying mantises, ladybirds and the odd cockroach though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Could be the breeze just makes it inconvenient for the bugs who decide easier prey is closer to the surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I used to not be able to open the windows at night in my 6th floor apartment during Uni in 2009.</p>
<p>I now live just a mile away from that apartment on the 2.5 floor.</p>
<p>I can open the window with lights on all I want. Virtually zero midges comming in.</p>
<p>The change has been extremely drastic.</p>
<p>Total insect population has been down over 70% in Germany, and even worse in cities.</p>
<p>Even during the day you'd use to get regular house flies and stuff buzzing in and getting stuck.</p>
<p>Had a single wasp find its way inside in the last 2 years of living here.</p>
<p>The change is completely unbelievable.</p>
<p>I bought the same model of car as my parents used to have during my childhood. One trip on the autobahn in summer and the front was plastered in insects.</p>
<p>The same car 15 years later? A couple of hits at best.</p></div>		</li>
