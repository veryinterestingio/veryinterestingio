			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference between the Panama and Suez canals is that the Suez canal has no locks, the entire canal is at sea level, with no physical barriers anywhere. Panama has several locks, as well as a freshwater lake in the middle, which makes it more difficult for some species to cross over, but several species of fish have been found to have crossed from the east side to the west side and vice versa, and an invasive crab species has been found in the lakes that feed the locks. In addition, the ships that pass through can also carry invasive organisms in their water tanks and on their hulls, and can carry them to every port they visit, though that problem is not particular to canals.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Funny little detail about the Panama Canal: the Atlantic/Caribbean side is actually to the farther to the WEST than the Pacific side!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>United States has a relatively new law that all vessels (barring some exceptions that depend on last dome dry dock etc) must have a ballast water treatment system on board. Same will be in Europe soon. That should help</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but less of an effect because the Panama Canal is less of a canal and more like a series of locks that pass through a fresh water lake. The lake water kills most, but not all, of the oceanic species hitching a ride on the ships. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what most canals are. A lockless canal is unusual - part of the point of a lock is that it makes use of a relatively small amount of water to create a waterway that doesn't otherwise exist - if it flowed freely it would require vastly more water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Less so because the Panama canal climbs 85ft to the large fresh water lake Gatun, and then back down.</p>
<p>There is a small section at the end of the Lessepsian migration article linked above that discusses Panama.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is part of this also due to the size?  Panama connects the Pacific and Atlantic, while Suez connects the Red and Mediterranean.  </p>
<p>The Red Sea is almost sectioned off by that strait between Yemen and Eritrea, and the Mediterranean is also sectioned off by the Dardanelles and Gibraltar.  </p>
<p>I would imagine that whatever lives in the Pacific and Atlantic is receiving constant competition/migration from everywhere, so whatever comes across Panama would be of lesser consequence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While working at our local oil terminal in my native Shetland Isles, I noticed the sea was full of tiny bright blue 'neon' fish. I managed to scoop one up (they were very tired and almost lifeless) and took it to the office hoping to identify the species. It turned out it was a tropical fish, much like one you'd buy in a pet shop for your fish tank. It had very likely arrived from the ballast water discharged from an oil tanker that had been filling up the day before. That tanker had been all over the world, the fish could have come from anywhere. It opened my eyes to the possibility of introducing invasive species to fragile habitats. I believe there are rules and regs on ballast water that require the ships to 'refresh' the water every so often on a long journey, so as to avoid transporting sea-life any great distance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Way too long ago, 1991 or so. Long before we all had cameras 24/7, so sorry no pics. But iirc.... they were about 25-40mm long, quite slim and very pointy head, black/very dark dorsal, really bright neon blue stripe along both sides. And as I said they were almost dead, obviously not used to the cold Shetland waters.</p></div>		</li>
