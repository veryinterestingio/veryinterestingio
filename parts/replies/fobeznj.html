<p>I'd point out that Tetanus is bacterial and you never clear Herpes or HIV so you don't really acquire it again, I think in the case of HSV when you get one type of it then you become immune to the other type though so that is providing a sort of immunity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t believe this is true for HSV 1 &amp; 2. The two are genetically similar enough that you may gain some antibody protection but that doesn’t guarantee immunity. From what I have read about 40% of people who have HSV2 also contract HSV1. Not sure what those numbers are in the reverse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a different strain though. The original question was more about clearing and getting reinfected with the same strain of a virus because you didn’t develop immunity, as some people are suggesting may happen with the coronavirus.</p></div>		</li>
