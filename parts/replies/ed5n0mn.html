			<div class="markdown"><p>Blue eyes in humans only evolved about 10,000 years ago and then spread like wildfire. The likelihood of this being down to higher survival is quite small - it's probably just because blue eyes were seen as being more attractive in a mate. I would guess brown eyes were the default and the other colours are the equivalent of a peacocks feathers: good for standing out in the crowd when the opposite is looking to find a sexual partner.</p></div>		</li>
