			<div class="markdown"><p>This. And Microsoft spent a *lot* of money to market that fact. </p>
<p>Today we're pretty used to large software companies having sophisticated marketing programs today but that didn't used to be normal. Apple was well known for being *far* more consumer-friendly than virtually everyone else, Microsoft included. Windows 95's launch was a huge public consumer-facing spectacle, really the first of it's kind for any OS other than Mac and a major change of direction for Microsoft.</p>
<p>And, even if you're used to command-line software, DOS sucked. It's very difficult to overstate the usability jump from Windows 3.1 to Windows95. Windows95 was the first PC OS that normal people could realistically install and run without special instructions. Given that Microsoft still had dominant market share, this bridged a whole ton of people who didn't have PCs into computing. It's not a coincidence that the huge rise in personal/social/consumer internet use blew up at the same time. Setting up a working internet browser on Windows 3.1 dialup was *hard*...trumpet winsock anybody?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This should be higher - getting internet prior to win95 was a pain in the ass - which is why AOL was so popular.  Win95 allowed people to connect directly to the internet easier, which is why AOL started to decline after that.</p></div>		</li>
