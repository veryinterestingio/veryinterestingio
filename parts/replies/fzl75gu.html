<p>I've never been Mormon, but my wife was born into it and now happily out of it. I learned everything I could about it to help her along the way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to what has already been shared, the doctrine that answers these questions is called the plan of salvation.</p>
<p>If you don't want to look too deeply into it, it essentially boils down to (in my opinion):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>lived with God as spirit children before earth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>came here to get a body like God</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>life is a test of a sort</p>
</li>
<li>depending on our grade we have the potential to become like God</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p>Our spirits “live” and exist in what is referred to as The Spirit World where we live with all the other bajillions of other spirits before it is our time to come to earth.</p>
</li>
<li>The belief is that we were “created in the image of our father”, God. So basically God is a bipedal organism. (So are our spirits). That is why Adam and Eve were created the way they were</li>
