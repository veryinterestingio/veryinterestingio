			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny story: When I bought my house, the first thing I did (as all new homeowners should) was went out and bought new locks for the doors. The hardware store didn't have any multi-door sets with the same keys, so I had to get different sets for the front and back door.</p>
<p>Imagine my shock when the same key fit both locks. I suspect it had something to do with the factory shipping out lots of doorknobs with the same keying in them, but it was still weird to buy two completely separate doorknob kits that both used the exact same pin combinations.</p></div>		</li>

Also, you can just bring locks to a locksmith to rekey them. At my shop we would charge around $8 per lock</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was in management at a door, window, custom stair. and millwork supplier to the home building industry.. We sold countless thousands of door knobs a year. We only stocked four key options. Most builders and tradesmen customers of ours were aware of that fact. As a result, a huge percentage  of new homes in the area could be unlocked by most local tradespeople, builders and material delivery companies, who had the set of four keys. This fact was never well known by anybody who did not need to know, and never created a security issue that we ever heard about.</p>
<p>Two other interesting points. The manufacturer we bought locks from is a major player in the business. At that time they had 98 different keys available, ordered with a numeric code, for their products. A far cry from the potential millions that others claim here. The other thing I observed is that some suppliers would collect builder and customer keys and end up.with giant key rungs full, kept on their delivery trucks. Instead of waiting for somebody to show up with a key, it was common for a driver to test a few dozen keys in the door, since he would likely have the correct key in his collection. Since these mega collections of keys had several brands of locks covered and usually got you in the door, i suspect that the actual number of key cuts out there is far more linited than most would assume.</p>
<p>Bottom line? Locks allow honest people to feel.secure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Way back in 2003, I went out with my boyfriend (now husband) one night and accidentally left my keys at home. My parents went to bed and locked the door before I got home. My mom was a light sleeper so I thpught, &quot;if we just start trying to stick keys in the lock, she'll probably hear it and come unlock the door.&quot; So we did. Attempted to put his parent's house key in, his car key, then his grandmother's apartment key. We were very surprised when his grandmother's key slid in the lock and utterly shocked when we could turn it and unlock the door. My boyfriend and I married, my parent's sold their house, and grandmother died, but we still have that key.</p></div>		</li>

<p>He wasn't, he secretly copied your key to burglarize the house, and then played it off as if it was his grandmother's key. Watch out for the long con, I think your husband might be up to something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In practise the number of permutations will be lower as there are forbidden combinations of pin cuts (for instance max followed by min). Whilst it varies from lock to lock make, for a 5 pin (the most common type ) this can take the number of possible keys below 10,000. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of this, lock manufacturers will do bulk runs of a single key code so that home owners can have all of their locks keyed alike without needing to call a locksmith. You can go to any hardware store and find 10+ locks that are keyed the same which means not only does someone else have a lock with the same key as you, but someone in your area likely has the same key.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A friend once gave me a key to her house to watch her cat while she was out of town. She handed it to me and I thought it looked a bit familiar.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to explain why certain combinations are forbidden, Imagine a max position followed by a min position on the next pin. The angle cuts on the key between pins have to be able to actually move the pins up and down in the cylinder. when that angle is too steep, they key can't be inserted because the pins won't move.</p>
<p>Related aside: Way back when, I was network IT for a lock company, and my wife was a teacher whose school happened to use our brand. She was relating how she needed to get into a certain room on the regular that only 1 admin had a key for, and was regularly unavailable when my wife needed the key. I found a code for the school in our system, and had a key cut by one of my buddies in that department.</p>
<p>Turns out, I gave her a master key for the ENTIRE DISTRICT.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many years ago my dad was driving a variant of a Renault 12. We went to a local department store and I took the cart back to the car to unload the stuff we just bought. Popped the trunk and started putting the stuff in the back, but eventually it dawned on me that this wasn’t <em>our</em> shitty car, as we didn’t have blankets in ours. Looked around a bit, saw ours and moved the groceries.</p>
<p>Apparently that car model only had a cuple hundreds of lock combinations and what happened to me was actually a pretty common occurence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, that's just because the lock is so shitty.   </p>
<p>I once unlocked my nice, Red Berlingo with my key, got in and stuck the key in the lock... surprise, surprise, it didn't turn.  Yeah, it was someone else's nice, red Berlingo.   </p>
<p>The exterior door locks are left extremely 'forgiving' on some cars, to account for wear and climate, and that sometimes make quite dissimmilar keys work in the same lock.    </p>
<p>The only lock that really matters on a car is the one in the ignition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The real numbers will be <em>way</em> lower.</p>
<p>Most cheap locks will use maybe 4 pins with 4 or 5 positions each. If at all. That's 256 or 625 possible different keys.</p>
<p>A lock with 6 pins and 8 positions that still works reliably and is reasonably proof against simple rattling will cost a lot more than average.</p>
<p>Worst case I've seen was a &quot;lock&quot; with only 3 pins filled, and the pins where so badly made that any reasonably close key worked.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The real worst case is usually those cheap cabinet locks you see on things like alarm systems, cheap &quot;strong&quot; boxes, and furniture. Some of the few locks you can actually rake open with a paper clip.</p></div>		</li>
