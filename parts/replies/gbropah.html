			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, more advanced, more expensive, and will still break.</p>
<p>It consumes both fuel, and the starter life. Like any other mechanical object that is put to use. It wears out.</p>
<p>EDIT: since this gained some attention.</p>
<p>I’m just stating simple facts. </p>
<p>I am all for lower carbon emissions AND these more advanced starters. I’m just stating that it definitely wears out the starters, at what pace, idk, but it does!</p>
<p>It definitely saves fuel, obviously, from not idling.</p>
<p>UPDATE: @SelectHousing4698 is stating that these starters have gone through vigorous testing and claims their design is built to the requirements of specified use.</p>
<p>Not really what I was originally arguing, but valid</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also here’s a fun fact for ya, a lot or the start stop starters are actually the alternator also. They are run off of the serpentine belt. When you need to generate electricity it acts as a alternator and when you need to start the vehicle it acts as a starter motor. Also to aid in starting, at least two cylinders are stopped at the top of the compression stroke so when that starter kicks in those cylinders will fire right off to help spin the engine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was a thing that GM did, they called it BAS (belted alternator-starter). It can go straight to hell. I think they were the only major manufacturer to use it, and I'm pretty sure they don't anymore. Hopefully never again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of them also use fancy tricks with the valves to keep them shut so the last cylinders that fired still have hot gasses in them and help the starter turn the motor over easier. Also, keeping the cylinders warm means the engine starts immediately instead of cranking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the engine temp is a big factor. I noticed at very long lights or very bad traffic if I’m stopped too long the engine will start up again withou me moving the car. I assume that avoids the engine from getting too cold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The engine also stops with a piston top dead center.</p>
<p>So all it has to do to get going is a squirt of fuel and a spark and off it goes, with minimal help from the starter</p>
<p>The starter motors these days are so much more robust than the old clunkers of the past.</p>
<p>500,000 starts for a new starter motor is easy done. the old ones that wore out after 50,000</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This, and a lot of the starter motors are belt-driven. Look at BMW's full-hybrids or &quot;mild-hybrid&quot; technology. These cars can also have transmission decoupling when your foot is off the gas, engine cuts off and drifts, and you get instant startup again due to the belt actually being timed perfectly to start the engine up when you need it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I came here to comment this, but saw yours already. </p>
<p>With that said, I was wondering. I’m certain that’s what more expensive cars (like Porsche and BMW) do... those cars start up smooth like butter from the stop... but I’ve been in some more economical cars (I think Honda’s?) that produced a sound and vibration that seemed more like a regular start rather than a top dead center start. </p>
<p>Is it possible that only more expensive cars do it the TDC method?</p></div>		</li>
