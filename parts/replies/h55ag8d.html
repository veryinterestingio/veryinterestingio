			<div class="markdown"><p>I think one addition to your simple analogy would be that you slowly increase the burner from off to high each time. When the burner is really low (analogous to when the sun is just rising and the solar intensity is low) the heat added by the burner can still be less than the heat being loss to the surroundings and the temperature can continue to decrease even though you are adding heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first bit of sunlight during a sunrise also causes moisture in the area (like dew) to start evaporating before the sun has really started to crank up the heat. This water vapor can make the few minutes just after sunrise a little bit cooler.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also good analogy since it uses water. This slow cooling process is more prevalent in places with a lot of water. The desert doesn’t waste any time getting cold after the sun sets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also the issue of &quot;where&quot; we measure temperature. Yes at the micro level the ground and air in direct contact with the ground would start heating up almost instantly. But it takes a fare bit of time for that to get to the 3 meter hight that the surface temperature is recorded. It's like how you might see someone use an infrared temp gun to see the temperature of a road surface and compare to the ambient temp. Which can be 20+ degrees F different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Guessing that would be a negligible effect if any, it may seem like the fact that the sun is visible should result in heating, but at such a steep angle it has the absolute maximum amount of atmosphere to go through of any point in its cycle.  When it's directly above you, even light and heat that is deflected up to 60 degrees will be hitting the ground nearby, and most of it hits directly. At an oblique angle like during sunrise a lot of the heat and light is hitting the earth thousands of miles away and is only starting to make any significant difference in your corner, especially as maybe half of what is scattered is directed away from the earth, lessening what is already a relatively small cross section to being with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn’t actually make any sense.  If the air being heated was below the supposed cool air that “drops”, then the air being heated was even cooler than the dropping air.  Adding heat will never cause cooling anywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the wind of it all. As the sun begins to heat up the Earth again, the temperature difference kicks the days wind into action as heat moves from place to place. This stirring—however mild—of the coldest possible air of the night will serve to make it feel even colder (to your skin). Plus if there's any dew formation that night, it's going to be most concentrated at the coldest time, and the condensation of moisture into morning dew has a localized heat sapping effect, making the surface of the Earth feel that much cooler.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point on the wind making a big difference to the feel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and the condensation of moisture into morning dew has a localized heat sapping effect, making the surface of the Earth feel that much cooler</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isn't it the opposite though? I thought condensation of moisture into dew has a huge heat releasing effect -- which is part of why the overnight temp tends to hold at whatever the dew point was (if there isn't wind to bring in drier air). Water condensing releases so much energy it essentially holds the air temperature there instead of allowing it to continue to drop.</p>
<p>It might still feel colder if you're walking around barefoot in the dew-covered grass, though!</p>
<p>edit: yeah, condensation is exothermic, evaporation endothermic. The heat released is &quot;small&quot;, but on a large scale, the kinetic energy given up by water vapor turning into liquid water is a lot relative to what's needed to warm the air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, condensation is a source of warming. It sounds small but it adds up. When it comes to thunderstorms we quantify it as CAPE (convective available potential energy, J/kg of air) and is essentially the maximum heating provided by a unit of air at the surface lifted into the troposphere until all it's moisture condenses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If anyone ever wants to experience this effect in a SUPER obvious way, Las Vegas in the summer is the way to go. </p>
<p>Head outside later at night, once dusk has truly transitioned into night, and stand any non-grassy surface (asphalt is best, but concrete works too). You can literally <em>feel</em> the radiant heat from the ground across your whole body. The air around your feet/ankles/lower legs is noticeably and obviously warmer than the air touching your face. If you extend your arms, palms down, you can feel the heat radiating on your palms. </p>
<p>It's not <em>hot</em> or anything - not uncomfortable. But it's really super obvious and really quite interesting. I've never experienced the effect as strongly anywhere else, probably because the sun is so intense in the day there and the temperature differential between day and night is so high in the desert. It's really cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something that keeps getting over looked is the water content of air. Water holds alot of heat per degree at 4.2 SHC (Specific heat capacity). Most materials are sub 1.  Outliers are usually around 2 and are few and far in between. Many metals are at &lt;0.2 with aluminum at 0.9 (iirc). This number relates to how much heat energy it takes to heat a material 1 degree C. So water takes 4x as much as oxygen(SPC of 1) with the same amount of mass. </p>
<p>So in area's with alot of water in the air I expect a slower rise in temps through the day with little bleed off during the night. Meaning days and nights grow hotter as time goes on because not all the heat is gone from the previous. </p>
<p>Desert area's would have a rapid increase and decrease in temps. With nearly maximum temps reached each time (night time lows and daily highs) after you consider all the variables. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So what's going on is that air cooled at a faster rate than what the asphalt can heat it at due to the lack of water in the air to hold the heat from the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Liquid water is 4.2, water vapor is much lower. Still an important factor, but nowhere near 4.2 kcal/mol. It is like less than 2 iirc.</p></div>		</li>
