			<div class="markdown"><p>This right here. Precise, repetitive tasks with controlled inputs are great for robots, if the cost of development and purchase is less than paying a human in the long run. </p>
<p>I think the perception and decision-making with taste, and accounting for culture and food trends and all of the things that go into cooking is still beyond what we can do with artificial intelligence so far though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. There is at least one high-volume conveyor belt sushi joint in my town that has a ‚Äòrice ball robot‚Äô, basically it makes and dispenses perfectly formed little balls of rice that go under that style of sushi. Pretty ingenious IMO to save time and handstrain in a busy environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It‚Äôs things like this where we‚Äôll see robots gaining traction in food service - if there‚Äôs a small, repetitive task which happens <em>a lot</em> then it‚Äôll get automated.</p>
<p>Consider how many places replaced the work of washing the plates with a machine. Even little things like deep fryers which automatically lift the baskets when the timer is done free up a human to be doing something which isn‚Äôt yet automated.</p>
<p>And there are even some styles of cooking like sous vide which pretty much require there be a machine making sure things are done absolutely consistently, even if a human then does the final finish and assembly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite sushi place has a robot that puts the rice on the nori. The sushi chef was getting really bad hands from that and it enables him to keep cooking. Didn't change the quality, still his rice. Funny the first time I noticed I was sitting in front of him and the robot and said it looks so perfect like it was done by robot. Then he pointed ...</p></div>		</li>

<p>repetitive
controlled inputs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is where you hit it.  Would you have a robot for each dish?  Would you have a robot on pantry and two on the saute, one handling grill and the other on the pizza oven?  Would you have one robot capable of every dish on the menu?  Plus support for those robots?  A team of technicians and engineers to prevent downtime?  And as for inputs, the inputs at a restaurant are different sizes, shapes, weights, etc.</p>
<p>We do have robots that cook food.  Heavily processed foods, ground down and mixed to uniformity, then extruded.  Those work in factories making one item in giant batches.  We are no where near the kind of robot that could receive a ticket for &quot;3 grilled salmon, mid rare, one medium well with no sauce,&quot; that wouldn't just give you cat food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We could absolutely do that task. The problem is the ratio of volume to number of entrees.  You don't just need grilled salmon, you need hundreds of other dishes nailed down for a sit-down restaurant, many of which won't even be ordered in a given night. Programming transitions to sequence cooking of all these things, and testing to high reliability, is just too much; Not economical compared to paying somebody.</p>
<p>Chipotle, though?  We could do a Chipotle vending machine easy.  A limited number of ingredients put together in a limited number of ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're overstating the problem though. It's not like having an entire human at each station. It's more like having a couple of motors and levers built into each station. And when you state it that way, yes, having a separate robot at each station sounds perfectly fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, mass produced food is absolutely made by machines. It‚Äôs not like Lay‚Äôs has some guy sitting around peeling, slicing, and frying their potato chips by hand.  It‚Äôs all done in a big factory.</p>
<p>As for restaurants specifically, I think unless it‚Äôs some place like McD or Taco Bell, people would perceive robot produced food as inferior, or less special than human produced meals.  Not necessarily for any objective reasons, but because I believe there‚Äôs some subjective value people place on good food made by a good cook. In other words, even if it was ‚Äúeasier‚Äù for a lot of places to use a robot ‚Äî I think many would still opt not to.</p></div>		</li>
