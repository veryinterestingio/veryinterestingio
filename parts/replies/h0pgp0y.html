			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, what you're suggesting is effectively a space elevator, which have been researched quite a bit. They are indeed physically possible, but we need the right material for the &quot;string&quot; - using steel like in normal elevators would collapse under its own weight. Carbon nanotubes seem like the most likely candidate for now</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aha yes, I was just asking someone else what material we could potentially use. Would one big string be better than say, several smaller ones (like on the four corners and center of a platform)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are describing a geo<strong>synchronous</strong> orbit, where the rotation period is the same as Earth's but the inclination may be different.</p>
<p>For a geo<strong>stationary</strong> orbit, the inclination of the orbit is also simply matched to the tilt of the earth (which is relative to an arbitrary reference to &quot;up&quot; anyway) and will remain stabilized in the same way the earth's tilt does.</p>
<p>Because the earth is not perfectly spherical or uniformly dense and subject to wobble-inducing tidal effects, things that might affect precession differently for a small orbiting satellite vs. a massive elastic spherical planetary body, gravitational effects would cause you to need some small station keeping adjustments if you expect to hold the same point precisely over years.</p></div>		</li>
