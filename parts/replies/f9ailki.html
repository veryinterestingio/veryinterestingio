			<div class="markdown"><p>Galaxy comes from galaktos (root is gala), which is Greek for milk or milky. As does galactose. Lactose comes from Latin, lac-, which also mean milk. And shares the same root at some point. </p>
<p>So galactose and lactose both mean milk sugar, one via Greek and the other Latin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surprisingly, it happened the other way around. We had a name for the Milky Way before we had the word &quot;galaxy&quot;. The Milky Way looks (apparently, to some people) like a bunch of milk spilled across the sky. So it got that name, or whatever its equivalent was in the languages people actually spoke then. Later we found out that other structures exist far away that look just like ours (specifically, Andromeda, which for the longest time astronomers thought was just a nebula), so we called them &quot;galaxies&quot;, using &quot;gala-&quot;, &quot;milk&quot;, in reference to the Milky Way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that glucose is the main circulating energy source in the body, and your body is most comfortable working with it. </p>
<p>By comparison, fructose (from fruit) requires different enzymes (proteins made by the body) to break it down than the ones that work on glucose (because of their shapes). For that reason, some people with a defective gene coding for a related enzyme are unable to break down fructose and are ‚Äúfruit intolerant‚Äù. </p>
<p>The more common version of this is the inability to break down lactose (sugar in dairy), aka lactose intolerance. This one is intentional though, since most mammals stop drinking milk after infancy. </p>
<p>As stated above lactose breaks down to glucose and galactose. The glucose is no problem, but the galactose has to be converted to glucose before it can be broken down, and that process requires energy (making the energy you get from the sugar less efficient). The production of one specific enzyme (lactase) is naturally shut off after infancy (or later depending on genetic and dietary factors) to help be the most energy efficient when digesting food.</p>
<p>Luckily because the cause for lactose intolerance is well known and consistent across most people, you can buy over-the-counter supplement pills (like lactaid) that have the enzyme your body no longer makes. It basically digests your dairy for you.</p>
<p>tldr; your body prefers glucose. Fructose and lactose make some people sick, but they‚Äôre perfectly fine for most people.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I know a bit about enzymes, and yes, the fact that we humans sometimes lack some enzymes can be really annoying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The body is also able to make glucose from protein, so as long as you are eating good sources of protein, your body will have sufficient energy without needing to eat any fructose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having a diet excluding all glucose (and by extension, carbs) can actually be a bad thing though. Your brain requires glucose as a main energy source and has a limited ability to utilize ketones (from protein and fat) for energy. The big problem with this is it can cause a local or systemic increase in acidity (ketoacidosis) damaging a variety of structures (including the brain which is especially sensitive to pH shifts).</p></div>		</li>
