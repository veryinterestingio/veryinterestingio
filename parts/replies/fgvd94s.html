			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea; I've seen 3 different versions of this behavior though, so I decided not to include it!</p>
<p>I've heard ants signal other ants they're mortally wounded by waving the remaining limbs.</p>
<p>I've heard the wounded signal this through pheromones.</p>
<p>I've heard the &quot;medic ants&quot; are able to discern between the mortally wounded and those that can be saved on their own.</p>
<p>And now you've just added a 4th.</p>
<p>So with (at least) 4 different possible explanations; and being too lazy to look for a conclusive source, I decided to leave that part out ;)</p></div>		</li>
