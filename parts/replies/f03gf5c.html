			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok I gotcha thank you for the explanation. So another quick follow up question - what’s to stop a company from patenting a technology that was researched and developed by an industry forum like this and making it proprietary if it was a great idea? And is there anything that dictates who can then manufacture  and sell these group-made technologies, such as companies like Anker and other 3rd parties that sell usb type cables?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more like the other way around: companies can patent whatever they want, but only things that get cross-licensed to at least all the forum members are accepted into the forum.</p>
<p>Then, each forum can operate in a slightly different way. Some may require that only free stuff gets contributed, others may pool patents and license them as a package, others may gatekeep access to the actual text of whatever they agree to, some others may license the use of logos to put on devices.</p>
<p>IIRC the particular case of USB, there are several different fees for access to the technical documents, getting assigned a vendor ID, use of the USB logo, and licensing costs per unit depending on whether it does or does not show the logo.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is no &quot;stopping&quot;.  As with most laws, the deed is done and people, if they feel up to it, file suit when they find out about it.</p>
<p>Lawsuits, or rather, the threat of having lawsuits, can discourage quite a lot.  If the body can prove it was theirs it's easier to win in court.</p>
<p>It's sometimes different if a company takes it and heavily modifies it.  Nvidia did this with gsync(variable refresh rate technology, original was vsync).  Doesn't mean they'd win for sure in court, but it's not as easily won by the party of origin.  In this case, market forces can also apply, IIRC, nvidia later included some form of backwards compatibility with the base item.</p>
<p>A lot of this is managed with licensing.  If a standards group comes out with &quot;This is free to implement, but not modify&quot; or various other things, that can also set a legal precedent in their favor.</p>
<p>It all gets pretty murky. Copyright, trademarks, patents are meant to be protective of original developers, but there's also exceptions such as fair use, and like above, it it's set up to be &quot;shared&quot; in some instances it's perfectly fine for someone to take it and modify it, even sell it(or support for it)....as we see with linux distros.</p>
<p>Mostly, the standard body gets pretty respected, as with USB.  People want their product to sell, and one good selling point is to work &quot;plug and play&quot; with off brand peripherals.  HDMI and USB are popular standard examples that are ubiquitous.  PC's to game consoles to blu-ray players to camcorders  to phones, peripherals, memory sticks, streaming sticks, etc etc.</p>
<p>/just general concepts, I could very well be off in the details</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is generally the right idea, but pretty far off in the details.  </p>
<p>What stops a company patenting jointly developed Intellectual Property (IP) is that a published standard is a clear, public, widely known example of prior art and a patent will not be granted.  </p>
<p>Standards developers or the national and international sanctioning bodies make a very big deal out of announcing and publicizing work. This is to coordinate and ensure consensus from the largest possible set of stakeholders, and also to prevent predatory practices like trying to patent collectively held IP.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be pretty easy to get that patent dismissed by showing that it was a collaborative effort with prior works.</p>
<p>If a company comes up with something entirely on their own, patents it, begins using it, and then it gains traction, then that company will likely get rich selling access as other companies are forced to adopt it due to consumer pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a competitive aspect to this collaboration too. It is in the interest of a company to make minor unnecessary changes to a proposal by a competitor to delay their time to market.</p></div>		</li>
