			<div class="markdown"><p>A 4k display has 2160 lines. Whether you can make out a line with your eyes depends on how big those lines are and how far you are from them.</p>
<p>Your eyes max out at 60 lines per degree of vision. For 4k, 2160/60 = 36 degrees. So, hold out your arms in front of you like you’re making a jaw, like the baby shark dance. Open the jaw 36 degrees. If the top and bottom of your 4k screen fits within the jaw, the lines are dense enough that your eye can’t make them out. If not, you may benefit from higher resolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thats actually been a thing for VR.  they have super high resolution everywhere, but only render it at that higher resolution where the eye is looking, to reduce the strain on the graphical render.</p>
<p>Not sure if any mainstream units have this sort of thing, I dont think so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It definitely is done in software some today. Beat Saber on the Quest is a good example. Where your head is pointed everything looks clean, but if you hold your head still and move your eyes down it looks like there is no AA on your sabers. During regular play, I never notice because the brain just accepts that everything is rendered the same, but at the beginning / end of songs when things are quiet I tend to look around. </p>
<p>Granted, it's not trying to mimic real life vision, but rather using how vision works to cut corners and get better performance. Not so much what the thread was originally about, but an example of how it can be used in the real world. To add to what you were saying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes me think about vr headsets: they're usually high resolution but because of the nature of the display the pixel grid is easily visible. They can cram more pixels in, but you'd need some amazing gpu power and a very high bandwidth link to the display. Maybe eye tracking combined with variably pixel sampling could give a useful performance boost if implemented properly. So the area of the display where the eyes are focused uses maximum resolution, but farther away (peripheral view) is low res since not much detail is necessary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember foveated rendering was supposed to be a game changer a couple of years ago, probably not long after the GTX 1080 came out. But then I never really saw it implemented in VR, at least not in a manner that it was obvious or talked about. What happened?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Visible pixels/screen door effect was only a problem on the first generation of headsets. On later releases you had to focus to see the pixels (Samsung Odyssey, Vive Pro, Rift S) and on the most recent headsets you can't really see them at all (Index, Quest 2, Reverb G2).</p>
<p>Foveated rendering will help lower the GPU requirement though.</p></div>		</li>
