			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with covid is one of identification, to fight a virus the body first has to identify the virus as a threat and then produce a defence against  the threat, while dopamine may speed up the production of a defence, having someone breathe all over you during sex will certainly reduce that minor benefit. It may be that people who are ill and have a positive mental attitude may have better outcomes due to dopamine.</p></div>		</li>

<p>YT, TV, games, FB, etc. are specifically designed to provide a hit as you use them. The same with sex, drugs, gambling, etc. These are generally called “immediate gratification” activities. That is when you do them, you get an immediate dopamine hit. The temptation to do an immediate gratification activity can be overwhelming over a delayed gratification activity.</p>

<p>Yes I too read comments on reddit an take it as a sign to have a lot of sex</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Too much dopamine and it gets downregulated, meaning you need more to accomplish the same.
Abstinence of sex or other stimulants would make you sensitive to dopamine. Making it much more effective</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of what makes understanding and treating mental illnesses so tricky, and why anti-depressant medications have so many side effects. Dopamine and serotonin have a lot of different functions in the body unrelated to their roles in reward/pleasure</p></div>		</li>

<p>You might feel the opposite if watching YouTube, or playing games was your job.</p></div>		</li>
