			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, you know,  the usual...shoveling snow, grazed my finger against the door, hyperbolically considering eating a bullet to make the pain stop. Doesn't help that it's the finger that's missing most of its nail. You never understand how amazing fingernails are until they're gone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the same question earlier today. if your hands are freezing cold from being out in the bitter cold and then you accidentally smack it against something it is so excruciatingly painful it feels like your finger could snap right off. Like an icicle could snap in half.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that answer doesn't make sense. Just because it's cold doesn't mean there's a drop in barometric pressure, which should be plainly evident these last couple days to just about everyone in the US and Canada.</p></div>		</li>
