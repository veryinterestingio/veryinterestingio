			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in lighting, and to remedy this there are turtle safe lights that are a very warm amber color. The turtles then follow the moon instead of going towards the streetlights. </p>
<p>I think that Florida and other turtley places require them, but that‚Äôs not my region.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's correct, we'll also have stricter light pollution ordinances in the beach areas during turtle nesting season. Eveb the traffic lights on the stretch of road that travels along the ocean have that special kind of film or filter (like the stuff on privacy screens for pc monitors/laptop screens) to where you can really only tell the signal color from straight on. Though if it's windy enough it'll cause the signals to rock back and forth enough to make it even harder to see if the signal changed :'D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just at the beach in florida last month all the ocean side facing lights at the hotel were turtle lights and the egg areas were taped off and checked daily, close to hatching time they have human guards to make sure no one fucks with them. Also it's major crime to fuck around with turtle hatching like a felony. No one reports on that shit on here it's always Florida man gets a DUI on a horse. We Florida men do good as well.</p></div>		</li>
