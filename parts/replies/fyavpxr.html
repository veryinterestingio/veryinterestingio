			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question. I should add that even though you may still be consciously aware of what is happening, much like a very intoxicated person, your memory will fail you at some point in the process.</p>
<p>It is difficult for scientists to explain exactly each individual step in this process, as it would be, from a certain point of view, a point of debate what consciousness is. We dream during the night, we always have dreams, but sometimes we donâ€™t remember them; so can you truly say your memory is completely shut off?</p>
<p>To further that point, you can be woken up from sleep too, and react to things in your dreams, is that then you truly being unconscious?</p>
<p>Sleeping is being more conscious, than say, being in a coma. However, relating the exact moment which a person falls asleep to their loss of consciousness of their surroundings is not equal to them having fallen asleep as there is more to the act then just ones memory and your perceived state of consciousness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, you can get sorta close by resting your elbow, and holding your forearm up. You'll know (roughly) when you fall asleep because you can suddenly feel your arm drop.</p>
<p>Obviously it'll jostle you awake, but that's probably why it works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, you could always record yourself falling asleep. Doubt it would be very interesting though.</p></div>		</li>
