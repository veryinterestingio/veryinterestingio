			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a boss who would keep repeating the same new buzzwords for weeks just after he learned them. Micro-services. Blockchain. Single source of truth. Transaction. It was fascinating. Every so often each of us (dev team) would pick up a new buzzword (preferably unrelated to the app we worked on) and mention it casually. Obviously we would take bets on which one he'd be stuck with. Sometimes we would even give him a false definition (like, micro-service is just a name for anything related to the microphone).</p></div>		</li>
