			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the best ways to improve your chess skill is to always expect your opponent to play the best possible move. Approach the game at that level. Weaker players often hope that their opponent makes a mistake. Aka &quot;don't play hope chess&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's another way to look at it, it's like playing a game where both players are talking through their thought process the whole time.  When one person makes a move, the other knows why that move was made and potential pitfalls as well. They may still spot something new after the move is made though.  High level play is kind of like this anyway.  You always assume your opponent sees everything you do and just make the best move you can that doesn't need any sort of trickery to still be a good move.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Chess is not just about setting traps and hoping the opponent doesnt see them. It's about coming up with good moves that are hard to exploit.</p>

<p>This reminds me of Day[9]'s speech, I think in &quot;My Life of Starcraft.&quot; He ended up playing against a lot of map-hackers in early SC1, where he couldn't abuse tricky play and just had to play more solidly than his opponent, rather than trying to outsmart them.</p></div>		</li>
