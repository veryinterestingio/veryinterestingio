			<div class="markdown"><p>Roughly. To ELI12, if you look at steel under a microscope, you'll see crystals. If you melt the metal and pour it in a mold, aka making a casting, those crystals will be like those nails mentioned earlier - all randomly mashed in different directions.</p>
<p>Heating and hammering steel to shape is is called forging. Heat the metal to a point where the crystals change form, but not hot enough to melt it (in other words, heat it red hot - I'll leave it to real experts to correct me and give details) you'll first, be able to hammer and reshape the metal much more easily - it's more bendy, and much easier to work with the old hammer and anvil. Second, all that hammering aligns all the metal crystals to the same direction, so when the metal cools, then gets tempered/heat-treated correctly, all those steel crystals will bond together and make the metal far stronger.</p>
<p>Of course, then there's heat-treating. You get different crystal configurations if you heat the steel red-hot, then quench it in water than you would if you heat the steel, then let it air-cool slowly. Air-cooling the steel is called annealing, or normalizing, IIRC - causes all the crystals to settle into position as they cool. The resulting metal will be softer, but more easily workable. Good for a round of final shaping, for example. If you want it harder, you heat and quench the metal, which insta-freezes the metal-crystals. That makes your metal really hard, but brittle. So you temper it. After quenching, you heat your metal to a specific temperature, not red-hot, but several hundred degrees, depending on how hard or soft you want the final metal to be. You can even judge the temperature by watching the color of the surface of the metal. When it's at the correct tempering temperature, quench it in oil, and you'll get a nice temper, so you get hardness without making it too brittle.</p>
<p>Edit: WOW! Thanks for the upvotes and awards! I'll admit I'm not a true expert, but there are obviously a few people in this thread that are. Glad to be of service,</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it's far more likely that, early on, they just didn't have the ability to heat metal to its melting point, but they <em>could</em> heat it enough to soften it up enough to be hammered into shape. Later, as they learned better heating methods and became able to melt metals, they may have tried it and realized it just wasn't as good as the traditional methods (though it's quick and requires less effort, so was probably still used here and there anyway).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure you need a ton more heat to  melt it. Prohibitively more expensive set up and fuel and work.  And unworked metal is pretty brittle from what I understand which was probably somewhat obvious.  Banging hot metal into shape was something you did rather than melt it.</p>
<p>Remember also we started with more ductile metals like tin, bronze, before working up to iron so there was a ton of experimentation. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People forget you can discover things like this in an evening if you're bored.  Like if it's 10000 years before the internet and you're just being bored doing blacksmith things, bang on some metal and you'll quickly notice that it will work harden.  So when Ragnor comes by with a bent ax blade, you know what new method to try.  Take all the time you waste on reddit, and imagine the things you could discover through trial and error.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans in the past were just as smart as humans are now.  People have always understood “why” things are.  It’s just that our “why” explanations have gotten more and more detailed as our tools and social roles have gotten more and more specialized.</p>
<p>“Hitting the metal makes it happy” is just as elegant and complete and reproducible of an explanation as “striking the metal alters its molecular structure”.  The difference is that nowadays we can (1) better measure and categorize more varieties of metal happiness and (2) better control just how happy we make the metal through striking it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of the other way around, we've been making steel ever since we've had access to iron. There's no early easy way to refine pure iron, so any bloomeries end up infusing the iron with all the carbon you need. Then experimenting with how much charcoal to use in the boomery process determines what carbon percent you get, and reheating and cooling rates determine grain formations.</p></div>		</li>
