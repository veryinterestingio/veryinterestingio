			<div class="markdown"><p>Pizza became big in the USA post-WW2. Domino's has been delivered since the 60's. Why popular after WW2? Soldiers stationed in Europe and Italy developed a taste for it. </p>
<p>Why Pizza traditionally such a deliver-able food? Think about it. Pizza in the box is the simplest, easiest hot food you can eat with <em>nothing</em> on hand. </p>
<ul>
<li>the box is its own plate</li>
<li>you eat it with your hands (no utensils) </li>
<li>it's portable</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no food easier to eat. Delivery chinese, burgers, hotdogs, etc etc all require accessories and care. Pizza is the easiest food ever because <em>the servings aren't individually wrapped</em>. You order 4 pizzas for 20 people and everyone digs in. You order hamburgers for 20 people and Jesus fucking Christ the amount of bags and individually wrapped shit is insane. Plus figuring out who's orders are in what bag.</p>
<p>Pizza forces immediate communal eating.</p>
<p>From a delivery perspective its so much easier too. Delivering 20 orders of pizza is a matter of stacking boxes. Delivering 20 orders of hamburgers or tacos or chinese is a bitch just for space and organization. Additionally a meal for 20 people is 4-6 boxes the company needs to get right. 20 people for a burger joint is a much more complicated delivery affair. Now there's 5x as much shit to get wrong. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, I don't know if this is a thing overseas (but I think it is), but here in New Zealand our most popular take away is Fish and Chips. It comes wrapped in paper (its own plate) and is ready to eat straight away out of the packet without utensils, and it is highly portable.</p>
<p>Why do we only have delivery pizza but not delivery fish'n'chips?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Counter argument: I live in South Korea and delivery fried chicken is everywhere here. It basically comes in a pizza box, everybody reaches in and grabs a leg and goes to town. Only thing to worry about is the grease. Thats on that pizza level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wanna know, too. In Istanbul, McDonalds delivers on motorcycles. They're everywhere and the delivery guys are even more insane than your average crazy Turkish driver. Ever seen Taxi? It's like that. </p>
<p>Why can't we have that in America? </p></div>		</li>

<p>We kinda do. Call your local cab company and ask them to pick up McDonald's for you. I used to work at McDonald's and people do this.</p>
<p>That said, McDonald's is looking for a way to stay relevant and profitable... delivery is an option they should explore. They could start their own uber style delivery app where anybody could deliver for them to make extra bucks. Imagine you're having a party and fucking McDonald's arrives after everyone has been drinking for awhile. Not to mention, I'd order a Chocolate Shamrock milkshake right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in Japan and the local McDonald's has a few guys who ride around on red motorcycles and deliver. Same goes for the last place I lived. I don't think it's available for every location, but it seems very common here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I spent a birthday on a month-long work trip to Costa Rica crying and drinking alone in a hotel room.</p>
<p>Then I discovered Costa Rican Burger King delivered.</p>
<p>Best broken Spanish order ever.</p>
<p>...except &quot;delivery&quot; in San Jose meant three hours later, from a poor man on a bicycle in the rain, and the food was beyond gross by then, including the ice cream.</p>
<p>I could see the Burger King from the hotel window, I was just too drunk and weepy to walk there or take a cab. I figured they would quickly deliver it, if there was ice cream.</p>
<p>On the positive side, I was also too drunk to really pitch a fit about my wilted french fries. Drank the ice cream with Baileys.</p>
<p>I also was proud of Drunk Me because she also ordered Dominos delivery, which got to the hotel room a helluva lot faster, so I ate pizza while I waited on burgers. Chorizo pizza makes an interesting vomit flavor at 2 AM!</p>
<p>It was still a 3/10 birthday.</p></div>		</li>
