			<div class="markdown"><p>To an extent, one informs the other. Said smashing of continents helped throw up a couple small mountains here and there where they're colliding after all. </p>
<p>also the fact it provides a usual geographic reference for socio-cultural grouping is apart of the reason why it's called that. Greenland, the  Alaskan Peninsula  and the Southern end of South America are all sub continents but no one really cares. Meanwhile the Arabian Peninsula is also a subcontinent, but everyone just calls it the Arabian Peninsula. &quot;Indian subcontinent&quot; happened to be useful shorthand to refer to that region of Asia</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a little of both. I'm pretty sure India was called a subcontinent before plate tectonics were understood, though that has reinforced the idea. It's not entirely coincidental though, plate tectonics are responsible for the enormous mountains that separate the subcontinent from the rest of Asia, and which has fostered and protected the unique culture(s) of the subcontinent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While that's a modern usage (one of several) of the term, it's very unlikely to be the origin, considering it was called a subcontinent for more than a century before plate tectonics became widely accepted by the science community. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, to be clear though, continental drift was a hypothesis that said the continents moved. It said nothing of the reasons why or how, and the idea of separate tectonic plates was not put forward until the 1960's. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A==B. </p>
<p>It was initially referred to as a subcontinent because it's geographically and geologically distinct from the surrounding bits of the continent. </p>
<p>The fact it's on its own tectonic plate is the underlying explanation for why that's the case, and as such is a perfectly fine answer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Continent&quot; has always had a cultural component to it. It's why &quot;Central&quot; America, despite clearly being geographically &quot;North America&quot; is almost always lumped in with South America. It's why &quot;Europe&quot; and &quot;Asia&quot; are a thing, despite there not really being a complete boundary between them, and the boundary that exists (the Urals) is pretty arbitrary and incomplete.</p>
<p>India was a subcontinent not just because of geography, but because of the distinct (albeit complicated and multifaceted) cultural &quot;unity&quot; (not that it was &quot;uniform&quot;, but there was a strong interconnected cultural history) which didn't extend as strongly outside it in either direction.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As in, “how many continents are there?” Your answer is indicative to where you were raised/educated. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, not really, with the exception of the northern part of the divide between Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Africa is essentially separated from the other continents (except a tiny strip, and there's a canal there now). North America and South America, ditto. Australia and Antarctica entirely separated. Eurasia, ditto.</p>
<p>It if was completely cultural, Latin America would be one continent, and Anglo-French America another. And Sub-Sahara Africa one continent, North Africa part of another. And so on. But they're not. (We do use useful concepts like &quot;Middle East&quot; and &quot;East Asia&quot;, but those aren't considered continents.</p>
<p>The one exception is Europe/Asia. That one <em>is</em> a historical artifact -- it's about the separation of the land masses west of the Black Sea and Straits from those to the east (and of the separation at the Mediterranean). Later this separation was found to not extend north of the Black Sea, so &quot;Eurasia&quot; is legit alternate to Europe and Asia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Arabian peninsula is also a separate tectonic plate, and so is Central America. Those are never called subcontinents, though.</p>
<p>Not to mention, the term has been in use since the early 1900s, and plate tectonics really only crystallized as a theory in the 60s.</p>
<p>The term exists solely because people see a distinct cultural and geographic sphere in India and the surrounding countries.</p></div>		</li>
