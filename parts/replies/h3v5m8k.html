			<div class="markdown"><p>There are people who have a mutation that prevents their bodies from making myostatin. They look ripped as hell without lifting a dumbbell in their life, the problem is that they need 4000+ calories a day just to survive, 5000+ if they do light exercise and more from there (which goes in line with what other animals eat, roughly twice the calories per kilogram of body mass than humans for the same activity level.)</p>
<p>You can imagine an ancient hunter-gatherer that needs that much food isn't gonna survive a bad winter (that's one of the hypothesis as to why modern humans survived while Neanderthals died out: they needed more food and due to global warming the numbers of large animals they relied upon dwindled, while we survived on smaller animals and more variety of them, including fish. We also ate more plant food, as our ancestors ate roughly 50/50 animal/plant matter, while Neanderthals ate more like 90/10, which helped humans as plants were more plentiful once the ice sheet over Europe receded.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neither of those have downsides in today's society though. Eating 5k calories isn't an issue with food abundance, and not going to the gym means you get to catch up on sleep or spend more time working in an office</p></div>		</li>
