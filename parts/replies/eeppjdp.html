<p>The other systems in the wikipedia article linked would require more complex and expensive materials meant for application with CO2 in very high concentrations, like coal power plants. </p>
<p>It seems to me like an algae-based system would be the most sustainable and cost effective option for a normal household, but I'm having trouble finding exact numbers on the necessary scale per unit of 1000ppm CO2 air. </p>
<p>Any solution to this would need to be a sustainable and relatively cheap method, like growing a lot of plants. I only say algae as a tank of algae would take less space and less cost to start-up, and algae is more efficient at CO2 conversion.</p>
<p>In terms of sunlight-to-biomass efficiency, algae beats out other plants.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>photosynthesizing Cyanobacteria [blue-green algae] have been shown to be a significant species in the global carbon cycle, accounting for 20â€“30% of Earth's photosynthetic productivity and convert solar energy into biomass-stored chemical energy at the rate of ~450 TW.</p>

<p>I'd like to find a data point for the sunlight-to-biomass efficiency of blue-green algae that is a percentage of the energy input, which the wiki article lacks.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I will assume the article is correct in its claim that &quot;The basic design shown here will scrub its own consumption and approximately 24 pounds of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year.&quot;</p>
<p>24 pounds per year = 30 grams per day. An average human exhales somewhere around 720 grams CO2 per day (this number depends on diet and metabolic rate, for better calculations see: <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ina.12383" target="_blank">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ina.12383</a>)</p>
<p>You will need to build around 24 of those algae scrubbers, assuming they work as well as claimed, in order to take up the CO2 from one human.</p>
<p>Of course, now that you provide more context, the amine scrubber sounds like an even worse idea (since it would be toxic if a leak occurred).</p>
<p>Why isn't ventilation an option in your case?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Most</em> homes lack good ventilation or an HVAC system. The only way for them to vent CO2 is to open windows, but any home in the more extreme winters or summers cannot do that since they would lose heat or air conditioning.</p>
<p>It's just a reality that keeping windows open <em>every day of the year</em> is infeasible.</p>
<p>There needs to be an affordable and simple solution for individuals to reduce CO2 concentrations in their homes, and most people think a few plants can do that. </p>
<p>Potted plants don't intake enough CO2 to reduce that concentration significantly unless you have extreme quantities of plants.</p></div>		</li>
