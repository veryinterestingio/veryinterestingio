			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the response I was looking for.  People tend to think about heat only in terms of the air, but the radiative heating/cooling from all the objects around you plays at least as important a role at any given moment.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Another is that the sensor inside the thermostat is protected from direct radiation by the housing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but not necessarily the same way as a human. For example, double glazing will isolate almost entirely from conduction, but much less from radiation. Whereas an aluminium sheet will insulate a lot from radiation, but much less from conduction.</p>
<p>Usually, thermostats are shaded from IR by a perforated casing, that will stop radiation and will let air pass, so they will mostly pick air temperature and disregard the IR exchange.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not quite, radiation goes from warmer to cooler. In a residence (hopefully) you are the warmest thing around. You are radiating heat to cooler things. The walls are cooler than they are in the summer. If you are maintaining a constant air temp (70 degrees f) then in the winter the walls are perhaps 66 degrees, in the summer they are perhaps 74 degrees. the amount of radiant energy transferred is in relation to the temperature difference. The walls won't radiate to anything unless it is cooler than them. In the winter they are likely the coolest thing in the room as they are part of the decreasing temp gradient to the outside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re getting radiation and conduction confused.  The walls absolutely will radiate heat at you even if they’re colder than you, and you can perceive the difference between a cool wall radiating some IR at you vs. a very cold wall radiating much less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>look at the equation for radiant heat transfer and get back to me.., Actually I'll provide it. In simplified form Q=hA(T1 - T2), where h is the &quot;coefficient of radiant heat transfer&quot; (which is made up of a whole bunch of other factors related to materials and geometry), A is the surface area involved, and T1 - T2 is the temperatures of the 2 objects. T1 - T2 will either be a positive or a negative number if the temps are different and thus the heat transfer will either be positive (rejection of heat from the T1 body) or negative (absorption of heat to the T1 body). Thermal radiation only occurs in one direction, from hotter to colder.</p></div>		</li>
