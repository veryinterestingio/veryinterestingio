			<div class="markdown"><p>True!  The test we’ve moved to uses a nasal swab, nares x2, rather than nasopharyngeal.  </p>
<p>What you are limited by is what the company describes for appropriate collection in their EUA/FDA clearance.  Going “off label” requires a lab to independently validate the alternate specimen collection and it isn’t worth it in most cases.  OP asked if coughing in a bag would work, which could in theory, but not really in practice.  That’s a bit different from debating swab types.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have a source for this claim? I’m genuinely curious. </p>
<p>I found this article, which seems to indicate that nasopharyngeal is significantly more sensitive than mid-turbinate swabs</p>

<p>Just a pre-print, but this study shows little difference between MT and NP. It’d be interesting to see meta analyses on this question.</p>
<p>Pragmatically, if you’re trying to do surveillance work on, say, an elderly population, you want that MT swab to keep people coming back for repeat tests as necessary. NP hurts too much for a lot of people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on when in the course of infection you test as well. Wherever viral loads are highest is of course the best specimen type.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I got tested today.  A colleague told me it was uncomfortable but bearable.</p>
<p>For the deep throat, I've got a really strong gag reflex. The nurse went in 3 times and I get heaving to chuck.</p>
<p>For the nose rape, she tried the first, it absolutely killed with pain.  She stopped, I had to spend a few minutes recovering.  Then she tried the other nostril... got to the same depth and gave up.  My face was a mess of tears and I can still feel a slight discomfort as if the inside was scratched.</p>
<p>I did not expect it to be that bad.  I suppose different people react differently.  That and I'm a big wimp.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems that dogs are testing at a high rate of accuracy for spotting Covid. If that pans out I hope it leads to other ways of testing less invasively and capable of testing many people at once.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Undoubtedly! That would awesome!  Nasopharyngeal was our default swab, but the later Nasal (only) swabs were a godsend when it came to small children or developmentally delayed patients.  Our nurses were super thankful for a less invasive collection.  If we could get to the point of a dog sniff, it would be amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve also read that if a person has the virus, each exhale only contains 20-50 particles(?) of the virus. To “catch” corona from someone you need to inhale somewhere in the range of 1000+ particles. So if you’re around a Covid positive human, just breathing in one or two of their exhales won’t give you the virus. </p>
<p>Tldr: no matter who you’re around. Limit your time with them, count their exhales and when they reach ~15 exhales, leave them. And you’re golden. /s</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As long as you can limit contact to about a minute and a half you are good, given you breathe about 12 times a minute.</p>
<p>That’s the silly thing about wearing masks.  Unless it’s an N95 it isn’t about protecting yourself.  You wear a mask to protect others. “My Body, My Choice” falls apart when it’s “My Body, and I’m choosing to protect you.” Otherwise it’s just selfish people who want to do their own thing.</p></div>		</li>
