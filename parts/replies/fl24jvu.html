			<div class="markdown"><p>So couple things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Exercise physiology is stupid complicated. Lactate formation is a piece of muscle fatiguability, but it's not the whole story.</li>
<li>It's actually crazy useful to make lactic acid. In doing so, you get a couple quick and dirty high energy electrons to use to make ATP <strong>without needing oxygen</strong>. The heart can't do that, which is why cutting off the oxygen supply for even a couple seconds causes crushing chest pain.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I completely agree with the idea behind your post, but I feel it's necessary to say that <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpregu.00114.2004?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" target="_blank">lactic acid isnt the problem</a>. More current research than this suggests that the body doesnt even produce lactic acid (it produces lactate, which is the conjugate base of lactic acid, but they're very different). </p>
<p>Neither of these are the reasoning behind what people consider <em>the burn</em>, either. The short version is basically the body doesnt have enough oxygen (which assists in clearing out the hydrogen ions) and the buildup of hydrogen ions is partially responsible for <em>the burn</em>. The formation of lactate actually requires the absorption of some of those excess hydrogen ions, which helps reduce that burn.</p>
<p>I don't mean to be overly pedantic, it just felt appropriate to share that information! I feel like we as a society have latched onto this idea of lactic acid being the enemy, and I feel like its important to be educated ya know? (:</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lactic acid is lactate plus a hydrogen ion. That hydrogen ion is actually produced along with lactate by lactate dehydrogenase in the same reaction. It’s buffered by the lactate. Lactate and lactic acid both exist simultaneously in equilibrium as lactate associates and dissociates with the hydrogen ion. They’re the same thing, except “lactic acid” refers to lactate + the hydrogen ion. </p>
<p>It’s true that, pedantically, at physiologic pH, the majority of the equilibrium favors ionized lactate + a free hydrogen. But by using the phrase “lactic acid,” I can refer to both the lactate and the hydrogen together, which are the products of lactic acid dehydrogenase.</p></div>		</li>
