			<div class="markdown"><p>Our stomach in a literal sense doesn’t do much digestion at all. It’s job is to store and churn food and dole it out in small regular chunks for the small intestine to do the actual digestion. In fact you can digest food just fine without much stomach acid. People who have their stomachs reduced by surgery or on high doses of acid blocking medication still do fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, I think you are confusing digestion with absorption.  The stomach is extremely useful for digestion between the stomach acid and the rhythmic motions of the muscles.  The small intestine primarily absorbs what is broken down further up the alimentary canal, however, it can adapt to do more digestion if the stomach does not.  This is why, like you said, people can live without their stomach, but they also have to have a special diet, like those who have their gallbladder removed.</p></div>		</li>
