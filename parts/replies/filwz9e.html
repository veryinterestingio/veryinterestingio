			<div class="markdown"><p>Til MMS is still a thing. In the UK even the £20 SIMs (no phone) have inclusive calls, data and SMS. You have to pay per MMS. Doesn't everyone have WhatsApp on your side of the pond?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Calls, texts and platform messaging (iMessage and RCS <del>whatever the android equivalent is called</del>) are generally unlimited, so there's little point in using an extra app like WhatsApp. It doesn't add any capability.</p>
<p>And yes, MMS is still used, but only for messages that cross proprietary platforms. Or if you keep the &quot;advanced&quot; messaging on your android turned off like me. It's not a big deal very often.</p></div>		</li>
