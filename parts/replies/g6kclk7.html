			<div class="markdown"><p>Although I agree with this - as a rider that does wear hi-vis riding gear I can attest that people just generally don't see us. Our eyes just naturally have a lower detection to MCs than cars. Also, bikes are more susceptible to be hidden behind other vehicles, signs, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_kpL4f4MXI" target="_blank">pens</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yo, I wanna take a sec to point out that it's generally a good idea to ride in a location in your lane that lets you defend it from other cars (also known as controlling your lane).</p>
<p>So what I mean is this: If it's a 4 lane divided highway, and you're riding in the left lane, you should be riding towards the right edge of the left lane (as if you were in the passenger side of a car). If you're in the right lane, ride towards the left edge (as if you were on the driver's side of a car).</p>
<p>If you're on an undivided highway it's a little more murky, but my general advice would be do stuff to make you more visible to traffic travelling the same direction as you. It's more likely in that situation that a driver would be changing lanes into you than crossing the center line into you (although obviously there are situations that could happen). Also, there are different rules and guidelines when you are riding alone vs with a group, this is advice for lone riders.</p>
<p>I bring this up because twice yesterday the bike that was following me (we were travelling in the left lane of a divided highway) almost got hit. They were riding in the left half of the left lane, and my suspicion is that the cars in the right lane would check their mirrors and/or shoulder check and see me coming up behind them, then see what <em>appeared</em> to be a gap behind me but was actually a bike that they could not see because from their angle it was hidden behind my car. They would then change lanes without checking after I passed them.</p>
<p>I'm sure they'd be at fault, but there are tons of dead people who were right. If the bike had been riding in the right half of our lane, they might have been more visible to those cars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember getting a few pins at some fair as a child that were all in protest of a proposed helmet law in Illinois. I didn't understand them and when my mom tried to explain it, I still didn't understand. Just the idea that people wouldn't want helmets made no sense in my child mine, and still doesn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The manufacturers know their target demo as well. The sit up straight commuter bikes are quiet like sewing machines. The hunched over crotch rockets sound racey. The cruisers all have deep rumbling tones. </p>
<p>What I'm saying is it's possible to make motorcycles quiet, but the sound is part of the whole package. Part of the design.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh for sure if you're talking about dBs. I'm just referencing the stock exhaust note. There's a (several) reason(s) a Honda Goldwing sounds different from a Honda CBR600 - even bone stock. One of those reasons is the type of persons buying that model.</p>
<p>Have you heard a factory stock crotch rockets exhaust? They're not obnoxious, but not exactly quiet either. I used to set off car alarms in parking structures if I blipped the throttle. Completely stock 600.</p></div>		</li>
