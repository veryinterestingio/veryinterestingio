			<div class="markdown"><p>We learned about that in security training recently! I remember being amazed at all the unexpected ways information can leak out.</p>
<p>To further expand, this is because computer security roughly boils down to solving difficult math problems. Certain algorithms involve repetitive steps, and the number of times these steps must be repeated depends on the input. For example (I don’t think this is how computers actually do it, but as an example) if you wanted to calculate the remainder of dividing 5 by 4, you might subtract 4 from 5 once to get 1, but if you want to find the remainder of dividing 17 by 4, you would have to subtract 4 four times, which takes longer.</p>
<p>So let’s say the system checks your password by first turning your password attempt into a number, and then dividing a secret number by it and checking the remainder. Then an attacker could send a password that converts to “4” and count that it takes four CPU cycles for the password check to complete, and guess that the secret number is 17, 18, or 19. Again, that specific example isn’t actually how computers do it, but that’s the idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This allows for &quot;black box&quot; analysis of programs. A black box program takes inputs and gives outputs but an external user does not know how, or sometimes what, will come out. Timing the action is part of discovering the inner workings of the code, it's a huge part of reverse engineering of code/hardware.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mean username.</p>
<p>The timing attack is a way of detecting valid usernames. We try different usernames with presumed invalid passwords (like a randomly created 32 char string). If the system is returning false on &quot;does user exist&quot; then invalid users will return faster than valid ones.</p>
<p>The bad password backoff is to make brute forcing the password too slow. If each attempt takes a second, just forcing even a short password takes an unacceptable amount of time</p></div>		</li>
