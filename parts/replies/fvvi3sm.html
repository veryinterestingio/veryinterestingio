			<div class="markdown"><p>When I try this I just end up with snot coming out of the..whatever it's called, (puncta?) tear duct drain hole on my right eye. I've heard it's relatively normal but can maybe lead to eye infections. <em>shrug</em></p>
<p>I just wanna know why it only happens on one side, lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our bodies aren't perfectly symmetrical so it could just be a case of one tear duct being ever so slightly larger in diameter than the other. I have similar issues if I blow my nose too forcefully while congested, but I've also had some messed up sinuses for many years now so it's just sorta normal to me now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whoa! That’s never happened to me, but sometimes the day after a night out I blow my nose and there’s bits of black eye makeup in the snot. Took me years to figure out what it was.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you hang out around a lot of smokers (or a fire pit, other smoke source, etc.) it could be the soot from that. Sometimes after a smoky party/nightclub I have dark snot when I blow my nose.</p></div>		</li>
