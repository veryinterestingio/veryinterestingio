			<div class="markdown"><p>If you a) don't exfoliate already and b) touch your skin and it feels pretty smooth, and c) you don't really have any real acne problems, you probably have the nice, non-sticky skin cells. In my case, if I don't exfoliate my skin at all for a few days - so if I don't apply my salicylic acid/glycolic acid toner once every other day at least - the skin on my nose and chin especially becomes quite bumpy, and if left alone, can transform into blackheads and other zits relatively quickly. If you don't any problems like this, or alternatively, if you suffer from rosaceae or eczema on your face, or just have especially dry skin in general, then I wouldn't necessarily recommend exfoliating.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most are thinking/referring to physical exfoliation I believe, but chemical exfoliation is the one that's amazing. Chemical exfoliation is the n.1 thing that keeps my skin top notch. When used wisely and appropriately to your skin type and needs, it does absolute wonders.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seconding this. There's a slightly outdated impression, I guess left over from the early 2000s, that exfoliating is just scrubbing your skin with a wash cloth or some face wash with microbeads, when most people don't do that much anymore. There's so many excellent chemical exfoliants nowadays, even for sensitive skin.</p></div>		</li>
