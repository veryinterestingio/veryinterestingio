			<div class="markdown"><p>So we have measured the age of the universe by looking at how the light from the oldest stars has Res shifted and then take that into account with how fast we are moving away, then we go back and know the origin, if I understand correctly.</p>
<p>And we know this expansion is occurring by creating space/or stretching the spacetime fabric like a balloon causing some parts to move away faster than speed of light relative to each other, while others are coming close like galaxy clusters, meanwhile the CMB should expand homogeneously. So are we really comoving closely with the CMB?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a word, yes.  We have some local movement as we orbit the sun and the sun orbits the galactic center of the milky way, but those velocities are essentially zero in comparison to the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sean Carrol has a great YouTube channel and I love his AMAs because he just thinks about everything and has a fascinating thought process. He's a theoretical quantum physics cosmologist and covers time asymmetry in his book &quot;the big picture&quot; </p>
<p>The number of times he says &quot;time doesn't speed up or slow down. Time always goes the same speed, which is one second per second&quot; is impressive. The &quot;arrow of time&quot; is one of those things we know how it works but not why. There is space time and that means it's space and time. For some reason you can go up, down, left, whatever direction you want to, in space but you'll never accidentally make a left turn into yesterday.</p>
<p>The twin watch paradox will be a good look up because there are several ways of explaining what we are seeing and the math accounts for it.  No matter what reference inertial frame you're in, time goes the same speed and the is no place you could stand that would detect the difference.</p>
<p>In answer to your question there are several ways we can account for it, with totally different reasoning about the nature of time and reality, and they come up with the same prediction of how MUCH time has passed in any given frame. </p>
<p>Sorry, but it's homework time and if just listen to Sean Carrol and watch some of his videos where he's speaking about many worlds at universities and stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. This is my argument consistently. Time is a constant and does not change. So many people misunderstand the concept of relativity. I’ve literally argued with people on Reddit that one second is one second no matter where you are in the universe for years. Everyone trying to tell me it’s me that doesn’t understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>theres theories and stuff about alternate universes containing their own sets of universal laws (where for us they are pretty much based on space, time and light and the manipulation of these within each other) but that means that there is probably a universe out there that contains a law that say that time is like space and can travel through it in any direction you please.</p>
<p>idk, just food for thought</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's one of the ways we've measured the age of the universe, yes.</p>
<p>We aren't perfectly comoving with the CMB but we're pretty close. Our sun has a velocity of about 350km/s relative to the CMB, which might seem like a lot, but it's barely a rounding error on relativistic scales. That amounts to a difference in elapsed time of a few thousands years over the entire lifetime of our solar system (roughly 4.5 billion years). That's like a day being shorter by a few nanoseconds - measurable but essentially meaningless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>The only places where you'd expect a large difference in the measure of elapsed time would be close to massive objects like black holes and things that have been moving at relativistic speeds for most of the existence of the universe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>of note, the opposite, the places that have &quot;elapsed the most&quot; time are the places that have been the most empty. Its almost like the speed of time is inversely proportional to the amount of stuff there is to interact with. </p>
<p>So the &quot;most time has happened&quot; in the least interesting of places.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's like when video games slow down when there is too much going on.  It's like the natural laws of the universe have a way of accounting for the chug, when things get too complicated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the same thing when I look at experiments into entanglement. Like we have found the limits of the optimization where it produces strange effects.</p>
<p>The delayed choice quantum eraser is kind of a dead giveaway isn't it? Its like time is not just multi-threaded but uses predictive branching...and we just did a meltdown attack on the predictive system to leak information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about light itself? Since it’s moving at lightspeed, wouldnt that mean that light reaching us from far away is actually older and the emitter is further away? Not much clue about physics, this happened to be in popular feed and was an interesting read</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct that the objects that emitted that light are now much further away from us than when they emitted that light, but I'm not sure what you when you say the light itself is older. The light is however old it's been traveling for. If that light was emitted 13 billion years ago and is just reaching us now then it's been traveling for 13 billion years regardless of how far away the emitting object was then or how far away it is now.</p></div>		</li>
