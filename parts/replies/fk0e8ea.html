</blockquote>
<p>All objects with any heat at all emit <em>light</em> waves. For objects below about 800K (1000°F), all of this light is in the infrared part of the spectrum that is below what we can see. Above that, more and more of the light is in the visible part of the light spectrum that we can see, which is why hot objects appear to glow. Something that is 5000K (8500°F) is almost entirely giving off light in the visible part of the spectrum. As you get above that temperature, more and more of the light emitted is in the ultraviolet portion of the light spectrum, which is above what we can see.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Important to note, the amount of light given off at any specific part of the spectrum only increases with temperature.  As it gets hotter and gives off more visible light, or even hotter and gives off UV, or hotter and gives off x-rays... the low frequencies like infrared that it gave off when it was cooler are still there brighter than ever.  They're just outshined by the even brighter light added as the temp increases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am aware :P But this is an ELI5 thread, I was simplifying things. The relevant part of that paragraph is the fact it includes infrared, which is what's used in thermal imaging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, infrared can pass through some objects that block visible light, so it's possible to see through things with thermal cameras if they're thin enough / made of the right material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the flip side, most thermal cameras can't see through things you would expect- like windows and water. (There are some fancy little Port-hole windows made for niche industry applications though).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As to the last aspect, is there any way this could be used to explain the countless people claiming to add auras? As in, someone being hypersensitive to seeing light combined with someone... I dunno, sweating extra light?</p>
<p>I don't actually expect this to be possible, just curios!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is no :-)</p>
<p>If you could see into the infrared spectrum auras would not be the first odd thing you noticed about the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a horrible way to try to approach the claim, but it’s easily disprovable in our modern science-rich time...thankfully. And it’s so simple that if it were true, we’d have had that explanation ages ago.
Adding a sci-fi twist - what if we could genetically “add” a feature like the heat-sensing pit organs of boas and vipers (which they use to hunt their mammalian prey) to humans? Not a very useful/adaptive trait for us but definitely one of those possible future body mods.</p></div>		</li>
