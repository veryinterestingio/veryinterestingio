<p>I'd just like to add that WiFi, Bluetooth, etc. work with insanely low amounts of power. Most people don't realize how low that is. We're speaking of nano-watts to a few tens/hundreds of pico-watts ( 1 pW = 0.000000000001 Watts). That's why even though you lose a lot of energy in the transmission, the receiver (router, mobile phone, earbuds) is smart enough to amplify and understand this extremely faint signal.</p>
<p>By contrast, an appliance like an air conditioner needs like 1000 W of power to work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you may be talking about transmitting power. In my previous comment I was mainly referring to the high attenuation the transmitted signal suffers along the way, and how we can still use it for communication purposes, but certainly the losses would make it impossible to scale the same idea for transmitting large amounts of power.</p>
<p>It's true that in a WiFi/BT transmitter you can have powers of hundreds of mW. But due to the large losses, the amount of power that ends up reaching the receiver 10-15 meters away can be as low as -95 dBm. <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/blog/3-key-factors-that-determinethe-range-of-bluetooth/" target="_blank">Bluetooth specifies a minimum receiver sensitivity of -70dBm to -82dBm.</a></p>
<p>My point was: imagine the amounts of power you'd have to put in the transmitter in order to provide let's say 10 kW to power a home at the receiving end located 1 mile away. Not only it would be insanely wasteful, but also obviously impossible for health/safety reasons.</p></div>		</li>
