			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a big topic in healthcare economics. Thyroid cancer is being diagnosed at a steadily increasing rate but deaths associated with thyroid cancer are roughly stagnant. </p>
<p>The best explanation is that we're getting better at finding it, but the cancer itself wouldn't kill many of the people we find it in. Given the ordeal associated with thyroid cancer, it's likely we're worsening human welfare by treating older people with mild cases of it, who would likely sooner die of something else.</p></div>		</li>
