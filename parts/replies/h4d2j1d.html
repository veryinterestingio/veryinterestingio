			<div class="markdown"><p>Local fancy steakhouse was advertising 24oz, 45 day dry aged steaks for $100.00, so my brother and I decided to go. His steak was a beautiful purple color when cut into while mine was bright red. His had that deep, mellow, mushroomy/cheesy flavor that comes with an aged steak. Mine tasted like steak. </p>
<p>We showed the difference to the waiter and he argued with me, saying they were both the same aged cut. The “chef” (who was a sous chef) comes out and says the same thing. Bartender overhears us and joins the conversation. Takes one look at my bright red steak and starts going into hemoglobin and the aging process and how a properly aged steak would not be a bright red color on the inside. Then the real chef/owner comes out and looses his shit because the waiter and sous chef argued with me about a steak that clearly wasn’t what they advertised. Owner replaced both our steaks and comped the meal. Bartender got a huge tip, didn’t leave the waiter much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So after having a few dry aged steaks I concur that they are definitely richer and have more depth of flavor. However, for a quarter of that aged steakhouse price I can shred a little parmesan and add some finely chopped walnuts for a topping and have a similar taste. </p>
<p>I am interested in trying one of those aging bags.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont know if there are any normal steak cuts that have skin on, but if I had to guess it wouldn't dry out on the skin side properly. </p>
<p>I'm not expert, just a guy that loves meat in all forms.</p></div>		</li>
