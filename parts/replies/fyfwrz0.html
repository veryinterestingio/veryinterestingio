If you put a virus with strong coagulopathy symptoms into a system with compromised vasculature, you're gonna have a bad time. I think is a main factor with the higher risk due to obesity as well.</p></div>		</li>

You can google and find lots of articles on this. I have a friend who works in emergency medicine. She says the majority of patients in their 30s are showing up because of stroke symptoms. It’s weird how it affects people differently.</p></div>		</li>
