<p>which I guarantee you more than one cell is removed.</p>

<p>How many cells?  Does this cause any kind of issues with the final child?  Just seems..kind of weird, haha.  </p>
<p>Also, is it true that even when an embryo comes back as abnormal, that it can correct itself once it's implanted into the surrogate or mother?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if different methods have different requirements, but in my unit five cells are biopsied from a blastocyst. Embryos have excellent ability to repair themselves, so the loss of a few cells isn’t going to be a drama to a child born. I have heard there is research going in to testing the free DNA in the culture media the embryo has been growing in for genetic problems, rather than biopsy - interesting times ahead!</p>
<p>They can also repair themselves genetically, but I am not sure in what circumstances. It likely depends on the severity of the chromosomal abnormality and how many cells are affected </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't ICSI a different procedure? I have no doubt things have changed considerably but it was quite a new procedure in the 1990's and only used when the man has a very low sperm count, post vasectomy antibodies etc. </p>
<p>I briefly worked in the front end of a fertility clinic at the time and I was very curious about how things worked in the lab - I'll never forget the embryologist telling me that with ICSI, they find the best swimming sperm, hit it on the head to stun it a bit, chop its tail off and inject it into the egg. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Embrologist here, the optimal temperature is 22.2 degrees C or 72 F for cool brewskis and hot Betties by the pool.
We find the bro’s we find the chicks we put them together with a bit of the libations and see if they do thenopantsdance. We watch the relationships and deem them viable if the chick isn’t a clingeroner in which case the bro is ejected into the hidethefuckoutlowkey and the chick is steered towards further acceptable bro’s. </p>
<p>It’s sbroance. </p></div>		</li>
