<p>I mean one of the stupidest games we had use this formula was Flappy bird. The most braindead game that was meant to be a one off simple market game reached such traction ... it struck a balance in our brains and initial publicity allowed it to be experienced.</p>
<p>Why its a great example is that this guy for sure didn't have a team of psyho-anaylists behind him. So he struck gold kind of with his simple formula.</p></div>		</li>
