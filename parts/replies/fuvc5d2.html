			<div class="markdown"><p>Just as a small note: they won't get all the passwords, just the shitty ones. Hashing is designed to be slightly difficult, so you can only try a certain number of hashes per second, even on good hardware. That might be millions or billions per second, but a good password is one that's long enough that there are quintillions of possibilities.</p>
<p>Anyone that uses one of the top hundred thousand passwords, or a password shorter than 7 or 8 characters, they'll get a positive match even on a well salted database, but if you're using a password manager and a 32 character random password, they won't get yours.</p>
<p>The main reason to not reuse a strong password everywhere, is that some website might use a shitty hashing algorithm to store passwords, or even store them in plain text. You could also get fished. If you have a unique password for each site, now you've only got one compromised account, instead of a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Getting people to use a password manager is next to impossible. So the advice I always “if I can’t get you to stop reusing passwords, at least never reuse your email password.” If that one is truly unique, that will go a long way. Because if the email address falls, the password is no longer needed for any other account.</p>
<p>It’s better than nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At 32 characters you can just use a passphrase without the need of any special characters. If that's 5 words and you get 1000 words to choose from (both probably closer to random assumptions than good assumptions) that's 10^15 combinations you've gotta check. Now I'm not sure how many combinations would be safe though. But it seems pretty good to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly why a password manager is so crucial.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generates <em>secure</em> and <em>unique</em> passwords for every website. Meaning even if MyFitnessPal has a breach because of their shitty security, the hacker won’t have access to your bank because you used the same email and “fluffy1234” as your password in both places.</li>
<li><strong>stores</strong> these passwords for you in a secure vault, so that you don’t have to remember them. How many times have you been trying to log in and can’t remember “oh, was this the website that had the weird rule where i couldn’t use the certain special character i normally use to make my passwords “strong?” Did I have to use different caps? What variation of my main 3-4 commonly used passwords did I use on this website?”</li>
<li>most password managers integrate with your browsers and apps on both PC and phones in order to input the passwords from your vault. I use LastPass for example. Any time I have a login field that is from a domain it recognizes in my vault, it has a little ellipsis to the right of the field allowing me to fill in the username/password. On my phone there’s an option to use my faceID to input. And if you’re signing up, it allows you to “generate and fill” a random secure password (this used to be a feature LastPass lacked and was frustrating - glad it’s fixed now).</li>
<li>you can securely share passwords. Want to give someone access to one of your accounts - for example like Netflix? You can securely send to their email and even block them from viewing the password. They will be able to input it from the vault but won’t be able to see it. Of course, if you’re using independently unique and secure passwords for every website, it’s probably not an issue that your friend knows your Netflix password is “wzEihb16bCc4^$@1HPW^@y!u4” - it’s just a pain in the ass for them to type in to their smart TV.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It takes a little bit to set up, I guess? You do have to go onto basically every website you use and update all your passwords, but it’s super easy to use and maintain after the initial set up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Absolutely worth using a password manager. And there are plenty that are free. I love LastPass, for example, but there are others like bit warden, keepass, etc. 10/10 cannot recommend enough. Makes your accounts more secure AND makes your life easier.</p>
<p>Oh and make sure to enable 2FA on all your accounts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they're trying to log in to another website using the log in form, the salt doesn't matter because they're just sending the password and the website salts and hashes it for them.</p>
<p>The salt would sort of help if you had both password databases and you were trying to figure out which accounts reused the passwords, but it doesn't matter if you're just trying them all without access to the second site's password database.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some operations can only be done (or are much easier) in one direction.</p>
<p>For a really simple example, look at the remainder/modulo operation. Say my algorithm is to convert the password to a number, then look at the remainder when I divide by 7.</p>
<p>If 12 goes into the algorithm, the output is 5, because when I divide 12 by 7, it goes in once with 5 left over.</p>
<p>If 47 goes into the algoritm, the output is also 5, because 7 goes into 47 six times, with 5 left over.</p>
<p>This is impossible to reverse. Even if I know the algorithm and the answer, I can't work my way back to the original number. i.e. if I know that the algorithm outputs the remainder when dividing by 7 and I know the answer is 5, I don't know if the original number was a 12 or a 47 because the algorithm gives the same answer for both.</p>
<p><strong>This is a really bad hashing algorithm by the way and (hopefully) nothing like one that is actually used. Because of the way passwords are stored, 12 and 47 would both get you into the account. It was just to illustrate a simple one-way calculation.</strong></p>
<p>An example of an algorithm that is easier in one direction but merely difficult in the other direction is multiplying and factoring primes.</p>
<p>e.g. it's really easy to multiply 13 and 17 to get 221. We have algorithms for doing that very quickly. If I tell you that 209 is the result of multiplying primes together however, you basically have to just try to divide 209 by primes until you get a whole number out the other end which is probably going to be a lot of calculations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You cannot run it backwards because that is not what a hash function is. </p>
<p>Hashing has 2 main features: </p>
<ul>
<li>Its one-way encryption, meaning its impossible to get the original input from the output.</li>
<li>The same input will always result in the same output. For example, &quot;apple&quot; will always hash to &quot;eia74kx9dw&quot; or something. </li>
</ul>
<p>When you enter your password in, the website runs the same hash algorithm to get a hash, then connects to the database and checks if yours matches to the one that is stored in the database. If they do, you are verified and are able to log in.</p></div>		</li>

<p>that was going to be my next comment, presumably these hashes arent internally developed, why not just buy a license to each of them and just run tons of words through them. could a machine learning algorithm not then estimate the hashing potentially?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wasn't it the other way around? You have the database with hashes and the algorithm used, take combinations and run through the hash and compare to the database and look for a match so you can use the correct password without actually having to type it in until you have the right one.</p>
<p>If you already have the password in english you'd just be able to use it directly on the website. I don't know enoufh about this to make an eli5 of this though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in general, people don't store passwords in the form you type them in (called plaintext). instead, certain mathematical techniques are used to encode them before storage, in such a way that you can't get back the original. the result of this process is called the password's <em>hash</em>.</p>
<p>now, say you have a ton of these hashes. what you want to do is find out what plaintext corresponds to each hash, and you do that by successively hashing different combinations of characters and checking for matches.</p></div>		</li>
