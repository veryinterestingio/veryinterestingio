			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea they are both called potential. Gravitation potential and voltage potential. It is a great analogy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had never actually envisioned the concept of potential differential with regards to electricity until this analogy. I always thought about it in purely abstract terms. The gravity example is brilliant and so obvious now!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The water analogy works better if you don't imagine a pump, but rather 2 containers of water with a pipe between them at the base. The amount of water in each container is charge, and the difference between the levels in each container is voltage. It's intuitive that if a valve were opened in the pipe, the water level would equalize between the containers, and the force with which that occurs is proportional to the difference in water levels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Problem with that is your tank comparison is equivalent to 2 batteries, while a pump is equivalent to a power supply giving constant voltage.</p>
<p>Both can work for the basic ELI5 but you need both to understand some other aspects of an electrical circuit.</p>
<p>For example a good one with with your tanks, if the water is the same height one could contain 1000 litres, the other only 1. One would be a large tank (like an IBC) and the other only a thin tube, but the  water pressure at any connecting pipe would be the same (assuming the pipe is the same level). So no water flows between them.</p>
<p>Just like you could have a house sized battery and single AA battery, if the house sized one was only 1V and the drained AA 1V you could not use it to recharge the AA battery to 1.5V (not without a boost converter).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing with all of these is the good is : you get some understanding of what volts, amps and watts are. The bad is : you hear the analogy, forget about electricity and start asking questions about the nature of the water or expanding the analogy with knowledge you have or read about plumbing - and that doesn't work because electricity isn't water.</p>
<p>It was like Feynman trying to explain to a journalist why he felt a force when 2 magnets got close - and he's says at one point if he describes it like it's an elastic band then people start asking him questions about the elastic bands. He pointed out that most people take things for granted but want an explanation of something that seems odd, but the thing they take for granted is more or less the same thing happening when you look at the deeper level.</p>
<p>Then being Feynman he then goes on to explain how elastic bands work in terms of the other more fundamental thing. Which shows us that we didn't really understand rubber bands even though we figure we do and they'd be a good analogy for a layman explanation of any force that makes something attract. We just accept rubber bands or the floor holding us up, but are puzzled by electricity or magnetism.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would this make resistance the roughness of the walls (i.e. smooth walls = low friction vs rough walls = high friction)? In this case, the rougher the walls, the larger angle (voltage) you need to get the same number of balls falling through the end (current). Seems to make sense with I=V/R.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Roughness of the walls is the material effect in resistance. The width of the wall and the length also contributes. The narrower the cable higher the resistance since the balls are forced trough narrower space. Similarly longer cables have higher resistance since balls are subjected to more resistance on the way. They will lose more energy if they go trough a multi-stage slider than directly going from point A to B.</p></div>		</li>
