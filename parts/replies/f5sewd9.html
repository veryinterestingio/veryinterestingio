			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, you can even use a tool called a degaussing rod to degaus to undo any fields induced by leaving the magnet too long or using a very powerful magnet.</p>
<p>Or atleast that is my understanding of them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Occasionally something would cause the circuit breaker to blow, you'd hear a huge arcing sound. At the same time the crt would hugely distort. Most of the time it would return to normal after. </p>
<p>I always suspected this was from some distortion on the input power perhaps induced from the field, rather than a magnetic field directly, since its a hell of a long way for that magnetic field to cause such an effect. </p>
<p>But the fact that occasionally I'd need to hit the degauss button to get the colours back to normal would suggest otherwise. Quite concerning considering the box was a good 50m away and the nearest wires 25m or so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember first learning about that concept in 5th/6th grade (so about 10-11) and testing it out myself on an old tv we had. </p>
<p>It did what my science teacher said it would! But that was a p early sign I was the kinda person who needed to experiment for myself, even if it did turn one corner of the tv green lmao</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically  CRTs got 3 beams of electrons, one for each primary color (red, green, and blue), and those beams are arranged so that they always hit their respective color phosphors (there's a grid just before the phosphors that sorta works like a bunch of pinhole cameras, making the beams hit the screen always at specific offsets); the motion of electrons is affected by the presence of magnetic fields, when you bring a magnet you screw the alignment of the beams and they hit the wrong colors; and the system is so sensitive that you even risk magnetizing the grid or some other component and leaving the screen with permanent color distortions (though many later models actually have internal demagnetizers that fire up when the screen is turned on, making that characteristic tweng noise, which often is enough to clear any distortions).</p></div>		</li>
