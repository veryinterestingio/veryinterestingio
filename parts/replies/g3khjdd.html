			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a good visual somewhere on the internet where they show the human body, but they enlarge areas with more nerves.  Basically it is like a stick person with a huge face, hands, feet, and reproductive area.  Which makes sense, it is all the parts that interact with the world and need as much information as possible.  Except the reproductive organs, but of course they would have a ton of nerve fibers because of how important and exposed they are, in addition to being needed for function.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its weird how that works, isn't it?  You can cause a lot more damage in some areas and it won't hurt all that much, but comparatively little damage to sensitive areas can be excruciatingly painful.  Like getting your toe nails ripped off.  Not really that threatening in the sense of life and death, but insanely painful because of all the nerves there.  </p>
<p>I have always been fascinated by people with a rare genetic disorder that won't allow them to feel pain.  They have historically had short life spans because of their inability to determine when something was wrong.  You could be walking around with chest pain all day because of an impending heart attack and be none the wiser, to say nothing of mechanical injuries.  But these people aren't happier or anything, which I assumed they would be with the absence of pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This model was made a long time ago based on surveys following physical testing. Most people at the time were too shy to accurately describe the sensations felt in the genitals area.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mainly because the skin area does not have all that much sensitivity to it (compared with the face), but if you get kicked there you end up reaching an internal nerve which is a problem: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The vagus nerve - an extremely long and sensitive nerve that runs all the way from your face to your groin - is largely to blame here.  </p>
<p>Since the vagus nerve is so long and sensitive, it’s one of the pathways along which pain is sent when someone is kicked in the crotch. But its size and length also mean that the pain becomes more generalised when it reaches the abdomen, which is why there’s more of a painful feeling there than where the man was hit.</p>

<p>I wonder if this has to do with the size of the pores.  Wait...do skin pores even come in different sizes?</p></div>		</li>
