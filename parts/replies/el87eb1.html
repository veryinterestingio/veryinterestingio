			<div class="markdown"><p>Animals reduce competition, and sometimes even favour the survival and success of related individuals. In ecology, this is called kin selection.</p>
<p>While kin selection has been observed in elephants and other animals, it has also been observed in fish too such as salmon (see link below). Kin selection is debated among plants however and that debate is rather inconclusive for now.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kin selection is definitely a thing in other organisms besides animals - it's even a thing in bacteria (<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2012.0843?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed" target="_blank"><a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2012.0843?url\_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr\_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr\_dat=cr\_pub%3Dpubmed" target="_blank">https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2012.0843?url\_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr\_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr\_dat=cr\_pub%3Dpubmed</a></a>) and plants (<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2016.0789" target="_blank"><a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2016.0789" target="_blank">https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2016.0789</a></a>). Kin recognition is, however, a different matter (that is, the ability to specific recognise kin vs non-kin). It has been argued to be present in bacteria and plants, although some scientists argue that they are cases of greenbeard effects (recognition using only one or a few number genes instead of using recognition of genealogical kin).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would be surprised if bears had zero recognition of that sort of thing, despite being solitary animals. Male grizzly bears try to murder the cubs of any female bear they find so she goes into heat again so he can mount her. It would be evolutionarily counterproductive if he also did this to his own cubs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've often wondered about that actually. Like, how could he possibly know? Does he remember having mated with her an appropriate length of time ago and make the connection? What if that mating turned out not to result in pregnancy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily, it depends on how often this desire to kill cubs results in a male bear killing its own cubs. For instance, if the female bears are somewhat nomadic, wandering through different male territories, then there's a good chance she wouldn't come back to his. So he wouldn't, evolutionarily speaking, need to be able to recognize his own offspring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Horses are similar. If the male can't tell if the colt is his, he'll just kill it. Only colts tho. Reduce possible competition from a genetically different rival.</p></div>		</li>
