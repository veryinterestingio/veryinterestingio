			<div class="markdown"><p>FWIW, it doesn't decrease the size of the picture. What decreases is the amount of light being gathered, so the picture is dimmer (assuming we're holding exposure time and ISO constant. In reality, you basically always up the ISO to avoid dim pictures, which makes the picture noisier instead of dimmer).</p>
<p>You could also lengthen the exposure time to maintain brightness and low noise, at the cost of moving subjects becoming blurry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well aperture just changes the focal depth/point, an aperture of F35 makes every area blurry other than the focal point but that’s interesting also</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, depth of field (the range of distances where things are in focus) increases with smaller aperture size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah (probably to an extent)—If you want to do landscape photography and have everything in focus near and far, you’d crank down the aperture. Make it small enough and you don’t even need a lens (as in a pinhole camera)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This should be much upper, the change in the curvature of the cornea is right, but the pinhole effect plays a larger role in this situation. Optometrist do this effect (pinhole effect) to test if the issue was refractive (can't focus to the retina because the curvature of the eye).</p>
<p>In the test if the pinhole is negative, meaning blurry eyes not improved by seeing through a pinhole, it means that the blurriness is caused by non refractive issues i.e. it blurry well because of retinal damage (technically it won't be blurry, but the average joe usually don't describe symptoms really well, they'll just say blurry), or there's issue with light transfer, say the cornea, or the lens or the vitreous humor is clouded for any reason). </p>
<p>eli5 tl;dr: pinhole plays larger role in this case. It is an effect that's being used as a standard test in a eye exam. It differentiate blurriness in vision: between issues that the medium in the eye is having trouble focusing the light versus because parts of the eye is not transparent and becoming opaque or translucent or the sensor of the eye is damaged.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because it's a fairly complex topic. It took humanity a long time to understand it enough to make use of the effect. Plus, this is a topic that really needs pictures, which I don't have.</p></div>		</li>
