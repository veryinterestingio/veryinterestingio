<p>Perhaps a better example would be something like an armadillo, which still has a pretty normal mammalian skeleton underneath its shell. I think a strong case could be made for pangolins as well.</p>

<p>If I'm not mistaken those armors are made of keratin, which is the same substance that makes hair and nails. So, these exoskeletons are just modified versions of hair or fur. Is the composition of the &quot;skeleton&quot; important to be classified as such?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair point, but seeing as most people have no problem considering structures as diverse in composition as the chitinous cuticles of arthropods, the calcium carbonate shells of molluscs, and the silica-based skeletons of some sponges to all be exoskeletons, I don't see any reason why we should limit ourselves to bone when it comes to vertebrates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm just not sure if there is a precise definition, that's why I asked if the composition is relevant. As far as I can tell, it is generally accepted that all vertebrates have an internal skeleton, except perhaps for the case of the specialized ribs of the turtles mentioned previously.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The only other biological matter known to approximate the toughness of keratinized tissue is chitin</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't the point of a skeleton to support and shape the organism? (Actual question as i'm not very knowledgeable in that field)</p>
<p>If yes, I'd understand to call tortoise shells part of their skeleton, but not the pangolin or armadillo armor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is certainly an important role of skeletons now, but they are also very important for serving as anchor points for muscles, and the latter function was most likely the initial driving force behind the evolution of vertebrate skeletons.  The first hard part to evolve in chordates was the notochord (which is actually made of cartilage, but is basically similar to a spine), and this allowed for relatively strong swimming by side-to-side movements in a way that invertebrates can't really do (<a href="https://images.slideplayer.com/14/4427902/slides/slide_11.jpg" target="_blank">this figure</a> demonstrates this idea pretty well).</p>
<p>Anyway, that's a little off topic, but yeah I think you can sort of argue either way for tortoises.  Obviously, their skeleton is derived from an internal one, but they've succeeded in moving pretty much all of their body into it (including moving their shoulder blades within their rib cage).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This whole time, I've though turtles probably feel like they're carrying their shell on their back, but it's more like they're dragging a huge belly. Their spine is above their guts.</p></div>		</li>
