			<div class="markdown"><p>On the other hand, complementary colors at high saturation/brightness, which should logically be the ultimate contrast, can &quot;<a href="https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/why-you-should-avoid-vibrating-color-combinations--cms-25621" target="_blank">vibrate</a>&quot; and are extremely blurry and uncomfortable to look at. Kind of a horseshoe effect of going to the opposite extreme.</p>
<p>Yet there's still <em>something</em> appealing about designs like the Spotify example they give, something that  still <em>feels</em> the same as more bearable complementary color schemes, so the preference simply being due to making it easier on your eyes seems rather specious to me. My guess is it's more just about dynamism? Contrast of any kind just makes an image more exciting because there's more going on.</p>
<p>That said, humans can also be very drawn to analogous color schemes, like red-orange-yellow, so none of this is really hard and fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When colours “vibrate” it’s because they are the exact same value, or lightness. If you were to turn the two colours to black and white (a blue and an orange that vibrate for example) they would be the same shade of grey. Our brains perceive images in value first, black and white, a fraction of a second before we perceive the hue or colour, so that vibration is the brain seeing difference and sameness simultaneously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to chime in and say that although complementary colors display the most contrast, the combination is not always 'pleasing'.  Often, maximum contrast is not what you are going for.</p></div>		</li>
