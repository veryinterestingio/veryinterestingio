			<div class="markdown"><p>I honestly think mesh WiFi is a fad. Itâ€™s a terrible idea to deploy it absolutely everywhere. It needlessly congests available channels. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here, I try to stay away from it in my commercial deployments. A cable is always preferred, using dedicated long range backhaul radios on a completely different band also works very well. But channel congestion is a serious problem and always has to be taken into account.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have mesh WiFi in my house because we were unable to cover the whole house reliably with one AP. Many smaller devices struggled quite a bit near the edge of its reach. We ended up getting an Eero system and it works great. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find sometimes I will install 3 in a home and one might be needed too far away from the others, I'll get a set of powerline adapters and put it on Ethernet that way.</p>
<p>Then they also get an Ethernet port out as well if need be.</p>
<p>It's just nice to have the option.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth knowing you don't always need to run ethernet. </p>
<p>MoCA 2 adaptors let you go from ethernet to existing coax and can give speeds of around a gigabit. </p></div>		</li>
