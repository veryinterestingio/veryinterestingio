			<div class="markdown"><p>NSFW - I have a close personal friend who’s wife is an absolute conjurer when it come to the spice. </p>
<p>One time she made him a meal out of dried chilies that was so hot that the next day when he was driving to work, he found himself trying to fight off an urge to evacuate his bowels that was so, so, soooooooo intense that he actually, without a word of a lie, came in his pants.</p>
<p>He’s a pretty racy guy who would go to some pretty crazy extremes to get his end away, but by his account, this totally unexpected and unwanted sexual encounter with the night before’s dinner left him feeling absolutely abused and violated, which was the part that surprised me the most.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not hard. You can buy capsaicin in very pure form. If you want, you can crank the spice meter up all the way to the moon.</p>
<p>Not recommended, though, unless you want to feel like you're dying for a day or two.</p></div>		</li>
