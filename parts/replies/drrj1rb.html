			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's like Lamborghini starting to say their cars have bullpower instead of a number of horsepower. Then Ferrari comes out with again the most horsepower in a new car, and people say &quot;yeah but does it have bullpower?&quot;</p>
<p>...which is actually pretty much how phone screen discussions started going after that. So great job again by the marketing team and too bad it works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Retina display: we cant afford to source the better resolution display, GPU and battery components and keep margins high. So we're going to say you don't need any better than we have.</p>
<p>iPhone X marketing fluff <em>finally an OLED we deem good enough</em> or more like finally, we had to source these displays from Samsung because we couldn't keep pretending OLED wasn't superior.</p>
<p>Samsung do it too:, our QLED quantum buzz word display is so much better than an LG OLED! Nothing to do with the fact we cant manufacture that size reliably!</p>
<p>The worst part is all these bloggers falling over themselves to use the above buzz and spread this misinformation around.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well do you? A 15'' screen at 2880x1800Â or a 27'' 5k monitor (iMac) is pretty damn good. They are good quality IPS panels too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That quantum fucking shit. There was a display at ny work advertising the quantum dots that was really gtating. But the worst part had to be &quot;most tvs are limited in the number of colors they can display.&quot; So what, you're saying this tv output in every single frequency?</p></div>		</li>
