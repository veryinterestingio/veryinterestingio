What a pinhole does is restrict the amount of light that can reach the eye, so everything looks more in focus but dimmer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, just like a camera with a smaller aperture has better focus and more depth of field. Which is why your phone can't take photos with beautifully blurred backgrounds that aren't close-ups (without software cheating), the lens is too small. You need a big lens for that effect at a distance.</p>
<p>This only works to a point, though. Due to diffraction (quantum mechanics shenanigans), as you make the pinhole smaller and smaller, at some point the image starts getting more and more blurred. This is because there is this pesky rule in quantum mechanics that the more accurately you know where something is, the less accurately you can know where it's going. If you make the pinhole so small that you know very accurately where light is when it passes through it, then light says &quot;oh yeah? well, then screw you, now I'm going to randomize the angle I'm going at&quot; and the image becomes more blurred.</p>
<p>Yes, it sounds bizarre, but quantum mechanics is <em>weird</em> and this really does happen. Search for Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.</p></div>		</li>
