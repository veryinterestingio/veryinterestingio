			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes me wonder if there is also some microscopic space around three water molecules, and some even more &quot;finer grained&quot; liquid out there that you can poor into a full glass of water without increasing the total volume.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding pure alcohol to water makes a volume slightly less than the two liquids separately as some of the water can snuggle into the alcohol and fit tighter than either alone</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda. </p>
<p>At that point it's not about the space between the molecules, but the forces pushing the molecules apart. It doesn't matter so much if something can fit in the spaces if the electric charges push it away after all. If the forces are either weak, or they can line up in an efficient way then the molecules pack together more closely. </p>
<p>Some substances can totally make that more efficient. For water, table salt can reduce the volume by ~2% under ideal circumstances. The sodium and chlorine ions are strongly charged and can pull the water molecules closer together. </p>
<p>This can get screwy though; acetone and chloroform are a classic example: If you start with pure acetone and slowly add chloroform then for a while you'll find that the total volume is <em>more</em> than the volume of the separate substances. Then once you hit a 80:20 mix acetone:chloroform the volume will decrease and become less than the total volume before mxxing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly, but you can add salt to water and it actually decreases the total volume by about 2%.  So in this instance you could then add salt without increasing the total volume.</p>
<p>This happens becaused the the dissolved salt + water molecules can pack in slightly closer to eachother than pure water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm fairly sure the mass of nutrients extracted from the soil by a plant is negligible, but I'm not quite sure how much it is. Do you know? The overwhelming majority of a plant's mass is pulled from the air, in the form of CO2 that is incorporated into its carbon based structure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh. I don't know about that. I just removed my peppers from their 14&quot; planters today. I had maybe two inches of soil left. By soil I mean all the wood chips. Two planters had about 1/2 the soil left. I was a bit surprised. I even fertilized quite well all summer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The soil will settle over time though, and will eventually compact if nothing is holding up these little spaces and pockets.</p>
<p>This is why earthworms are so good for the soil. Earthworms eat dead plant matter and recycle it (worm poop is amazing fertilizer), and they also continually dig tunnels through the dirt, loosening the dirt.</p>
<p>You can buy earthworms at any garden store or fishing supply store (note: you probably will have to ask the store staff where the earthworms are, they're easy to miss in a large store). They're a fantastic investment for all gardeners.</p></div>		</li>
