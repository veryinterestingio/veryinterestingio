			<div class="markdown"><p>everyone should buy a tongue scraper <em>right now</em> if they don’t have one already. only a couple bucks from your walmart or wherever.</p>
<p>i feel like 90% of my morning breath goes away from using one. i can’t even imagine brushing without scraping my tongue now. i’d still feel gross.</p>
<p>(brushing your tongue with your brush works, but something is so grossly satisfying from seeing all the gunk come off.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, spend a few extra bucks and get a metal scraper instead of a plastic one. Stainless steel and copper have anti-microbial properties and will last many years, while plastic quickly accumulates germs and need to be replaced at least every few weeks or months depending on usage, cleaning and storage. That's more environmentally friendly, too. </p>
<p>Some people recommend starting with plastic since it's easier on your tongue, but I found that if you just scrape lightly at first with the metal and build up to a pressure that's comfortable for you, that works fine.</p></div>		</li>
