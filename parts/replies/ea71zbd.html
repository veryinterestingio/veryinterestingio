			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very good explanation. I have depression and get pissed at myself because I am unable to complete simple tasks. It's frustrating much like having the flu and not being able to do jack.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What upsets me the most about my depression bouts is how I pushed away so many people I cared about. They would get in touch with me and I would normally love to hear from them. Why I did that, I honestly won't understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me, it’s because doing anything to help the friendship feels like “work”.  I feel guilty because I don’t have much to offer right now. I know what I <em>should</em> do to be a good friend but it would be insincere at best. My body and mind want to hibernate but I know I should call my friend and listen to their issues with work. Or hear about how amazing-balls their 3-year old is.  And when I struggle to just get through my day and am constantly tired, it feels like too much to lie and pretend interest in that. Then I feel guilty for being a shitty friend.  So I do it. And actually feel better because I allowed new thoughts into my head.  And the next day I wake up extra tired.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Emotional law of inertia. Any emotional state will naturally try to perpetuate itself. Depressed people do things to make them more depressed, happy people do things to make them more happy, angry people do things to make them more angry, etc. If a state gets sufficiently deep, it takes outside intervention or consciously forcing yourself to take actions you don't feel like taking in order to change state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it's a terrible system that feeds into each other. The depression saps our will to do anything, we get mad or ashamed at ourselves for it, and in turn that makes us more self-defeating and it's even harder to do things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually why in CBT, or at least in the book about CBT, it was suggested to do one thing, like a small thing, and that can help break the seal so you actually do some other stuff. It's also why I find the Pomodoro method and UFYH(UnF*ckYourHabitat) are the methods I suggest most to people with depression, especially comorbid depression bundled with anxiety, adhd, asd, bipolar, etc. Neither require lots of prep or focus or preplanning, you can do a barebones version with your phone or a kitchen timer, and you can literally commit 15 minutes at a time, which doesn't feel like a long time on paper but you'd be surprised how much of a difference it'll make in your environment. That 15 minutes or 1 thing, essentially sets the wheels in motion to do more.</p>
<p>For people with ADHD there is also a severe lack of dopamine rewards and depression often deals with an imbalance of dopamine/serotonin/other brain chemicals and either your body doesn't produce enough, or your brain isn't uptaking enough, or your brain doesn't recognize the chemicals it has. For ADHD it manifests as a focus on novel tasks like video games, that feel more rewarding than un-novel tasks, like doing the dishes. For depression, when comorbid it can come from anxiety and stress around not doing those dishes, or even forgetting to do basic stuff because adhd makes your brain go &quot;yeah that isn't important&quot; so you just completely forget shit because the focus and reward to help you remember it, it just didn't happen.</p>
<p>I think also a lot of the spiral comes from the anxiety and stress about that initial decision to like, not go to class or call out from work. The internalizing of that decision for say, someone with high self esteem might be along the lines of &quot;I'm tired and I deserve a day off&quot; while depression is more like &quot;what's wrong with me, why didn't I go to work? Ugh I'm so lazy and terrible.&quot;</p>
<p>I have done so much research at this point but I still struggle with feeling crappy when I feel like I never get enough done so, progress but knowing the mechanisms doesn't exactly magically cure anyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What got me out of the worst of it was going for small victories. And what really helped me was running. Going out and running, regardless of speed or duration or feeling like physical death was creeping closer, was victory. Ten minute jog? Victory. Foot hurt so I aborted? Still went, victory.</p>
<p>And you get better rapidly, which helps.</p>
<p>For you, it may be something else. </p>
<p>(If you do go running, buy good running shoes and just follow a couch-to-5k plan, repeating days and weeks as necessary. There's no rush, and no judgement.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes this is how I feel and I hate it because I don’t consider myself to be lazy but just doing nothing and not being able to find the energy to get myself up makes me feel disappointed in myself because I know I can do better but I also can’t, if that makes sense</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's one of the best analogies I've heard.  What's really hard is, when you hit that space, it's unbelievably hard to find the right resources (therapist, doctor, etc.) to help get you healthy again. Because you can't do anything. So you can end up stuck for longer than necessary. I had to find my support team during a period when I was up, and now they're on speed-dial. Having learned that, I've helped people find support when they were down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I don't believe that people can break ankles. I mean look at you making a big deal about hobbling round. We all get sprains from time to time and we just get on with things. It's like you're just doing it for the attention. You've got a good job and a nice house, what have you got to have a broken ankle about? Some people have <em>real</em> problems you know. </p></div>		</li>
