<p>Buying it is just an excuse to show off how rich you are.</p>

<p>Traffic.org, a leading NGO in countering wildlife crime, concurs. Rhino horn is mainly used as a status symbol </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Demand for rhino horn as a luxury purchase by upper-middle class
citizens in Viet Nam, including professional businessmen, celebrities
and Government officials, has been identified as the strongest driver
of the current rhino poaching crisis</p>
<p>A consumer research study, conducted in 2013, surveyed 720 individuals in Hanoi and
Ho Chi Minh City and discovered that rhino horn users value this item because of its
significance from a social point of view. Buyers and users of rhino horn form a powerful
social network consisting of important individuals with whom it is crucial to maintain good
relationships. Rhino horns are sometimes bought for the sole purpose of being gifted to
others; to family members, business colleagues or people in positions of authority. Those
purchasing rhino horn believe that owning rhino horn, as well as being able to purchase it
for others, reaffirms their social status and strengthens the bonds among peers within their
particular network. People involved in these activities are usually familiar with each other
and trusted within their social circle even though they are engaging in an illegal activity.</p>
<p>Rhino horn consumers are currently seen as influential people within Vietnamese society.
Educated, successful and powerful individuals are the main market for the horns which
come all the way from Africa to satisfy high local demand.</p>
<p>Users of rhino horn are generally health conscious and want to maintain or enhance
a healthy lifestyle for themselves and their loved ones. While their main reason for
purchasing rhino horn is to reaffirm their social status, this is supported by an underlying
belief in health benefits. Users believe rhino horn possesses properties that detoxify the
body and can therefore cure anything from a hangover to serious illnesses. Consumers
feel that having rhino horn at home ensures the well-being of their families.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's how the OGs in Asia think and I absolutely hate it. It's all about status and face. They will go through all this ridiculous shit to uphold thsse pẻrceptions of themselves. My dad is one of them, he buys bear bile, bird nest soup, tiger gland, etc. What's commonly done is that these products are put into foods or most commonly placed into liquor. They don't get that putting any living matter in alcohol makes it useless but OGs don't like logic and only care about hierarchy, you will never ever be right or convince them of anything they don't think themselves. So you have a generation of people who care very greatly about their status and are completely willfully ignorant to facts that don't line up with this rigid hierarchy that they uphold. This won't get better until they simply pass on and bring their ways with them. But as of now, because of our culture they are held to the highest regard, and their ignorance is celebrated amongst themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well said.  nice to have an inside voice say this so it doesn't sound racist.  you are sadly correct, we just have to wait for the older generations to die off and take this bullshit with them.  i hope the rhinos can last that long.  also, i'm really looking forward to what china will look like in 40 years...  if humanity lasts that long.</p></div>		</li>
