<p>It‚Äôs much easier for a service department to have the parts and expertise available for one manufacturer,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and another interesting thing with that, IIRC, certain manufacturers are getting involved at the trade school level.  </p>
<p>So for example, you go to one of these schools like UTI, and say they have a partnership with Ford.  The students take a course actually developed with input from Ford, working on Ford cars, and using the same equipment that's standard at a Ford dealer.  At the end, the students leave as &quot;ford certified mechanics&quot;.</p>
<p>Doesn't mean they don't know how to work on cars other than Fords.  Just means by having that cert:</p>
<p>Dealerships benefit from knowing a standard baseline expectation of what their new hires can do.</p>
<p>Graduates benefit because that industry recognized piece of paper saying what they know how to do, makes its easier for them to get hired</p>
<p>The trade school benefits, because &quot;you'll get your cert&quot; gives the school a clear &quot;this is why you should come here.  This is what you'll leave with that will get you a job&quot;.  Makes it easier for them to get students.</p>
<p>All that said, kinda good for the customer too, in that the customer gets this peace of mind that &quot;ok when I go to a Ford service center, they'll know what they're doing, specifically trained on my kind of vehicle&quot;</p>
<p>(and that in turn is desirable to the dealership, because they get you coming in paying for service instead of hitting up jiffy lube or whatever; which again in turn is desirable for the dealers AND the Manufacturer, because keeping you coming in regularly for all your car related maintenance needs keeps that relationship going in your head, so when its time to think about getting a NEW car, they already have this head start over their competition.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>actually one more note, this reminds me of a History channel doc ;Harley and the Davidsons that touched on a similar idea.</p>
<p>Basically Harley Davidson was competing for an Army contract against some other make.  Supposedly they gave the Army a great price and then offered to put together a Harley field mechanic course that would be provided to the Army free of charge, taught by Harley mechanics.  </p>
<p>Idea being, Harley was sacrificing some profit up front to get the deal, but it was a strategy play.  Harley was counting on all those Americans back home and Harley being the bike they're already well familiar with.  Thus making the brand a household name.  (Gillette razors supplied the troops in a similar though process I think)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only problem I've seen with that is, they mainly get trained on the newest models. Once your car reaches 5+ years of age, you're better off taking it to an independent shop, where they're likely to have a wide variety of seasoned techs from a wide variety of backgrounds. I used to work at a Honda dealership as a tech on the express side, the mainline shop had a grand total of one technician that had been working on Hondas for a couple decades. The rest had just a few years of experience and if a 2012 Civic rolled in, they knew as much about how to work on it as anyone else would.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Honestly dude, what quality education doesn't focus more on new more complex models than focusing on older ones? You can often easily backtrack in the tech, but you're still going to see a ton of new shit and need to understand it.</p>
<p>Cars are complicated as fuck. First-hand experience is how you learn to do shit like that man, you can't go to school and learn how to service 30+ years of models in a reasonable time-frame.</p>
<p>I'm in tech but we don't spend extra years learning how to support and work with decades old tech, we touch on concepts that are different and then leave it as outside of legacy shit you're going to learn on the job, it's largely useless today as the industry has changed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why would the manufacturer care whether I have my car serviced by the Certified Ford Mechanics at the dealership or by the Certified Ford Mechanics at the local independent shop? I'm still getting my maintenance needs taken care of by someone with a big Ford sticker in the window, and the local independent shop is a lot less likely to lie to me about what my car needs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The dealer cares, because its good business for the dealer.  The manufacturer cares less, but they still care because the manufacturer wants to help the dealer succeed.  Its part of the portfolio the manufacturer sells TO the dealer.  When dealers are deciding who to align with &quot;and this is the revenue we'll help you generate in your service dept&quot; is part of the pitch/package.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, keeping you coming back to a branded dealership for all your car related needs, like I said, reinforces the relationship that makes it easier to keep you with the brand for your next car. </p>
<p>AND, getting the work done at a dealership benefits the manufacturer by making it more likely your parts will be OEM direct from the Manufacturer. </p>
<p>But I don't know where THIS is coming from</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Because that's a general stereotype, and while yes some mechanic shops are honest and some are not, whether they are honest is in no way dependent on whether they are indy or not.  &quot;JimBob's Tire and Auto&quot; is no more or less likely to lie to you than the service dept at &quot;Jim Robertson Dallas Ford&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the Ford dealer sells actual Ford parts from their factories so they make money off of it. Ever go into an auto part store and they always have multiple selections of the same part at different price points? That's because you're getting oem parts made by a third party and the name brand doesn't see any of that and thats where your other then dealer auto service centers get parts ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p></div>		</li>
