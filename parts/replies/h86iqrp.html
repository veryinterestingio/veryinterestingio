			<div class="markdown"><p>Id say its simply due to the similarities.</p>
<p>In japanese you have two words for emperor: 天皇 (Tennō), which is exclusively the japanese exmperor, and 皇帝 (kōtei), which is any non-japanese emperor.</p>
<p>We call tennō (天皇) emperor as its the most accurate tingle word for it. If you take it apart you get 天, roughly  „godly“, „divine“, and 皇, „ruler“, „sovereign“. So in that sense you could translate it as divine sovereign, and well, we have a word for that, which also describes the political position of ruling several smaller states quite accurately, and thats emperor</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is thinking of Japan as one thing.</p>
<p>Much like China, Japan for most of it's history was functionally more like a conglomeration of Japanese states ruled by generals or local lords rather than a country. It makes more sense for the guy in charge of most or all of those the be an emperor, consolidating various daimyo and their resources. It becomes even more fitting once they move into Okinawa, Korea, Manchuria, etc.</p>
<p>Then you have the cultural aspect mentioned in other comments about the deific nature of the emperor and the mandate of heaven and all that.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The rather anticlimactic answer to most questions like this is: because the white guy who wrote it down first decided to translate it that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really loved how it let us know Toranaga secretly loved Blackthorne for saying there's an excuse for rebellion if you win. Yabu and Omi if I recall spelling had some crazy moments as well. It's always nice to bump into people who appreciate that book :) Made my night actually.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I suppose, and many would vie for the title of emperor at certain points in earlier historical times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually they didn't. No one wanted to be emperor. The emperor's life was just full of endless tradition and ceremony, and was very tedious. Most people only lasted about 10-20 years in the role until they wanted to resign. What they'd actually do is get themselves into the imperial family by marriage or similar means, and then become reagent, gaining all the power, without the ceremonial responsibilites. Afterwards, their family members would be emperor, usually with a family patriarch doing the real ruling behind the scenes.</p>
<p>This is actually the primary reason that Japan can claim a single imperial line that lasts 1,500 years. Because it was much more preferable to marry into the family instead of killing it.</p></div>		</li>
