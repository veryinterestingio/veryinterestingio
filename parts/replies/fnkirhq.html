			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the definition of humor that it's a feeling of relief when we realize we don't need to learn something from an <a href="https://definitionmining.com/index.php/2018/01/01/beauty-and-humor/" target="_blank">unexpected observation</a>. Which is what a punchline is:</p>
<ul>
<li>We're hearing a story</li>
<li>Things are getting weird or unexpected</li>
<li>Which probably means our expectations about the world are wrong, and we might need to update our ideas to match these new details</li>
<li>Then the punchline reveals that there's some contradiction or the original story intentionally ommited a key detail or something, and it makes sense again</li>
<li>And there's a release of that feeling like the world doesn't make sense</li>
</ul>
<p>We've just recognized this pattern and now construct jokes to fit it. I also think that's why it's so hard to remember jokes, the humor is feeling of not having to remember.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, exactly!</p>
<p>But the question we should ask isn't just &quot;what's funny&quot;, but &quot;why are those things humorous?&quot; What makes a benign violation funny?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://leeds-faculty.colorado.edu/mcgrawp/Benign_Violation_Theory.html" target="_blank">a violation refers</a> to anything that threatens one’s beliefs about how the world should be. That is, something seems threatening, unsettling, or wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, that's any situation where our expectations about the world are incorrect, which is usually a situation where we'd have to update our expectations/learn a lesson/etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For a violation to produce humor it also needs to be perceived as benign. That is, it needs to seem okay, safe, or acceptable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We need to see something wrong with the world, but perceive that it's actually acceptable. Either it turns out it fits in with our worldview, or the original perception was flawed or misleading in someway.</p>
<p>Personally, I don't like the term &quot;Violation&quot; because it implies not just breaking the rules, but something negative. In the strict definition used here it works well, but it's more difficult to use in general. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most people wouldn't think of a pun as a violation. They're not against grammatical rules. In fact one example given of a &quot;violation&quot;  for puns is &quot;alternative norms&quot;. But following a different set of rules isn't a violation of rules. It's like saying American football is a violation of international football rules, it's not a violation, it's just a different set of rules that are being followed (at least in normal usage of the term)</li>
<li>Violation can also be normal. There's lots of places where human rights are violated regularly, or are implicitly or explicitly endorsed by the people in power. The fact that they're normal and/or accepted or even viewed as &quot;benign&quot; doesn't make them not violations</li>
</ul></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In hotel management school, we were responsible for running the cafeteria as a reasonably formal restaurant (in some ways). Every day, we had to set all the tables and the instructors would go around and check spacing and all that. We got really fast at it - one person would place forks, the next would place knives, etc. The last person would check each setting to make sure it was properly spaced and make minor corrections. </p>
<p>One day, we got the assignment to set the tables with the forks and knives reversed. A very simple thing, just put the utensil the same way, but on the other side of the setting. It took us more than twice as long.</p></div>		</li>

At the time I only had a crappy black and white tv to play it on, and it actually added to the atmosphere; even now when I see screen grabs of it in colour it looks too bright and harsh.</p></div>		</li>
