			<div class="markdown"><p>Legit, I learned this stuff from watching Dr. Stone, and they used a hunk of glass and a diamond wedding ring. </p>
<p>Although, I have heard about irl experiments to try and use this technique to get sounds in ancient pottery to try and listen to conversations thousands of years old. Idk how that went.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. I just looked it up. I guess that didn't go anywhere. Makes sense, I guess. Not like they were intentionally pressing vibrating needles into their pots as they spun, or something like that. Ah, well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a show ages ago which supposed that stone walls in old buildings could have absorbed sound waves and could be played somehow to hear the recording.  I do remember hearing the same hypothesis for pottery, and IIRC someone &quot;played&quot; a piece of pottery and heard the sound of a dog barking.  I'm sure that result is open to a wide range of criticism, haha!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand OP's question just a bit, I get how you make the first record by carving it with a needle being driven by the actual sound, but how do you make +10k such records? Do they just carve a bunch of discs ising the same process or is there some process where they then map the surface of the original disc and then carve that into other discs somehow during mass production? If so, what does that process and equipment look like?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds easy enough. But I must admit, if someone described either the first cut process or the mass production process as well as how the records are actually played to me in a universe where none of this stuff had been invented I would have guess that none of it would result in a record that can be played by dragging a needle through it. Like how do the physical dimensions of the cut on a Whitney Houston record singing I Will Always Love You differ from one in which you have Mariah Carey singing the same song/notes/words? It seems like capturing such subtleties with such simple processes and materials would be impossible. Comparing it to another example, precision measurement tools like calipers or micrometers are generally considered to be insufficient for really precise measurements when made out of plastic. But somehow plastic records can capture such subtle differences inside of a tiny little grove that can be played back with mass produced needles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, than makes a chain of opposite molds (grooves&gt;ridges&gt;grooves&gt;ridges), so the final stamper has ridges, and is stamped in a blob of vinyl plastic, which ends up with grooves closely resembling the initially cut master. Closely, in that there is inevitable some imperfection in the mold copying process. Not to mention as you copy one mother (first positive copy from master) many times, it will wear some.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well there’s clearly a certain shape in vinyl that makes vibrations sound like your favourite artist. So theoretically you could compose a song just by etching into the vinyl and have it sound like a famous artist. Next to impossible, but on paper it’s theoretically possible.</p></div>		</li>
