			<div class="markdown"><p>You are 100% correct that there was a societal shift to getting up during the middle of the night and doing stuff, but it too was simply us humans changing our sleep pattern to societal norms as you’ve pointed out we still do today. </p>
<p>Humans are hardwired for biphasic sleep, but that is one big block of 7-8hrs (rare genetically gifted people can get by on 6 hrs without consequence but that’s some stupidly low number of people) and then secondary sleep period in the afternoon. Siesta, nap time what ever you want to call it. </p>
<p>Edit: for clarification as I wrote it terribly above, I shouldn’t have said get by with 6 hrs of sleep. These rare genetically different people can sleep for only 6 hours but with the same benefit everyone else gets from sleeping the full 7-8hrs. </p>
<p>But like you said earlier, we humans shape our sleep around society and not the other way around. (Tsk tsk.) so not many people get the second sleep that we are hardwired for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also since you seem to be interested, look up professor Nathaniel kleitman and Bruce Richardson’s 1938 sleep experiment from the university of Chicago. It’s an interesting look at how the body sleeps when not affected by light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That it backs up a lot of what I’m saying?
The average sleep was between (on mobile so trying to remember) 5.7 - 7.1 hrs of sleep and was not interrupted by extended periods of wakefulness. Also if you see some of my other comments I also mentioned that temperature is a big signal to your body to wake up. </p>
<p>Once again, I’m not saying you can’t sleep less than 7hrs, I’m saying for the average person they will not receive the full benefits of sleep with less than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I’m not saying you can’t get by on 6 hrs, I’m saying that it isn’t sufficient and you won’t receive the same benefits as someone who sleeps for longer unless you are apart of the aforementioned genetically lucky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man I feel way less crazy now.  My cat tends to wake me up at 3 or 4 and I usually just read for an hour or fuck around on reddit then sleep another couple hours again.  And sometimes with WFH, take a 25 min nap at lunch, or around 5 or 6pm.</p></div>		</li>
