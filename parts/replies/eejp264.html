			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the man who has spent the most time in space is a Russian Cosmonaut named Gennady Padalka, at 879 days in space. I can't find anything about how much time dilation he's experienced, however the dude who previously held the record for most time in space (and therefore the most time dilation experienced) was in space for 132 fewer days, and wikipedia says that he experienced time dilation of ~20 milliseconds, meaning he aged by ~20 milliseconds less than he would have on earth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well unless you consider biological aging. He was exposed to more radiation which makes your body age (biologically). So although he is younger in years, he might die earlier. Speaking oversimplified.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but that's adding a whole other layer of complexity to it. Technically speaking, he is younger than he would otherwise have been, as you can't really account for biological factors that influence ageing in the same way you can measure time dilation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, although they should be a few seconds older because of time passing faster higher up the gravity well, the speed of the ISS slows down time slightly more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but large chunks of time in zero gravity are worse on a persons body than age.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't find the link but there was a clip or an article I saw about an astronaut who spent a significant amount of time in space and when he came back down to Earth, he sort of lost function of his legs. It atrophied or something? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They ISS is very close to earth. And still well within it’s gravity.  Astronauts aren’t in Zero g. It just feels like it because they are falling sideways all the time.  A Twinn on the ISS would be a little younger than his twin on earth</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally the twin should be slightly older because at that altitude time runs slightly faster, but as the iss is moving slightly faster he aged a bit less. </p></div>		</li>
