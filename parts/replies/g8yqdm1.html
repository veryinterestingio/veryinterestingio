<p>Births are, in my experience, not the happy joyful events TV makes them out to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry you had a scary experience. :( </p>
<p>I was working as a doula at the time and noticed it at a few different births. I was lucky to just be there for support and encouragement, not doing the work of birthing or making medical decisions about anyone in the room.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for saying this. What I understood from giving birth:  how people can be tortured/in pain until they will do or say anything to make it stop.   It was a terrible experience and one I chose to never repeat.   Love my daughter but getting her into the world was terrible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! I have 2 beautiful children but both labours felt horrific pain-wise, to the point where I begged them to just cut the baby out and I’d had enough, it felt like my brain was going to explode with the pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! I knew babe would come out slimy and gross, but when the dr plops that babe on your chest they start out a grey/purple colour. Not something that’s talked about a lot in pregnancy, and is fascinating to watch no matter how many times you experience it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I (husband at wife’s head) forgot I was told they came out grey and covered in goo. I have awful dry skin and was mortified he had some variation of it. They wiped him off and he was already turning pink when they handed him to us. Got his momma’s skin.</p></div>		</li>
