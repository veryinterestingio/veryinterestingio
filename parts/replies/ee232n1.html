			<div class="markdown"><p>I caught the Swine flu when I was around 20 and it felt like there was a real chance I might actually die. I always get a flu shot now. People act like it's inconvenient but you can get one at most pharmacies (or any doctor's office), generally in 15 minutes or less. It's much better than going through days worth of hell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My work has a flu clinic come in every year. It's so convenient. Literally write my name down on a block of time, and take a sheet and fill it out at my desk. Once the time comes, walk up to the front of the building, sit down, and within minutes you're done. No waiting in line, you don't have to make a special trip to somewhere just to get the vaccine. It's so easy that I ask my coworkers that don't get the shot -- why? It couldn't be easier. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget some people who claim to have gotten the flu after getting vaccinated are mistaken.  The &quot;stomach flu&quot; (gastroenteritis) is not influenza and is not prevented by the flu vaccine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, picked up a stomach bug at Christmas that infected several family members and one of my sisters kept referring to it as flu and I was like no, not flu, norovirus, there's a difference. Flu isn't in and out of you within 24-48hrs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, in Spanish is gastroenteritis but it's also called &quot;gripe estomacal&quot;, which translates to stomach flu. It's not well used though, it's an old habit.</p>
<p>I'm suffering that right now, this is the third day and I want to die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. And real flu can be debilitating for a long time - when I had proper influenza, it knocked me out for 2 weeks in the first instance and led to a post viral syndrome that lasted for months. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And that's for a fairly strong and healthy adult. On children, older and weaker people, it will mean death. And by not getting vaccinated, you may survive the flu, but you run the chance of helping it spread to someone else who won't.</p></div>		</li>
