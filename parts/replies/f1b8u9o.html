			<div class="markdown"><p>Look at it like a funhouse mirror - the light bounces (kinda) at a certain angle based on where you're standing and what you're looking at. If either thing moves, it all kinda shifts. </p>
<p>But it's not random. It's just round, so you always get a full circle (half usually covered by the horizon) of red, yellow, green, blue. You're always in the centre of it, because that's the ones sending those wavelengths to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>basically, the slight difference in angles between your eye and the droplets means the ones at the bottom/inside edge are shining more red light, and the top/outside more blue. Its like when light shines through a window with angled cuts and makes rainbow/diffraction patterns. Stand in one spot youll get more red light shined into your eye, slightly to the side, more blue. Its also why one eye might see a red glint, while the other sees a different color(yellow, green, blue, etc).</p>
<p>Rainbows be like that, except many smaller windows across a much larger area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When light hits a water droplet the light passes from one side of the drop to the other, then leaves the surface of the drop refracted into its different colored components (1st rainbow).</p>
<p>But not all of the light makes it out. A fraction of the light is reflected internally off the interface between the drop and the air. After bouncing off the interface, it hits another place within the drop and is refracted out (2nd rainbow). The second rainbow is always fainter because it's a smaller fraction of the total light.</p>
<p>This is not a 100% accurate description but the general idea is correct. It's caused by light reflecting multiple times within a droplet.</p></div>		</li>
