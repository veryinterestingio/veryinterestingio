			<div class="markdown"><p>My 10yo daughter had one on her nose that appeared shortly after birth.  It was somewhat aggressive. If we hadn't done anything, it would have grown into the cartilage in her nose.</p>
<p>The doc gave her propranolol and basically it just went away for the most part.  We then used lasers to make the rest of it go away.  You can still tell a little bit that something is different about her nose as compared to her sisters, but only barely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for using its name, I had no idea what it was called! I had a big one of these as a kid on the back of my neck and had it removed in high school when my hair started catching in it and making it bleed (plus I was super self-conscious about wearing my hair in a ponytail). The skin started to grow up again about 4 years later and I had it removed/cauterized again, and I haven't had a problem since.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For what reason, other than aesthetic, would you want to treat the second kind?</p>
<p>I have one on my scalp, but it doesn't bother me because it's always covered by my hair. Is there a health benefit to removing it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can bleed a lot if damaged... Well more so than surrounding tissue. They can also grow down and attach themselves in cartilage. Mostly aesthetic though especially if they are on the face.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have one that partially went away. The area now is super sensitive. It is on my leg and even just someone resting their hand on the area bothers me. Dont get me started if i bump it on something. It is pretty large though (palm sized) so maybe that is why? Also the veins are huge. They look as big as the veins in the crook of my arm. I am afraid to treat it though because i am scared of how much the lasers or injections would hurt since it is so sensitive already.</p></div>		</li>
