			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually. The sound is from bubbles of water vapor forming and then quickly collapsing again. The collapsing of the bubble has a water hammer effect. The sound is loudest at about 70c because the forming/collapsing happens a lot faster then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh, that's interesting. So the water is &quot;loudest&quot; at a point it's nowhere near boiling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not the temp of the water. It rate at which heat can transfer from the source into the water. That heat flux determines what temp you will get subcooled nucleate boiling. It's just that the majority of cooking pots/pans and stove combos will give you the same range of heat flexes. But a very thin aluminum pan on a very hot high BTU burner will causes subcooled boiling at a lower water temp than a thick cast iron cauldron/Dutch oven. </p>
<p>The boiling needs two parts, the temp of the water and the heat flux. It also changes based on the pressure on top of the water, such as in a boiling vessel like a pressure canner and the level of impurities in the water. Also using a very rough surface on the pot will induce boiling at lower temps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the point where the most amount of bubbles form and collapse. I think it's about 70 degrees Celsius. Go on YouTube and search thunderf00t and boiling kettle or something. He has great slow motion footage</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, cavitation is usually due to pressure drops I think. But same effect in a way with the bubbles collapsing.</p></div>		</li>
