			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Because you couldn’t always tell if the house was on fire or not. I’m 49 years old and I can vividly see the teachers who told us this. I mean, I’m over it, but man, it did a trip on me when I was a kid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm 39 and used to lay there at night and if my room got super hot (because the air conditioning duct to my room was shit) I would be terrified that the house was on fire but nobody knew, and just rehearse in my head how to get me and my stuffed animals out. I ended up with a lot of insomnia over that bullshit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont know if others have said this in the thread, but here's my input..</p>
<p>As a firefighter (well, almost. Nearly have my certification!) We have to engage with the community. It's incredibly important that there's a good connection between us and those who we serve, afterall we are a public department (not all but most major cities). Therefore there are different initiatives to building relationships with the community.</p>
<p>One of these is to go to school and teach kids things like what to do if there's a fire or emergency. That makes me think that most people learned this through the FD, NOT the schools. Even if the schools themselves taught it, there is probably a decent chance the fire department went and organized lessons that can be taught and worked with the community to spread the information.</p>
<p>The lack of other important life skills falls upon our education system, but I think without the fire department this also wouldnt be that big of a trend. Of course there's other reasons like have been posted in the thread, but this is my take.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know the signs near elevators that say in case of fires use stairs not elevator. I recently found out why, I think from Reddit. If you know why, you will never consider getting on an elevator in a fire.</p>
<p>If you are on the 15th floor and there is a fire on floor 9, someone on floor 9 went to the elevator and pushed the button, then ran for the stairway because the fire got big. You get on on 15 and press 1, but the elevator stops on 9 because the button was pushed. Now you push the &quot;close door&quot; button, but the door won't close because the smoke occludes the electric eye. You can't leave and the floor is on fire. Now you know why. (PS the firemen can use the elevator because they have a key that turns off the electric eye.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah elevators during a fire are an extremely bad idea. In most cases even firefighters wont use elevators - if they do it will only go until a couple of floors below the fire floor where they may stage a medical center. The biggest problem is how hot it can get on a fire floor. If you take the elevator onto the fire floor, the doors can open and the superheated gases enter the elevator and that's the end of you. Plus fire can mess with electrical systems that allow elevators to function, or similarly their mechanical systems. If possible we much rather use the stairs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a product out recently about this. It listens for fire alarms. And will shut your door for you if it hears one. I think it had a light and a siren to wake you up too. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's to slow the spread of the fire. Many buildings have doors held open with magnets that release when there's a signal from the fire alarm panel. They also shut down air circulation fans to stop from fueling the fire with constant fresh oxygen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>haha agreed</p>
<p>I don't have the product, but the explanation does make it sound fairly safe. You've likely used spring loaded(self closing) doors 1000 times without noticing. That's all this is. You install it, open the door(which winds the spring and sets it), then when the alarm hits, it allows the spring to slowly close the door.</p></div>		</li>
