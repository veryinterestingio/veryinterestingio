			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember seeing a fairly brief interview with one about 10 years ago.  She was pretty interesting.  She talked about the movies/tv shoes she worked on and her process.  It was a very analog tagging system and she had three short lists of cool songs that were separated based on license costs/terms.</p></div>		</li>

<p>many radio stations employ them too</p>

<p>Then why do most commercial radio stations play the same old songs over and over again (or the same new songs, for that matter)?  Even Sirius XM satellite radio does this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good point. I guess some radio stations may be 'incentivised' (maybe monetarily? Maybe they have an understanding of their core listeners and cater to that market?) to play certain music? Either way, I love cats, I wouldn't mind Jersey, so take great, great, great care, u/katfromjersey !</p></div>		</li>
