			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know where you got 27 MBps from, but the bluray spec puts 1x speed at 36 Mbps according to Wikipedia (4.5 MBps). Bluray video players should be a minimum of 2x, but the spec goes up to 16x (68 MBps).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>where reads can reach 100MB/s or faster</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a massive understatement. It's a <em>lot</em> faster than 100 MBps. My games drive reads at 2700 MBps. Similar (but newer drives) go up to 3500 MBps. Expensive, specialised drives can go over 5 GBps before you get out of reach of top end enthusiast budgets.</p>
<p>That puts my hard drive at just shy of 40 times faster than the fastest bluray spec (600 times the base spec) and modern m2 drives at 51 times the speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're confusing Megabytes with Megabits here. 8 megabits = 1 megabyte. Consoles have 2x drives (9 megabytes), 7200 rpm hard drives usually can read in speeds of about 100 megabytes. the blu rays, in a 16x drive (which cost a lot) have a speed cap of around 72 megabytes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I'm not. I'm very specifically using B for byte and b for bit. None of the hard drives I'm talking about have RPM because spinning disks are incredibly slow compared to SSDs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spinning disks cap out at about 100MBps.  Good quality ssds can reach up to 500MBps on sata or up to 3GBps on pcie.  </p>
<p>There is also a difference between the max speed protocol supports and what the device can actually reach and no ssd can currently max out the pcie bandwidth without implementing raid internally.  Most people think that devices can reach the max protocol speed when its just not true.  </p>
<p>Consoles are all sata based and ship with spinning disks.  Computers can use either sata or pcie but reaching the theoretical speed requires an optimal use case that is almost nonexistent in real world usage.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not talking about the maximum speed of the interface, I'm talking about the advertised speed of drives for sale. Sure, you're unlikely to get it maxed, and certainly not continuously, but you won't be off by the kind of factors you're talking about here without being able to get your money back for false advertising. My m2 drive gets 2500 MBps read under tests easily. PCIe drives with GBps speed do raid internally, but that doesn't make them any less real.</p></div>		</li>
