			<div class="markdown"><p>I would also guess, and this is <em>purely</em> a guess, that it can also do with the intensity of the burn (concentration of capsaicin) and your tolerance. You can absolutely build up a tolerance to it by constantly exposing your mouth to more frequent and higher concentrations of capsaicin. I've done a very basic test with some friends before with absurdly hot sauce. Just a controlled volume directly onto the tongue. Doing so, the people who had the highest tolerance felt the burn immediately, but the intensity was actually lower and it went away faster. The lower tolerance people didn't experience anything initially, but felt a significantly more intense burn... So I hypothesize that the nerves that handle signaling capsaicin go into overload and temporarily top signaling with too intense a heat, then all fire at once when the come &quot;back online&quot; so to speak. While people with a higher tolerance have nerves more capable of handling it, so respond immediately. During this time, the sauce also can spread more before everything fires, leading to a more intense punch once the nerves start firing again.</p>
<p>I'd like to, once again, emphasize this is a hypothesis from a <em>very</em> informal experiment though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely.  I've always liked spicy food but I've been steadily increasing the heat levels over the years.  Things that I used to consider &quot;pretty hot&quot; don't even phase me these days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>100%. I used to find Dentyne gum too spicy to chew and I'd have to slowly suck on it to only release a little bit of spicyness at a time. One day I accidentally ate an entire spoonful of garlic chili sauce and I've been the top spicy eater in my family ever since.</p>
<p>Just start with something easy like Sriracha then move on to jalapeños, then habanero, thai chili, etc.  I say this because with sauces, you can control the amount with Sriracha but with peppers, you either get one that has nothing or might be hell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely! I can handle really spicy food now but I don’t do it too often because often it hurts my stomach or esophagus even if I didn’t feel the spice in my mouth. Fortunately I don’t get that “2nd burn” after going to the bathroom, just good ole heartburn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't see that holding up though, at least from my experience. </p>
<p>There are some mildly spicy foods where the burn (though mild) is immediate and up front, while other, very spicy foods, will have almost no burning at all until after it's been chewed and swallowed. And also in the other direction, where it doesn't kick in right away, but there's a delayed, mild heat, and when your mouth is on fire instantly. </p>
<p>Then there are some where the burn is consistent, no matter how much you eat, while others start off mild and build up to a point where your mouth is completely on fire. </p>
<p>My guess, just based on experience, is that sugar and fat make a huge difference in how and when the spice kicks in, and how much it builds on itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't really comment on the 'reaction speed' on spicy food, but your comment on sugar and fat making a difference is very much true in 'hotness level' in general; more fat (butter) makes milder sauce; more vinegar makes hotter. (From my experience with wing sauces in restaurants). </p>
<p>Wether or not those actually affect the 'speed' the spice hits, I can't say. The topic seems quite interesting, especially due to apparent lack of research papers on the subject. Anecdoticly I can say for sure I've faced quickly and slower acting hotness, can't elaborate on the  preparation of those sauces/dishes though.</p>
<p>Just my 2c as a semi hot-sauce fan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like your hypothesis is right in a way. Lower pH increases binding affinity of capsaicin to its receptor and leaves channels open longer. I wouldn't phrase it quite that way though. It's not that lower pH allows for greater recruitment or faster recruitment but rather that capsaicin is more likely to randomly bump into and form a complex with its receptor. As for nerves &quot;resetting&quot; faster, I'd say that any kind of neurally based negative feedback is pretty distanced from the pH of the mouth, most circuits are far from their receptor location. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right?! I love it when the ELI5 response is followed up by more detail and a better explanation. The whole point of ELI5 is to help introduce and explain to people a variety of subjects that would've otherwise been inaccessible, and the follow up can spark an interest in something that some people would've just written off as &quot;too hard&quot;. I've personally learned a lot from this sub in subjects I wouldn't have expected to enjoy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not sure what the experiential effects of the “nerve resetting’ are, but the study you linked claims that a lower pH contributes to shorter closures of the channel. The “capsaicin receptors” tend to open (activating the spicy receptor) then close and stay closed for a duration afterwards. Lower pH causes the amount of time the channel stays closed to decrease, so it is able to be activated again much more quickly. Idk if that added anything or not, but it seems like vinegar would make the spicy feeling more intense because, among other things, the receptor is spending more time being “activated”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From wikipedia- The most commonly occurring capsaicinoids are capsaicin (69%), dihydrocapsaicin (22%), nordihydrocapsaicin (7%), homocapsaicin (1%), and homodihydrocapsaicin (1%)</p>
<p>As someone who has eaten a vast variety of the hottest chillies known to man, and made sauces from nearly all of them, the variety and therefore the type of capsaicin is probably the reason for the differing burns. </p>
<p>Something like a 7pot (1m-1.8m shu depending on subspecies and my personal favourite chillies for the heat profile and flavour) has a slow building burn similar to that of an oven. The heat is hot if that makes sense. When you breathe out, it literally feels like your mouth is an oven. Can wreak havoc on your throat for a solid 10mins tho)</p>
<p>A scorpion on the other hand (1m-2.1m shu) has an intense and instant needling heat. Similar to what you would imagine eating a wasp nest would feel like. Ever been stung by a wasp? Imagine that coating your mouth for a solid 10mins. </p>
<p>There are some, like the Bhut Jolokia (ghost pepper) and the Carolina Reaper that can induce a mixture of the two, but for stark contrast those two are an easy deal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is a 7pot, and by shu do you mean scoville heat units?</p>
<p>Also do you have any resources for the different heat types of peppers? Scorpions are as you described for me, and anything from the habanero family is more of the slow buildup</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>7pot is a Capsicum Chinense originally from Trinidad i believe. Quick info search says it got it's name from its ability to heat 7 pots of food. They use it in military grade pepper spray and as an addition to marine paint to inhibit barnacle growth. We eat the little fuckers.</p>
<p>Shu is indeed heat units. </p>
<p>Only evidence I have is anecdotal from myself and my mate who regularly enjoy punishing ourselves. Good for a cheap high and tasty to boot. Plus, when you convince an unsuspecting mate when drunk &quot;Naa,  it ain't that hot&quot; you then have a good giggle about it. Could probs do some hunting but cbf. Might later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I grow peppers and try a pod from each plant just for fun. The chocolate scorpion was immediate and intense. The ghost took a good 15-20 seconds before I felt anything, then it was a punch to the throat that just got worse from there. I have ornamental peppers, Numex Twilights, that have an incredibly sudden burst of heat that goes away very quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I am not a fan of the Scorps heat tbh. Great for sauces as they pack a great wallop, but not for eating whole. </p>
<p>I made the decision to underestimate a Jays Peach and wished I could have died in a black hole. There was no endorphin relief, just a solid agonising 10mins. I scoffed at its mere 1mil shu and I should not have.</p></div>		</li>
