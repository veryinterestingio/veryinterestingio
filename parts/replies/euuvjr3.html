			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically barcodes are just numbers/letters that can be read with a scanner, there are many formats but nowadays a scanner can read them all.</p>
<p>Behind the barcode there is often no encryption, for example if you take a few movie tickets and read the bars, you will probably find a pattern in there (maybe the date, seat number, etc). If you figure out the pattern completely, you can print your own movie-ticket barcodes (thats why barcodes arent really a protection mechanism).</p>
<p>The talk gives funny examples of how sometimes the systems dont even check that the data is valid, just that the barcode format is recognised (using a pack of cigarettes as a parking pass, etc).</p></div>		</li>
