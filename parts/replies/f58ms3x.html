			<div class="markdown"><p>Using rays to model light is the geometrical <em>approximation</em> which breaks down when beam sizes get small. An easy example of why it is an approximation is that it models a focus as a point, which would imply infinite intensity at that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Light propagates as spherical waves, or a superposition of them, for linear isotropic media like the vacuum. Plane waves are an idealization and in practice any light beam is bound to spread due to the fact that  a perfect planar phase front is impossible to achieve, hence a perfectly collimated beam doesn't exist. An interesting approximation to nondiffracting beams are Bessel beams, which in practice dont diffract over a finite distance. This is my main research topic and they have very cool applications.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To say they go in the same direction is to know their momentum exactly, which means you can't know anything about their position, by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.  So if they are going exactly parallel to each other, they can't be doing so in a narrow beam.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Photons are particles that act as waves. As other people here (who are more knowledgeable than I) have pointed out, a property of beam emissions is refraction. </p>
<p>I believe this is part of the reason that laser transmitter relay for long range communication though space is unfeasible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The physics is inflexible but you can engineer a beam for long-range transmission, it just becomes impractical at some point. The larger the beam waist and the longer the wavelength of a beam the lower the divergence.
A perfect gaussian intensity profile is also an elusive property - you can get close, but never all the way, which also makes your divergence a little higher than the minimum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your intuition is going in the right direction, though not a practical one. A plane wave will propagate without thinning out. It’s already infinitely wide. They are just a theoretical concept, though.</p>
<p>Regarding photons, they interact with each other, and are thus just a different way of describing the same phenomenon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a side note, while the gaussian beam will always diverge, a Bessel beam will not. The Bessel beam is somewhat special, but can be produced with a special lens called an axicon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but as long as you ensure that you make your bessel zone wide enough to  keep the central lobe of the bessel intensity profile, you are good to go for most applications. The outer rings are not that interesting for applications. Best property is the depth of focus and the self healing properties, also if you use a reflective axicon instead of a lens, the bessel zone can be formed much further and you could use pulsed beams. This could allow for long range use of bessel beams where you control by design where the bessel zone starts</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You often hear these claims about Bessel beams but they are misleading. They only have a flat wavefront (non-divergent) in the diamond-shaped region where the parts of the beam intersect.</p></div>		</li>
