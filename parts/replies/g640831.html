<p>First, there are definitely many cool emerging patterns in how musically experienced/trained individuals (or even individuals who are just better at musical skills!) might benefit from that experience and aptitude in linguistic contexts. More specifically, in terms of how music may help in learning a language as an adult, you might be interested in these reviews of the findings so far:<br />

<p>It seems like most of the findings show that the &quot;transfer effects&quot; from music to adult second language learning might be most related to phonology (rules for how the meaningful sounds work in the language), reading skills, and pronunciations. In studies that just look at music and language links more broadly, we also find links between musical skills and other aspects of language beyond phonology and reading, e.g. our lab's work on links between musical rhythm and grammar abilities during language development, and also on how impaired rhythm skills and impaired language skills can go hand in hand.

<p>In general, to your question, keep in mind that a good test taker of language isn't necessarily employing the same skills as a good comprehender, speaker or &quot;decoder&quot; of language. For example, some aspects of language learning are very explicit - e.g. memorizing vocabulary, learning grammatical rules, learning the case system of that language, translate or formulate sentences, passages, etc., decode the written form of the language, lots of practice lots of repetition. Classroom assessments usually need to be concerned with these more explicit aspects of language learning. </p>
<p>Some more implicit aspects might be how accurate is your &quot;hearing&quot; of speech sounds; how good is your sense of what is &quot;correct&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; in the language; how automatically are you &quot;thinking&quot; in the language you're learning while comprehending or producing it - are you for example translating Korean first into English or another language you know, and only then feeling like you can comprehend it? Do you first make a sentence in English then translate word by word before you can get to the Korean sentence?; how does your brain make predictions about what's coming next while reading (which can also be indicative of a deeper familiarity of the language)?; how much effort is your brain expending when you read or listen to understand in that language?; how easily are you able to produce the sentence with your mouth once you've thought of it in your mind? or maybe you can produce it as you think of it like a more fluent speaker Unfortunately, it's harder for classroom assessments to get at these things formally. </p>
<p>This process of learning a new language as an adult usually involves getting better at the language in both implicit and explicit terms! As you've probably noticed through your intensive language study, many aspects of the language can become more automatic over time, and your test scores don't necessarily reflect this yet, depending on what you're being tested on. But your musical experience is probably helping you with a number of different building blocks of the language learning along the way :-)</p></div>		</li>
