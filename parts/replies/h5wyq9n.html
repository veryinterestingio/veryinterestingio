			<div class="markdown"><p>Its wild how different even one “tumor type” can be. I remember reading a paper that sequenced RCC (kidney cancer) cells trying to identify underlying mutations. They found 30+ fundamentally different mutations. Thats akin to saying that a disease we typically use one name for could be seen as dozens of different diseases, all with different potential treatment approaches. Accordingly, RCC has been notoriously hard to increase OS.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the case of RCC, immunotherapy has been really effective. It's not known why, but for some reason kidney cancer cells accumulate a lot of mutations. It doesn't matter much <em>which</em> specific gene is mutated, as long as it produces a mutated protein. Such proteins can be highly immunogenic (the immune system wants to attack them). Drugs called checkpoint-inhibitors take the brakes off the immune system and allow T-cells to attack the cancer cells.</p>
<p>In other types of cancer, the specific mutations do matter. For example, we always do genetic sequencing on lung cancer, because certain mutations allow targeted therapies. An EGFR mutated lung cancer responds well to EGFR inhibitors (Erlotinib). Targeted therapy is probably the future of cancer pharmacotherapy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, yes. Even besides cancers we are learning that this is much more often the case than we thought, usually syndromes we don't completely understand yet turn out to be various different diseases leading to the same clinical symptoms.</p>
<p>Some syndromes, chronic fatigue for example, are even speculated to be a group of various genetic disorders and viral infections.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a gene transplant drug trial back in 2000s that got hard shutdown just because the two neighbouring cell next to the genetically transformed cell had the wrong signal and turned cancerous as a result. Its such a huge headache to figure out where things could go wrong.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I’ve been on a “hormonal chemotherapy” called Zoladex for a while in treatment of endometriosis. <em>Why</em> is it a “chemotherapy”. What makes it “chemotherapy”?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Endometriosis is found first by von Rokitansky i think pre-Civil War, and I'm happy to forgive him for not knowing what the bloody cysts signified, as much of tissue processing for pathology wouldn't occur during his lifetime. It's not defined as a term till about 100 years later. When you see it under the microscope, the cells dont look especially ugly like cancer cells do. They look more outta place, like endometrial cells out in the abdomen, and that was what it was considered for a long time. </p>
<p>Thats a decent explanation. Except-thats not the whole story. Endometriosis usually has <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5555376/" target="_blank">mutations</a>. It is not a normal set of cells. It is also not cancer. This may be surprising but youve thought of this before maybe without knowing it. This is a cousin of a mole on your skin. Most sit there. Some gain additional mutations and get bigger. Some of those can become melanoma. If there's ~4 to 100 mutations needed to get a cancer, it makes sense that you'd occasionally see cells that had one of them (and that's literally what many moles are). </p>
<p>So you're preventing an atypical group of cells from dividing and making more of themselves. You possibly get symptomatic benefit benefit too. (<del>If you're in the USA you also get to deal with the incumbent dystopia of an insurance company who didn't read NEJM and doesn't want to pay you for perceived girl problems</del> whoops that's an overshare). Chemotherapy isn't the worst word for the drug doing those things, it's just got a connotation thats inappropriate because it used to have side effects more severe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chemotherapy is just any selection of toxins that are designed to kill bad cells faster than they kill you, so you survive but the bad stuff doesn't. </p>
<p>Zoladex is given alongside hormone related chemotherapy because Zoladex is a hormone blocker. I dont believe Zoladex itself qualifies as chemotherapy.   If the bad cells inside you are hormone-related (like with endometriosis) Zoladex can keep the hormones under control.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additional to what others have said, zoladex is considered a hazardous medication because it will interfere with the reproductive system. In healthcare the distinction between cytotoxic and reproductive hazard are often synonymously labeled chemotherapy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wrong. Immunotherapy refers to drugs which <em>modulate</em> the immune system, like checkpoint inhibitors (Keytruda) and interferons.</p>
<p>Most monoclonal antibodies used for cancer do not qualify as immunotherapy. Some are actually considered chemotherapy (like Avastin, a VEGF antibody). Most are considered targeted therapy (like Erbitux, an EGFR antibody).</p></div>		</li>
