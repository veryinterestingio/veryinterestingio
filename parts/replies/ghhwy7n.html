<p>Inflation changes as the ratio of money to goods and services available for purchase with that money changes</p>

<p>It's a bit more nuanced than that. The velocity (circulation) of money matters. If the central bank prints huge amounts of money and then just stores it (doesn't spend it), the inflation will not be affected. On the other hand, if people buy and sell goods at a faster rate, the inflation increases.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why inflation can spiral out of control. If inflation is high, it's better to get rid of any money you have by buying valuable goods. This increases velocity of money and drives up the inflation even more.</p></div>		</li>
