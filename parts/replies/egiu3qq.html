<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligopoly" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligopoly</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An oligopoly is a market form wherein a market or industry is dominated by a small number of large sellers (oligopolists). Oligopolies can result from various forms of collusion which reduce competition and lead to higher prices for consumers. Oligopolies have their own market structure</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the actual definition (from my business law class a few years back) of being in a cartel, which can be prosecuted, is if they actually meet to talk about prices. If they do that it's illegal. If they just see the public prices and change accordingly it's not.</p>
<p>That's why gas station prices are nearly always the same. They don't talk to each other about prices, but see that if they're changing to $2.5 a gallon, they should change theirs to the same. So long as they don't actually make contact to do this on purpose, it's perfectly legal. </p></div>		</li>
