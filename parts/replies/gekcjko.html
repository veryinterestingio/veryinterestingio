			<div class="markdown"><p>Super cool. Thank you. </p>
<p>So, from this perspective: were these crystal and grain movements happening from the minute the cable was put under load? Was there a T0 where the movement was not happening, and a T1 where it began?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you watch the full video, you can see that at first the little 'springs' between atoms simply stretch. This is known as elastic deformation, and is reversible; it goes away when the load is removed. I believe they show this in the animation. When the loading is sufficient, it instead begins to rearrange itself. This is plastic deformation, and it remains after the material is no longer under stress. Sufficient plastic deformation leads to yield - breaking.</p>
<p>Worth note is that during plastic deformation, the elastic deformation does not go away. If you stop bending a metal wire, it will bend back a little bit as the elastic deformation goes away, but the plastic deformation remains. The plastic deformation can also cause 'permanent' elastic deformation, as parts of the material try to pull themselves towards their original shape, leaving a sort of messy collection of internal stresses.</p>
<p>Thinking about it now, this is probably part why glasses and monocrystalline substances are so brittle. They cannot experience plastic deformation to any significant degree, and instead just break.</p>
<p>Those residual stresses, which I mentioned as a sidenote, are actually quite important things in metallurgy and glasswork.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't hit everything you mention, but for a good video showing the elastic deformation in a metal, here's the Slo Mo Guys snapping a steel bar. Somewhat applicable to OP's question</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>mmmm. glasses are basically suddenly frozen liquids. and they do plastically deform but not elastically; all tension and compression are permanent. they tend to handle compressive forces extremely well because there is extra space for the atoms to be squeezed into, but bending or tension doesn't have a lot of extra freedom of movement which is why they fail somewhat impressively in these conditions.</p>
<p>we use their compressive strength to our advantage, though. car windows and phone screens are made in such a way that the inside is under tension and the outside is compressed. this allows any extra tension that the glass sees to be &quot;absorbed&quot; by the exterior as a release of compression rather than tension and it doesn't break! </p>
<p>monocrystalline materials are a little more complicated but the long and short of those is they are harder to deform (which is good for things like jet engines in which they are used) but yes they do gain brittleness. but strength and brittleness are two sides of the same coin. it's hard to increase one without increasing the other, and so techniques like single crystal formation are used to maximize one while minimizing the increase in the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the OP but fascinating! So let me get this straight: when I &quot;stretch&quot; something, I'm either literally pulling the atoms apart, or they're rearranging their bonds?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not if you're stretching it in its elastic region. A spring, for instance. The bonds are stretched but not rearranged. Once you pull it so far that it doesn't return, it is bent, and that's when the atoms get rearranged.</p></div>		</li>
