			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally: </p>
<p>In the US, polygraph tests are <em>not</em> admissable evidence, neither is whether the suspect refused to take one. SCOTUS said something to the effect that polygraph tests are totally unscientific, and not better than tossing a coin.</p>
<p>Cops know this, and will use them only when they think it'll intimidate the suspect into confessing something he/she wouldn't otherwise confess. So if the cops ever ask you to take a polygraph, the only correct answer is &quot;Lawyer!&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've been watching the JCS Criminal Psychology channel on YouTube. It's incredible that <em>nobody</em> asks for a lawyer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In the US, polygraph tests are not admissable evidence</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's actually not explicitly true. In some states, if both parties agree to the polygraph, it can be used in court. Eg.,</p>
<p>&quot;Georgia law provides that polygraph tests can be admitted if both parties in the case agree, in advance, that a witness will take a test and the results will be shown at trial.&quot;</p>
<p>However, I believe this is itself currently being tested in the Georgia court system. Regardless, there are vanishingly few situations in which I imagine the above exception is used... Still, it does leave some room for police to manipulate and/or intimidate an uninformed witness or defendant into such an agreement. Any use of polygraph in the judicial system should be unequivocally banned.</p>
<p>It can't be said enough: never speak to police. If they arrest you, ask for an attorney. If they aren't arresting you, go home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up the SCOTUS ruling on polygraphs - it wsa pretty scathing, especially considering how reserved judicial opinions at that level usually are. But it made it clear that polygraphs were in no way evidence &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can imagine people agreeing to that because they think &quot;well I know I didn't do it, so I'll tell the truth and the polygraph will show the court that I'm innocent&quot; and then getting so intimidated and flustered by the questioning during the test that the results end up looking incriminating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did a polygraph for a pre employment background check and I was super nervous, never done one, asking 1000 questions before the test, sitting in a small room hooked up to stuff with a camera recording you and being asked questions. Person at the end said I was &quot;showing signs of deception&quot;. I'm like lady this is nerve racking for anyone who has never done this before. The fact so many jobs in any type of government require them is crazy to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a similar situation in the 90s. I had gotten an offer in IT at a bank, provisional on a clean background check and polygraph. I hadn't smoked weed since the conception of my eldest child, two years earlier, and hadn't done any other drugs since college, a decade earlier. The polygraph was going well, except the interviewer was repeatedly returning to questions about cocaine (as this was in the 90s, for a job at a Wall Street bank). First, it was &quot;Have you used cocaine in the past six months?&quot; (No.) Then it was &quot;Have you used cocaine in the past month?&quot; (No.), then &quot;... the past week?&quot; (No.) We finally got down to &quot;Are you consuming cocaine right now?&quot; (No.) The interviewer then chuckled and ended the interview. I started work the next week.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That reminds me of when I was taking my citizenship test and the guy was like &quot;have you done drugs?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ever?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Even marijuana?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No drugs.  I'm clean.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yeah?  What about this on your record where you were pulled over for a DUI?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Haha, that's f-&quot;</p>
<p>And he gave me a serious/angry look</p>
<p>&quot;Oh... You're being serious.  Well, I guess your records are wrong then, because I've literally never had alcohol either...&quot; (Must have been a surprise to him because what 25 year old doesn't drink, right?)</p>
<p>He lightened up and was like &quot;ok, you passed.  Congrats&quot;</p>
<p>I kinda wanna take a polygraph to see what they'd ask.  I follow the law and stuff (aside for downloading bootleg movies in the past) so I wouldn't be surprised. Worst case scenario I lose a bullshit interview.</p></div>		</li>

They help narrow in on things that might have gotten missed otherwise, but false positives are easy enough to assess also</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wasn't a polygraph, but at one point I was getting absolutely grilled by a customs officer because I was entering the US for a job interview and hadn't thought to bring proof that that was my intention.  At one point he was like &quot;you seem nervous&quot;.  It was apparent that, uh, yeah, no kidding, so I figured my best choice was to just be honest, and I said something along the lines of, &quot;yes, I have a job interview tomorrow and I'm not sure I'm going to be able to be there&quot;.  He kinda just grunted and let me through.  Hoh boy that was stressful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it worked for me lol. I was kind of pissed they even started requiring it. It was for a 911 call taker job who for years before that never had a polygraph requirement and all of a sudden they started requiring it. I don't trust any of them up here anyways, a few years back there was an investigation that found one of the main polygraph people in my county was found to be purposely failing people to get more money since the departments would either have to send them back through for a secondary test, or there would be more applicants for him to test.</p></div>		</li>
