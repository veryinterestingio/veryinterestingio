			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, a fifth, (although not a very major stream of revenue) you sell casks to private customers, while still storing it until it matures. </p>
<p>You essentially fill a cask, and sell it off to a customer for anything between £2000 and up, depending on the cask type, including an agreement to store it for [X] years. </p>
<p>After [X] years, you can make money of fees for additional years in storage, bottling, transportation etc. </p>
<p>It's a lovely gimmick, where the customer gambles his own money on whether or not the cask will turn out well or not, where your entire cost is one additional cask in your storehouse.</p>
<p>And a sixth is of course selling off young casks to be made into blend. After three years, you have a cask, and you can already tell it wont turn out well enought to be bottled as a 12 year old. But it is still legally whisky and it still tastes fine right now, and it can still be used in a blend, because a blend is simply several whiskies mixed until it achieves a certain specific taste. When a blend says it is from &quot;hand selected casks of whisky&quot;, do bear in mind that said hand-selection still takes a 250 liter cask of whisky and mixes it up in a batch of several thousand liters of whisky. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This can be a pretty horrid gamble. Nant here in Tasmania, Australia tried this recently and screwed it up massively. (<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-23/nant-whisky-to-be-investigated-by-tasmania-police/8836186" target="_blank">sauce</a>)They went under and got bought out. Which sucks, but fortunately the new owners have put some good coin into the place and revived it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nant promised to buy them back once the whisky had matured, with investors to be rewarded with 9.55 per cent compounding interest.</p>

<p>Yeah, see, that's the distillery taking a <strong>much</strong> bigger gamble with their own money, and not just letting their customer have a cask they have bought laying in storage.</p></div>		</li>

<p>that seems like an incredibly sound investment, for someone who really gets down with liquor.</p>
<p>spend 2k now, and in a decade break it open for an entire barrel full of premium 10-year-aged whiskey or whatever?</p>
<p>i don't drink, but if i did, i'd be all for that.</p>
<p>now i kind of wish i did, and was aware of it back when i was like 21 or something, and could crack it open after getting a doctorate or getting married and serving it to the guests or something.</p>
<p>to be fair i'm neither married nor do i have a doctorate, but it's a cool idea nonetheless</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except it's never just £2000. </p>
<p>Because with transport, bottling, tax, VAT etc. after those 10 years, it ends up being more. </p>
<p>Because after 10 years, a hogshead at 250 liters still contains 150-ish liters of cask strenght whisky at 56 % ABV. And although you might like cask strength whisky, you don't like it well enough to go throught the 200-220-ish bottles that cask makes for. So you get it diluted down to a more amiable 40 % ABV or something thereabouts to taste. But by diluting you end up with 200-ish liters instead. Which makes you end up with 280-300-ish bottles instead. </p>
<p>And unless you have your own bottling plant at home, you end up paying the distillery for bottling those for you. </p>
<p>And taxes on alcohol is paid upon bottling. So that gets added. As well as transporting those 300 bottles for you. </p>
<p>And the distillery will offer to handle paperwork with tax authorities on your behalf, for a surcharge.</p>
<p>And then VAT on the products plus services rendered. </p>
<p>And 10 years after handing off those first £2000, you end up forking over twice that in order to actually get physical ownership of the fluid you already bought once. </p>
<p>And you do end up with a godawful lot of whisky. 300 identically tasting bottles of whisky. So you better cross your fingers that what was in that cask turned out well. </p>
<p>And you wont exactly have [Brand of whisky, 10 years old] because that is almost <strong>always</strong> something that has been mixed from several casks of the same brand of whisky aged at least 10 years, until it tastes as that whisky is supposed to taste of. Because no two single casks of whisky will turn out exactly alike. </p>
<p>But yeah, in the end you will have paid around £6000 altogether, and wound up with 300 bottles of whisky that cost you £20 a piece. So if it ends up being good whisky, you've made a bargain. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Increase price for aging to decrease demand. There will be a sweet spot for supply and demand. One of my cousins owns a winery and I've heard her talk about just this (for pricing aged wines).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wine's a lot more flexible because it ages in the bottle. As soon as whisky is bottled that's it. It's forever a 12 year old and won't change, even if it was bottled in 1950.</p></div>		</li>
