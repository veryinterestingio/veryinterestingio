			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the weight of an individual rope itself given enough length will eventually exceed the breaking strength of the rope.</p>
<p>It wouldnt matter how many you would have after a certain fepth they would all start breaking at the top.</p>
<p>I think what you are getting at is to have separate hoists or &quot;elevators&quot; at different depths.  This would work.  Some mines do that, especially deep diamond and gold mines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I’m getting at the latter, building an elevator that is perhaps only .4x the breaking length of its tether and then using that elevator to bring down a second tether the same length that way when you bring down the second tether the first tether only has to bear the load of .8x its maximum load. Set up up the elevator system so that the bottom of one gives access to the top of an other.</p></div>		</li>
