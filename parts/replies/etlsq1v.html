			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've read, prion proteins are extremely tough due to their physical structure (they form plaques that are resistant to proteases and somewhat resistant chemical attack).</p>
<p>Because they are not alive (like bacteria or fungi) you can't get rid of them them with disinfectants, antibiotics, or other antimicrobials. Because they don't contain any DNA or RNA, you can't use nucleases. Because they are resistant to enzymatic degradation, you can't use proteases. And because they are physically tough at the chemical and structural level, you can't use heat or detergents.</p>
<p>In order to destroy the prion protein, you need to use harsh chemicals like sodium hydroxide or sodium hypochlorite (bleach) to denature and oxidise the protein structure - thereby destroying it and rendering it non-infectious.</p>
<p>It's one of the things that make prions so dangerous. If you have a piece of meat contaminated with bacteria, or fungi, or a virus, you can simply cook it to kill them all. But not with prions.</p>
<p>There's evidence that prion proteins persist in the environment for years - even decades - and can lay dormant in the soil, be transferred around by birds eating infected carrion, or even be taken up by growing plants and then eaten by herbivores.</p>
<p>Thank goodness prion diseases are rare - that's all I can say!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like your explanation, you seem to have a decent understanding of the prion field!</p>
<p>We can destroy them with heat (incineration). Chemically, we use something called <a href="https://jvi.asm.org/content/78/4/2164" target="_blank">LpH (and acidic detergent)</a> to decon our stuff. Lastly, we can use proteinases like <a href="http://agscientific.com/blog/2018/11/proteinase-k-and-prion-diseases/" target="_blank">proteinase K</a> (experimentally) to digest PrPSc, but there is a resistant core that is left over. However, if you use a high enough concentration of PK, you can get rid of the PrPSc signal (on western blot). PK is very strong though, and will chew itself up if left alone, so it is not a viable solution. There is also a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/43/6/757/327631" target="_blank">paper</a> on techniques for sterilization of surgical tools.</p>

<p>Thanks! I've only done a bit of cursory reading after watching a documentary on BSE - but I do have a background in molecular genetics which helps with understanding some of the biochemical stuff.</p>

<p>Interesting! I kept reading that prion proteins were resistant to proteases - but I guess they meant resistant in the context of endogenous proteolytic pathways, rather than the application of a high concentration, highly active exogenous protease.</p>
<p>Thanks for the info!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it's just been a long time since i took O-chem, but I'm at a loss as to why &quot;standard&quot; nitric acid washes aren't enough. We denature and splice proteins all the time from cooking to digestion to cell breakdown and material recovery, are prions just layers upon layers of mishapenness that prevent traditional pathways?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The typical way to destroy a protein is to denature it - get it to unfold and lose its shape. A prion is a protein that has misfolded into a highly stable shape - both rendering it unable to function, but also able to catalyze normally-folded versions of itself into misfolding into the same shape. The stability of the misfolded shape also makes it hard to unfold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We actually don't know if the reason misfolded PrP causes disease is due to a toxic loss of function or a toxic gain of function.</p>
<p>On the surface I would lead towards toxic gain of function, because we can <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bmb/article/66/1/43/284841" target="_blank">knock out the prion protein in mice</a> and other animals and they have almost no observable phenotype.</p>
<p>Also, it doesn't catalyze any other proteins to misfold, it specifically catalyses normal prion proteins to misfold (although we are unsure as to how). This is an important distinction!</p>
<p>You are correct about the stability of the misfolded version being difficult to unfold though, that is certainly true!</p></div>		</li>

<p>I meant that it catalyzes normal versions of itself to misfold, yes.</p>
<p>And one thing that is neither toxic loss or gain of function is the formation of fibrils and plaques - although I'm not sure if we've quite established whether or not those are actually deleterious. Also, apparently PrP may have some role in myelination, and maybe maintenance of long-term synaptic changes. Also possibly involved in programmed cell death, renewal of bone marrow from stem cells, and even innate immunity, based on where we've found it or upregulated genes related to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anything disposable gets tossed and incinerated like other biohaz material. Surgical equipment goes throw the ringer with a loooong protocol of NaOH, heat and acid(?) (cant remember off the top of my head) and the whole thing takes like 36 hours.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Part of the reason they are so hard to get rid of is that the conformation prions are in is so stable. So when you denature the protein via heat or chemical, it just pops back into dangerous conformation once the heat or chemical goes away. </p>
