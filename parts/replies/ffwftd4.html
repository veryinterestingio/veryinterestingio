			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that is technically not correct, automatic cars do have a &quot;clutch&quot; in form of a torque converter which disconnects the engine from the wheels when the resistant (as in breaking) becomes to big. This is needed since the crank shaft always rotates, even when you don't press the gas-pedal!</p>
<p>If you release the clutch in a manual car but don't step on the gas the car will move to...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not necessarily. If you're stopped on a hill and you release the brake you will move in whichever direction the hill is facing (uphill you move back, downhill you move forward) vs an automatic car will always go forward even if it's uphill. As well, if you're stopped on a completely level ground, but release the brake and throw it into neutral and release the clutch(or even keep the clutch down while in gear) you will not move at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A. If you put the automatic car into neutral and release the brake pedal it wont move either</p>
<p>B. If you release the clutch without pressing the gas pedal you will either move forward (or backwards when being in reverse gear) or your car will die when it's to steep uphill...</p></div>		</li>
