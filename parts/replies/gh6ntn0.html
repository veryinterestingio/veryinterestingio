			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so vaccinating a plant isnt as simple as it is with an animal. You can't just give it a shot, or put something in the water and have it absorb it. It has no way to distribute the cure to already existing cells. That makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, the way that farmers and scientists combat these things when it comes to crops is through genetic editing and selective breeding to create a new crop yield that isn't susceptible.</p>
<p>When it comes to trees and a disease spreading through non-crop species. The best thing that can be done is culling of plants that are affected and those surrounding it that may have it to stop the spread (Which is why people need park wardens to keep an eye on diseases that may affect a forest).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Distribution issues aside, it would be impossible to vaccinate a plant because of their lack of an adaptive immune system, aka, their immune system cannot learn to recognise new foreign particles like mammals can. Plants are genetically programmed to recognise a set variety of molecules that are commonly associated with pathogens or disease. This system does not naturally change within a plant’s lifetime, so it can’t adapt to new pathogens. As others have said, the only way to give plants immunity would be to alter their immune system genetically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To build off the deployment issue, many crops we grow are annuals, so they're dead by the end of the year naturally. It makes a lot more sense to create a genetically-modified version of that crop to grow for the year that's resistant to whatever disease, than to inoculate every individual plant, every growing season.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've provided a good overview of innate immunity in plants but I want to add that there is actually another form of plant immunity that is more of a mobile defense. When a plant is infected with a pathogen it can actually send out mobile signals to the parts of the plant further away from the site of infection. These signals then ready or &quot;prime&quot; defense in distal tissues by causing defense genes to be turned on, antimicrobial metabolites to be made, as well as help to increase the production of a plant defense hormone called salicylic acid. This defense response is called systemic acquired resistance or SAR for short. </p>
<p>SAR is not always induced depending on the initial pathogen infection. However, the mobile signals the plant produces to ready the rest of the plant for defense have been of interest in helping reduce infection. Some researchers, myself included, have been trying to understand exactly how these signals are working in the plant with the idea that they could be applied to help enhance resistance to pathogens. Some people trying to sell the work like to call it a &quot;vaccine&quot; for plants but I think that is very misleading since plants do not produce antibodies and SAR has mostly been observed to confer protection only up to a week or so after priming with the strongest protection after a few days. It is also important to note in plants there is a tradeoff between growth and defense. So if you were to spray a chemical that could elicit an SAR-like response you would want to do so at a very specific time and stage of development to maximize protection while not compromising the growth of the plant and therefore avoid impacting yield as much as possible.</p></div>		</li>
