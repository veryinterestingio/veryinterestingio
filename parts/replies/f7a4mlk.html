<p>Edit: I have no idea why “these amps go to 11,” but I’m sure you’re all very clever for commenting that</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not displaying actual battery life. It’s displaying operating battery life. Even if your phone were to hit 0%, the battery still actually has some juice in it. It just doesn’t have enough to safely power your device without physically damaging the battery cell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I’m saying is, why not display the percentage in a way so 0% is the cutoff for it appearing to shutdown, even though it has life in it.  Why display 6-8% when it’s misleading to the user?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not completely. It’s also a safety mechanism for the battery itself as draining a battery to absolute 0 is quite bad for it. You can sometimes control it to some extent, but just about every complex device that uses a battery has a hard cutoff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, but most smart devices are programmed to consider &quot;0%&quot; as the point where the battery will start suffering degradation and force a shutoff at that point. They don't just run until they literally cannot provide enough power for the device to run anymore.</p></div>		</li>
