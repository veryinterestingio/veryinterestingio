			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh dear! This is not good. The problems that we have seen is that patients are spending more time at home, and this is increasing their risk for blood clots. I always advise that if you are sitting for long periods, get up and move around the room at least once an hour. Let’s be honest, we can’t concentrate for more than an hour at a time anyway. Get a glass of water or cup of coffee and stay hydrated. Move around regularly. Make a point at some point in the day to go for a long walk if you can. The other thing we’ve seen in Britain is that many people have put on a lot of weight while in lockdown or working from home. We know obesity can also increase one’s risk for clots. Please, try and get more mobile.</p></div>		</li>
