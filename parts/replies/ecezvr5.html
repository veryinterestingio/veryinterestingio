The brain is weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad is a nascar fan, we would try to bond over the races... hours later we would both wake up with ten laps to go. DVR is great, or so my Dad thought. We would rewind to 100 laps left. And then do that all over again! My Dad is a gem! Even if we woke up to the winner he would still rewind it. I’ve been in two car accidents while falling asleep! Driving makes me sleepy!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder how much of this could be attributed to survival instincts. Crickets or birds suddenly stopping could indicate a potential threat nearby. Even if I were wide awake, I think I’d be creeped out if the ambient noise just suddenly fell silent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd think more about it as 'a change in sounds' that wakes people up.
The noise you hear while watching could be boring or something, making you fall asleep. During this time, some other process in your brain decided it's a safe area to fall asleep, so it will associate sound around you to that too. </p>
<p>Once that 'ambient' sound changes, your brain's link to being safe is no longer valid. Your brain will think safety has been compromised and wake you up.</p>

<p>But I'm drunk, but I 99% think this is it, so that's that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has a similar effect for me at least. When my room is quiet, it’s harder for me to fall asleep, and stay asleep.</p></div>		</li>
