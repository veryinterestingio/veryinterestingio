			<div class="markdown"><p>I would suggest these are all 'umami' flavors and that your body is craving amino acids, which would make sense. Basically by not digesting normal amounts of food and starving if all types of nutrients, the most important ones become the 'squeakiest wheel'. I bet Worcestershire sauce or liquid aminos or nutritional yeast might hit the spot too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense, I also love Vegemite and things like that when I am coming off a bad time.  I’ll have to try Nutritional Yeast next time, I usually save it for sprinkling on pasta or snacks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya, I know that sounds odd.  But all the TPN and IntraLipids and other IV nutrition and Ensure in the world just doesn’t cure the cravings.  Lol.  </p>
<p>One time when I was like twelve or thirteen i came home from a four month hospital stay craving onions and garlic.  I had gotten down to 67 pounds at 5’2”.  And that is with IV nutrition.  I came home tired and hungry.  So I was at my grandma’s house and everyone was busy doing yard work and I saw onions and garlic.  I got out the cast iron skillet and started cooking them.  I must have had 6 or 7 onions and two or three heads of garlic going.  Just frying it up in olive oil and butter.  Lol. It looked like a slice of Heaven to me.  Then I sat down and started eating my feast.  Well the whole house smelled of garlic and onions when my family came inside.  I got the biggest butt chewing for stinking up the house, lol,  but dang it, it was delicious.  Of course back then I didn’t know what to say when they asked me why.  I just cried. Lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know the first time I craved Sardines I had never even eaten them before.  But went with it and bought some and it did the trick.  Let me know how the Sardine spaghetti is.  I’m sure it will be good.  My mom used to make spaghetti with shrimp.  Oh man, that was something.  She also got me into adding anchovies into dishes for that umami flavor before umami was cool.  I never thought about Sardine Spaghetti.  Looking forward to hearing how it turns out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>May I suggest a recipe? For 1 person. Canned sardines (85 g drained, the standard weight of a can here) in the pan with their oil (filtered), mash them with a fork, reduce with 100 ml (or more) of white wine, add half lemon or lime juice (if you like lemon add zest too), fresh thyme at the end. Sometimes I use tomatoes or tomato sauce, but I like more without.</p></div>		</li>
