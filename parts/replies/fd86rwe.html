<p>As a comparison, this is a live map of the fires in Australia at the moment: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/JA0RLji.png" target="_blank">Australian fires</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems there was some mention of fires in Africa <a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/after-amazon-outcry-nasa-images-shine-spotlight-on-african-forest-fires" target="_blank">last year</a> , whilst the media was covering the Amazon fires. Apparently the fires seen on the satellite image last year are mostly controlled seasonal fires on agricultural land rather than within natural forests. I'm not sure if this is still the case now. </p>
<p>There are bush fires in Australia every summer, but I think this year has been exceptional with the fire season starting so early and large fires happening simultaneously across multiple states. </p>
<p>I do agree though, that there is a great discrepancy in media attention covering the western vs non-western regions. I personally feel uncomfortable with people overseas being so generous with donations since we are a relatively well off country.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although most of the African fires are due to subsistence farming practices, primarily <a href="https://apnews.com/49f74a56b5564cae8d49f3022223d003" target="_blank">slash and burn.</a> The African fires are mainly grassland and most individual fires are less than 100 hectares in size. Though if not managed properly they could threaten forests, however, the fires in Africa are not nearly as ecologically disastrous as the Amazon or Australian fires. </p>
<p>It’s easy to paint the attention given to Australia as the world just ignoring the developing world, but context matters. Thousands of people are not fleeing to beaches to escape being burned alive in these subsistence agricultural communities. Exploding eucalyptus trees in 50 degree heat are different than somewhat controlled burns of farmland in grasslands.</p>
<p>Issues not given enough coverage this past year have been the flooding in East Africa, the growing political problems in the Lakes region— mainly Burundi, Ebola management in the DRC, water theft, and the illegal oil industry in Nigeria that is destroying the ecosystem in the south, while the country is embroiled in sectarian ethno-religious violence.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So being 500x times hotter probably has <em>something</em> to do with the news attention...</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Wildfire smoke produces toxic gases and fine particulate matter. In general, long term inhalation of fine particulate matter has been associated with........</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is classed as &quot;long term&quot; here? Because most of us in the vicinity of these fires have been inhaling these gases for well over a month now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an excellent question, thank you for asking! To be more precise, I should have said that both long term and short term air pollution exposure is associated with detrimental health effects and increased deaths.</p>
<p>Early air pollution epidemiology studies in the late 80's to early 90's focused on air pollution exposures over several years. In the famous <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199312093292401" target="_blank">Harvard Six Cities Study</a>, the investigators looked air pollution-related over 14-16 years in six cities with differing pollution concentrations. They found cities with higher fine particle concentrations were associated with increased mortality.</p>
<p>More recently the field has been investigating shorter-term (days to months) exposure to air pollution. Increased disease burden and death rates have been associated with acute exposure to high concentrations of particulate matter. Some examples: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6174054/" target="_blank">1</a> <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/STROKEAHA.111.673442" target="_blank">2</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, potential teratogenic effects. The WHO has only recently begin looking into air pollution as carcinogenic, and typically substances that are carcinogenic are also teratogenic. I'd expect to see fertility issues &amp; increased infant mortality for the next several years at least in anywhere exposed to such high levels of air pollution.</p>
<p>If anybody bothers to study it, of course.</p></div>		</li>
