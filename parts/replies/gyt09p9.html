<p>Those are not common occurrences, so fossils are rare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PhD geologist here! That’s not quite true. Yes, fossilization is rare, but there would likely be a number of chemical signatures preserved
in the rock record that would tell us if there was a pre-human industrial civilization on Earth.

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC a decent amount of the structural material in even living bones is &quot;inorganic&quot;. (Pure calcium is a metal, after all. Though bones are <em>far</em> from pure calcium.)</p>
<p>But no, fossils are more akin to a casting of the original shape. Like packing sand around a wax carving and then pouring molten metal in, burning away the wax but preserving shape. Obviously the exact process is very different, but fossils are (usually) entirely non-organic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up the Carboniferous period on wiki it’s amazing, due to there being no bacteria that could break down any sort of dead trees.
They just built up and up to point where oxygen in the atmosphere was massively high.</p>
<p>There where spiders and insects the size of dogs due to the way they grow depending on the level of oxygen in the air.</p>
<p>This where most of our coal comes from this 1 period of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Afaik, the main &quot;agent&quot; of wood decomposition are fungi. They hadn't yet developed in the Carboniferous era, allowing large amounts of dead wood to build up.</p>
