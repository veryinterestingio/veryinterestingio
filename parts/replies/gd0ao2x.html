			<div class="markdown"><p>They'll certainly be included in the part where they show that you don't have issues getting a shot even though you had (possibly unknowingly) had sars-cov-2. Or that you need a negative antibody test before because it's not safe, although I couldn't imagine how that'd work.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As far as I know Moderna actually requires a negative ab test at both doses in order to count.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Would you not have antibodies after the first shot? Or is it designed to only give you protection for 4 weeks or less and that's when the second shot comes in, with the hope of it having longer lasting immunity?</p>
<p>Or am I misunderstanding vaccination and the immune system in general and that antibodies do stop being produced but memory T cells keep that antibody's recipe access to the body should it ever need it -- how then does the body identify which antibody to produce? I had the impression that a B cell identified which antibody has bound to an antigen and can somehow ask for more of them to be produced. Was that bringing the antibody/antigen complex to various T cells until one says &quot;Yeah, I can produce that?&quot;</p>
<p>Hmm, I may be totally off here. A refreshed from anyone knowledgeable would be great!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question! I had to look this up. The vaccine is against the spike protein (S), but the test for prior infection in the trial is against the nucleocapsid protein (N).

<p>The mechanisms of immune memory are many-layered and complex.</p>
<p>Specialized B-cells called plasma cells stick will just do nothing but pump out antibody for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>However in addition there are memory B cells and T cells that stick around to restart the entire immune response (and start it much faster).</p>
<p>The B-cells contain the recipe for the antibody. While the T-cells contain the recipe for the T-cell receptor. This special T-cell receptor can detect a specific digested fragment of the antiGEN which has been captured by another cell called an Antigen Presenting Cell (B cells are particularly good APCs because they are coated with antiBODY so the antiGEN will stick to them and get sucked inside like some horror movie). The antigen is then chewed up by the APC and its bodyparts are displayed on the surface to be seen by the T-cell. When the T-cell sees the chewed up bodyparts it will spring in to action and start dividing and also directing any other B-cells it finds with the same body part to start making more antigens.</p>
<p>If you're wondering why this project seems to have so many checks, it's essentially because you need to have a response that ONLY activates when needed, but when it does activate it goes bonkers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, and here's why. In order to be sure of reinfection, you have to sequence the RNA in the virus twice. That's different than a PCR test and more intensive. The second infection has to have a genetic difference to the first one (there are numerous small differences detected). There aren't many people who have their first infection sequenced, making it hard to know if the second illness is a reinfection or if the first one was never fully eradicated and came back (think cancer). And it's likely that 1) having the first infection makes it less likely of a second infection and that 2) if it occurs it's less intense, lowering the chance of seeking a test anyway. My hope is that there's an ongoing effort at places like Mayo Clinic to swab the same patient twice and just keep the extra swab in the freezer in case sequencing is wanted.</p></div>		</li>
