<p>In all honesty the worst thing about it is that the inbreeding has led to the mares having higher rates of having twins which in the horse industry is a pretty big negative.</p>

<p>Why is having twins considered a negative?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: they die</p>
<p>Long answer: foals are more likely to be born premature and suffer health effects. Sometimes one or more of them will end up abandoned by the mare. Premature birth can result in being small/weak which is a net loss if you're looking at breeding them for financial reasons (which most are). Also complications from pregnancy and birth make the death rate among mares carrying twins much higher as well.  So Singleton = probably a healthy mare and profitable foal. Twins  = a lot of extra worry and care, and likely will lose out on profits for foals, some or all involved may die</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this, this is because of the type of placenta horses have. They have what is called a diffuse placenta; the layer of placenta provided by the mother is intimately connected to that developed by the foetus. When there are two or more foals gestated, often one foetus does not receive adequate blood nutrient supply leading to it not developing properly, but because it is still taking up space in the uterus and placenta it still impacts the ‘dominant’ foetus and reduces its growth. If the foals are born they’re often both undersized and the smallest is lucky to live a short time of its born alive at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because statistically speaking it is very rare that both foals and the mare would survive and/or be healthy after the birth. The placenta in a horse is only designed to grow one foal so both foals often suffer from intrauterine growth retardation in the uterus. Plus the mare will often abort the foetuses at around 8-11 months. Also if they do survive past birth the mare can’t really produce enough milk for two foals like a sheep could her lambs so it’s very likely that one or both of the foals would die from malnutrition. It’s common practice for a vet to crush one of the embryos at the 14-16 day scan to prevent all this from happening.</p></div>		</li>
