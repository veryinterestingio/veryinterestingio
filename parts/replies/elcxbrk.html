			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for leading me to discover the “Deep Astronomy” podcast. I have been looking for astronomy and physics based podcasts with content intended for an audience with greater than average knowledge of the topic. I’m no academic but it gets old to constantly hear the sentence “black holes are objects SO MASSIVE that nothing, not even LIGHT can escape them!”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the suggestion, I will absolutely check that out. And yeah I had the same experience with how the universe works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to piggy back here and ask you something I've been wondering.  Are black holes actually singularities?  Like, are they really exactly 1-dimensional, or are they just really, really close to being 1-d?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to general relativity (GR), there is a singularity at the center of a black hole, which is surrounded by a horizon.  The distance between the singularity and the horizon grows with the mass, so more massive black holes have bigger horizons.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>However, whether or not there are singularities in nature remains unknown, because it is unknown whether GR continues to hold to arbitrarily short distance scales, which is an experimental question.  Many physicists expect that such a singularity is ultimately resolved (prevented from being 'really' a singularity) by quantum mechanical effects.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, formulating a theory of quantum gravity is (so far) unaccomplished for cases where the universe looks like ours.  In some mathematically simpler cases we can construct such theories, but whether a 'real' singularity persists remains unclear (not because the theory doesn't provide an answer, but because it is difficult to leverage the theory to make a prediction).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So, the short answer to your question is &quot;According to GR yes, in the real world nobody knows.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggyback #2: The common adage is that black holes are black because they're &quot;so massive that not even light can escape their gravity&quot;. But I've also heard that that's not true, and that the real reason is that due to relativistic effects, they're black because light coming from them is redshifted to infinity. Which is it?</p></div>		</li>
