<blockquote>
<p>While hyperalgesia occurring at the site of injury is termed primary hyperalgesia, enhanced pain sensitivity in surrounding uninjured skin is termed secondary hyperalgesia<strong>. Primary hyperalgesia</strong> is contributed to by sensitization of peripheral nerve endings (<strong>peripheral sensitization</strong>), whereas <strong>secondary hyperalgesia</strong> is due to changes in the spinal cord and higher brain areas (<strong>central sensitization</strong>).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can’t remove the central nervous system part of it, but can’t we effectively inhibit/overload it? Isn’t this the whole concept behind deep brain stimulation or spinal cord stimulation (I’m forgetting the technical term for it)? Basically we find the area of the central nervous system where the pain is originating and implant electrodes to repeatedly stimulate it electrically so the neurons in the area can’t fire effectively and you don’t end up getting the pain signal? I’m trying to offer a little additional explanation here but also feel like you’ll be able to explain this better than I can with your research experience. I might have some details wrong.</p></div>		</li>
