<p>Also the only time you can &quot;turn it off&quot; is when you blackout.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only time your brain 'turns off' is when you die.
Even when you are blacked out or high as fuck, you brain is still telling your body to breath, your heart to pump. When you are blacked out your brain will often tell none vital organs to slow down function to preserve the vital organs.
If your brain stops doing all of that, you are dead.</p></div>		</li>
