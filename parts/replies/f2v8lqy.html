<li>Efficiency is calculated based on an increase in energy in the streams, including chemical energy and thermal energy.  The energy balance is around the entire solar concentrator dish and reactor system.  Input is solar energy intercepted by the dish reflector.</li>
<li>This question gets at the alternative of using methane – through a combined cycle powerplant – to make electricity for battery electric vehicles.  That’s definitely a high-efficiency alternative way to support electric vehicles but requires yet another step – electrolysis – to get to hydrogen.  The combined cycle plant is about 50-55% efficient and, since electrolysis is about 75% efficient, the overall efficiency is about 35-40%, methane to hydrogen. The energy efficiency of the STARS H2 generator is about twice this.</li>

<p>Can you actually provide the numbers there?  How much chemical energy and how much thermal energy in the input?  And how much chemical energy of the output is in the hydrogen and how much in the other products? </p>
</li>
<li>Your answer here is a good answer to a different question than what I asked.  You answer the question: &quot;Suppose we want to produce hydrogen from natural gas, to power fuel cell vehicles. Is this a better way to do that?&quot;  My question is &quot;suppose we want to power vehicles from natural gas.  Is this any better than using BEVs?&quot;  My guess is that BEVs are more efficient, but I'd want the specifics for my first question in order to assess that myself, or a direct answer to this question.</li>

<li>The easiest way for me to respond on the energy content is to note that steam-methane reforming is endothermic and that the Higher Heating Value (HHV) of the chemical products are typically 20-25% greater than the HHV of the incoming methane.  With a water-gas shift reactor downstream, the products are pretty much just H2 and CO2, with all the HHV being in the H2.</li>
<li>There are three apparent ways to power vehicles using natural gas.  The simplest is to combust compressed natural gas (just like we currently combust gasoline) and this is already done.  A second, which was mentioned another question, is produce electricity in a gas-fired powerplants, using the electricity to charge a Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs).  And the third is to produce hydrogen from the natural gas, using it in Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles.  Personally, I consider FCEVs to be the best case in terms of emissions, and I like BEVs for short distance applications (yes, I have one).  In terms of energy efficiency, FCEVs and BEVs share the electricity advantage but hydrogen with fuel cells tends to beat stationary electrical power generation with battery storage.</li>
