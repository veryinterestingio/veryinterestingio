<p>ost cardiac problems and you will see that most of them aren't the heart muscles failing the body, it's the other way around.  </p>
<p>High Blood pressure? Your heart muscle is fine, the problem is that it is working too hard because your body is in bad shape, narrow arteries, obesity, reduced kidney function. It will keep working too, but your arterial walls aren't strong enough to withstand the extra pressure and over time will weaken.  </p>
<p>Heart attack? That's a clot or blockage in an artery that starves your heart of oxygen, again it is your body failing your heart muscles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What can someone do diet wise, and exercise wise, to combat High Blood Pressure?  </p>
<p>Mine is not on the extreme end yet, but is enough to sound an alarm.  Doctors have only told me that I could only take medicine for it (and that diet or exercise can't change it).  I really doubt that to be true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>High blood pressure is a symptom that can have a ton of different causes. So many that no one could give a specific person good advice without understanding their medical history and examining them personally. So I can't give you better advice than a doctor. </p>
<p>For the most part cardiovascular exercise and avoiding a sedentary lifestyle will keep your blood vessels in better shape and help avoid arterial hardening that's the one of the biggest long-term threats from high blood pressure. </p>
<p>Diet wise leafy greens and foods high in potassium can help your body manage fluids more easily  (usually through processing sodium better) but a lot of &quot;blood pressure eliminating superfoods&quot; are pretty scant on actual research and filled with sensationalist articles. Keeping a healthy weight very is important though. Extra body mass means more power from your heart and that strain will hurt your arteries.</p>
<p>I'm really curious what doctors you found that told you not to exercise or eat better. Most doctors I know would still recommend a healthier lifestyle if your chief complaint was a nail in your foot.</p>
<p>There are plenty of congenital causes for cardiovascular dysfunction though. Exercise and diet can't really help a weakened valve all that much for example. Try asking your doctors to explain the basics of the problem and keep asking questions until you feel like you understand their position.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This sounds to me like cholesterol. Are you sure you didn’t mix that up? On average, 80% of the cholesterol in your body is made by the liver. The other 20% is dietary. For some people, it is not possible to reduce their cholesterol level to a “normal” level unless they take meds for it because their own body produces more than it needs (in some cases, a lot more).</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's always my blood pressure.</p>
<p>It throws me off-- because on the fitness scale I'm above average.</p>
<p>But maybe I should do more steady state cardio.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s honestly a little of both. But in general yes their support systems are improved and demand less of the heart. But it’s disingenuous to say the heart doesn’t get stronger or weaker it does just not in the same sense as say your biceps.</p></div>		</li>
