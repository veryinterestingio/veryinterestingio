<p>Alcohol can kill the virus, but doesn’t wash it off your hands, they’re still there, just dead or injured, so if you missed a spot, it’s still alive on your hands</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't worry, viruses are not really alive on your hands, they just lie there. They're more like tiny land mines, billions of them, waiting for you to put that hand to your mouth, nose, eye, or whatever, pour in and take any cells they can hostage, impregnate them and force to make millions of baby land mines, until they burst and spill them all over inside you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By destroying or damaging the virus you are effectively &quot;killing&quot; it since it can no longer do its job, so I don't think OP's usage was wrong enough to point out. I think it's common knowledge that Scientists don't count viruses as living.</p>
<p>Also, we may not consider viruses as being alive by our current understanding, but that may very well change in the future as our understanding of what constitutes something as being alive changes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Biochemist here (did some microbio too) antibacterial soaps are no better than regular soaps for the most part. The antibacterial agent most of them use takes time to work, to the point that it doesn't do much in the time most people take to wash their hands. </p>
<p>Regular soap is quite effective at killing bacteria to begin with. For the same reasons it kills viruses. It disrupts and damages the cell membranes of the bacteria. </p>
<p>TLDR Normal soap is just as good as antibacterial labelled soap. Just wash hands thoroughly to get maximum benefit.</p>
