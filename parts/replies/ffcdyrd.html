<p>All while water doesn't require special  (and heavy, and weight is the biggest problem for the rockets) high-pressure container, only need electricity to separate them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer.  With the addition of a solar panel for the electricity (which they already have in abundance) for splitting, and the fact that water is removed from the air (after being exhaled by the crew).   One goal for the future is to separate the water out of their waste and recycle it, and to recycle CO2.  We can already do it, but the equipment is large and involves lots of other maintainence/supply.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Compressed Oxygen isn't even used in aviation systems because it requires heavy cylinders to transport for very little amounts. Even aviation uses Liquid Oxygen in their emergency systems which is difficult to replenish and requires controlled systems and high pressure containment of a fluid that is highly explosive and very dangerous to handle.</p>
<p>Electrolysis is safer, and the station requires water anyway. Using what you already have and doing more with less is the constant goal of aviation and space engineering.</p>
<p>EDIT: Since there is some confusion, portable oxygen bottles used in airplanes are filled with compressed oxygen because it is safer, but they are for emergency use for a very small amount of time. Any installed system such as a mask-up system uses liquid oxygen, or has a usage time of less than 5 minutes before being fully depleted. Aircraft such as fighter jets, and military transport aircraft are almost all equipped with a fully integrated liquid oxygen system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn’t true. There are compressed oxygen cylinders on Jetliners for the pilots in case of cabin pressure loss. The cabin uses solid oxygen canisters. Aviation Oxygen cylinders are compressed dry oxygen and have to be regularly checked for moisture, and leaks because that can cause them to freeze at high altitudes and become useless for loss of cabin pressure.</p>
<p>As for military, and small planes, I have no idea.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>They combine it with the excess hydrogen from the electrolysis process to create methane and more water.  The water is cycled back into the system, and the methane is dumped overboard.</p>
<p>Why would you dump oxygen overboard?</p></div>		</li>
