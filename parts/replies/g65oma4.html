			<div class="markdown"><p>They also did an AMA on here last week and got this question specifically. They said no lifeforms from Earth they know of can survive in that high of concentration of sulphuric acid, even the most durable extremophiles we know of.</p>
<p>Edit: It was an interesting AMA and definitely worth a read.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting to me they're now strongly considering it to be from life, because there's no known geologic process to produce this much phosphine, while also saying there's no known life that can survive in that atmosphere.</p>
<p>It seems they could just as easily say that because there's no known life that can survive that much sulphuric acid, it must be an unknown geologic process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is indeed one of the conclusions by the paper. People love going &quot;aaaaa life on venus!&quot; while the researchers are right now more like &quot;aaaaa life on venus or some kind of really cool chemical process we haven't seen before!&quot; Media just focuses on the life part because hype.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To be fair, &quot;atmospheric clouds of sulphuric acid&quot; is not an environment that exists on Earth, so there's no reason we should have encountered life that can live in such a place.  But the history of biology is full of discoveries of life living in places previously believed to be so hostile as to make it impossible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if Earth's Nitrogen/Oxygen concentrations are extremely hostile to most lifeforms, and the life that has evolved here (I'm writing from Earth) is highly anomalous. Maybe Venus is actually the most life-friendly atmosphere in the solar system, and we just don't know it because we're basing our definitions of life on our weird and unique situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think your assumption of ample nutrition is a flawed assumption. They specifically mention in the paper that these hypothetical life forms would be severely limited in their growth based on the very thin layer of habitable atmosphere, and further limited by the scarcity of nutrients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s correct. In an AMA I believe it was recently on Reddit the response was that the Venetian gas is like 90 percent sulphuric acid which even the most sulphuric acid resistant lifeform on earth would not be able to tolerate. Also, they described how the probes are cleaned and the microbes would have to live through the UV bombardment of space. The odds sound pretty low. That’s the mathematically proven part.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To give a sense of the scale of how much phosphine they detected the paper reports ~20ppb. 20 parts per billion does not sound like much however the mass of the atmosphere of Venus is ~4.8×10^20 kg. This means there is approximately 9.6x10^12 kg of phosphine in the atmosphere, and remember that it shouldn't be stable so it should be continuously destroyed. That is simply too much mass for a tiny amount of life deposited 60 years ago in an extremely hostile environment to make, additionally if it was caused by accidental human caused contamination we wouldn't expect it to be in stead state already and the concentration should be increasing which we will be able to measure in a few years to see if it has changed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well you said it, they did the math.  They figured out the maximum amount possible and it is less than they found.  Simple as that.  Could be they made a mistake or didn't take something into account, but a lot of smart people haven't found a problem yet.</p></div>		</li>
