			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of the extraction process uses diesel gasoline to extract the cocaine from the coco leaves. Watch the Gordon Ramsey video on youtube. So the more you can taste this, the more pure it is.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>
<p>I meant diesel fuel not gasoline. Sorry, I’m a 29 year old female that isn’t very car savvy. If you just watched the video you would know what I meant! Jeez</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should really be ether, not diesel fuel, but part of the war on drugs was getting ether and other volatile liquids heavily restricted in Colombia in an attempt to curtail production. Instead, producers switched to using diesel fuel which just adds more unnecessary adulterants to the final product.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that’s sort of true. </p>
<p>Gasoline is used in the manufacturing process and if you taste that it typically DOES mean it’s legit coke from the jungles or whatever, but it also means it likely hasn’t undergone the last phase of the purification process which is an acetone wash. </p>
<p>Cocaine does not dissolve in acetone but many of the alkaloids and other trash of the manufacturing process does. If you do an acetone wash it gets rid of these impurities but it also lowers the weight, sometimes significantly.  For this reason you can see why a product sold on weight and still gets you high regardless wouldn’t go through this process, which also increases production time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is they like to remove as much of the weight as possible as transporting it is very costly. Theyve got more than enough ways of getting that weight back in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nail polish or nail polish remover? Cause acetone wash is the last step and sometimes it’s not allowed to evaporate fully which is why it might have similarities with acetone. I’ve noticed that when I do the acetone (99.9%)wash myself with a better evaporation cycle it removes that burn you sometimes get with shitty coke.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally. </p>
<p>I remember last year I ran into a guy I sort of knew in a club and we made out. I immediately pulled back and said “are you on coke?” he was so surprised and lowkey freaked out that I could “tell” (guess he thought he looked sober) but really I could taste it the second we kissed. </p>
<p>He wasn’t aware that I was trying to stay sober from coke at the time, so that little surprise taste was like....agony and ecstasy at once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A friend of mine who passed away last year, had a boyfriend through high school. They would do coke often.</p>
<p>they broke up, and she got clean. A couple years later, he divorced his wife, and they got back together. Our friend group tried to tell her and show her how he was abusive and how she needed to get out of that relationship, but she wouldn't.</p>
<p>a few months before she passed, she told me that she was doing coke again, and it was because of him. He never stopped the whole time, and he was doing a lot. She didn't want to tell anyone that he got her addicted to coke again. She said the same thing; that she could tell when/ if he was on coke when they made out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s so incredibly sad. It really is so much about association. When I first started using, it was almost always with my friend Nate. He was a great, very smart, very charismatic guy- who had a massive coke problem. We would hang out together, he was there when I bought my first gram, and we had fun. </p>
<p>He moved away, I got clean. Then he came back for a visit, did coke the whole time. I didn’t do any, but then the day after he left I called the dealer and started right back up.</p></div>		</li>
