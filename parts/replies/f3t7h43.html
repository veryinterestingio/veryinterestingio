			<div class="markdown"><p>I love this answer! Adding on to this, movement of your stomach is motivated by a hormone known as Ghrelin, which your body releases about 4 hours after eating, which signifies that your body is now interested in eating again. Ghrelin makes you feel hungry, and triggers the contraction of smooth muscle around the stomach (causing the rumbling sound). (There's a theory that release of ghrelin is associated with how loose the stretch receptors in your stomach are) </p>
<p>Given that you just woke up, it's very likely that your body is in the late stages of digesting your dinner (food takes roughly 24 hours to fully pass through the digestive system), and now that you have woken up, your melatonin levels (sleep hormone) fall, and allow ghrelin levels to rise.</p>
<p>Once you eat, your body will start releasing a different series of hormones (leptin is a popular one)  which inhibits the release of ghrelin for about four hours. Horray for food intake!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it about 4 hours after eating for everyone? How much individual variation is there with that? I often will only eat three, sometimes just two big meals a day. I simply don't feel very hungry more often than that. Some people seem to be like me while others get peckish every three hours or so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Four hours is the typical biological response - without any sort of learning by the body. Naturally, if you become accustomed to eating a big breakfast, snacking throughout the day, and eating dinner, your body will slowly become used to it, and your hormones will likely be reflective of that learning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably going for a cray question here, but could we not use those last hormones (leptin and the like) to inhibit hunger and control food cravings on overweight people (the people with real problems with the food, not people with some tiroidism desease or something else)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are supplements that attempt to either increase the available amount of leptin, or the body's sensitivity to it. However, it isn't necessarily straight forward, obese people can actually have <em>more</em> leptin but the brain has reduced sensitivity to it, and people who lose weight by dieting experienced decreased levels of leptin. Beyond that, leptin is involved in other processes within the body besides simply &quot;am I hungry or not.&quot; So it could have a therapeutic value,  but it is likely more complicated than it would appear at first blush.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding on to the other answer, hunger is also not strictly due to these hormones. Habit (eat when bored, grazing through day, eat when sad, eat when happy, a candy bar at break, cookies after school, etc.) plays a large part in many people's struggle with weight loss, and that's another set of issues entirely. Their body isn't telling them they're hungry, per se, but they still desire to eat.</p>
<p>(I think there are theories out there that this is sometimes due to gut bacteria and how often we eat sweets and certain things at set times and they get used to it.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If ghrelin release is due to stretch receptors being less active then wouldn't having a glass of water have the same effect as using leptin without unwanted side effects. It works for me!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Be warned, I'm not a doctor, just a human anatomy and physiology student, so please don't take my understanding as an actual diagnosis! Please see a professional if the symptoms get too bad.</p>
<p>One possibility is that your stomach is physically smaller than most, and when eating a meal, the sheer volume causes an upset to the level of stomach acid (which is also a possibility, your stomach could be producing too much acid) reaches up too high, which could cause a burning of the lower esophagus (heartburn).</p>
<p>A possible solution to try is smaller meals throughout the day, but more frequently. (4 or 5 smaller meals as opposed to 3 big ones). See if there's a trend between the kind of food you eat and how bad your stomach feels (sugars pass through the system much faster than something like fat). Keep a log if you want to talk to a doctor, and make sure you drink water! (Shoutout to r/hydrohomies)</p>
<p>As far as the bloating is concerned, I unfortunately have no idea, beyond the stomach size thing.</p></div>		</li>
