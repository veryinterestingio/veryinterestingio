			<div class="markdown"><p>The technology banning and regulation is very interesting, when the vaporfly's came out they basically fucked over every single long distance record and had to be banned, there's certainly technology that could drastically improve performance (the same could be said of the anti-drag swimsuits). I am not certain what happens with the records broken exploiting that technology before it's banned though, do they stand? If so it's unlikely humans will ever beat a lot of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've often thought about this. How important are performances of dead people to the point that we're holding back people. Soccer/football doesn't seem to care much as they change the ball every few years. Baseball cares a lot and the bats and balls are <em>allegedly</em> the same as they've been used since the beginning. Though some people think baseballs are juiced now. Should everybody have to wear the same shoes while running? The same bike while cycling? It seems so odd to think about it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is definitely a cycling record somewhere that requires the rider to ride a bike equivalent to a 20th century level of tech. These things are not uncommon i wouldn't think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>MLB changed the baseball to be less &quot;bouncy&quot; because athletes have more power than they used to and the number of homeruns have increased every season.</p>
<p>While the bats remain largely the same, players can still choose the sealant and finish of the bat.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Could possibly happen during the olympics but would never happen in the pro scene since there's too much money from brand sponsorship for having people win using <em>their</em> bikes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sorta stuff is in line with insanely hard tricks in speedrunning just not being attempted because of how boring it would be if everyone did them.</p>
<p>Say Mario 64, PLENTY of tricks that would in total save you a few minutes on the current record, but if runners grinded to be able to perform them to the point where the world record is just a run that gets every trick first try, who the fuck wants to sit there resetting every time they miss a trick because it GUARENTEE'S that they don't have the chance to break the world record.</p>
<p>If the record for X running event is Y speed until a new technology comes around to shorten that time by a big amount then it's less about the athletes raw capability to outperform everyone else but rather the quality of the technology they're using. Why should I care about the best archer in the world who's bow aims for him?</p></div>		</li>

also doping and even genetic-tailored doping.
also improved nutrition during development in children who are at the same time funneled into being an athlete since kindergarten (even in motorbike racing children are shoved into training early on by racing on mini-motorbikes)</p></div>		</li>
