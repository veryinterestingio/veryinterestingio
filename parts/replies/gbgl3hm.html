			<div class="markdown"><p>good point. I've also learned that the environment is a really important consideration too. My original goal of the question was along the lines of: let's say you have a bacterium. How much could you reduce the genome and still have the same bacterium. What are the limits for different &quot;body plans&quot; of life? How efficient is the genetic encoding relative to its maximum efficiency? I know that as you knock out genes you could lose proteins. In which case it technically would not be the same bacterium anymore. But maybe there are alternative more efficient encodings for the same protein.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think your question is very interesting! It’s difficult to imagine how you could do this experimentally though. You would need a way to select for things with small genomes such that they have a competitive advantage over the larger organism. I don’t know how this could be achieved, it’s hard to see any natural selection pressure achieving this, and I can’t see any lab-contrived set up that’s straight forward. Not to say it’s not possible though, but experimentally very difficult.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, in practice it would be quite challenging.  I was envisioning artificial selection rather than natural selection. For example, with bacteria, one could find the individual bacterium with the smallest genome and let it reproduce until a bacterium with a smaller genome emerges. Several selection lines could be used to allow for multiple pathways to a small genome. </p>
<p>But then how can the genome size be found without killing the bacterium?  Maybe a tracer that binds to DNA and lights up could be used to measure genome size. The stronger the light, the larger the genome. The question is just out of curiosity, but that is how I envision it could be done. </p>
<p>Of course the procedure would be different plants and animals, where the genome could in most cases be sequenced wihout killing the organism, but the tradeoff is that the time to reproduce would be slower. So a faster reproduction time could speed up the results.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even with this, it's still a surprisingly complex question. Look at things like mitochondria, for example. They are organels: part of another organism, yet they have their own DNA. Then you have things like leoprasy, which have tiny genomes because of their specialisation for growing in specific environments. Fully independent organisms, again, are a different consideration.</p>

<p>By altering the DNA you would technically have a different one.</p></div>		</li>
