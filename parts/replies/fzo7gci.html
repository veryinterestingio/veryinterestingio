<p>Edit: narrator is Ray Porter. I believe he is on reddit.</p>
<p>Edit2: I had to go back through my history to when I praised him for his awesomeness, but u/therayporter is his username.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seeing as nobody’s made an ELI5 of Von Neumann probes here I’ll explain:</p>
<p>Step 1: build and launch probe</p>
<p>Step 2: probe lands on new planet/asteroid/etc</p>
<p>Step 3: probe gathers all resources, builds new probes with them.</p>
<p>Step 4: launch probes</p>
<p>??? </p>
<p>Profit: the probes continue to create more probes, multiplying at large rates and spreading to more places. Everything (that the probes can reach) will eventually turn into probes searching for new resources.</p>

<p>We are standing on the shoulders of giants. As we create new technologies (or other advances in society), we are able to use those technologies to then create other newer technologies and so on. We built crappy computers that helped us build faster computers that helped us build even faster computers and so on. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this is true to an extent, I think it's lacking in attributing the key technology that really started the massive speed up the question is really pointing at.</p>
<p>High speed (for the time) communication.</p>
<p>When new information and technology still had to be physically carried location to location, distance meant time. And the more distant two points were, the more likely it was that the carrier or ther information would meet with done occurrence that would prevent delivery, whether that was a natural event (a ship sinking in a storm) or man-made (robbery, murder, etc).</p>
<p>Once we developed and built the lines for the telegram, what could once take years (a message from California to England, for example) could instead take first weeks, then days, then hours as we laid more lines. This was concurrent with the development and application of efficient and safe steam power, first in railroads, then on riverboats, and finally on ocean going ships.</p>
<p>As the distances between people grew ever shorter, technology and ideas could travel those lines. Where once a new invention could fade into obscurity as it went unknown and undeveloped by the wider world, now every new machine or technology could take root and grow thousands of miles from its original inventor. Could be refined by hundreds of minds seeking new purposes for it.</p>
<p>In a way, we crowd-sourced the modern age.</p></div>		</li>

I agree that communication advances added momentum to the train. But the Industrial Revolution was the fuel that pushed the train out of the station.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that high speed communication helps, but I think the real fundamental change that has lead to so much progress is literacy.  </p>
<p>Having more than a small percent of the population able to read and write means that the ideas and knowledge can be written down, copied, and distributed to more people.  Before widespread literacy was a thing, anyone wanting to learn from someone else had to spend years or decades studying with/under that person; literacy changed that because then you could distribute that knowledge far faster and more efficiently than apprenticeships would allow.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Literacy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For sure, but you can’t separate that from communication.  When the only means of sharing information were books hand copied over years and costing more than an annual salary, literacy is irrelevant.  It becomes useful with the printing press, then pamphlets, then newspapers, the nightly broadcasts, to email, to almost instant text and chat Capabilities</p></div>		</li>

The speed which we can send an idea across the world is definitely one of the biggest factors in the rate at which our science and technology advances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Check out Ray Kurzweil's books if you haven't already. I really like the idea that technology and society progress in S curves, slow to start, fast in adoption, and a taper off into the next thing. The thing is each S curve progresses faster than the one before it, the standing on the shoulders of giants. I love the concept of the singularity and could talk about all day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a book called Superintelligence by Nick Bostrom about this very thing. The answer is very complicated and depends on how we get there. It is difficult to determine the motivations and agenda of something so far removed from us. Can the mouse determine what the owl wants to do and why? Can the owl communicate to the mouse what it means? For any Ai to exist in a way they would be the best for us personally we would need shared experiences with it. It would need to know what it means to be human. It could help us, guide us, conquer us, or absorb us. Maybe all at the same time.</p></div>		</li>
