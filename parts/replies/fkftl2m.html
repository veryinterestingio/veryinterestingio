			<div class="markdown"><p>Especially during action movies I often find myself turning the audio up and down. They're usually mixed so you need to turn it to 50 if you want any chance to understand the dialogues but the explosions blast your ears at 20. In my experience, they're doing the opposite of what they should be doing. Specifically those of cinema-quality. I have always assumed they just tune the sound for cinema shows and go lazy on adjusting it to normal levels for their streaming/blu-ray versions. </p>
<p>I still remember the first panem movie because I could barely understand anything if I turned the volume to 60+. But there's one giant explosion when the main character shoots an arrow at some pile of explosives... Man, I didn't know any of my TV screens could be so loud. Even at a volume of 10 when I couldn't hear anything else, that explosion is still too awfully loud. Action movies...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that they are being lazy. There is definitely a different mix created for the movie theater and streaming service. The thing is that some people have really nice home theater setups and still want the movie theater experience. So they still make what is called a 'dynamic mix'. </p>
<p>I think in the future they will have to add additional audio options for people who want a more traditional broadcast TV style mix. Broadcast TV had its audio dynamics squashed to hell and we're all set used to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I must have good luck with action movies. </p>
<p>Then again the only ones I've seen lately have been John Wick, so there's that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>an action movie is likely to have a sound mix with louder vocal levels than some other shows, because the voices need to be heard over or in contrast to gunfire and explosions without the explosions being too loud</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You say this, but it's a never-ending battle when I watch action movies to hear the voices and not have the loud parts shake my walls.</p></div>		</li>
