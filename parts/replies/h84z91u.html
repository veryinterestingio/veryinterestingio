			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty neat, though as mentioned on the website there is a fair amount of learning involved to intone one's voice with the device. The intonation is manually controlled (if you watch the demo video he states that a light press of the device's button gives a low intonation and the harder you press it the higher the voice sounds.)</p>
<p>Still, quite an improvement over the older devices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense and thanks for responding. However… I guess when I think innovations like noise cancelling where they inject an inverted wave in the incoming wave to cancel out the unwanted sound, that they could do some sort of audio “up scaling” to get to a more pleasant and intelligible tone even if still was monotone. Some high end TVs can take really crappy content and upscale the picture to 4K. Seems like it would be easier to do with sound only. Am I missing something why that wouldn’t be possible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the sound you hear doesn’t come from the device, you only hear it after it’s been modified by the speaker.  The vibration from the electrolarynx causes the air within the pharynx to vibrate, which the speaker then modifies to create speech.  </p>
<p>I think that part of the problem you are hearing is that the buzz of the electrolarynx is constant, whereas normal voice switches on and off very quickly during speech.   For example, in the word ‘example’, it is voiced at the beginning, voiceless in the ‘x’, voiced again until ‘p’ and then voiced again at the end.  This level of electrolarynx use is near impossible to achieve. </p>
<p>What you’re describing in terms of correcting the final output would need to happen after the speech was produced.  Not technically impossible, as you say, but it would require a further device, and remove the speech one step further away from natural conversation.</p>
<p>Also, since the advent of surgical voice restoration, the electrolarynx has become a fallback option, so there is limited call for development.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact : there's already some Chinese voice that are indistinguishable from real human if you provide the sentence and pick the correct template. The tempo and pause is important for English and Mandarin.</p>
<p>For example Indian speak more accurate English than Japanese. But Indian tend to stick all word together without pause because Tamil has no pause between words. It is easier to understand Japanese English than Indian English.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because with both of those you're starting with information. With electronic voice you're starting from scratch. There's nothing to Iscariot upscale. Plus with digital image processing you're often losing information elsewhere or guessing based on the surrounding pixels. Since the voice is created wholesale, there's nothing to guess from</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Feed that buzz into voice recognition software and then output it through a speech synthesizer? It won't sound conversational but some text-to-speech software does a very good job of sounding not totally robotic.</p></div>		</li>
