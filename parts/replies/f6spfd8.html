			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer!  Feynman maintained that if your math yielded infinite values, your math was probably wrong.  Infinite mass AND infinitely small size?  As with Newtonian mathematics before it, General Relativity has limitations, we just arenâ€™t sure what they are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it is quite possible to do math consistently with infinities in a rigorously-defined way.  It's non-standard, but it's quite viable to work with in principle.  Still, modern physics is usually done with standard analysis so you're right, infinity is not a valid value in standard number systems and any prediction involving them must be given a proper stink-eye. :p</p>
<p>Still, the bigger problem is the lack of differentiability of spacetime inside the Cauchy horizon, and the Einstein field equations are differential equations which are simply not valid for a non-differentiable spacetime.  So any prediction made by apparently solving them cannot be trusted.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Tbf, singularities only describes points in space with a certain mass, meaning infinite density. It doesn't need infinite mass. In fact, it cannot possibly have infinite mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Infinity is not a real or complex number.  Chances are that if you are playing with infinity, &quot;your math is probably wrong&quot; because math changes when infinity is a number and you have probably not verified that all of your mathematical models are still valid and consistent under your new axiomatic system.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We don't really say that <em>black holes</em> are infinitely dense, a black hole's density seen from the outside can be defined according to its Schwarzschild radius (in the simplest case) in which case it is not infinite at all.</p>
<p>We say that <em>singularities</em> are infinitely dense, or more accurately, we say the density is <em>divergent</em> (undefined) because the closer you get to the singularity the more curved spacetime becomes; the singularity is effectively an asymptote.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Well, that phrasing seems to imply a finite, well-defined density, and what is &quot;extremely&quot; dense is subjective.  For example, almost everyone will agree that neutron stars are extremely dense, but black holes are surely not neutron stars on the inside.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The thing is, because the warping of spacetime is so extreme, beyond the event horizon there is no force (either known or in theoretical principle consistent with relativity) which could prevent total collapse into a point (or flat ring, in the case of a black hole with angular momentum) with exactly zero volume.  Since the volume is exactly zero, and you can't divide by zero, the density is undefined and grows towards infinity the closer you get to the singularity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What's really funny is that, because a black hole's radius grows relative to its mass's square root, supermassive black holes are less dense than water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it doesn't matter what <em>extremely high</em> number you can come up with, I can point to a place in the black hole where the density is higher. To infinity. No matter how big of a number you name. </p>
<p>That is why infinity is used. It isn't a number. It is a concept. It means that no matter how high you go, I can go higher.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a nutshell, the Cauchy horizon is the boundary at which you start to get closed timelike curves instead of closed spacelike curves.  As I understand it, for a Schwarzschild black hole the event horizon and Cauchy horizon are effectively the same, but for rotating (Kerr) black holes they are not the same and you have an outer event horizon and an &quot;inner event horizon,&quot; or Cauchy horizon.  Beyond the Cauchy horizon is where you get non-deterministic &quot;solutions&quot; to the Einstein field equations, apparently because spacetime becomes non-differentiable and the equations fail to be applicable anymore.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p></div>		</li>
