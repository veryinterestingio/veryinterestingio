<p>Unsalted nuts, regular or dried fruit, fresh veggies (carrot, green bean, celery sticks) etc. Early on, your taste buds will tell you it's bland and needs salt or sugar. But as you eat more and more of the &quot;bland&quot; stuff and less salt, your tongue will discover the tastes that were in the &quot;bland&quot; stuff all along.</p></div>		</li>
