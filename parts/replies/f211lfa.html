			<div class="markdown"><p>I can’t answer that, but using your muscles causes damage, and the repair process (paired with eating food) is what creates muscle growth</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strictly speaking, muscle damage isn't necessary for muscle growth. Ideally you want to be aiming for the point <em>just</em> before damage starts occurring. Properly the phrase should be &quot;no ache, no gain&quot; – when ache becomes pain, stop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Massage can injure the muscle. Ideally your muscles should be warmed with lighter massage strokes or heat before any hard pressure or any work on deeper muscles. If you don’t warm the area you can injure the muscle and create scaring. Most people think that deep tissue means super hard pressure over large sections of the body but research is showing this can be harmful. If you get bruises from a massage, then it wasn’t done correctly. If you haven’t had a massage in a while there may be some soreness, but that will go away with ice and gentle stretching.</p></div>		</li>
