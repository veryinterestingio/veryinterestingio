			<div class="markdown"><p>Realistically, taking into account thermal expansion and contraction is going to result in a much more significant change than the curvature of the earth. </p>
<p>For each mile of curvature, you're seeing less than 8 inches of elevation change. Whereas, over a 1 mile range, I think it would be pretty realistic to see a couple feet of change due to thermal expansion and contraction for, say, a concrete building. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean keep in mind that in this scenario it's a concrete building spanning a full mile in length. That's not something you'll really see very often. This is also taking into account a significant change in temperature so it would be between like summer and winter. of about 35C/95F. This is why there are expansion joints built into buildings. </p>
<p>But this is why you see all that space between concrete blocks on sidewalks. There needs to be a lot of room to expand and contract.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The story is the test pilot discovered this when he placed his hat in this gap for safekeeping during a flight and found when he landed his hat was now an extremely thin part of the plane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Romanian Parliament is a 19 century building, so chances are a lot of the walls are load bearing masonry walls that are then spanned by wood beams. That setup in itself allows for regional expansion and contraction. You can consider any such bay between two masonry walls to be an independent system. </p>
<p>Modern Expansion Joints becomes a need once structures are engineered in steel/concrete and overall structure acts as a singularity. </p></div>		</li>
