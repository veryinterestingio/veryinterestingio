			<div class="markdown"><p>I would guess that dichotomy effects such as these present more infrequently/mildly when viewing yourself in that way. We are very good at recognizing gray area in ourselves, we have a much harder time seeing gray in other people.</p>
<p>It's a combination of only having access to the constant dialogue for yourself, and not having enough mental capacity to hold an idea of every person you meet in complex detail.</p>
<p>We see people who are closest to us (if we are emotional mature) as complex people capable of varied responses, but it's much, much harder to do this with more than a handful of people. Hence the emergence of tribalism, in groups, nationalism, etc</p></div>		</li>
