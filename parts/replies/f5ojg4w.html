			<div class="markdown"><p>“Stress” isn’t bad for you. </p>
<p>Exercise is stressful. Anytime you get excited or you feel strong emotions, your body is getting stressed. </p>
<p>So that’s the first distinction. </p>
<p>Let’s say then an “unhealthy lifestyle” is bad for you. Because that’s really what it is. </p>
<p>First the body needs to be in balance between the SN and PNS (the nervous systems). </p>
<p>You need both rest and “activation”. </p>
<p>This is why too much exercise is actually bad for the body. We’re talking many hours everyday with poor rest/recovery. </p>
<p>Second, the body has basic needs to function properly. </p>
<p>For example, without stress on your body, bones won’t repair themselves and they will become brittle. Which one reason why astronauts need to exercise in space. </p>
<p>Physical Exercise triggers all kinds of long term positive hormonal responses like growth hormone and testosterone. </p>
<p>It also helps strengthen and improve your circulatory system. </p>
<p>Why doesn’t everyday “stress” help with that? </p>
<p>Because even when stressed your heart rate isn’t that elevated. The physical stress isn’t that high which means lack of positive adaptation. </p>
<p>Plus, people tend to be chronically “stressed” which inhibits the PNS which means you aren’t recovering and restoring your body. </p>
<p>Third, there are groups of emotions that trigger negative effects on the body. These aren’t that well understood, but feelings of hopelessness and dread can cause the body to go into an emergency state beyond just the regular SN activation. </p>
<p>I believe that is a culprit behind a lot of health problems.</p>
<p>Here is one study that shows increased death strongly correlated with feelings of hopelessness:
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/8849626/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/8849626/</a></p>
<p>I’m sure there are other reasons, but those are the big ones from the top of my head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer I've seen in this thread. As someone taking an exercise physiology class right now, there's way too much going on to fully explain everything, but the most important detail is chronic versus acute, or &quot;long-lasting&quot; versus &quot;short-lived&quot; effects. When you put your body through exercise-induced stress, you're essentially training your body to become more efficient with what it has. The more efficient your body, the better it will function. Those acute stresses help the body. Chronic stresses essentially deteriorate the body and it's ability to function efficiently. The more stress you're under more of the time, the more worn out your body's systems get. I think the original comment hits on that nicely. Although as a side note, the body isn't very good at distinguishing what is or isn't a fight-or-flight situation. What I mean by that is, if you're running, the body naturally assumes it is running from some type of danger. This applies even during intentional exercise or training just as it might if you were running away from/fighting off zombies, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So would recovery be relevant here and explain the difference? After exercise, the body is allowed to rest and make those adaptations to the stress/damage of the exercise, whereas in the case of chronic stress, there is no downtime to allow the adaptations to occur; so could chronic stress then be like a state of low-grade, constant overtraining?</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jlorockz" target="_blank">jlorockz</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that's a very good way to look at it. Essentially that is what is happening. Recovery is huge for your health. That's why if you don't get enough sleep, your body functions start failing. Your immune system weakens, you can't think clearly, you find it difficult to be motivated to do things, etc. Most of the recover or repairs done on the body happen when you're asleep. I've heard it explained as basically your body has less so worry about at night because you're not doing anything, so it can focus more of it's resources on repairing the body. Just like when you don't get enough sleep and your body starts to deteriorate, similar things happen with chronic stress since there is less time for your body to recover. Sleep and recovery are very important.</p></div>		</li>
