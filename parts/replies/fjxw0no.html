			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent points, made in true eli5 fashion which I appreciate. However, when you say that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes cracks snap bigger and make an earthquake that is not on a fault line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Earthquakes always occur on fault planes, by definition. Often these faults are not actually noticeable at the surface (the displacement can get smaller and smaller to the point of no fault at the surface), but sudden movement along a fault plane is literally what an earthquake is. </p>
<p>Thinking about it, I reckon you meant that “sometimes cracks snap bigger and make an earthquake that is not on [or near] a <strong>plate boundary</strong>”. Plate boundaries and faults are two different things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rocks on global scales are not solid and unyielding. Think of it more like a bunch of chunks of rubber. (And as mentioned above, they are not perfectly straight smooth edges, but ragged) As one piece moves along or under another, the pieces catch and deform on scales of hundreds of miles - on a scale of several hundred miles, rock is flexible to a small amount. Think of the amount of energy stored up when a chunk of rock a couple of hundred miles long and tens of miles thick is being squashed or stretched so it's even 10 or 20 feet out of position from where it should be.  </p>
<p>Then the piece with the most stretch or easiest slip lets go. The pieces can't hold where they are any more, a spot lets go, and everything shakes as the repercussions ripple of giant chunks of earth moving a dozen or more feet to relieve stress. Now, the area before or after that release may not have enough stress to release and keep going. It may have been unstressed because the other area had all the stress; or it may have had an earthquake much earlier and let go. </p>
<p>This is how, for example, scientists can look at plate boundaries and predict - for example, the plates have moved in California and Alaska, and evidence (a sunken forest of broken giant trees) shows over 500 years ago there was a giant earthquake in Seattle area; so it's well overdue for one so that chunk of the plate can catch up to the rest.  </p>
<p>(You can see photos of earthquake fault lines where the earth has moved enough that for example, over the decades roads and fields no longer line up properly on each side. There's a park near Wellington NZ where the fault is a small berm where one side of the ground is about 10 feet higher than the other...)</p>
<p>Plus, the edges of the plates, as mentioned are not straight. Worse than that, some places the edges are like broken glass - there are minor chunks between to two main plates, and fracture lines running between into one plate because of overstretching,  and so on... and earthquakes can happen along any of those boundaries too as they re-adjust.  It's not as clean and simple as the &quot;first principles&quot; explanations would have you believe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the person you asked, but I've posted this comment a few times in this thread so I can answer! </p>
<p>Oil and gas production in Oklahoma brings a lot of water up from the ground in addition to the fossil fuels, and that wastewater is generally too contaminated to economically do anything with it. So to get rid of it, they inject it back underground into a different layer of rock that is porous and can hold a lot of water. However, those layers are also fractured and connected to deeper faults in the underlying basement rock, and the pressure changes because of the water injection activate the faults and cause slip. I find the diagram in <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2015/06/18/okla-quake-drilling-061815" target="_blank">this article</a> (and the article itself) to be helpful!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question, and u/spcialkfpc did not really give a correct answer. First, everyone in this comment thread is saying &quot;epicentre&quot; when they actually mean &quot;hypocentre&quot;. The latter is the actual point in 3D space at which the earthquake begins. The former is the point on the surface of earth, projected directly upwards from the hypocentre.</p>
<p>An earthquake is not a single point in space. The hypocentre can more or less be located to a single point because it is the beginning point, but once the earthquake begins, there is a rupture. A fault is a plane in the earth's crust. This can be between two tectonic plates where each are sliding and grinding past one another, or it can be in a a single plate in places where there is crustal folding/crumpling/stretching. Either way, there is some area where one part is moving one way and the other part is moving a different way. That is a fault, and a fault is a 2D plane (generally).</p>
<p>When an earthquake occurs, it begins at a &quot;point&quot; on the fault plane and ruptures outwards from that point. A rupture is the two sides of the fault sliding rapidly past each other. Because we are talking about the earth here, which is huge, this rapid slipping (ie. rupture) doesn't happen all at once, though it does happen very quickly. The entire rupture is considered the whole earthquake. The size of the rupture (ie. the total area of the fault plane that underwent this rapid slipping), the speed of the rupture front (ie. how quickly it propagated on the fault plane),  and the direction the rupture went (ie. up, down, side to side, more in one direction, in all directions, etc.) all depends on the stresses involved, the type of rock, how deep the earthquake is etc. etc.</p>
<p>To give you some numbers, a megathrust earthquake, like the Big One that is supposed to happen on the north american west coast, or the big earthquake in Japan a good few years ago, has a rupture area on the order of hundreds of square kilometers, and can have a rupture speed on the order of a few km/s. These are the biggest earthquakes the earth is capable of producing. The rupture from start to finish can be 10's of seconds (ie. 10-90 seconds).</p>
<p>In contrast, some earthquakes are very small. They may have rupture speeds of a few km/s but the area of the rupture may be much smaller, maybe a few square metres. Some earthquakes are very slow, with rupture speeds of only a few centimetres per day but rupture a very large area (10s - 100s of square km) and not very much slipping.</p>
<p>This is all to say that an earthquake never ever occurs at a single point in space. The energy radiated from an earthquake rupture comes from different points in the rupture area at different times in different magnitudes. For large earthquakes, it is very possible to locate the &quot;area&quot; of an earthquake rather than the &quot;point&quot; of an earthquake. However, it is easiest to locate the hypocentre (again, the &quot;point&quot; where the rupture begins) so this is how it is usually done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>The boundaries between tectonic plates are not a clean, uniform “slice” like you would make in a cake.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes definitely, a very good point to make. </p>
<p>Overall this is a decent explanation in terms of the very broadest of pictures, but is a little muddled in the way you describe any detail. I know this is explain like I’m 5, so there’s no need for us to go full geophysics mode or anything, but I’ll try and clear a couple of things up:</p>
<p>• Earthquakes are obviously concentrated at and close to the plate boundaries, but there are many other earthquakes which occur within plates, far from any boundary between plates. Some of these are due to movement of magma within the crust (the hotspots supplying magma to the crust beneath Yellowstone or Hawaii produce a certain background level of earthquake swarms for instance), but many are also due to the tectonic forces originating at plate boundaries then being transmitted through the plates. This is particularly true for the continental portions of plates, which are more easily deformable than the more competent and rigid oceanic parts. </p>
<p>• So the follow on from this would be that earthquakes are not a thing that actually happen exclusively on plate boundaries as such, because they happen on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_(geology)" target="_blank">faults</a>. Obviously, faults are concentrated around plate boundaries, but in continental portions of plates there are many faults throughout - often leftover from places where there used to be a plate boundary there - these then get ‘reactivated’ with the stresses passing through the crust from hundreds of kilometres away. </p>
<p>• Looking at faults then, it’s important to recognise that they are a plane within the crust along which movement occurs, so that the portions of crust either side become offset from eachother. Knowing this, there must be some start and end to the fault, where the displacement dies out to zero. Somewhere on the plane near the middle of the distance between these end points will be the point of maximum displacement - where movement occurs here is the <strong>origin</strong> of an earthquake. Because the origin is located at the part of the fault with the most displacement, it’s actually not a small point but a large surface over which the earthquake is originally produced. </p>
<p>• The earthquake origin is also called the <strong>focus</strong>, or the <strong>hypocentre</strong> (geologists love multiple words for the same thing or similar things). The <strong>epicentre</strong> is actually the point on the Earth’s surface directly above the hypocentre - the closest point that you can get to the hypocentre if you are on the surface. </p>
<p>One last quick one, when you say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This release of energy causes shockwaves (for lack of a better term) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The better term you’re looking for is seismic waves ;) </p>
<p>It’s perfectly clear what you’re getting at, I just thought it worth mentioning seeing as seismic waves travel at the speed of sound of the rock they are moving through, whereas shockwaves are a different phenomenon - they refer specifically to waves which travel <em>faster</em> than the speed of sound in whatever medium they are travelling through. For shockwaves to occur in the crust it takes <em>even more</em> energy than is produced by earthquakes; this occurs when large enough meteorites hit the Earth.</p></div>		</li>
