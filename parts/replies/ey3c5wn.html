<p>Maybe you want to look for a Blue Whale. You search, you have to look through every page to find when you want.</p>
<p>Or you could flip to the back of the book, look in the index for Blue Whale which lists all the pages that reference it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I figured I'd keep the example in the realm of the original question (searching on a computer). There's a high probability that a lot of people reading this have never even used an encyclopedia and don't know what an index in a book is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair comment. I know in the UK we have catalog retailers where you go in, look for the items in a book, get the item number and then go to a till to order it. Most people have been to Argos or Screwfix in the UK.
I don't think you have that in the USA though.</p>
<p>Second best is a shop with the items in an isle above it, with the dividers down there further pointing you to your item :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just ribbing you. This is Explain Like I’m 5, or ELI5. A few years ago the answers usually tried to address an imagined five year old. They’ve drifted to being general explanations since then. Yours was very good but not sure a 5yo would follow, maybe a 10yo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This still doesn’t make sense to me.</p>
<p>The filenames have to be sitting somewhere so the OS can be aware of them, right? There isn’t a place where the filenames are just hanging out you can quickly query?</p>
<p>I feel like I could make a recursive (into folders) filename regex matcher in python that would just blast its way through this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Filesystem do have an index of files, but they're not indexed by name, they're indexed by a unique id. And they're not stored as a list, it's a B-tree.</p>
<p>It's optimized for getting at any single file quickly, but since the underlying data structure has nothing to do with the directory structure or filenames, when you're going in and out of folders repeatedly, you're not exactly accessing it in any optimal order.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>aha! how many files are typically in it? what’s computational complexity for visiting every node in the tree? It seems like even if there are millions of files it should be able to just blaze through it.</p></div>		</li>
