			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why in French, there is  &quot;ininflammable&quot; with 2 &quot;in&quot; : one &quot;not able&quot; and one &quot;able&quot; which means &quot;not able to be able to catch fire&quot;, like a rock.</p>
<p>The two &quot;in&quot; are not pronounced the same way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well &quot;ignifugé&quot; means that it has been adapted to become &quot;ininflammable&quot;.</p>
<p>Like you could make a sofa &quot;ignifugé&quot; which therefore makes it &quot;ininflammable&quot;.</p>
<p>Some material, like concrete, are naturally &quot;ininflammable&quot; and can't be called &quot;ignifugé&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd also note that inflammable is a much older word than flammable, originating about two centuries earlier</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We get inflammable from the Latin verb inflammare, which combines flammare (&quot;to catch fire&quot;) with a Latin prefix in-, which means &quot;to cause to.&quot; This in- shows up occasionally in English words, though we only tend to notice it when the in- word is placed next to its root word for comparison: impassive and passive, irradiated and radiated, inflame and flame. Inflammable came into English in the early 1600s.</p>
<p>Things were fine until 1813, when a scholar translating a Latin text coined the English word flammable from the Latin flammare</p>

<p>And then 100 years later...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s reported that, as early as the 1920s, the eagle-eyed language guardians of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) realized that many people were viewing the in– in inflammable as a negative prefix and were at risk of consequently incinerating themselves at a much higher rate than was desirable. (Is any rate really desirable, though?)</p>
<p>The NFPA advocated to have flammable used exclusively for warning labels (such as are found on mattresses, oil cans, and other things that will catch on fire if you put a match to them) and managed to nudge our language toward a more sensible path.</p>
<p>According to Google Ngrams, flammable takes over inflammable in frequency in the 1970s, likely corresponding to such safety efforts. Flammable (along with combustible) is now more common in technical contexts, particularly as a warning on vehicles carrying combustible materials. Inflammable is the word more usually used in nontechnical and figurative settings (e.g., The speaker ignited the inflammable emotions of the crowd).</p>
