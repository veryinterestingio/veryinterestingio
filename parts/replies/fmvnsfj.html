			<div class="markdown"><p>The parasite is Trichomonas Gallinae, and it can be spread by contaminated water and food. It's common in pigeons and raptors that eat pigeons, so if you feed birds in your garden, clean your feeders and water dishes regularly, and put them where pigeons can't get at them.</p></div>		</li>
