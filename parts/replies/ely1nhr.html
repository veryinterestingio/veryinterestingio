<p>Increasing general amounts of seretonin in the brain wont cause happiness. seretonin is a widely used neurotransmitter that we still don't completely understand it's pathway but the primary receptor we believe has any association with depression is 5HT-1A but there are over 20 different types of seretonin receptors such as 5HT-2A which is what we believe is active when people take hallucinogenic drugs and a slew of others that have wide spread inhibitory and excitatory effects and as the article mentions most of which are responsible for our gut</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Testosterone can cross the BBB where it goes into the hypothalmic pituitary axis (HPA) and it then has a bunch of things it can do</p>
<p>Some believe it activates receptors that trigger aggressive behavior and It also inhibits the release of GnRH (the chemical that ultimately produces more testosterone)</p>
<p>Can be converted to estrogen which is what some believe is where our libido comes from</p>
<p>This is actually why taking anabolic steroids have the effect that they do because they mimic testosterone with out being able to be broken down into DHT and estrogen while also lowering your natural testosterone </p>
<p>So it increases aggression, lowers sex drive and can cause a reduction in sperm growth (DHT)</p></div>		</li>
