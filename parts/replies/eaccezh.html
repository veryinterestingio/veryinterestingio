			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what type of bet you make too. The basic pass bet actually has the best odds, and stuff like hard sixes or eights is kind of a trap.</p>
<p>Honestly though, for me craps is just about playing a cooperative, friendly game where most people are cheering for each other. When somebody is on a hot streak, the atmosphere around the table can be electrifying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. Plus the more picky roller always gets to choose dice from a pool of about 6 in craps anyway. This helps a lot too. The real issue is players coming in with their own dice. </p></div>		</li>
