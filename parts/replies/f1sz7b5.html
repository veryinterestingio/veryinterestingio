			<div class="markdown"><p>Applying natural selection mechanisms to modern humans can't be thought of in the same way as the ancient human.</p>
<p>With an abundance of food, security and technology, why would uv exposure become a selection pressure killing people/babies, preventing the proliferation of light skinned genes.</p>
<p>UV can be solved with clothes, creams and if you're always enclosed in a structure you can put uv filters on anything transparent.</p>
<p>Rather than seeing a genetic adaptation I find it more likely humans will have a technological adaptation to new environments and dangers.</p></div>		</li>
