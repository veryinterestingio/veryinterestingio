What the virus actually &quot;wants&quot;, is to survive and procreate. Some viruses have two phases in their life, one where they infect a cell and lie dormant (see explanation above), and one where they &quot;activate&quot;, we call that the lytic phase. When they activate they take over your cell and use it to create their protein shell and copy their genetic information and fuse both into mature virus particles.</p>
<p>To survive you can't wait too long to start up the lytic phase or your host cell might just die due to cellular stress. Thats why they use certain receptors to &quot;feel&quot; if a cell is under stress, and thus might die in the near future. It tries to &quot;escape&quot; the possibly dying cell, like jumping off the sinking ship trying to survive.</p>
<p>To summarize: it just tries to avoid dying when a cell dies because of natural factors by creating other virus particles and escaping said dying cell.</p>
<p>I hope this is a clear explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. So theoretically stressing a human pushes the virus out where it could be attacked by immune system. I can't be the first who thought of that way to make a vaccine. What's the showstopper?</p></div>		</li>

<p>But it can't fully prevent it, since the virus is still there. Just in a weakened form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get coldsores and they always happen just before menstruation. It's so weird, like clockwork. Bit it will happen for 5 or 6 months in a row, then stop for a year and then do 3 months, then stop for 2 months, and then happen again for 6. I don't understand what the hormones are doing. I don't feel stressed when it happens. </p>
<p>Can we see the virus hiding in the nerves? How big is the maximum size for something to be able to travel down a nerve? Can we create teeny tiny robots and drive them to the virus and take it apart?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>A quick google-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Herpesvirus DNA varies in molecular weight from approximately 80 to 150 million, or 120 to 250 kilobase pairs, depending on the virus. This DNA core is surrounded by a capsid which consists of 162 capsomers, arranged in icosapentahedral symmetry. The capsid is approximately 100 to 110 nanometers in diameter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s smaller than the wavelengths of light we use to see. You would only be able to actually see them with an electron microscope, which needs vacuum to work. No, we can’t visually see them inside nerves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be super pendantic, we could still use light microscopy; super resolution microscopy is a thing, and techniques such as 4Pi microscopy have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10504" target="_blank">achieved sub-40nm resolution on live HeLa cells</a>.</p>
<p>That said, it's not something we could do in a living, breathing human, and would require tissue biopsies at the very least, which is a bit excessive for a herpes diagnosis.</p></div>		</li>
