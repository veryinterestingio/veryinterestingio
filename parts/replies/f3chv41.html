<p>To be specific, it matches what it *should* be, so that it can properly hydrate the cells that need it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be even more specific: by being at the concentration cells ought to be at, saline will provide a water source for dehydrated cells, while absorbing water from over-hydrated cells, since water flows from more-hydrated solutions into less-hydrated solutions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is the process by which the water would cross the cell membrane, yes. The direction of osmosis is determined by the difference in solute concentration inside and outside the cell.</p>
<p>Edit: clarity, original read &quot;by the solute concentration&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, 0.9% is isotonic. Something different would be higher or lower in salinity and therefore be hypo- or hyper- tonic, leading to the side effects listed above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this, isotonic means having equal osmotic pressures. </p>
<p>0.9% NS - Normal Saline, or NaCl, or table salt in water at 0.9% (weight/volume) - is isotonic - roughly, and enough for most purpose.</p>
<p>There are a few other salts/ions/things in blood, interstitial, and relevant bodily fluids that change this by a little, and there are some other solutions (in both the &quot;answer to a problem&quot; and the &quot;solutes in fluid&quot; sense) that address this, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringer%27s_solution" target="_blank">Ringers Lactate</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes we want a hypertonic fluid/solution. A hypertonic nasal spray would dry out the nasal passageways - which would be helpful if they were &quot;wet&quot; - a.k.a. edematous, which happens with allergies (allergic rhinitis). </p>
<p>Wet here means the tissue (your nose) has excess fluid (roughly &quot;too much water&quot;), and extra salt (hypertonic solution) helps to draw out the extra fluid.</p>
