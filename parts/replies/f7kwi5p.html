			<div class="markdown"><p>This still confuses me reading around about it. I thought the whole big thing was that antimatter reacts violently to matter, cancelling both out. One of the comments above even says that if there was areas of antimatter and matter clashing together in the void then they'd be millions of times more explosive than supernovae, so how is it that bananas aren't just turning into flashbangs every 75 minutes? How is it that we just don't notice this phenomenon <em>at all</em>?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The right application of magnetic and electric fields can and has held antimatter. Berkeley used some weird eight-pole magnet to do it in 2010. I think the problem is there is no such thing as a true vacuum, so inevitably your stored antimatter hits a stray air particle or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We know that each star has to be fully one or the other because when matter and anti-matter come into contact they annihilate. We are pretty sure that we can’t see any anti-matter stars because of two things: stars eject a lot of particles into interstellar space (sole winds) and we would see the areas where the solar winds from a star and anti-star would collide and stars kick out a lot of what are called alpha particles and we haven’t seen any.</p></div>		</li>
