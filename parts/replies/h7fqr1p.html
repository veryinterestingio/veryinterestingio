<p>I should have gone to the doctor to get it removed, but my wife apparently popped it well enough the last time to where she got the sac. It never came back after that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds like a reoccurring cyst. A dermatologist will need to remove the sac to get rid of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That might be a sebaceous cyst. The smell is the sebum, and it's very distinctive. A dermatologist can express (squeeze) it or can remove the sac depending on how big it is. Go in when it's not inflamed at all to get it taken care of. When they are infected or inflamed you have to wait till they're better first, but that's when most people decide to get them done.</p></div>		</li>
