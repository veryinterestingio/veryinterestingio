			<div class="markdown"><p>We can put some numbers on just how spicy the collision caused by tidal drag would be. In a circular low earth orbit, the specific kinetic energy of the orbiter is between 10^7 and 10^8 J/kg. That's a decent approximation to the energy per kilogram of Titan that would be released as heat in the collision.</p>
<p>Titan has a mass of a little over 10^23 kg, so the total energy liberated by the collision is somewhere around 10^31 J. The mass of the crust, oceans, and atmosphere of earth (which is mostly just the crust) is somewhere around 10^22 kg. As the interaction between Titan and the Earth occurs through the crust/oceans/atmospheres of Earth/Titan, and we can assume to a decent approximation that energy is equally partitioned between them, the crust has to absorb something on the order of 10^8 J/kg, which is about a metric fuckton. If the interaction is really slow, then some of this heat could be partitioned in the mantle/core of the earth or transferred back to Titan, which would alleviate some of the problem, but that's a harder thing to calculate so I'm just not going to do that.</p>
<p>Rock has a heat capacity of like 2000 J/kg-K, so without any heat transfer, the surface of the earth would heat up to like 10^5 K. Not only would the oceans and atmosphere boil, the entire crust would be a hot ionized gas.</p>
<p>However, no heat transfer is unreasonable, particularly at those temperatures. Let's look at how long this interaction would have to take to keep the surface of the earth from getting molten. Rock melts at something like 1500K which is pretty close to the temperature of the mantle, so we can ignore heat flow into the earth in this case.</p>
<p>Earth currently radiates about 10^17 J/s into space by thermal radiation and has an effective blackbody temperature of ~280K. By the Stefan-Boltzmann relationship, radiated power scales as temperature to the 4th power, so if the earth's average temperature was raised to the melting point of rock, it'd radiate about 10^3 times more energy to space, or about 10^20 J/s. We have to get rid of 10^31 J, so in order to keep the surface of the earth solid, we'd need the interaction to occur over a time longer than ~10^11 seconds, or about 4,000 years. Any shorter than this and the whole surface melts. We are helped a bit by the fact that some energy would go towards heating up the much colder Titan and that unequal distribution of temperature across the surface would radiate disproportionately more energy thanks to the 4th power in the S-B relation, but I doubt that'd get us down to less than a thousand-year interaction to keep the surface from entirely melting. And of course this all assumes the atmosphere and oceans are like 1,200 C, so pack your shorts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The better question is, if Titan instantaneously teleported to the discussed location, how long do humans have to figure out a way off before its unlivable (or so bad that an exit strategy can't be reasonably executed). </p>
<p>Bonus question: Same as above, but there must be a minimum level of biodiversity left within those humans to successfully repopulate elsewhere for an indefinite period.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a tough question. I'm going to assume that we have earth as it is today and Titan just appears in orbit with its surface 900 km from ours all of a sudden.</p>
<p>I don't think we'd have long. Unless we had access to the magic that brought Titan to us in the first place, we'd be in a ton of trouble in a hurry.</p>
<p>The effect of the tides u/Hattix mentioned would be almost immediate. It'd take a while for them to settle into a regular pattern, though we'd almost instantly get tides and tidal waves on that order of size.</p>
<p>The instantaneous appearance of Titan would introduce some very high frequency components in the gravitational force at any given point, much like a hammer hitting a bell. This immediate effect would cause all sorts of earthquakes, violent storms, etc. which would be just the beginning of the geologic reworking of the earth's surface. Shock waves would propagate through the earth and back, likely causing immense tectonic damage both near the point closest to Titan when it appeared and on the opposing point, with several hours transit time for the seismic waves. If Titan appeared <em>instantly</em>, there would be Fourier components of the gravity at all frequencies, which means it would <em>literally</em> ring bells and excite rotations in gasses, etc. though these very high frequency components would be correspondingly small and unlike to produce effects we could measure or notice while we're trying to avoid the total destruction of the surface of the earth around us.</p>
<p>The massive tidal waves and immense land tides would follow, making it extremely difficult for us to manufacture space hardware for our escape. Just not dying in the day or two following the appearance of Titan would be an all-consuming job.</p>
<p>Next, there's the transfer of atmosphere from Titan to Earth. The atmosphere on Titan is cold, but as it flows through the Roche lobe to the Earth, it's going to be burning off that 10^8 J/kg as it comes to rest with our atmosphere (as well as another ~10^7 J/kg in potential energy as it falls from about the first Lagrange point of the new Earth-Titan system). While this process might be slow compared to the issue of the tides and the high-frequency Fourier components of the gravity due to the instant appearance of Titan, it does mean that we'd be transferring <em>a lot</em> of heat into our atmosphere in a hurry. Things might warm up slowly, but they wouldn't get any cooler for a long, long time. If the flow of gasses was fast enough, it'd also cause massive winds and shock waves as countless tons of gas smashed into our atmosphere at orbital speeds.</p>
<p>Titan's atmosphere has a higher average molecular mass than ours, so the scale height (the height at which the atmosphere's density decreases by a factor of e) would be <em>lower</em>, meaning the pressure would go up considerably as the atmosphere of Titan flowed to earth, which would be accompanied by additional heating due to compression.</p>
<p>Basically, as far as I can tell we'd be superfucked. I can't imagine a scenario where we'd survive long enough to build any sort of escape hardware. Perhaps people at a high elevation near the poles (assuming Titan appears in an orbit near the ecliptic) would be on stable enough ground to not die pretty much immediately, but it's hard to imagine they'd be able to build complex hardware there while the rest of the crust is getting pulled apart like some kind of tasty bread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If Titan suddenly appeared in orbit, would we be able to feel its additional gravity?</p>
<p>Edit: Titan's mass is 0.0225% that of Earth, so that'd be about an extra 15 grams weight to a 70kg person, not very noticeable. And that's assuming Titans mass is directly added to earths and increases its gravity proportionately, which doesn't account for an orbiting Titan. I don't think the added gravity in this sense would be a major concern.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What would happen if Earth's surface was spinning as fast as Titan was orbiting it? Would the Earth be able to retain an atmosphere then? Would the tidal effects still drag Titan closer? Would there even be tidal effects, or would the Earth just kinda be a permanently elongated a little?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From a pure orbital dynamics point of view, this is a stable arrangement.</p>
<p>Earth spins every two hours, Titan orbits every two hours. We're nicely tidally locked.</p>
<p>Step back up a little. Earth spins every two hours. Call it ten times faster than current, so an observer on the equator would be doing 10,000 mph.</p>
<p>Everything below 30 degrees latitude is under water. Everything. The Arctic is a dry wasteland. Spinning so fast, centripetal forces act on the oceans, forcing them to the equator. You'll notice something else too: Your weight at the equator is only one tenth of what it is at the poles. The centripetal force acts on you too, dramatically reducing your weight, and the weight of anything near the equator. Indeed, if we spin the equator at 17,000 mph, we cancel out gravity completely! The oceans would rain upwards into the sky. I don't recommend you try that at home.</p>
<p>This reduced gravity causes a thick mist around the equator and enormous, if slightly slow, amounts of rainfall. Mid-latitudes don't escape either. Tropical storms will spin faster and have more energy. &quot;Hypercanes&quot;, hurricanes able to span an area the size of North America, become a possibility. They'd be able to deliver ten to fifty feet of rain per day. This is not recommended.</p>
<p>On a positive note, you'd be able to fly at the equator just by flapping wings attached to your arms. This would be useful to dodge the 1,500 metre high waves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This actually sounds like the basis of a really cool science fiction world.  And the stretched out atmosphere ought to mean they can be slightly farther apart (slightly reducing all the effects) and maintain atmospheric contact, no?  </p>
<p>Colonists arriving on this world would call it Whirlpool or something, I think.  You would just need a reason they're willing to fight through the weather.  Or natives could exist, but would be REALLY interesting.</p></div>		</li>
