			<div class="markdown"><p>Why we make the difference between field particle shaped and wave shaped? Even if it's concentrated in a small region, it's fundamentally the same thing but at differents amplitudes. Why ????????</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A particle is a limit case and never actually point-sized. The same goes for the other limit case: a wave never actually expands to infinity (which it would have to so it has a unique wavelength).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK , so where is the limit between particle and waves and why do we make the distinctio?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nonsense.  Particles, like Quarks and electrons absolutely do have a size in QFT.  They are points.  They do not have an absolute position.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This should be the top answer, IMO.  My answer to OPs question would have been that they are both waves and particles so far as experiments are concerned. Modeling electrons (and other particles) as <em>fields</em> neatly unifies these paradoxical observations of particle-wave duality, and is further validated through accurate experimental predictions.</p></div>		</li>
