			<div class="markdown"><p>This here is the right answer.</p>
<p>All the &quot;elasticity&quot; &quot;distorting bones&quot; etc are misleading. The cycling of muscle fibres is what causes fatigue in this situation, as well as things like static holds in exercise.</p>
<p>Demonstration: hold arm out in front of you. No great force is applied but fatigue quickly sets in. Continue to hold arm out and observe spasming as muscle failure sets in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems like the most complete answer here, however I'm curious what your thoughts are when we consider the stress transferred from muscle to tendon on into bone. As I understand, the bones also respond to such stresses in a dynamic fashion. I've read that many believe that this is how bones remodel. Would sustained isometric exercises such as the one proposed here be described differently if we took the response of the deeper connective tissue into account?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely sure I'm clear on what you're asking, but if you're talking about the flexing of bones and stretching of tendons, both of those are potential places that your muscles could be doing &quot;work&quot; (obviously, much more so in the latter).  The thing is that the amount of energy stored building up tension is tiny compared to the energy expended by your muscles turning on and off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This.</p>
<p>An analogy would be if you had a hydraulic cylinder that had a small tube that fed back into the reservoir. Whenever you pressurized it you’d have a constant flow of “waste” that the pump had to keep cycling through to maintain the force applied to the cylinder.</p></div>		</li>
