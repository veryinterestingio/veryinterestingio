			<div class="markdown"><p>This is partially incorrect regarding ablations. As a patient who gets ablations 1-2 times a year, they are outpatient. I go back to work immediately afterwards. Doesn’t require sedation or anything, just local anesthetic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had them both, with and without sedation, in multiple locations. I didn't think it was good awful without (honestly, the pressure on the specific area that was inflamed felt kind of good) but I wasn't ready for the fentanyl. Everything was hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing, like some sort of idiot. But it made that juice box afterwards the best juice box of my life. </p>
<p>The headache after though....wow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not entirely accurate. Radiofrequency nerve ablations are frequently done in an outpatient setting (at least in the US). They aren’t considered surgery and can be done with specialized needles. They are very safe to do with proper training.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also most insurance considered nerve ablation as investigational and therefore not covered, so most patients can't afford it as treatment</p></div>		</li>
