			<div class="markdown"><p>I always think of the diesel issue as a balance between fuel efficiency, low exhaust, parts wear/tear, &amp; power output. You can tweak the car towards one of these but you will loose in the other categories. </p>
<p>The Kyoto treaty made countries concerned about air pollution, so Europe started producing a lot of diesel cars (Russia just happened to have a lot of diesel refineries). But the Kyoto treaty didn't say anything about NOx. So when the USA changed the rules about NOx, VW had to scramble to come up with a fix. They tried to license tech from Mercedes/Daimler but they couldn't get the deal done. They could have made the engine less fuel efficient or have less horse power, but the consumer wasn't going to like that either. My big question, which I have not scene answered yet is this: VW programed the engine to pass emissions tests, what was the difference in horse power, fuel efficiency, and engine wear and tear when you ran it in the mode? Did they cheat for 2 mpg or 20 mpg? Did they loose 5 hp or 75 hp?</p>
<p>VW just released a new Diesel engine in Europe. They've licensed the AdBlue tech and have installed twin dosing at two different stages in the exhaust line to reduce the NOx.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Diesel is gaining steam in the American light truck and SUV markets. We’re seeing 1/2 ton trucks get 30 mpg on the highway from all domestic manufacturers. The emissions systems do harm the potential mpg and reliability though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm.  The new LM2 i6 3.0L duramax engines coupled with the new 10 speed transmission are nothing short of amazing.  I have the 2020 GMC version it's so wonderful on long hauls, can easily get 500+ miles without trying.  The amount of torque is pretty impressive too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In America, diesel is the more expensive fuel, isn't it? In Norway, gasoline has always been about 25% more expensive, so everyone drives a diesel or EV.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How are they doing in towing capacity and torque compared to the 3/4 ton and up Diesel engines or 1/2 to gas engines? I’d expect somewhere in the middle but haven’t yet looked myself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Somewhere in the middle for the most part. Tow ratings of around 10-12k lbs. the main benefit is being able to tow and get good mileage, main drawbacks are initial cost and issues with the emissions systems that companies are trying to iron out.</p></div>		</li>
