			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily correct. </p>
<p>There isnâ€™t necessarily an entire inflammatory pathway that must run from A to Z and we just change timing.</p>
<p>Edit: disagree with me if you like, this is reality.</p>
<p>The cascade is fuelled by signalling, reducing the rate of signalling decreases the magnitude of response which decreases the effects of the cascade. If signalling slows to a certain point the signals may not connect sufficiently enough to continue and will shut down the pathway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about chronic inflammation? Like tendonitis that flairs up after exercising but isn't a true injury per se?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that swelling is to increase blood flow. This brings white blood cells and nutrients to the area. Adding ice and constricting the blood vessels is going to hinder the immune response and limit nutrients. I can't see that speeding healing. All the advice I was given for my injury was to encourage blood flow to the area.</p></div>		</li>
