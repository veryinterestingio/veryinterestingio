			<div class="markdown"><p>A slight vaginal odor is natural and healthy, as it is with just about every other part of the body that is not constantly exposed to air. However, “odor” does not equate with “bad.” A vagina and vulva should NOT smell foul (like something rotting) or fishy. That indicates an overgrowth of harmful bacteria that can cause irritation, itching, pain, and inflammation.</p>
<p>Side note: I once heard in microbiology about a woman who made yogurt cultured from the bacteria in her vagina. Lactobacillus is a common vaginal bacteria and it’s also in yogurt!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Overgrowth of naturally occurring bacteria, so harmless in normal amounts but can be harmful when their numbers grow. Overgrowth then converts TMAO to TMA, which produces the fishy smell (which shouldn’t be present in healthy vaginal flora).</p></div>		</li>
