If sunburn is anything like any other kind of burn too great a difference in temperature can also make things worse.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It isn't. Sunburn is a <em>radiation</em> burn, not a thermal burn. There's no heat to trap or temperature difference to do more damage or whatever. The damage stops as soon as you are no longer exposed to the radiation source, the 'burn' after the fact is the result of your damaged cells self-destructing en masse. There's nothing you can do to affect that, and you wouldn't want to if there was - the self-destruct is a critical line of defense against cancer. Most you can do is reduce the secondary inflammation a bit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It will not prevent damaged layers of skin from sloughing off.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and placing it on a severe burn in too great of a quantity can trap heat and cause more damage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not possible. Aloe vera is basically water and has an incredible thermal capacity and rapidly cools the site it is applied to and continues to provide cooling as it evaporates with the added benefit of being a gel which evaporates more slowly, stays in plays and leaves a marginally protective film layer once it is completely dried. (which is incidentally why it temporarily relieves symptoms caused by sun burns).</p>
<p>Let alone the fact that sun burns are not caused from heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's not a thermal effect. Sunburns are radiation burns from ionising radiation (mostly UV-B) from the Sun. This radiation mutates DNA which causes apoptosis in the affected cells. The resulting inflammation is what is perceptible as sunburn.</p></div>		</li>
