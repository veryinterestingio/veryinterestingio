			<div class="markdown"><p>This could (theoretically) become an issue. It <em>is</em> possible to select microorganisms for alcohol-resistance. Some strains of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae" target="_blank">brewers' yeast,</a> for example, can be very alcohol tolerant.</p>
<p>Alcohol based sanitizer certainly has advantages--it's cheap, non-staining, fast-drying, and leaves no residue. However, there's a practically unlimited variety of alternative topical disinfectants. If ethyl alcohol stops working, we can switch to isopropyl. Or hydrogen peroxide. Or chlorine bleach. &amp;c, &amp;c, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Antibiotic resistance is a big deal because there are only a couple dozen antimicrobial agents that are safe to ingest. But for disinfecting the skin, there's no shortage of fallback plans.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And my understanding is that because ethanol denatures proteins, there really isn't a way to become resistant to it other than coming up with ways of not being exposed to it, but doing so may limit cell respiration. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I think I remember this being an issue with people who use hand sanitizer constantly. Or maybe it was that it kills competing bacteria allowing other more dangerous bacteria to flourish. Also people being raised in that sort of household have sub-par immune systems to begin with due to lack of exposure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You, like most people, are confusing antibiotics and antibacterial. Stuff like hand sanitizer just outright kills everything it touches, some bacteria can hide in cracks but it doesn't really work the same way. The source posted is a BS pop Sci article that has a whole 2 data points. One test in one hospital in 2004 then again in 2009. It's a science fair level experiment. Do 1,000-2000 samples and you have real information. Doing 2 samples makes me think they know it's BS and they just need any positive result to publish. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol based rinses will kill a lot of bacteria that you don't want to kill though, and dry out your mouth a bit.  I'm not sure about its proven efficacy but there is probiotic chewing gum that you can get to replenish some stuff after you brush/rinse.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In any alcohol based cleaner (mouthwash or hand sanitizer), the typical process is that alcohol destroys the cell membrane, which causes the cell contents to leak out and thus destroys the cell. Non-alcoholic mouthwashes do this with a different ingredient than isn't alcohol based or as drying. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The concentration of alcohol in mouthwash and hand sanitizers are very different though. Alcohol based hand sanitizers usually have ethanol concentration at ~60â€“70%. Ethanol in mouthwash is much lower in concentration, and serves to dissolve the active ingredients.</p></div>		</li>
