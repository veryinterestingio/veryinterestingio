			<div class="markdown"><p>I know you know this, but for those that don't: Natural frequency is the frequency an object will move/vibrate when you add energy to it (eg hit it). When you flick a ruler the frequency it vibrates is it's natural frequency. For a free swinging pendulum it depends entirely on the length of the arm, which is why they were traditionally used for timekeeping. Nodes are points of no movement along the wave, like the handles of a jump rope when you are swinging it. The rest of the rope moves, but those move very little. Say the natural frequency of the piece of paper is 30hz (30 hits a second), that means if you apply that frequency the paper will move a lot, this is called resonance.</p>
<p>Now there's also something called harmonics, which are just a multiple of that 30hz (60hz, 120hz, etc.) You will still see a lot of movement at the harmonics, but it will be higher frequency, and lower amplitude.</p>
<p>So in the paper example the natural frequency is likely pretty low (eg 30hz), and the paper will move (or get &quot;blown&quot;) much more at this frequency. The higher frequency will still have a  effect (particularly at the harmonics) but since the amplitude is so small it'll look like the paper is just vibrating really quickly, while remaining stuck (it &quot;sucked&quot;) into place.</p>
<p>The main factor though with a subwoofer and piece of paper though will just be the volume of air being moved (lower frequency usually has a longer &quot;stroke&quot; and pushes more air per stroke.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't have to be a single sine wave. All sounds are a combination of sine waves with different frequencies and amplitudes. They add and subtract from each other to create the sound you hear. The fundamental frequency is what matters because it's the loudest sine wave. If a cello is played at the same note as a drum's fundamental frequency, the drum will vibrate despite having completely different harmonics.</p></div>		</li>
