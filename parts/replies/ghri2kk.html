			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but it's a different mechanism than OP is talking about.</p>
<p>The AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID vaccine is a modified chimpanzee virus that infects human cells and instructs them to produce a protein for the COVID virus (Spike Protein).</p>
<p>This triggers a full immune response to this protein so when the COVID virus shows up, an army of immune cells and antibodies are waiting for it and will destroy it utterly.</p>
<p>This vaccine was just approved in the UK and India.</p>
<p>We live in a very exciting time for science!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not how you were imagining it when you posted but they used to use malaria to kill syphilis </p>
<p>The way it worked was a really high fever would kill the syphilis. So they would purposefully infect you with malaria which have you a really high fever.</p>
<p>Now malaria could kill you granted but they knew how to treat malaria. But they didnâ€™t know how to treat neurosyphilis and that was as good as a death sentence. So they figured it was worth the risk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically yes, assuming the &quot;target&quot; virus exposes very specific proteins on the surface of the cell that allows the &quot;hitman&quot; virus to specifically target infected cells.</p></div>		</li>
