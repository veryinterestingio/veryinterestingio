			<div class="markdown"><p>If I had to guess, not noticeable by breathing. Outdoors, CO2 is between 300-500 ppm, and indoors it can be between 1000-1200 ppm. And if that difference in air quality is only noticable to me if I really stop to think about it, then 5 ppm isn't going to ping at all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You have more change in O²/CO² when air temperature change by 5°C. Or when it's rainy, compared to sunny.</p></div>		</li>
