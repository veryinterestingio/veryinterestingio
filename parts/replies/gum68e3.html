			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, I remember the feeling in my shins. I was more like 6-7 at the time, but I was on the couch just lying in my pain crying to mom asking her to make it stop. </p>
<p>Such a weird memory I forgot about until now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually could barely walk at one point in middle school, I was growing so fast my tendons were pulling chips of bone away, and the causing calcium to build up at those sites. I still have lumps of bone where my knees and ankles connect. I grew like 6 inches in 6th grade. It was miserable, incredible painful and I still have lingering issues from it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For my daughter it was her knees. It's such a distinct pattern, it's easy to follow once you know the signs.</p>
<p>She'll start eating a ton of food and always be hungry for a week or two, then she'll start complaining about needing to stretch her knees and they won't stretch. Once I see two or 3 days in a row where she's just ravenous, I know the knee complaints are coming lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I cried all the time back when I was a kid just from my leg and foot pain alone, let alone the other traumatic stuff I was experiencing. Buying pants was a waste of money because I'd outgrow them within months, so they'd buy me extra long pants and just roll them up to my ankles.</p>
<p>Thinking about it makes me kind of ill. It was a pain that couldn't stop, and my parents weren't exactly comforting about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They touch on this in a documentary series on Netflix called ‚ÄúBabies‚Äù. It‚Äôs in the first episode. They had a sample of infants and had the parents measure and weigh them daily and journal their behaviors and moods. IIRC, the data showed that babies may grow a little bit within short periods of time (days, weeks), but also experienced bursts of growth in which they were irritable, fussy, etc. It was really eye-opening to me, as someone who works with children. Between growth bursts and teething? It‚Äôs rough out here for a baby.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding on to teething and growth spurts... Mental &quot;leaps.&quot; There are half a dozen reason why a baby is fussy and since they can't communicate, it's just a guessing game every time. Hungry? Look for hunger cues. Sleepy? Look for sleepy cues. Dirty diaper? Smell or squeeze for clues. Over-stimulated? They're just mad. Over-tired? Also just mad. Sometimes with hysterics. Mental/developmental leap? Really can't tell. Not feeling well? Also can't tell. Teething? Sometimes teething cues, but they're always teething/drooling at a certain age. Growing pains? Can't really tell. </p>
<p>The easy route is to just assume something is wrong because they're never truly fussy for no reason.</p>
<p>I learned the hard way that my son, who ALWAYS got fussy in the carseat after about 15 minutes, also gets carsick.</p>
<p>Parenting is also learning. Lots of learning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm on kid number three right now and he's about 17 months. Just huge, seemingly random meltdowns throughout the day. Changing the nap schedule helped somewhat, but only somewhat. Not familiar stuff, no new teeth, doesn't seem to have any bowel issues. Little guy goes from cute as a button to banshee in a split second, and the only way to deal is either bribery, distraction, or sheer patience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fairness, if we, as adults, didn‚Äôt have the ability to even generally vocalize our frustrations or other negative emotions (and social norms), we‚Äôd probably all be crying and yelling all the time too üòÇ
I‚Äôm sorry you have a fussy little dude. Just know that if all of his basic needs are met (fed, dry diaper, comfortable environment, no sock strings pulling on a hangnail, etc), he‚Äôs just yelling to yell or get attention, and it is perfectly acceptable to let him cry in his crib for your sanity. Babies often feed off of our energy, too. So if you‚Äôre stressed and frustrated from him being fussy...they feel that. I‚Äôve seen a perfectly happy baby lose his shit because the parents were getting snippy and quietly passive aggressive with each other!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on age, could be some sort of allergy.  I have 3, have several friends with 3+.  I've seen kids that were irritated by the laundry detergent, fabric softener and even the mother's milk from breast feeding.  They had to get a special formula until the mom changed diet enough for the milk not to upset the baby.</p></div>		</li>
