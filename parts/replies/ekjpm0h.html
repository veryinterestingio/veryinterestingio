<p>there is already a very strong periodicity of 7-10 days</p>

<p>What's the source of this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called the synoptic cycle. It happens mainly because of how the continents are distributed. The atmosphere is composed of waves, and the period of some of those waves (called long waves because they are big) is 7-10 days. It's why you'll have a month where it rains every single weekend.  <a href="https://www.weather.gov/jetstream/longshort" target="_blank">Here's a jargony rundown</a> if you want more details.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Great! /s</p>
<p>Seems every April or May, my baseball games get rained out on Sundays for an entire month or so. It'll be decent weather during the week, but come Saturday afternoon or Saturday night...</p>
<p>Nice to know that it's relatively predictable, I guess. So I guess I can plan on possibly having the next few weekends with no games because it's supposed to rain this weekend (after raining last weekend, too).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess, although it isn't great, is probably lunar orbit. The moon's orbit is about 28 days, so a difference every 1/4 lunar orbit? I know tides happen when the moon is on the close side from the gravity and the opposite side from inertia, it would happen 4 times in a lunar cycle, so maybe something similar. I don't really know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>from a local perspective the moon passes daily above your head (because of the rotation of earth).</p>
<p>This is also why the gravitational tide is experiencrd daily (twice).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be difficult to do, since any unknown remainder is just an unknown cycle. It would not point to man made vs natural. But some point, the data correlation with some man-made factors may be strong enough to point to likely causation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically, something like an extra 3% chance of rain, or maybe partly cloudy instead of mostly sunny.</p></div>		</li>
