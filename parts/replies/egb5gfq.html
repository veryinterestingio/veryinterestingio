<p>Just taking the reported time from a single satellite (correcting only for leap seconds etc.) is good enough for subsecond accuracy, which is certainly good enough for a phone. If you can receive a satellite, it will probably be within ~0.2 lightseconds of you.</p>
<p>Some vendors just don't give a fuck and don't bother with the leap seconds, or will get it wrong - your clock will likely be off by 18 seconds (or 36 if they tried but made a sign error, or various variations because they use an older offset).</p></div>		</li>
