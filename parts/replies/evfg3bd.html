			<div class="markdown"><p>It is an Engineering thing. Planned Obsolescence is to design something with a specified expiry, whether time or number of uses. Then as an Engineer you design your product to meet those specific limits with the least cost(material, time, $$) and most efficiency. Consumer plastic water bottles are designed with only a single use in mind, so there is no guarantee that they will last more than one use, not saying that you cannot use it more than once, but that the company making them is absolved of all responsibility after the first use. The FDA(in the US, other countries have similar governing bodies) puts out guidelines on how you should or should not use a product, especially if there have been multiple cases they need to address.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen bottles with &quot;not refillable&quot; or similar on them.  This may refer to the US practise of having refillable soft-drinks in restaurants (which isn't common outside of the US/Canada), thus saying that the bottle is not refillable by the seller once drunk, but may be interpreted by some as 'do not refill the bottle'.</p>
<p>At a guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not about the practice of refillable soft drinks at restaurants, it's about an old practice of returning (originally, glass) bottles to the bottler for sanitizing and re-filling.</p>
<p>Plastic non-returnable bottles don't survive the cleaning and sanitizing process required for commercial re-filling, and so have to be marked as not refillable. It only seems weird <em>now</em> because this is by far the most common case.</p></div>		</li>
