			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ll add to this a recommendation to read Cadillac Desert. It is considered one of the most influential environmental issue texts of the 20th century. His thesis is that the West should never have been settled as widely and intensely as it was, and the history of its settlement is one of much darker truth than the myths that are generally taught and told. It’s quite a large book so I usually advise starting with the PBS documentary (which can be found on youtube) or trying the audiobook.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The book is written in a narrative style though.  It's fairly long,  but not overly dense</p></div>		</li>
