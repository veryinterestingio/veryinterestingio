			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like it would be sort of the opposite, like the brain is falling asleep but hasn't &quot;paralyzed&quot; the body yet ( so that your body isn't acting out your dreams). Add in a startle of some sort in your dream and your body reacts like it's real, and wakes you up.  What you describes something more like sleep paralysis, where the person is conscious, but cannot move their body (and can apparently be terrifying according to sufferers).</p></div>		</li>
