			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, I'm not familiar enough with long covid to say what's actually going on there. It could be a host of things and might be different in different people.  Some people might just have a post-viral syndrome where they have cleared the virus but their immune system is still mad about it. Other people might have a persistent infection. In that second case, inhibitors of viral replication might be able to get them over the hump (remdesivir, the regeneron or eli lilly antibody cocktails).</p></div>		</li>
