			<div class="markdown"><p>It's truly astonishing because I can't remember ever having actually listened in English class but I did read a lot and I watched A LOT of movies with subtitles so maybe that's how I picked it up. I think age plays a huge role too since I've watched a ton of Spanish shows and movies in the last few years but I still wouldn't be able to independently form a single sentence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It comes with use, and you use it all the time without thinking about it, especially if you read a lot. It doesn't hurt to learn the rules too, though, so that doesn't mean you shouldn't pay attention in grammar classes. A lot of times grammar class can give you the &quot;why&quot; behind something you picked up intuitively, and that can often help more than just acquiring it the &quot;right&quot; way. And (outside of grammar class, probably) don't be afraid to let this language intuition you've gathered help you do things that are &quot;incorrect&quot; to make cool new statements. Part of what makes language so wonderful is that there isn't one hard-and-fast &quot;right&quot; way to say anything; instead, we can create words and sentences nobody else has ever used before and have people understand what we mean by them.</p></div>		</li>

<ul>
<li>Grammar has no real &quot;why,&quot; but the formal grammatical rules can overlay a conscious structure on top of what you picked up intuitively, helping you aquire and remember more, after you've crossed a certain threshold of learned complexities.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A while ago I learned that the English language has a hierarchy of adjectives. Certain descriptions are 'more important' than others and come first in a sentance. Native speakers never really learn what the order is, but know it because doing it differently just 'sounds wrong'</p>
<p>Example: </p>
<p>Big green house. </p>
<p>Green big house.</p>
<p>One of those sounds weird.  </p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>here's a <a href="https://www.gingersoftware.com/content/grammar-rules/adjectives/order-of-adjectives/" target="_blank">link</a> with the specific order.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Finnish at least has but mainly in that if you say green first you stress the importance of the house being green so &quot;big house, the green one&quot; because English sometimes has a reverse order to Finnish.</p>
<p>In my native Finnish that would be &quot;se vihreä, iso talo&quot; but even then you most often will hear &quot;se iso, vihreä talo&quot; because iso has a strong vovel and the rest are consonants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add an example linguistics professor Noam Chomsky uses:
Take the sentence &quot;The man who is tall is happy.&quot; If you wanted to turn that statement into a question, how would you do it? It would be &quot;Is the man who is tall happy?&quot; So you'd have to move one of the 'is' to the front, but which is did you move, and why. The answer to which 'is' you need to move and why is fairly complex and most people who don't have a degree in a relevant subject can't explain why to you. But most children can at least guess correctly and almost any native speaker adult can turn the statement into a question. </p>
<p>By contrast, you're never going to intuitively stumble into the pythagorean theorem, you either know it because you learned it or you don't.  So there must be something unique about how we learn language.</p>
<p>I just thought that example was interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would the answer be the &quot;is&quot; connected to &quot;is happy&quot; because that's the only &quot;is&quot; that is being questioned? &quot;The man is tall&quot; seems like one static unit. Like: Is (the man who is tall) happy?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I call bullshit.</p>
<p>&quot;Who is tall&quot; is a relative clause while &quot;is happy&quot; is the actual predicate of the sentence.<br />
When transforming an indicative sentence to an interrogative one there's absolutely no reason to even touch the relative clause, of course you only deal with the predicate.</p>
