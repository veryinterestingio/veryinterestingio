			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans meat are actually the combination of two, which is why our muscle are more pinkish instead of pure white or red muscle.</p>
<p>And this made sense since humans do both types of activities a lot.</p>
<p>Unless you're a redditor.</p>
<p>Edit: Guys, you can stop saying that pig's muscle is similar to human's. There's already 10+ people who already mentioned that.</p></div>		</li>

But I don't disbelieve them. Why would we disbelieve them? It's only illegal in one state. but it has to be a consented-to activity.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Birds are built to be light and quick to move: hollow bones and small, compact, stream-lined bodies covered with lightweight feathers that reduce turbulence of air as it flows over their bodies during flight. Cattle are big, heavy, slow-moving grazers who need the capacity to move quickly when the need arises; if their muscle stores a lot of oxygen, then they can get up and hustle when they need to (like when a predator is after them).</p>
<p>Additionally, the respiration system for birds and mammals is <em>vastly</em> different: mammals have two lungs and a diaphragm for squeezing the lungs to draw air in and out; <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=avian+respiratory+system&amp;rlz=1C1GTPM_enUS849US849&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiZ5_Xr7tnpAhXWZc0KHQ8LA8QQ_AUoAXoECBEQAw&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=767#imgrc=O3n7OWbaKrqNIM" target="_blank">birds have sacs throughout their bodies that store air before delivering it to the lungs</a>. The capacity for keeping oxygen readily available where it's needed most (like the muscles, for example) is different for mammals and birds: mammals don't have these chambers for storing oxygen like birds do, so they need some other mechanism of reserving oxygen, hence the abundance of myoglobin in their muscles. Not all birds need this protein in their muscles because they get enough oxygen due to the design of their respiratory system. </p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.funtrivia.com/askft/Question71130.html" target="_blank">birds like duck and geese have dark breasts with more myoglobin in the muscle</a>; I believe this is to aid in prolonged, sustained flight. Chickens and turkeys don't do a whole lot of flying (or beating their wings for long periods of time), so there's less need for their breast muscles to have a lot of myoglobin for reserving oxygen.</p></div>		</li>
