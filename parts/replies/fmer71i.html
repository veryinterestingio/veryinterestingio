			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, eating disorders as far as i understand are defined by the behaviors associated with eating, not the resulting weight of the patient. A couple decades ago it was a topic of discussion because people were being denied treatment until their weight was outside of normal range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s also possible to have an non-specified eating disorder that involves traits from multiple classes of eating disorders. There also disordered eating.</p>
<p>Weight is also not an indication of what eating disorder someone has.  You can be 300lbs and have anorexia, or you could be 99lbs and have binge eating disorder. Usually if someone has one eating disorder, they may have symptoms of a secondary one. </p>
<p>Most doctors will not treat an eating disorder that revolves around fasting, denying, or purging in overweight patients. They can even be congratulated on it, and encouraged to continue with their dangerous habits. </p>
<p>Case in point: I have ED: non-specific. I am fat. At my worst, I would only eat one low fat yogurt and one boiled egg a day. I was berated at a doctors appointment about how I was eating too much and needed to limit my calories. I was even given pro-Ana tips on how to cut back on food. By a medical doctor.
I also suffer from Hoshimoto’s Thyroiditis (hypothyroidism), so even during phases of starving myself, I didn’t loose weight. All it did was throw my levels out of whack, and make me sicker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are at least a few medical conditions that actually cause overeating but with entirely different underlying physiological reasons like <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prader%E2%80%93Willi_syndrome" target="_blank">Prader-Willi syndrome </a> where they are incapable of ever feeling sated by food and essentially always feel like they’re starving to death. They typically have mental deficits that make it very hard for them to understand this behavior.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also hypothyroidism.</p>
<p>And while people with Pica normally eat things that have little or no nutritional value I watched a show a while back about a kid who's parents couldn't figure out how he was getting fat. They had normal portions during home meals and as far as they could tell normal school lunch. When he continued to gain weight they started really watching his portions and checking with the school to find out if he was somehow getting a lot of extra food there.</p>
<p>Turned out he had pica and was eating food out of dumpsters on his way to/at/from school and neighborhood/home trash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hypothyroidism ultimately accounts for not that much weight gain. My thyroid considers itself a non-essential worker, and hasn't done anything useful for at least the last 5 years. I still lost 70lb before I went to a doctor, and that wasn't even because of anything weight related but more that I was so tired I was struggling to function, and my hair was falling out, I was always ghostly pale, my nails started peeling and chipping, and I started fainting when I stood up. </p>
<p>Those symptoms definitely didn't aid weightloss. But they didn't cause weight gain, just an added difficulty. It's also so easy to treat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely this. No matter what their condition is, CICO is really the only thing that actually matters in weight loss. Hyper/hypothyroidism MAY play a role in the effectiveness of said weight loss, but by a maximum of 10 to 15% of weight gained/lost.</p></div>		</li>
