			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a surprisingly complicated question to answer.</p>
<p>One part is that it never goes away, it's always circulating at low levels and just flares up in flu season. (Someone elsewhere in the thread mentioned the fact that most flu is not in humans, which is true - by numbers it's mostly an avian disease. However there are a number of strains which are mostly human specific and circulate within us - occasionally these just get topped up with fresh genetic material from another species.)</p>
<p>Partly the seasonality is due to the weather. In certain circumstances colder, drier weather can aid transmission, due to things like characteristics of droplets in the air and on surfaces. This might synergise with behaviour changes at the same time (like spending more time indoors near to other people) and other physical properties (like less UV degradation due to less sunlight). </p>
<p>However that doesn't explain flu transmission everywhere. For example some places in the tropics have year round transmissions, while others have one, two, or even more sporadic spikes. Sometimes this may follow rainy seasons (counterintuitivey given the temperate zone humidity observations) but this might be due to affecting a balance between droplet travel distance versus environmental persistence.</p>
<p>We still don't have a perfect answer, but that's a quick summary of some of the things we do know.</p>
