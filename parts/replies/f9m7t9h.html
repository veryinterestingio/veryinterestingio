			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a plain, flat color does not have those properties. That's why there is no &quot;silver&quot; on a computer screen. It's just a shade of grey. You can have a shade of yellow that we might identify as gold, but it won't have the shiny property that we associate with gold-colored materials. Your computer screen will never turn into a mirror.</p>
<p>However, if we're talking about 3D rendering, or even 2D drawings with texture, then indeed those properties come into play. Specular and diffuse colors are two fundamental material properties in 3D modeling! They determine how the surfaces interact with the <em>environment</em>. You can't make your monitor interact with the environment outside of it, but virtual objects in 3D space can interact with their virtual environment like real materials with those properties would.</p>
<p>In the end, your eye only sees simple colors. Matte/shiny isn't a property of light, it's a property of how materials interact with light. Your eyes just see the final result, but your brain interprets it to infer what kind of material you're looking at. Things like how the reflection changes as you move, or whether there are clearly shiny reflections of light sources around the object, contribute to how the brain understands the surface properties. And this works even if it's a photo or 3D render on a computer screen, though obviously not as realistically as, well, real life (e.g. an image on a screen does not react to the <em>viewer</em> moving).</p></div>		</li>

<p>That would be kind of fun though. Put a few cameras around the monitor, facing the user, and use software to create subtle reflections on the things that are displayed on screen.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can't make something look like (reflective) metal with a single color. Making those rings any solid color wouldn't give them a convincing &quot;gold&quot; look.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. That's why in cgi you use environmental mapping, which is using a picture (usually the sky)  to simulate reflection.</p>
<p>It works for metals but also works for water. If you want that Carribbean green, you are going to use something whit lots of vegetation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've asked this same question on here before, I've tried to research it off Reddit, and never gotten any really satisfying answer, but <em>this</em> finally helps me understand, differentiating diffuse and specular colors!</p>
<p>Technically I had been asking about mirrors, why they can look silver when they can also accurately reflect the colors of objects around them, but if I understand correctly, the same concept applies?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, mirrors are just all specular reflection, essentially. It is precisely the ability to reflect their environment accurately that we call &quot;silver&quot; (perhaps with a little bit of loss / a slightly darker reflection compared to the incoming light).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oxidation tends to create a &quot;haze&quot; of diffuse reflection, which might contribute to this effect. Silver oxidizes quite readily. It could also be a difference in just how polished the surfaces are. And yes, the actual materials reflect light differently too, though a quick Google search there suggests silver is actually more reflective than chrome.</p></div>		</li>
