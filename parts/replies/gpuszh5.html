			<div class="markdown"><p>Would like to add that there are actually different vaccines targeting the virus in different ways, each with their own &quot;shelf life&quot;. For example, we may have 1 vaccine right now that has 1 particular kind of antibody, but if that virus mutates*  that antibody may no longer stop that particular virus, because your body recognizes it now as a different invader(if the virus's antigenic determinants have changed). </p>
<p>Another way a vaccine <em>can</em> work, is like how the tetanus vaccine works. The reason you need a booster every few years for tetanus is because the vaccine does not immunize against the actual bacterium* but instead against the products that bacteria makes, which are toxic to us.</p>
<p>I hope this was additive in some way, not more confusing.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a quick note: the reason the tetanus booster is every 10 years is because that's only as long as the vaccine efficiency was tested for. It's quite possible that it lasts much longer and I've heard some suggest it could actually last up to 30 years before needing a booster (that's not to say you shouldn't get it every 10 years, better safe than sorry, just saying that the timeframe isn't related to how long it lasts).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We always like to talk about how long an immunity lasts and for the purposes of conversation it's a useful way to describe things but it's important to remember that this isn't actually how it works. </p>
<p>Immunology crash course:</p>
<p>When you are developing, your immune cells undergo a shit ton of random genetic rearrangement of the genes that code for antibodies. They just mix and match and blend all of those genes to try to come up with every conceivable combination of antibody to handle ebery conceivable antigen (particles from whatever is trying to infect you) you might encounter. This is in part why the clinical course of people exposed to a new illness like COVID-19 can be so variable (some people have randomly generated antibodies -specifically IgM- that work better than others). </p>
<p>Now, after you're born you get exposed to antigens. The mechanism here is that antigen presenting cells (APCs) take antigens and deliver them to B cells that are waiting to be activated. When exposed to something new the APCs have to find a B cell that is a match to their antigen. This can be a good match or a poor match.  Either way that B cell undergoes another round of genetic rearrangement. It doesn't only make the one antibody that matches the antigen it received, but it generates multiple cells and introduces a &quot;fudge factor&quot; via genetic rearrangement to ultimately make many different antibodies with the goal of getting some that work even better than the one originally activated. </p>
<p>Then the antibodies fight the virus via multiple mechanisms from direct inactivation to programmed cell death. After the virus is gone many/most of these activated B cells start to either die off or they go senescent (hibernate) and await reactivation. </p>
<p>This is where the &quot;length of immunity&quot; issue comes up. From a certain perspective you can claim that you're almost never really immune or always immune and it's a matter of semantics. If you're re-exposed to the antigen you still need that APC to present the antigen before the whole process starts again. If you have lots of those B cells around this may happen quickly. If there aren't as many around it may take longer. But it's a numbers game based on probability, and it will eventually happen. Basically, you have to roll 6s and the question is: &quot;are your dice 6-sided, 12-sided, or 1,000,000 sided?&quot; The length of time this takes determines whether the illness can become clinically evident and actually cause symptoms vs the illness gets handled behind the scenes and nobody was the wiser. </p>
<p>In reality you probably never lose all of the B cells generated during the original illness and even if you did lose nearly all of them it's still technically possible for a quick reactivation with a little bit of luck. 6s can be rolled on the first time with 1M-sided dice, it just isn't very likely. So the most accurate way to describe it isn't to say &quot;are you still immune&quot; but &quot;are you immune enough?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In that case, it is related to how long it lasts, it's just that 10 years is the maximum <em>known/researched</em> effective time, with anything beyond that being <em>currently unknown</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a few european countries they don’t do tetanus booster at all. Those countries don’t have a higher tetanus prevalence than other industrialised countries. The WHO as of 2017 does not recommend tetanus booster for adults because it believes that succesful childhood vaccination protects for the rest of the life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a note, I believe SARS-CoV-2 is a somewhat slow mutating virus actually because it has proofreading activity in its replication machinery. For example I think influenza and HIV have much higher mutation rates since they don't have a proofreading exonuclease in their</p>
<p>Also, you're correct about the mechanisms of tetanus toxin immunization vs the covid-19 vaccines, but minor note is that it's a bacterium, not a virus, that produces the tetanus toxin</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is true. The main reason behind variants is mostly because the virus was left unchecked in various countries that went &quot;herd immunity&quot; at first: UK and Brazil, for example. There were enough people getting sick that it was almost guaranteed it'd mutate at sometime. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also, the UK variant can also be blamed on herd immunity for another reason: it didn't protect the immunocompromised. In not doing so, they fostered infections that lasted much longer.<a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/12/uk-variant-puts-spotlight-immunocompromised-patients-role-covid-19-pandemic" target="_blank">When they tried various partly unsuccessful treatments, it allowed for survival of the patient (temporarily), the virus and mutations happened.</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>That might be true for viruses <em>in general</em>, but AFAIK all the COVID-19  vaccines target the virus' outer shell, which is very highly conserved and doesn't mutate much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was refused the shingles vaccine, then got shingle in my 40's.  It was very much not fun.</p>
<p>It took a really long time to drill down and get the info, but here's their logic:  No one has tested what happens if you get the vaccine twice.  They technically can't give it to you a second time.  (I say don't ask, don't tell.)  They also don't know whether it provides immunity after twenty years, because that's as far as the study went.</p>
<p>Elderly people are far more likely to be disabled or killed by shingles.  Therefore, they recommend you have the vaccine in your 50's to protect you through the remaining life span.</p></div>		</li>
