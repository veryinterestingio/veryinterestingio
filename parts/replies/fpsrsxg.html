			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure! Two tornadoes are formed when the tube is tilted vertically. Think of pulling up a string at its centre, there are two vertical vortices. They spin in different directions. 90-95% of the time, the one spinning clockwise peters out fast.</p>
<p>Exactly why is complicated and I am not qualified to explain (my professor told me it was complicated and he didn't explain — I'd love to have an expert tell me more about it). However, I was taught that this has nothing to do with the coriolis effect. Eg If you run a tornadogenesis simulation on a computer but turn off The coriolis force, you'll find the same results.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I looked into my old textbook, I see why the right-moving tornado is favoured now. It's far beyond the scope of the question, but basically it has to do with the structure of the thunderstorms that generate tornadoes and where the downdraft is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This has helped clarify something about the vertical tilting that has always conceptually eluded me! It always felt weird that the rotating column just sorted of got lifted upright by buoyency. Pointing this out lets me visualize it in 3D much more clearly and makes far more physical sense.</p>
<p>Is there any sort of unique event when the column &quot;splits&quot; high up in the storm cell? Super curious about this whole process now. Weather drawings seem to gloss over a lot of subtle but very important details like this and it really hinders understanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, you get buoyancy with hot, moist air. Shear is harder to get and generally occurs most often in the midwest.</p>
<p>If you have buoyancy with no shear, you get baby, run of the mill thunderstorms that kinda kill themselves. Keep adding shear though and you'll get more and more intense and long-lived thunderstorms (&quot;organised convection&quot;, we call it) that can become organised or spawn tornadoes. Too much shear, though, you'll get the system too spread out to do much. This theory is called RKW theory (rotunno, klemp&amp; weisman, 1987).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question:</p>
<p>I have heard that tornados are a pretty rare phenomenon outside the US. Supposedly the Tornado Belt in the middle US is one of the few places where tornados happen with any regularity. Is there any truth to that?</p></div>		</li>
