			<div class="markdown"><p>I think they're analogous, if not identical - in information theory, the entropy of a random variable X is defined as H(X)= E(-log(p(X)) or equivalently -Sum(p(X=xi) log p(X=xi)). In fact, it seems that Shannon named it after Boltzmann's definition, so they are closely related indeed. </p>
<p>I haven't read it myself, but <a href="https://monoskop.org/images/b/be/Shannon_Claude_E_Weaver_Warren_The_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication_1963.pdf" target="_blank">Shannon &amp; Weaver's book</a> is often cited as being an approachable classic that held up extremely well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That does sound identical, but I want to see how the same patterns arise under a different system. Thanks for the recommendation! I actually just picked up a copy at a used bookstore last week!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You absolutely can't generate a true random number. Almost all (in the mathematical sense) numbers are normal noncomputable numbers, and we've never managed to identify or generate a single one of them. A process than randomly generated or selected numbers would almost always return one of these numbers.</p></div>		</li>
