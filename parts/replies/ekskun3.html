			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that's a slightly different question I think. A living animal's reflexive response to injury is a fairly universal evolutionary trait that includes insects, worms and even simpler single celled organisms. And most use the same basic neural machinery to sense and trigger a muscle response with the intent of stopping whatever is causing the damage. There's not much debate around this in the scientific community as far as I know.  Thurs very much applies to insects as well, with published open source instructions on how to insert electrodes into cockroaches or beetles and remote control them. See <a href="https://youtu.be/tgLjhT7S15U" target="_blank">robobeetle</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/KgZb4Aq0mo8" target="_blank">roborat</a> for examples of this.</p>
<p>What there is unresolved debate about is about which organisms feel <em>pain</em>.  Some biologists believe that while lower order animals do possess neurons and demonstrate reflexive responses, they don't feel or at least perceive pain in the same way as animals with far more complex and advanced nervous systems like humans do. This is often centered on sea creatures which are generally harvested and processed without any concern for the pain or cruelty involved - including in the preparation of Hakodate that I linked above <a href="https://youtu.be/K1cff6HYMHE" target="_blank">which is pretty rough to say the least - NSFW</a></p>
<p>One often debated example is the boiling of lobsters alive. They often thrash about and even produce a squealing sound in the process which many believe is evidence that they feel pain and that this is a cruel and inhumane way to dispatch and prepare them for consumption. However, the movement is still reflexive and the sound they make is actually due to steam escaping their carapace and not at all like a scream, which they lack the organs to do at all. But it's nearly impossible to know if this translates to pain in the way we perceive it. This is mostly an academic or philosophical debate though because it seems unlikely that they don't feel <em>something</em> which is very unpleasant. However it actually may be the most rapid and thus humane means if dispatching them and certainly one of the safest ways to cook them without risking dangerous bacterial infection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The human body keeps fluids at a steady .7% to .9%. The first cells originated in slightly saline water and the molecular processes adapted to that salinity. So cells today create that saline environment artificially to keep everything working. </p>
<p>3,5% salts in your blood would be off by a whole order of magnitude. Your cells would dessiccate and deflate osmotically like a grannie's tits. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And facepalm here! A pharmacist I worked for as a kid told me that &quot;normal saline&quot; solution was so called because it was the same concentration as blood, then added the bit about seawater equivalence. That was nearly 60 years ago, so thanks for putting me right before I cark it. And yes, I should have just googled it before posting.</p></div>		</li>
