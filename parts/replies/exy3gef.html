			<div class="markdown"><p>I might be wrong about this, but I don't think so because the moisture in the air is more conductive, and while lightning is caused by dragging things against each other (like static), I think the rain cloud is what usually holds onto the different charge, not the dry air. (like how you can drag wool socks on a carpet and the person with the socks can shock people, but the carpet can't.) Hopefully that makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also warm moist air tends to create a convection between the ground and clouds, which increases the atmospheric scrubbing (for the lack of a better term), which generates the increased possibility of lightning.  Cold dry air tends to stay close to the ground, and without geothermal energy (since the ground will also be cold) the air can't circulate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact, at least in some theories, it's the water droplets in the air rubbing the air that generates the electric charge.  Fewer water droplets means not enough charge to create lighting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree.. Arizonan here. Humidity is often around 10% and we rarely have a rainstorm without thunder and lightening. When I lived in Seattle for a few years, it was surprising to see rain so often but rarely thunder or lightening.</p></div>		</li>
