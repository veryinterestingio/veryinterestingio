<p>The problem is that, unlike most other things that have a top speed, the SR-71 is not limited by its power, it's limited by its frailty.</p>
<p>SR-71s have exploded trying to avoid missiles. They tear themselves apart at high speed before they run out of engine.</p>
<p>So it's not a matter of &quot;Let's just try to go faster&quot;, it's a matter of &quot;Every bit of extra speed above X is increasingly likely to rip the ship apart&quot;.</p>
<p>Think of it like a car without sufficient downforce, still accelerating. It has enough power to go faster, but, it can't safely do it.</p>
<p>For example:
<a href="https://youtu.be/McJJeukIWSA?t=22" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/McJJeukIWSA?t=22</a></p>
<p>Only, the SR-71 is going 10x as fast. As soon as anything buckle or pulls or... anything, the air itself rips it apart in the blink of an eye.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DOD claims no SR-71 was shot down. You might be thinking of the U-2s getting shot down.</p>
<p>My understanding was over temping the airframe and inlets reduced the strength and thus the life. Fast enough might have the airframe fail but the big worry was keeping the airframe life as long as reasonably possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no evidence to indicate that there's a classified top speed. The SOPs limited the speed and that can <a href="https://www.sr-71.org/blackbird/manual/5/display.php?file=5-8.png" target="_blank">be found in the manual</a> but it's not a secret that the engines can go faster, however it would be unsafe and it could cause nasty things with the inlets, it could damage the engines or even the actual structural integrity of the airframe if you were to go much faster. Obviously no one was trying to destroy one on purpose. </p>
<p>The actually classified things are simply missing from the manual. There's no need to give you fake info if you can keep sensitive stuff to yourself. There's a very good reason why there's virtually zero information on the exact sensor capability, the ASARS or the EW suite.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That said, there's no need for US military to develop anything faster. Between satellites and stealth, the advantages of speed were not worth the cost and maintenance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The X-15 did go faster.  It holds the speed record for crewed powered aircraft.</p>
<p>SR-71 hit 3,529.6 km/h whereas the X-15 hit 7,274 km/h (both being airspeed).  So the X-15 is significantly faster, but it cannot maintain that speed the way the SR-71 can maintain it's speed.</p>
<p>Both are incredibly badass flight platforms that are so much fun to read about.</p>
<p>During the same era as the SR-71, in 1966, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_XB-70_Valkyrie" target="_blank">XB-70 Valkyrie</a> hit 3,250 km/h which is 92% of the speed of the SR-71 record.</p></div>		</li>
