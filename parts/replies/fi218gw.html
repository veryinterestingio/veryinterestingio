			<div class="markdown"><p>Getting carried into the house and then tucked in was THE best thing in the world. I used to fake still being asleep all the time. I love doing it for my kids now too. I don't even care if they're faking. I won't be able to pick them up forever and just want to cherish those moments when I can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might be that your mind decides when it should start remembering things once something changes and saves a bit before it just in case. You might be partially &quot;conscious&quot; but since nothing of note happened for most of it, your brain just didn't care to write it down. I have something similar where I always &quot;wake up&quot; about fifteen minutes before my alarm goes off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I frequently comment on this phenomenon over longer periods too.  Your brain will kind of half-assedly summarize your life if you do the same thing every day.  If every weekday is the same exact routine then on Saturday your week was &quot;Weekday * 5&quot; instead of &quot;Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday&quot; etc.  You can remember a little better what a generic day is like but you forget all the specific details because they're not important.</p>
<p>It's why time flies when you're stuck in a routine and the years go by and you hardly notice, but if you move to a new state or something then all of a sudden you're thrust into the thick of it for several months of finding your stride.  If you want to live longer in experiental terms, you've gotta change your life once in a while.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If your alarm goes off at the same time each day, that's probably your circadian rhythms at work as opposed to being partially conscious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have the opposite experience. Any new place I sleep, I sleep like a fucking dead man. Any new bed will instantly become the most comfortable bed I've ever been in. After a few days, it's back to sleeping like shit and being tired when I wake up, just like home.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: sorry, it's just anecdotal experience here. I'm ADD, and I noticed that I experienced the opposite in new surroundings as well: I sleep great the first night.</p>
<p>I haven't done any research on it, but I think that it would be something interesting to see if there's enough anecdotal experience suggests by someone doing as a research project</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's also my experience, but I'm not an insomniac. I'm good at sleeping, like, <em>really</em> good. </p>
<p>But the quality of the sleep is better the first night somewhere new...</p></div>		</li>
