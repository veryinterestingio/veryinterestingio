			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have access to the whole paper but according to the abstract, behavioral characteristics such as education, activity, and health eating were taken into consideration:</p>
<p>&quot;After additional adjustment for sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics, HRs were 1.00 (reference), 1.07 (1.02-1.12), 1.18 (1.06-1.31), 1.38 (1.11-1.70), and 2.03 (1.26-3.27; P = .004), respectively. Adjusted HRs were 1.30 (95% CI, 1.09-1.55) and 2.75 (1.40-5.42; P = .004), respectively, comparing participants who consumed 10.0% to 24.9% or 25.0% or more calories from added sugar with those who consumed less than 10.0% of calories from added sugar. These findings were largely consistent across age group, sex, race/ethnicity (except among non-Hispanic blacks), educational attainment, physical activity, health eating index, and body mass index. &quot;  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be interested in this as well. Is sugar the direct cause it is it environmental/psychological. </p>
<p>Are people that east refined sugar less likely to workout? Are they more likely to over indulge. Does sugar intake effect hormone production? Do the effects on this hormone production make a person more likely to display these characteristics?</p>
<p>I'm in the process of getting myself to a healthier life style and knowing things like this could be very helpful.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, sugar itself is not so much the problem, the gross overnutrition is. At baseline the sugars we consume are converted to glucose via various metbolic pathways and then they can be stored in the liver as glycogen or utilized by the cells. If the glycogen stores are full, then they get turned into fats, and that's where a lot of the bad rap of high sugar diets come from. It's all in the speed that they are absorbed and transformed that makes a carb &quot;empty&quot; versus &quot;complex&quot;</p>
<p>One other thing to add is that high glucose in the blood has direct effects on the arteries on top of the pro inflammatory state described above. This is diabetes in a nutshell, a vascular disease. The glucose actually is modified to be able to bind to the hemoglobin molecule, which then essentially clogs up the blood vessels leading to all sorts of complications, including heart disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add further context:
Sugar is converted to blood glucose a lot faster than other forms of energy such as complex carbohydrates. </p>
<p>The insulin profile of somebody who eats 500cal of coco pops vs 500cal of porridge looks very different, where sugars will cause larger ‘spikes’... This profile could be linked to insulin resistance. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The human body needs approximately 4g of carbs at any given time, which it can produce itself from fat. i.e., unlike the other two macros (fat and protein), which are dietary requirements, there's NO need to consume carbs.  Yet, we do anyway: often 60g in what's considered a healthy meal, and 120g or more in what's considered an acceptable, normal treat, like pizza.  In total, many people are eating 200 or even 300+ grams of carbs per day, when again the requirement is ZERO.</p>
<p>So yes, certainly overnutrition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>there's NO need to consume carbs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This strikes me as a somewhat bizarre thing to point out. The fact that you actually <em>need</em> a very small amount of the total calories you get to be fat and protein doesn't say anything bad about carbs, nor does it imply that eating a lot of carbs makes for overnutrition. </p>
<p>There's about 4 calories in a gram of carbohydrate. 4x120 = 480. If you're eating 3 meals a day and eating 120 grams of carbs in each meal, you've still got 640 left over in the recommended 2,000 calories for protein and fat, which is <em>plenty</em> to get the amount you need. </p>
<p>It is, in fact, entirely possible to eat 300 (or more!) grams of carbs a day, also get the small amount of fat and protein you actually need, and still be at a caloric deficit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any point in eating zero carbs though? </p>
<p>What is the stoichiometric amount of carbs to eat to avoid needing to convert protein to sugar?</p>
<p>What do you mean by 4g at any time, is that the amount in the blood?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely, we can use our other macros to generate all the carbs that we need, turning long chains into rings isn't that hard to do emzymatically. But since converting them to energy itself costs energy our bodies have rightfully developed a nice little reward system regarding the consumption of carbs versus other macros. </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>

<p>Extra calories contributes to weight gain. Processed foods (which typically have plenty of sugar, but also many other harmful ingredients) are the perfect package to induce overeating (and so cause weight gain) as well as inflammation but this doesn't incriminate &quot;sugar&quot; in and of itself (a definition of what is meant by sugar would help here).</p></div>		</li>
