<p>Also i would imagine that a 100 year old man(for example) wouldn't be able to achieve an erection, or would he?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see no reason why a 100 year old man with a clean, wide penile artery couldn't fill it with blood if his heart is not diseased.</p>
<p>If he has avoided artery narrowing and doesn't have any psychological sexual issues, why wouldn't he? What else is blocking the blood from getting to the penis?</p>
<p>About 15% of men suffer complete ED, but most will see a decline in the strength of their erections over time, even if it does not weaken to the point of being ineffective.</p>
<p>The UK are stockpiling Viagra in case if a no deal Brexit, so it is clearly a substantial problem.</p>
