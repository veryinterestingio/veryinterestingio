			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the atmosphere that protects us. The moon is too small and distant to be of any appreciable protection to us. In fact, because of its gravity, it's possible that some meteors that were not headed toward earth ended up being angled toward us. </p>
<p>Billions of years ago, the earth was covered with craters, but due to tectonic movements and erosion over the eons, most have been erased from earth's surface.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But this is also true for asteroids that <strong>would have hit but are diverted</strong> by the gravitational effects of the Moon.</p>
<p>Statistically those effects might cancel each other out- which leaves the physical object of the Moon still standing in the way of all celestial objects that would have hit the Earth from that direction.</p>
<p>All in all that means the Moon has a very very very slight asteroid-defense-function...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every rock that hits the moon is a rock in an earth-crossing orbit that has forever been taken out of circulation.  The moon has a cross section of about 7.5% that of the earth.  Back of the envelope, it protects us from about 7.5% of the rocks that otherwise would have eventually hit us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Combination of several factors.  </p>
<ul>
<li>The atmosphere eliminates small impacts and reduces the effect of medium impacts.</li>
<li>Large impacts do not happen very often.</li>
<li>Erosion by weather and plate tectonics keeps the number of total craters small (the lifetime of any individual crater is short on a geological timescale).  </li>
</ul>
<p>Contrast with the Moon, where:</p>
<ul>
<li>No atmosphere, every pebble hits the surface at whatever speed it is going.</li>
<li>Large impacts are still rare, but without weather and without vulcanism/plate tectonics they are essentially there forever and they can accumulate. You can find craters within craters within craters within craters pretty much everywhere on the moon.</li>

<p>Both of those, plus erosion erases most of the scars. Also, the oceans eat up the largest fraction of the ones that actually hit.</p></div>		</li>
