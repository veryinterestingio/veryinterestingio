			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't say I've ever done that.</p>
<p>But the thing I mentioned is actually rather common: fresnel or some &quot;random&quot; pattern on the inside leaving the outside flat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Examples where that would be a very bad idea, due to messiness potential:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oven lamps</li>
<li>Microwave oven lamps</li>
<li>Refrigerators</li>
</ul>
<p>And I checked my car, and the trunk lamp has a smooth outside. Also my kitchen shelf lamps, etc etc.</p>
<p>So a rough outside seems like an oddity to me.</p></div>		</li>
