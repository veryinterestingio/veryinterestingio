<p>point to our vaccine being very effective, around 90%</p>

<p>Isn't this contradicting the new data coming out of the UK and Israel that shows a high rate of Delta breakthrough cases?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the linked article: “Israel has one of the world's most advanced vaccination campaigns largely based on the Pfizer-BioNTech shot. Sharon Alroy-Preis, head of public health at Israel's Health Ministry, said that Israel still lacks enough data to provide insight into vaccine effectiveness against the Delta variant.</p>
<p>&quot;We are collecting the data now. We are only now seeing the first cases of the Delta variant in Israel - about 200 of those - so we will know more soon,&quot; she told reporters on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Asking employees about COVID-19
An analysis by Public Health England (PHE), where the Delta variant is more widespread, found that both the Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca (AZN.L) vaccines provide more than 90% protection against hospitalization from the Delta variant. “</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>90% protection implies 10% break through.  If you have 1 million people exposed then there will be 100,000 break through cases.  So no, not contradictory at all.</p>
<p>You should expect a lot of breakthrough cases.  However, for the breakthrough cases you should still expect to see reduced severity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it does not, because in places like the UK you have a high proportion of vaccinated people.</p>
<p>Say, hypothetically (so I do not get egg on my face by getting real numbers wrong) you have a population that is 80% vaccinated with a 90% effective vaccine. Say also that vaccinated and unvaccinated people are exposed at the same rate, and that exposure for an unvaccinated person always results in infection (probably unrealistic assumptions, but they make the math easy).</p>
<p>Then out of 100 exposed people, 20 are unvaccinated and get infected. 80 are vaccinated, and 8 of them suffer a breakthrough infection, since the vaccine is 90% effective at preventing infection. This means there are then 28 total cases, of which ~28.6% are breakthrough cases.</p></div>		</li>
