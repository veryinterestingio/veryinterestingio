			<div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s both </p>
<p>Either or</p>
<p>Symptomatic bradycardia with hypotension still gets pressor support at least as a bridge to something like transvenous pacing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why I mentioned cardiac output. Symptomatic bradycardia is due to poor cardiac output. It's less a concern about increasing the heart rate and more about increasing the output.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe because things are different in the UK but I've literally never seen adrenaline be used for bradycardia in 7 years of cardiac ITU nursing. Glyco or atropine in all cases I've seen. Adrenaline is far too arrythmic. In the UK we hardly ever use it. Maybe as the last drug in the mix once every other pressor/trope has been thrown in.</p>
<p>Not doubting your practice, just interesting the way things differ.</p></div>		</li>
