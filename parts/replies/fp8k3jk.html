			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to note the difference of R0 and Re, the effective reproductive number. R0 is the reproductive number when a virus is novel to the system and not measured are taken. The effective reproductive number, Re, will be different because it is the measure based on being in the middle of an outbreak or when measured are taken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>R0 is highly dependent upon the environment.  If you are modeling an outbreak of the same flu like virus in Kansas during the summertime and New York during the winter time, you will need to use different  R0s to accurately predict the results.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this, not only does SARS-COV-1 cause a more severe illness, but it also is found to be contagious only when symptoms appear. This makes it much easier for sick people to be isolated before they can spread the disease. </p>
<p>SARS-COV-2, much like the flu, is often contagious long before symptoms begin, or even completely asymptomatic, meaning a sick person can infect a number of people before they even know they are sick. This is what makes it so much harder to deal with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IMO, this is the key factor here. If COVID-19 weren’t contagious until symptoms showed, China probably could have contained it easily. Even if not, other countries would not have been as severely affected as they are. Remember, SARS only infected about 8000 people worldwide (the exact figure escapes me, but that’s close), and killed around 800. There were even cases in the US, but nobody remembers that because it didn’t kill a huge number of people due to being so containable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, why was it possible to contain swine flu and H1N1 better than SARS-CoV-2? </p>
<p>I think the difference is that SARS-CoV-2 infections never become severely symptomatic (asymptomatic versus presymptomatic) but I'm not sure how common asymptomatic flu cases are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another neat fact, viruses generally evolve to be LESS lethal because it's better for the survival of the virus. People with a mild flu will go to work and spread it, people with a bad flu will stay home.</p>
<p>During WWI, it was the opposite. Soldiers who had mild flu stayed in the trenches but soldiers with severe symptoms got on crowded trains to travels to crowded hospitals and the more deadly virus spread for the 2nd wave.</p>
<p>Scientists and epidemiologists today always look harder at areas with extreme turmoil as pandemics happen because those environments favor more lethal mutations</p></div>		</li>

<p>It’s important to note that this theory has a lot of caveats. For example, a zoonotic disease like COVID19 or Ebola doesn’t necessarily care how lethal it is to humans, because it just has to be able to evolve to survive in its native species. COVID19 however looks to be establishing itself as a human disease, so it’ll be interesting to see how it might evolve over time.</p>
<p>Also, with a disease such as COVID19 that has high transmissibility and mild symptoms early in infection but very severe symptoms later on, does it even need to evolve towards being less lethal? After all, it’s got no problem finding new hosts. And it’s actually only lethal to small subset of individuals, individuals that have likely already passed their reproductive age at that. It’s lethality doesn’t greatly effect the number of potential new hosts nor does it kill/incapacitate people before they can spread it to the next batch of people, meaning there’s <em>maybe</em> not as much of a driving force for the disease to become less lethal.</p></div>		</li>
