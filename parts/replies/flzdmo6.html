			<div class="markdown"><p>DNA is the blueprint every cell in your body uses to make the various proteins and such for it's internal processes. Viruses inject their RNA (basically one half of the &quot;DNA ladder&quot;) into the cell and that genetic sequence then &quot;hijacks&quot; your cell to make the viruses building blocks, which then assemble into new viruses. But, assuming this process doesn't kill the cell, means next time that cell replicates it will also replicate the viral RNA that was inserted into the cell's nucleus. Suddenly you have a cell with extra genetic material it didn't have before. Now imagine every once in a while some of the new materials that viral RNA makes, also happen to benefit the host cell or then entire host organism. That's essentially how it happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that's less like &quot;harmless viruses&quot; and more that at some point we basically assimilated some ancient virus into our genome because we actually found its DNA to be useful. Between that and mitocondria, really, we're just like the Borg collective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really what happened. We didn't voluntarily &quot;assimilate&quot; viruses into our genome, these are DNA strands that are for the most part results of retroviral attacks, where they use reverse transcriptase to convert their RNA into DNA which they then insert into the genome. If this happens in a gamete, then the offspring will carry that same viral DNA. Over the course of millions of years they have just added up, some may end up coding for something which have a function for us, but largely they don't necessarily have any specific function.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, not voluntarily, I assumed they just happened to leave that material behind and then it just happened to code for something potentially useful which led to cells with that DNA having a competitive advantage and thus ending up carrying that DNA until today.</p></div>		</li>
