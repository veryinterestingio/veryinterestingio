			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there is definitely a learning curve with fasting. Your body has to get used to the sudden stress you've put on it. My recommendation is to start slow and increase your hours as your body becomes more comfortable with the new routine. Start at 10 hours, slowly bump to 12, then 14 and 16. Once you can comfortably handle 16, 18-24 hours fast seem to be lot easier. I average 18 hours daily now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to diminish what you're doing or maybe I don't quite get the math but isn't that just like skipping breakfast? Say you have dinner at 6pm then the next meal is lunch at noon the next day. I do this all the time, not that big a deal. Again, I don't wanna rub anybody wrong if I'm not comprehending....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first couple days of trying fasting can be difficult. But after a while you get into a rhythm where you notice hunger pangs around a specific time of day (for me it’s 11 and 3), once I can recognize the time frame I can prepare myself mentally, ie make sure I have plenty of water, go on a walk, or have something to distract me until the hunger pang subsides (which it always does). It takes patience. But if you’re getting dizzy, you might need more water and maybe spiked with electrolytes (try lite salt).</p></div>		</li>
