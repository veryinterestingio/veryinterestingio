			<div class="markdown"><p>I like radiolab and all.... but man sometimes it gets way too cutesy with the editing, the effects, the metaphors, and especially when Jad and Robert pretend to be surprised by the outcome of a story theyve already produced, but need to be an audience surrogate. It's so corny and over produced I kind of find it hard to take.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is because you are talking about different meanings of purple and/or exist.</p>
<p>I think you are arguing that there exist no purple photons or purple wavelength, while your friends are arguing that there exists a perceptual experience, a qualia, for purple.</p>
<p>You must agree that just by looking we can tell when an eggplant has ripe fruit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I liked his explaination, but I do want to point out there are two theories about your cones in your eyes.</p>
<p>TL;DR - The two theories couldn't be any more different, I explain both to the best of my abilities, but both theories are needed to explain different situations and phenomenon that our color vision has. So technically both theories are wrong on their own. Long story short, we have much to learn about our eyes.</p>
<p>A little deeper into the biology, you eyes have two cells that pick up light. Rods are very sensitive, they only &quot;see&quot; in greyscale, and they're what gives you night vision. Cones, on the other hand, require much more light, but they're what actually see the colors. Now this is where the theories come in.</p>
<p>Theory 1: The &quot;Trichromatic theory (Young-Helmgoltz theory).&quot; This is basically what has been stated above, and it's also what people generally refer too. It basically states normal color vision is based on the activity of three different cone activity, red, green, and blue, each with different peak sensitivities. basically, blue and red mix to make purple, but the stronger intensity red, will make it more pink.</p>
<p>Theory 2: The &quot;Opponent Process theory.&quot; This one is a little more complicated. This one kind of says that the cone is like a light switch,  with different sensitivities still, but instead of &quot;on/off&quot; its &quot;red/green.&quot; You still have three types of cones, but they each activate to two different colors instead of just one, but they can only activate to one at a time.</p>
<p>The Opponent-Process theory states that cones are linked together to form three opposing color pairs: red/green, blue/yellow, and black/white. Activation of one member of the pair, say blue, inhibits the other, green. This explains why we dont see &quot;blueish yellow&quot; in the same location. This theory also helps explain some color dificiencies, like why people with dichromatic color deficiencies, confuse either red and green, or blue and yellow. This also explains why we see yellow when we have no yellow cone.</p>
<p>You can actually test this theory as well. If you've ever looked at a bright light, then looked away, you'd notice that the light, though gone, is still blocking your view. That's because your cones tire out by looking at a specific color, and once removed, your cones go to the opposite color to &quot;rest.&quot; As easy way to test this, is by looking at a screen showing pure red for about 30 seconds, then quickly switching to a white screen, you'll actually the &quot;after image&quot; of the red, which if you focus enough, will be green.</p>
<p>Now, please do choose which theory you want to believe in, also, please correct or tell me if I put mis-information or didnt explain something clearly enough, but there is one fact about these theories, both are needed to explain what is known about our color vision. I guess since that's the case, you could technically say both theories are wrong as well.</p>
<p>Edit: Blueish green -&gt; Blueish yellow</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit: The above comment was previously worded differently, which is why I seem like an idiot in this situation. His originally comment said emitted instead of reflected.</p>
<p>My Original comment:</p>
<p>No the way pigments work is they absorb some wavelengths and reflect others, so a purple pigment would absorb green leaving only red and blue.</p>
<p>So doesn't contain red and blue wavelengths reflects red and blue wavelengths.</p></div>		</li>

<p><strong>This is an appropriate response. I did not word the original question correctly and then edited it to make it more accurate.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't get it... Isn't Violet just another word for &quot;purple&quot;? There are definitely &quot;Violet photons&quot;.</p>
<p>Edit: This got a lot more responses so I thought I would sum up all the great explanations I got.</p>
<p>Violet is really a more intense blue (as far as light is concerned).  We see things that contain red and blue pigments as violet because our red cones pick up that wavelength of light <em>in addition</em> to the red wavelengths on the completely opposite end of the spectrum.  The image below shows it pretty well.</p>
<p>The curves represent how much the cones in our eyes detect the wavelength

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, violet in the context of light and colors is just s deep deep blue. Once you start adding red to it, it’s no longer violet, but becomes purple or magenta. </p></div>		</li>
