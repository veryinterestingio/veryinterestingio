			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a good question that I don’t have an answer for beyond speculation. I wouldn’t be surprised if behind closed doors at one of the company’s there is some person who’s working on some type of feedback system that could potentially auto adjust the rate at which a total artificial heart pumps blood but IMO this technology is still in its infancy. In fact in the US the Syncardia TAH is only FDA approved for bridge to transplant. Trials are still going on for destination therapy. I’ve personally only seen one patient on my unit with it since we trained on it.</p></div>		</li>
