<p>The majority of real, high quality LSD vanished from production in the 90s when a major lab was busted, now adays unless you're well connected you are not buying real LSD.</p>

<p>While there have been some major busts that have affected the supply chain, there is plenty of real LSD out there nowadays. The dosages are so small that one lab can produce a massive amount from a few production runs, then go into hibernation for awhile. </p>
<p>Take a look at a testing site like www.drugsdata.org, and you'll see that most LSD samples test legitimate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To your point though there is a chance it wasn’t LSD but an off brand. </p>
<p>Source: have taken a few tabs of LSD in my day( or what I thought was LSD anyway)</p></div>		</li>

It was only after i was pink lightning going through the clouds that it really hit me. Then i spent an hour looking at a buttercup through an magnifying glass.</p>
<p>Edit. To anyone who thinks that they one day try LSD, have a magnifying glass on hand, they awesome to play around with while tripping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's amazing that nature is probably the best thing you can experience on psychadellics. I've had some pretty fun trips, but the best ones are always outside.</p>
<p>A magnifying glass and some plants does seem like a really great time, I'll have to try it next time I get my hands on some mushrooms!</p></div>		</li>

Yes like saying almost all of the acid sold today is fake.</p></div>		</li>
