			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really interesting! I wonder if we know a lot about dust particles in general? I think dust is a really vague word which has a multitude of properties.
Now I have a weekend topic to look up to, thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah dust can be a lot of different things, in most households itâ€™s a combination of skin cells, dead microorganisms, fibers from cloth, etc but it can vary wildly depending on your air pollution. When I had an apartment near an interstate the dust would stain things, like coal ash. Sometimes when you sneezed it would be black.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Near highways, brake dust is the #1 created dust particle and surprisingly abundant. Especially near interstates with lots of traffic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have to wonder if static electricity doesn't play a role here; most fan blades are plastic, and plastics can build up static and attract dust pretty easily. I just bought a TV with a shiny black plastic edge, and the edge was visibly dusty within a couple of days. And I believe wood also can build up a static charge.</p></div>		</li>
