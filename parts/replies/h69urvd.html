			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry about that, I did read it too quickly. To be clear, what I'm saying that your intuition for how forces work is distorted because of your experience living on Earth. The same way that we struggle to believe &quot;an object in motion stays in motion&quot; because that's not how things work on Earth, this is another example of how friction and gravity messes with our accurate intuitions about physics.</p></div>		</li>
