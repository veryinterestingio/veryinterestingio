			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're a poacher (or a smuggler, or a retailer, or someone else along the chain,) why wouldn't you substitute cheap artificial rhino horn to increase your profit margin?  You could sell your product 10% cheaper than your competitors and still make more money.  But then your competitors will lower their prices too, and you'll have to lower your prices, and suddenly the price is so low that killing actual rhinos isn't cost-effective for anyone.</p>
<p>This, incidentally, is why the diamond cartel is terrified of artificial diamonds (which are already essentially identical to real diamonds.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve heard the bigger issue with this is that it would increase demand for the product - ie now everyone can get it, it fuels the idea that it’s a real medicinal product.</p>
<p>Then if they figure out a way to distinguish the real thing, you’ve got a larger pie of people who want it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, tho I want to get slightly more specific. I want the people funding/ encouraging the poachers to feel the heat. Alot of the physical poaching is done by people on the edge of poverty trying to feed a family. No excuse for their actions, but I certainly blame them far less than the greedy corrupt piece of shit paying them to do this garbage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There have been a lot of ideas on how to flood the market, for rhino horn and elephant ivory (usually the latter), many people will for instance argue that elephant ivory stockpiles should be sold to decrease the price and therefore decrease poaching. Some people argue that it should be legal to raise rhinos in captivity to sell their horns (the reasoning being &quot;we have a lot of cows under this idea&quot;)</p>
<p>Somewhere on my dead computer is a compilation of a bunch of resources basically saying that doing this LITERALLY increases poaching, because it just gives sellers of real horn/ivory a huge smokescreen under which to do even MORE business.</p>
<p>This is why you will see reports about countries burning piles of illegal, seized ivory.</p>
<p>I did the project a couple years ago, and in that time I've been to Africa, seen elephants/rhino in the wild, and spent the past few months on internship caring for critically endangered rhinos.</p>
<p>I wish these projects to make fake horn the best of luck, I would be ECSTATIC if they succeeded in decreasing poaching, but from what I've seen I sincerely do not think it will help (and it might actually hurt.)</p>
<p>They don't lack ideas. They lack funding, law enforcement support, economic and governmental stability...</p>
<p>God, it is sad.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: While I'm remembering, something related I want to point out-</p>
<p>Demand for tiger parts is also INSANELY high and still rising, but the &quot;supply&quot; is dropping.</p>
<p>So they are turning to other species of big cats to meet the demand.</p>
<p>At the rate we are going, lions and jaguars will follow tigers to extinction sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to be such a bummer. At least we can day drink in quarantine, right?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I'm not saying I support this strategy, I don't. 'Farms' coupled with much harsher penalties for poachers saved alligators in the US. The farms dramatically reduced the price poachers could get, so the risk vs reward ratio decreased a lot. But alligator farms are not very profitable and often rely on also having tourism to stay in business. So raising rhinos in captivity probably wouldn't work unless you cut out all the smugglers and middlemen. Even then it might not drive the price down enough to deter poachers who are typically very poor and have few opportunities for decent employment. I believe that in at least some areas where rhinos are poached the penalty for poachers is the rangers shooting you where you stand, which is about as harsh as it gets as well.</p></div>		</li>
