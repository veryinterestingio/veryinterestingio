<p>The synthetic part is a new method but has the potential to be much faster to produce and scale rapidly. Although it has never been widely used before to my knowledge, although COVID could change that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>a strand of RNA that triggers antigens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>RNA generally doesn't trigger an immune response from the <em>adaptive</em> immune system. (It sure as hell can from the innate immune system, tho). What you mean is that the virus has something like 10 or 11 different proteins, and several could be good targets to express as proteins to serve as antigens (the antigen is the thing that triggers immunity).</p></div>		</li>

<p>But thank you for the info. I've never heard of that. That's really interesting.</p></div>		</li>
