			<div class="markdown"><p>Several hundred miles at least. My neighbor used to raise them, then they would drive several states away and release them and the birds would “race” home. I want to say he was like 500 miles away before. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can race pigeons from Scotland back home to Ireland. My da used to do it, lives in Kilkenny down on the South Western side. They used to bring them as kids and let them fly back home, someone there would see whose would get there first haha. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, this just leads to more questions -</p>
<p>a) does this mean, that every city would have had a market for homing pigeons that would reach different cities? Or would they have a market that sold pigeons that would come back to the city they are sold in?</p>
<p>b) how would such pigeons be transported in the first place? Would London for example, raise a bunch of pigeons at their &quot;post office&quot; , force them to make their home there and then send out cart loads of pigeons to every neighbouring city? </p>
<p>c) say, these pigeons are kept in cages for urgent uses only. how long, before they recentred and called the cage their new home? I presume there is no intergenerational memory of home?</p>
<p>d) How far do pigeons make their nests from each other? Would you be able to have multiple pigeon nests in an area without them getting territorial?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could be wrong, but my understanding is that only Great Houses had homing pigeons and they're pretty much a one-directional form of communication (one bird only flies one direction). House A would raise pigeons and take some along when visiting House B then 1) use their own pigeons to send a message back home to House A or 2) leave some House A pigeons at House B. Then later if House B needed to send a message to House A, they would strap the message to a House A pigeon and release it.  But I do wonder how long a House A pigeon can stay at House B before considering House B their home and no longer being willing to return to House A.</p>
<p>I guess that pigeons were less likely to be used for between house communication and more likely to be used for a traveler/officer from a house to be able to send a message back home (they would be unable to receive a reply from home via pigeon). I'm guessing the message send home via pigeon would be something like &quot;arrived safely&quot; or &quot;send reinforcements.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is possible to shoot a bird out of the sky,  it is difficult even when you are ready and waiting, and even harder if you aren't already prepared to shoot before you see it. But even if you do shoot it down, in a place where you can retrieve it without being shot yourself, the message could easily be encrypted with a one time pad cypher, which is unbreakaboe.</p>
<p>The downside of one time pad cyphers is that you have to securely transmit or transport the cypher, but since you have to securely transport the bird too, you can just carry the codes with the birds.</p>
<p>There is a risk of the enemy capturing your birds and codes and sending fake messages back, but very low risk of them reading your messages, as long as you burn your cypher after encrypting and have proper security on the receivers end after decrypting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They won't be able to send them back unless they have pigeons from the origin point who consider that home. Sending the ones with fake messages will go to the original send destination. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you capture an enemy outpost that is equipped with a couple of pigeons for reporting back to HQ, you can send a pigeon that says something like &quot;movement to the North, estimate 100,000 enemy troops&quot;. When in fact your army is going around to the South. </p>
<p>This only works if you capture it without the enemy knowing, but it is a possibility you need to defend against if you are using pigeons for communications in a war.</p></div>		</li>
