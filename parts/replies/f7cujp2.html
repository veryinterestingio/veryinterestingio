			<div class="markdown"><p>Leading strand synthesis isn't actually entirely continuous, although the fragments are more on the order of 1kb which is good enough for gen bio courses to glaze over this detail.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah you are definitely right. It's been kind of strange learning all the little details that are left out of more general biology classes, but I also recognize how little it matters to someone like myself (computational biologist) whose research is wholly unrelated to DNA replication</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm so sorry. I wrote all of that misreading primase as polymerase.</p>
<p>OK, I know even less of this, and I think that might actually be a wider science thing... </p>
<p>As far as I understand, primase could theoretically create primers that go the length of the dna strand BUT they copy incredibly slowly (low processivity) and so are unlikely to carry that out before detaching. Instead they form a complex with helicase, which increases primases affinity and binding of single stranded DNA, increases its speed of copying and (for some reason... Sorry don't have an actual answer for you) limits its length to that 10-ish length. It's some aspect of the complex that limits it. </p>
<p>Some info on that: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2846230/#!po=0.413223" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2846230/#!po=0.413223</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Yan et. al. Suggests a &quot;caliper&quot; model in which the length of the RNA primer is physically constrained by the Structure of primase. This study was carried out in an archaeal species, which shares both structural and functional homology to eukaryotic replication proteins. </p>
<p>They found that binding of the 5'triphosphate at the initiation site by primase subunit PriX, an archaeal primase subunit that shares structural and functional homology with the N terminal portion of the C terminal domain of eukaryotic PriL, and binding of the elongating 3' end of the RNA stand at the catalytic site of archaeal PriS acts as the physical constraint to determine primer length. The RNA primer length is determined by the maximum number of nucleotides able to be accommodated between these two binding sites at different subunits on the primase.</p>
<p>Figure 6 in the paper has the model if you want to check it out. I won't go into too much more detail, but that's the gist of it.</p></div>		</li>
