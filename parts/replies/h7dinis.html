<p>That's a 22.7% effective tax rate. A successful surgeon making $1m in regular income pays a higher rate.</p>

<p>At his level, it's 23.8% due to the 3.8% surcharge on high income individuals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the surgeon has a salary. That's taxed at a higher rate  37% if they make $518k or more..  But you're not taxed on all your income at 37%, only income above $518k.  Your effective tax rate is lower.</p>
<p>If someone had that same income only as capital gains, they'd pay only 20%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And that surgeon also has many deductibles or credits or anything else to help lower tax rate. It’s the tax code, it’s there for a reason. I’m in a high tax bracket monthly like another said who replies to you, but after everything is said and done I only have an effective tax rate of about 18%. But eventually even when I don’t have income, I’ll be taxed on my assets, which I have not yet realized(sold).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that surgeon may be making a million, but he's got $100,000 mortgage interest deduction, $50k in crypto losses, a home office he writes $100k off for, and a side business that's hemorrhaging money. He's probably looking at an adjusted gross around $350, for a 12.25% effective tax rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd doubt a successful surgeon pays a higher rate in the end.  I mean I pay roughly 32% monthly but my end of year effective tax rate is typically around 12.5%.  Actual effective tax rate is usually less given all the possiilities for deductions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The top tax rate is 37% and that starts at $523,601 so that's almost half the income at 37% meaning the other half of the income - at a lower rate - isn't going to be anywhere near 22.7%.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I have no idea about your taxes. Also nobody pays 32% monthly in Federal taxes unless you're maybe making 8 figures regular income.</p></div>		</li>

When he dies the estate will pay off the debt and transfer the net to his heirs. I assume there's a really beneficial treatment for that payment too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Like I don’t get why it matters <em>when</em> Bezos gets taxed, only that it does. Who cares if he’s dead?</p></div>		</li>
