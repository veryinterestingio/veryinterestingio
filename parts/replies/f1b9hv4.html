			<div class="markdown"><p>\^ This. Your muscles undergo a cellular process which heals them while you're resting. So a tear in your muscle is not uncommon. For example, when people are working out, your muscles get larger by literally tearing your muscle fibers, which will then heal, creating more (and thicker) muscle fibers. Tendons and ligaments don't function like this, so they grow/heal at a much slower rate.</p></div>		</li>
