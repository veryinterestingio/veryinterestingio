<p>the military was forced to institute a draft</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The draft that covered the Vietnam war was initiated in the 1948 Selective Service Act. It was used for the Korean war, and it was in place for 13 years before Kennedy began to militarize the US involvement in Vietnam and another three years before the protests began.</p>
<p>It was ended in 1973 by Richard Nixon and reinstated in 1980 by Jimmy Carter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but I am using the term institute to mean, set in motion. I am not using to say they invented or created it just for that war or saying it wasn't done before. There is a draft process now that is similar to the Vietnam process but it is not currently being employed as there are enough volunteers to the military to handle the current manning needs. The other wars that used a conscription ie. Korea and WWII were not protested by nearly as much as Vietnam. There are dozens to maybe a hundred or more anti war songs about Vietnam where Korea has like 2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They set the draft in motion for Korea and WW2, neither were protested as much as Vietnam using your own words. Therefor the statement you made that I quoted and disagreed with is still unsubstantiated.  </p>
<p>All I am saying is the claim that you made that the US started the draft (instituted, if you will) was certainly not predicated on civil opposition since that didn't even come into its own until three years after the full militarization began.</p></div>		</li>
