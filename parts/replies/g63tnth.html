			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an interesting question! There is some research on this (see for example: <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02305/full#B44" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02305/full#B44" target="_blank">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02305/full#B44</a></a> and papers they cite). One factor that can contribute to this effect is that music chunks texts to units with equal lengths (syllables, phrases) that are easier to process for the brain than non-chunked plain text and it can also facilitate their memorization.<br />
Another factor could be that we are repeating songs in our head (or even loud) more often than plain texts. With that we are retrieving the information what facilitates its memorization known as the testing effect (eg., <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01693.x" target="_blank"><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01693.x" target="_blank">https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01693.x</a></a>)</p></div>		</li>
