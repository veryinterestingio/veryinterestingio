			<div class="markdown"><p>How the hell would you get an approval for this study? Or more important question is: can I convince my self that I already ate enough just 2 hours ago? Specially since I remember that I ate and should not feel hungry at this point. Seriously what is a practical element to focus on when you trying to lose weight?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've wondered this too. I imagine they explained the study to the participants during a period of lucidity, and got their permission. Still seems like many IRBs would furrow their brows though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Like, you'd think maybe it's because pizza is delicious. But I couldn't eat an entire cheesecake. Or two things of Oreos. And if I tried, I'd certainly stop enjoying it well before I got anywhere near the end.</p></div>		</li>

<p>First - stretching of the stomach sends signals to the brain</p>
<p>Second - chemical released by the small intestine tell the brain that you're digesting food</p>
<p>Third - sugar, protein and fat blood levels are managed by the pancreas and liver. These responses are what give you cravings </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>May I bother you for a moment? Fully understand if you haven't the time to answer this, just figure it doesn't hurt to ask:  </p>
<p>My understanding is the signal for &quot;you can stop eating now&quot; takes a set amount of time to be triggered (20 minutes, I believe?) is this true? I've always been a very slow eater, and my understanding is being such, I am less likely to overeat. (Possibly related, I also have a tendency to fast all day, then have a moderately embarrassing sized meal 4-5 hours before bed.)  </p>
<p>I've also heard sodas - rather, items sweetened with HFCS - dampen this &quot;put down the fork&quot; signal; what you be savvy to any info on this?  </p>
<p>Thank you in advance if you do have the time to reply, or to anyone that may be able to drop some knowledge/squash my misinformation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>a bit of neat info to add on here; some people can never get that &quot;stop eating&quot; signal. people with Prader-Willi syndrome lack the ability to produce that &quot;i'm full&quot; signal to the brain, so they're just constantly hungry always.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not the most educated on this topic but from what I remember in my research into keto and hormones and all that jazz is that fructose interferes with the leptin response, leptin being a hormone that tells you if you're full or not. So yes, eating anything with fructose (sucrose also contains fructose) impairs the bodies ability to signal with its hormones that you've eaten.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so very much for your feedback!!  </p>
<p>I'm not as skeptical as I'd like to be about reading things on the internet, but I was pretty sure I picked up that notion from a study on the correlation of HFCS and obesity. Since then I've tried to limit my consumption of said sweetener, and tried to replace it with more... This is the incorrect term, but it's the closest my vocabulary has - &quot;natural&quot; sweeteners: cane/beet sugar/molasses, and honey. My diet is still horrendous (because I have the willpower of a shoe lace) but of all the shite food decisions I make, I feel a tiny bit of pride for at least being able to cut out any and all pre-packaged beverages.  </p>
<p>Sorry to ramble. Again, my deepest gratitude goes to you for taking the time out of your day for a random stranger. I hope your upcoming week is a marvelous one!\^_\^</p></div>		</li>
