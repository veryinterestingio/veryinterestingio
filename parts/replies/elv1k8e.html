			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason is because it is an all-or-nothing event. Imagine looking at a light bulb, where light is a type of atom. A huge number of atoms can seem like a dimmer switch where more and more disappear as the switch is lowered, but a single atom is a light switch. It either is on or off, and just looking at the bulb there is no way to tell if it is only one third switched, because the change happens all at once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no 'buildup' of decay.  At any given instant there is a chance that it will decay <em>spontaneously</em>.  This is because there exists a state of lower potential energy for the system.  All it takes is for the particles to randomly enter a certain configuration for the decay to occur.</p>
<p>It's like a snowfield on a mountain.  Whilst the system is being held up by friction, all it takes is for a particle to move out of place, whether that's from wind or whatnot, for everything to collapse.  There's no buildup, because its not like there's some sort of fuse - it's just when the system reaches a state where decay can occur.</p>
<p>Also important to note, given the sensitivity of the system quantum effects can also trigger decay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay let me rephrase part of the question then. Since age does not influence the decay, what is it that triggers the decay when it does eventually decay, do we know this?</p></div>		</li>
