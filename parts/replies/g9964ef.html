			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes you don't have a bolt of a correct length, or if you are trying to get a cotterpin hole to match up with a castle nut, you need to do some adjusting. It's better to have a bolt that is a bit too long than too short, and most aviation bolts are made under the same standards, AN or NAE. For instance, I was trying to install a smaller autopilot servo, and my options were either AN3-4s or AN3-5s. The first number indicates width, in 32nds of an inch, and the second number represents length, in 16ths of an inch. The AN3-4s were too short, while the AN3-5s were too long. They don't make AN3-4.5s, or if they do I'm sure they are expensive and take 3 weeks to ship, so I just threw an AN3-5 on there with a thin plain washer to get the cotter pin hole to line up and have enough threads exposed. As long as the end of the bolt isn't in the way of anything else, it doesn't hurt anything, but if a bolt is too short and doesn't fully engage all of the threads of the nut, then you run the risk of the bolt coming loose. </p>
<p>If you don't know what cotterpins are, they are a form of locking device that prevents a nut and bolt from loosening. They look a little like bobby pins, except thicker, and both of the legs are straight. They are used with a bolt that has a hole through it, near the end, and a castellated nut, or shorthanded as castle nut. Castellated nuts look kind of like a crown, with prongs sticking up creating slots on each side of the nut. (if this is confusing, google images of these, they are kind of hard to describe without you seeing one). You tighten the nut and bolt to a given torque range, let's say 30 to 45 inch pounds, and then check if the hole in the bolt lines up with a slot in the nut. You first tighten the bolt to 30 inch pounds, then check, and if it's not lining up, then you go a little more, and a little more, until it either lines up or you hit 45 inch pounds. If it hits 45 inch pounds, then you remove it all and add a washer, then try again. </p>
<p>Another reason you use spacers is if you need to make sure that there is separation between two parts. A good example is a custom instrument panel in the cockpit; on smaller aircraft like Cessnas these usually have to be tailored and fit to each aircraft. Part of that is when you are actually installing the panel to the structure, you want to make sure that the panel is mostly flat, when the structure under it has different heights and shapes. To do this, you stick spacers in between the panel and the structure, so that the side view goes like this: bolt head, panel, spacer, structure, nut. </p>
<p>There are two ways you can do the spacers, which is you actually use either cut tubing or proper spacers, which you then have to use a belt sander to shorten to the perfect length, or you just use a combination of flat and thick plain washers super glued together. This is much easier when trying to fit the panel because you can easily add or remove washers, then glue them once you are done, whereas with proper spacers you can only remove material until it gets too short, then you have to start over. </p>
<p>And before you panic, the glue is doing nothing to hold the panel together, it's just a nice thing to do for the next mechanic who has to remove the panel. The bolt and nut clamp the washers together anyways, it's just easier to remove and install when you only have to worry about one stack of washers instead of 3 individual ones that rain down everywhere. </p>
<p>These methods I am describing are more common in general aviation, which is mostly single engine prop planes like Cessnas and pipers. Each of these aircraft were hand-built, meaning that even 2 Cessnas that are technically the same plane will require some trimming and fitting to install a new part. Basically imagine if to replace your car's bumper, you had to shave down the edges of the bumper until it fit on your car. Commercial aviation, like airliners, is generally more standardized, and you would buy a kit from Boeing or some other company that would include all the hardware, including spacers, that were needed. Everything would already be measured out by the engineers, so the mechanic doesn't have to do as much trimming and fitting.</p></div>		</li>
