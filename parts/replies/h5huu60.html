			<div class="markdown"><p>If you surface to quickly you can get it and even animals adapted to deep-sea dives can, but they have mecanisms to mitigate it, I.e. the fat composition is one of those. Fat in animals adapted to deep-sea dive has the ability to absorb nitrogen, so the &quot;bends&quot; is harder to manifest in those animals, but it's still life-threatening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work with someone who was so full of shit. One day I told him I did a bit of scuba diving for a bit. Since whatever you have done he has done 1 better (like if you had a cat, he would have had a lion, plus being an absolute pathological liar about virtually everything).
So naturally he tells me of the time he went for a walk along the bottom of his farm dam. Fish bowl on his head, hose pipe stuck inside the fish bowl and his mates breathing into the pipe. That and many others are things where he was just absolutely the best ever.</p></div>		</li>

Obviously I was talking about free diving.</p>
<p>Also you don't wreck your lungs holding your breath going down even while scuba diving, they just simply compress.
You don't old your breath while ASCENDING because you can over expand your lungs, also because of Co2 toxicity with depth there is an higher risk due to partial pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly true, but humans are so limited in terms of our free diving potential that the immideate damage is also very limited.</p>
<p>You can however still get Diving related osteonecrosis (where nitrogen bubbles damage your bones) if you spend a lot of time freediving at an elite level.</p>
<p>Whales and turtles though. They can get the bends even though they don't take any breaths while diving (because they can spend hours beneath the surface and dive to depths exceeding a kilometer).</p></div>		</li>
