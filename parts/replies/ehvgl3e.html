			<div class="markdown"><p>Southern California has had drought conditions periodically over the past couple decades and a desalination plant was built in San Diego county. We’ve had a ton of rain recently but apparently the plant produces quite a bit of water:</p>
<p><em>The Claude Bud Lewis Carlsbad Desalination Plant is the largest, most technologically advanced and energy-efficient seawater desalination plant in the nation. Each day, the plant delivers nearly 50 million gallons (56,000 acre-feet per year (AFY)) of fresh, desalinated water to San Diego County – enough to serve approximately 400,000 people and accounting for about one-third of all water generated in the County.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can technically do it with no electricity on a sunny day.</p>
<p>Get a large bowl, put a small cup inside, weighted down somehow. Put salt water in the bowl (not in the cup) and cover the whole thing with clear plastic wrap.  Make sure the inner cup is shorter than the bowl.  Put something small in the middle of the plastic over the cup so that the plastic points down towards the cup.</p>
<p>Put in the sun, wait.</p>
<p>The saltwater will evaporate and condense on the plastic, then roll down towards the middle and fall into the cup.</p>
<p>Boom, fresh water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's expensive compared to the alternatives (rivers, lakes, groundwater, manmade reservoirs etc.) but not exorbitantly so for developed economies. </p>
<p>Another way to think of this is that it puts an upper limit on the price of water near the coasts. Costs inland would be higher because of the need to pipe the water over long distances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not there there's no possible use. It's that there's no economically viable use.</p>
<p>There are plenty of applications for brine but none that are so desperate for it that they can justify shipping it around in tanker trucks. You could distill it all the way down to crystalline salt but then you would need to purify it, and at that point you've spent way more money than you would have just harvesting it elsewhere. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is worsened by the fact that a lot of our salt doesn't come frome the oceans but from salt mines. So we're constantly increasing the salinity of our oceans. Road salt for instance is just unfiltered table salt coming from salt mines.</p>
<p>It should be mandatory that salt from desalination plants is used on icy roads.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea here is a good one, but you also have to take into account the amount of fossil fuel that would be used to haul salt to places far from the coasts. It may not actually be more environmentally friendly than mining salt. I don't know for sure which is better. It probably depends on where it is needed geographically. </p></div>		</li>
