			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate that people do this mainly cuz I broke my muffler on my civic, a common car for people that like to make loud cars, and now everyone thinks I’m one of those assholes.</p>
<p>In reality I’m just a broke college student and can’t afford the fix. They said another few parts around the muffler were broken too so it’d be like 1200</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Call up a local junk/scrap yard. I drive a Civic and the local junkyard has a bunch of civics I can buy used parts off of for way cheaper. Obviously a brand new muffler would be great, but if there's another car in the scrap yard with a fine muffler pick that thing up and it'll take your repair prices waaaay down.</p>
<p>Just a suggestion, obviously as long as you aren't breaking noise ordinances or anything it's up to you</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When a former coworker came to work on his new motorcycle one day, I inwardly groaned, knowing I'd have my brains rattled once we left for the day. </p>
<p>I actually sat in disbelief for several minutes when I heard it running for the first time. It was only a little louder than a car. Very low, almost <em>gentle</em> sounding &quot;purr&quot;. You never heard him coming from five miles down the road. You never heard him rev the thing like a maniac. It was amazing.</p>
<p>Keep in mind I live in the South and had never known anyone to have anywhere close to a quiet motorcycle until him.</p></div>		</li>
