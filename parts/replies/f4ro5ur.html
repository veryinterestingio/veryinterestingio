			<div class="markdown"><p>The contrast is that Amazon had their IPO only a few years after their founding and losses during this period of early-stage growth-at-all-costs were fairly small. Amazon then continued to carefully manage profit to near-zero for the next almost two decades, but they were able to do that only because the company had already proven itself consistently profitable and chose to reinvest <em>all</em> profits in new growth areas. Uber, in contrast, is a decade old already and losses somehow just keep growing. The core business loses money and always has. I don't think there's any compelling reason to think it will ever suddenly become viable.</p>
<p>Backing up to OP's question, another example of this sort of perpetual loss is Spotify, which has spent most of its long life setting new records each year for losses, with the occasional good quarter due to random accounting issues. It's yet another non-viable business being subsidized by investors. At least, the ad-supported (really VC supported with a tiny subsidy from ads) business is non-viable, but that's also the majority of their users. If they ever want to become a real business, they have to just cut that off. Streaming music can work; free to listeners streaming music can't work.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, I don't have a lot of faith in Lyft becoming profitable. The entire ride-sharing business has grown based on below-cost rides. There's no reason to think people will suddenly be willing to pay the full-cost. Perhaps there are certain markets willing to pay enough, but if that's the case then profitability means scaling back from other markets and I'm not sure what that does to the network effects.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd phrase that more precisely as &quot;can't be independently profitable&quot;. Youtube Music, for instance, works because it doesn't need to be independently profitable as long as Youtube as a whole remains profitable.</p>

<p>Areas which supported apparently profitable and tightly-regulated taxi services for long periods might be seen as a fairly obvious example of markets willing to pay full cost for ridesharing, as well as evidence that the business model could remain viable with or without networking effects.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Except whenever these 'ridesharing' companies put the prices up, they lose customers. Ordinary taxi companies have better economies of scale and don't have the huge corporate overheads that the gig economy companies do.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Uber is going straight for self-driving cars because cutting out the driver is the only way it knows it can make money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IMHO, this is a pipe dream for Uber. </p>
<p>We’re currently at Autonomy level 2/3 for vehicles. For their plan to work autonomous vehicles need to be closer to 4/5, which is still at least 3-5 years out from a technical standpoint, not to mention the regulatory hurdles still TBD. </p>
<p>Uber can’t continue their losses at the run rate they’re currently operating at for that long, so their only option is to try and integrate as many low-overhead verticals as possible (Eats, Transit, Bike/Scooter, etc)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that Amazon’s cloud service is a serious cash cow, and may well be subsiding the rest of the company to a large degree. In a sense, they’ve gotten lucky with one of their ventures, and that allows them to be actually profitable now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amazon was printing money, but it was using it in a different way then you might expect. The worse thing for a business is to have cash sitting on the shelf and getting taxed. If your goal is to pull money out of the business and pay dividends then, you are gonna take a beating, even if your shareholders spend that gain in new investment. If you instead keep that money in the business, and spend it on growing the business, then the shareholders will make gains on the worth of the stock instead. It isn't like 'profitable' is this rigid definition that all companies fit. Profitability can come and go depending on stock sales and buybacks, investments, and so forth.   </p>
<p>The number that really means 'making money' is more like gross margins. On the stuff that Amazon brings in and flows out, how much are they makin on that stuff, and what does it cost them to do it? Under that model, Amazon has always been doing well. It is simply less expensive to run warehouses and ship than it is to run warehouses and retail stores too.</p></div>		</li>
