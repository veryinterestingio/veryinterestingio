			<div class="markdown"><p>The major complications with such a cachectic or emaciated patient is refeeding syndrome and it is a beast all on it's own. Basically, the body realizes it's getting nutrition and tries to rebuild it's energy and muscle storages at the cost of electrolytes and other nutrients. This can prove to be rapidly fatal and needs aggressive supportive care. The goal is to go slowly based on metabolic demand and try to get the patient eating on their own (very challenging in anorexic patients) rather than rely on forced nutrition. It's best to limit parenteral feeding because this can shut down the GI system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. The main risk here is refeeding syndrome which is primarily an issue with phosphorous levels. Refeeding causes a massive shift of electrolytes especially phosphorous back into cells of the body which lowers the levels in your blood. When blood levels of phosphorous get very low you can die of respiratory failure from diaphragm weakness or cardiac failure primarily because there isn’t enough phosphorous in these muscles to make ATP or energy that cells can use. </p>
<p>At centers where advanced anorexia is treated and patients are in similar states to the man in this photo, tube feeds are started slowly with close monitoring of electrolytes every few hours and gentle IV fluids are started. The process generally take 2-3 weeks to get from this point to a place where somebody could just eat a meal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why a feeding tube vs just a few ml of like a &quot;shake&quot; every hour? Wouldn't the feeding tube just create an opening that could get infected? Or do I not understand feeding tubes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So a feeding tube can be inserted through the nose, down the throat into the stomach, sure has an small risk of spreading a bug from the upper air way to the stomach, but most people swallow spit and snot and the stomach deals with that so this is no real additional problem. In regards to why not just oral feeds? Not too sure myself, but it allows further regulation and exact measuring of what you give. You don't have to second guess how much did the patient eat of what you gave them. Just removes another variable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regulation is how I would see it. You can feed someone the nutrition they need slowly and constantly over the space of many hours without them either having to self regulate or be constantly reminded to consume. Takes all the guess work out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve only had situations were a patient was minority staving. Feeding tubes can give them nutrients while for extended periods of time. So instead of their stomach being stressed by a large one time meal 3 times a day they can have a small amount introduced consistently over the course of let’s say 7-10 hours. Then they can move up to bolus feedings through the tube and eventually go back to eating orally.
IV fluids have been used where I worked too. But that was to prevent dehydration while we worked on getting them ready for gtubes.</p>
<p>Then there are Jtubes (I forgot the actual term) they bypass the stomach altogether and go straight to the intestine. Most of your food absorption happens here. I’m still studying this so excuse the lack of terminology but from my wrk experience I only remember seeing this once. It was for a guy whose stomach couldn’t tolerate any food or liquid because he had a procedure done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Feeding tube does not create a new opening, rather it just uses the existing body passages and acts as a direct connection between outside and stomach but through nasal cavity rather than mouth.
Also, since our gastric lining is already acidic and adapted to exposure to foreign objects (food), it's very uncommon that feeding tubes cause infection, unless the same tube is kept inside unsupervised for a very long time.
Regarding, why shake isn't administered orally is because in severe conditions, when a patient is unconscious or even semi-conscious, giving anything orally may do more harm than good because it can easily get into respiratory tract causing aspiration pneumonia or even death due to aspiration. This doesn't happen when we are conscious because our body reflexes prevent that by putting lid of epiglottis over the respiratory pipe when we are swallowing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A feeding tube is just a tube that goes directly into the stomach. There's no more risk of infection in the stomach than it you swallowed whatever you're eating.<br />
Basically it's just assisted eating.</p>
<p>As for why: the patient might not have the strength to swallow. In addition, there's no risk of food getting stuck in the air pipe this way, which might be a bigger risk for weaker patients like this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You avoid IV fluids like the plague until you get the electrolytes balanced and get some thiamine into the patient. Oral/gastric fluids is fine.</p>
<p>This a huge mistake people always make in the ED when they see someone who's &quot;dehydrated&quot;, bolusing patients at risk for refeeding with large amounts of IV fluids, and then they develop florid heart failure.</p></div>		</li>
