			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of the grease coating as many layers of grease. The bottom layer sticks well to the pan^(2), but the middle layers don't stick to themselves very well^(1). When something slides over them, the top layer sticks to the top, but the middle layers are still sliding. These layers can support a lot of pressure even as they are sliding sideways, but only if there is a proper seal on the item. If not, the grease will flatten out and squish out from inbetween the two surfaces. </p>
