			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very thorough.  You also do have some negotiation with stuff like TVs. If you buy a bunch of appliances for instance you can ask for a discount at some stores.  Also they have price match.. not a traditional negotiation but similar</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For something like TVs, this is precisely the reason why everyone &quot;price matches.&quot;  They have a universal minimum a TV can be sold at, so it doesn't matter.  I like this explanation of the pricing practices, but it doesn't explain why any of the systems would be used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, most big chains that price match will have their own model number on electronics. The Samsung uruchwk38tud TV at Walmart might be identical in looks and specs to the one at target, but the model number would be like uruchwk39tud</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but there's a few reasons why manufacturers will demand that retailers maintain a certain price. Take a luxury good, like a Ferrari. A big selling point is that the car is expensive and exclusive, which carries a certain prestige to ownership. If a dealership started marking down Ferraris to make room for less expensive cars that actually sell, that would tarnish the Ferrari brand and hurt future sales.</p>
<p>A similar situation might happen with something that has a limited production run, like bottles of aged whiskey. By setting a minimum price, the producer is telling the retailer &quot;I'll give you a decent price now since I have a lot, but when I start to run out don't get mad at me for the price increase.&quot; It helps keep things civil between the retailer and producer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pricing is always geared towards price discrimination.</p>
<p>You obviously make more per item if you sell at a higher price, but fewer people will pay that. Your max profit is determined by getting every customer to pay the highest price they are willing to part with, but still broadening the market by letting some people buy more cheaply as long as they wouldn’t have bought at higher prices and don’t discourage the ones who do.</p>
<p>In retail this is often done with coupons. You can get significant discounts on even basic goods by looking up and using coupons, but most people don’t bother. So you get some people paying the full price and others taking the effort to use coupons and getting the cheaper price without anyone feeling like they are getting scammed for paying different prices.</p>
<p>For car sales, it is almost always worth it for people to look up coupons because the sale is so large, so instead the negotiations with the sales person is where they try to get a profitable sale out of you at the highest price they can without losing the sale as long as it brings in enough to cover the costs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the sales clerks offered to bring a manager over to reduce the priced of a return item tv for me when I was shopping. I think it really has more to do with secondary market value rather than pricing structure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never pay full price for white and brown goods. Always walk in, ask what the price is, tell them they can do better than that, then tell them you will think about it. Go to the opposition, state the price and try to get them to beat it. Rinse and repeat till one of the breaks. </p>
<p>My old housemate wanted a new bed. He took 6 months playing these games within the same store, getting prices, telling them to do better, walking out. Never once bothered to go to a competitor. He picked up a $10k mattress and bed for $5200 delivered. Never be in a rush to make a big buy as it gives them the power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's very obvious with video game consoles. If you've purchased one or more PlayStation xbox's or nintendo consoles over the decades you may be able to recall that no retailer ever offered deals that affected the price of the actual console. </p>
<p>Free or discounted games or controllers with purchase of the console perhaps but the actual console themselves were always the exact same price in every single store. Retailers are contractually incapable of selling the consoles at a reduced price.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The retailers don't want to hide the price from you, it's just literally too low a price for them to advertise.</p></div>		</li>
