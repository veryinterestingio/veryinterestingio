			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a whole class of words that sound like opposites but are actually synonymous, or at least similar. (edit: &quot;pseudoantonyms&quot;--they're called)</p>
<p><strong>Guise/disguise</strong> is another one. <strong>Mend/amend. Pending/impending. Bone/debone</strong> (IMO &quot;I'm going to <em>debone</em> that salmon&quot; just sounds better.) <strong>Caregiver/caretaker</strong> --interesting one. And if Hollywood has taught us anything, a <strong>terminator</strong> is one who <strong><em>exterminates</em></strong>, and vice versa.</p>
<p>There are also &quot;contronyms&quot;, or autoantonyms, which are a bit different. The exact same word can literally mean the opposite thing:</p>
<p>-A &quot;strike&quot; can be a hit (normal usage) or a miss (baseball).  And &quot;screening&quot; a basketball opponent is not the same as screening a movie. Cars are &quot;fast&quot;...but they also hold fast if you set the parking brake. You can &quot;overlook&quot; employees; you can also overlook an important detail. Government can &quot;sanction&quot; an event (allow), or sanction imports (not allow). &quot;Dusting&quot; crops is literally the opposite process of dusting your blinds. A &quot;custom&quot; can be a common practice, or a completely unique item. If your alarm is going &quot;off&quot;, then turn it off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A clutch is a different case altogether. You press (or depress) the pedal, which actually causes a spring plate to pressure up. Which releases the pressure on the clutch disc. Which disengages the engine from the transmission. There's so many opposite actions in the one process it can be hard to wrap your head around.</p></div>		</li>
