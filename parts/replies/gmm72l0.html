			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just a thought experiment.</p>
<p>However if the grains are close to the size of the aperture to start with, the effect of a small amount of wear will be much greater than if the grains are all incredibly tiny with respect to the aperture. This relationship of the grain size to the aperture also explains why water clocks are going to be inherently better in every way. Which is probably why everyone doing legitimate timekeeping in antiquity was using water clocks instead of hourglasses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe you can get a measurable effect by starting off with two identical hourglasses (using a stopwatch to make sure they have the same duration) and tying one to the &quot;seconds&quot; hand of a clock and leaving it there for a month or two. That would ensure sand is running through it 24/7, which <em>may</em> be enough to shave off half a second or so. Either way, it'd be a neat little experiment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact. In the navy there is a saying to &quot;warm the bell&quot; meaning basically do something, or show up too early.</p>
<p>In the olden days sailors would ring a bell every half-hour (or every flip of the hourglass) to mark the time.</p>
<p>Sailors, usually at night, would often keep the hourglass in their coats or hands to warm it up, with the thinking that it would expand the glass throat and make the sand flow faster, bringing their watch to an early end.</p></div>		</li>
