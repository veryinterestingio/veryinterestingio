			<div class="markdown"><p>Ejaculation would necessarily stop at the cervix anyway. Without a miracle of alignment taking place, vaginal acidity, flowback, cervical mucus, and dead-ends in the cervical tissue will stop much of the ejaculate. Only about 1% of the total ejaculate is going to enter the uterus. That 1% will then have to do battle with the immune system of the body they are invading.</p>
<p>Rejoice, it is miraculous that we can conceive at all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Way back the Discovery Channel had an awesome documentary called <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1461416/" target="_blank">&quot;The Great Sperm Race&quot;</a> that visualized the individual sperms as people going through a horrible series of human-scale challenges to get to the egg. </p>
<p>First part was a huge valley with millions of people in white suits running and racing each other. Later there were stairs and ladders and being chased and murdered by her immune system, dead sperm falling everywhere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With 250 million competitors, it is the most extreme race on earth and there can only be one winner. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a really good educational video game where you played as a sperm from just after ejaculation up to conception. The cervix was by far the most frightening/difficult part.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another question I've always had, do the quality of the genes in a sperm cell affect its ability to &quot;win&quot;--that is, does a &quot;strong&quot; sperm create better offspring? Or is the winning sperm just as likely to contain genetic defects?</p>
<p>Or is it purely a matter of luck and the sperms' strength/skills don't matter at all?</p></div>		</li>
