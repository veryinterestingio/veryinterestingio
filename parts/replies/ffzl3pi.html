			<div class="markdown"><p>When cleaning your own ears the risk for your ear drum is pretty low. It always sounds as if people can hit the ear drum just like that without even noticing.</p>
<p>While cleaning the outer end of the ear canal feels good, the bony end hurts like hell when you scrape against it. People don't voluntarily stick a cotton swab that far in. Now, stumbling around, or hitting your arm on something while cleaning your ears can be enough of a jostle to ram it further in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not true for most people, in fact that is only true for people who already have ear problems to start with.   Using qtips is perfectly fine for most people..the ONLY reason people started saying don't do it is because of a lawsuit for damage to eardrum..zero to do with earwax.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My parents would clean our ears by pouring in some peroxide and letting it fizz for a minute before laying us on the other side to drain and wipe clean and repeat. </p>
<p>In my teens I would do the same, probably not as often as I needed to but then once a year or so I would be going about my day and then suddenly lose hearing in one ear. Totally blocked and would go to a ENT to have water sprayed in to loosen the blockage. Really gross. </p>
<p>As an adult I know I am not supposed to put anything bigger than my elbow into my ear but I use qtips daily. Insert into open space, swab in a circle and pull out. Never ever ever have blockage or issues for over 20 years now. So, yeah I subscribe to qtips for ear wax control.</p></div>		</li>

They also have a heavy duty system with basically an IV bag you hang on your shower rod to flush your ears after your shower when all the wax is nice and soft. I bought one for my brother and he no longer has to go to the doctor once a year for an extraction so he can hear again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try to avoid using earplugs that go into your ear canal (inconvenient, I know) or anything really that goes in there, including swabs. Also see your doctor a couple times a year to get them cleaned. I go every 3-4 months so my ears don't get clogged. (Every ear specialist I've ever seen has strongly recommended staying away from swabs) Luckily it's free where I live. If you have to pay for your appointment, I understand this might not be an option...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have allergies? Sometimes this has influence on how much wax is produced. Also some people just make a lot of ear wax.</p>
<p>Yours is kind of a special case. Use your q-tips. Have your doctor show you how to pull the ear in order to straighten out the ear canal. Once you know some anatomy and technique itâ€™s not a particularly dangerous thing to do.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>So, I use earplugs pretty much only at shooting ranges. I don't go often, maybe four times a year. </p>
<p>I went to one of those indoor skydive places awhile back and while we're putting on the squirrel suits, the guy hands us all ear plugs and says &quot;here's how you insert them. Put your opposite arm behind your head (right arm, left ear) and pull your ear back. They'll go right in properly&quot;. </p>
<p>Holy shit, mind blown. I've never even thought to try this with qtips though. I'd probably puncture my brain.</p></div>		</li>
