			<div class="markdown"><p>This isnt correct... 40% of people with peanut allergies are allergic to tree nuts as well. Its not just from cross contamination. The proteins in peanuts and tree nuts are similar in structure and that is what people have a reaction to. You arent more likely to be allergic to other legumes if you have a peanut allergy. At least not anymore than any other allergy (people with one food allergy are more likely to have another regardless of the type) </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, I test positive for both tree nut and peanut allergy despite not actually being allergic.  It has something to do with an antibody I naturally produce in levels similar to those with the allergy.  And if I recall correctly, it was the same antibody that caused both false positives.</p>
<p>My memory on this is a bit fuzz, it's been over 10 years since the test</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've often asked myself if the human brain takes part in allergic reactions. The reason why I suspect it is that I have allergy against dust and I sometimes just have to think about cleaning something dusty like a vacuum cleaner and my body reacts with typical symptoms.</p>
<p>This would explain why two unrelated species are responsible for allergic reactions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really interesting. I wonder if that means you're more likely to become allergic later on in life or what exactly causes you to have those antibodies but not be allergic</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting. The main cause of peanut allegies are due to lack of early exposure as a baby/child. Maybe it's a two factor thing, where you need both the anti-bodies and lack of exposure or something like that. </p>
