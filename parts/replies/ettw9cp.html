			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait so does that mean that if you placed certain birds by, say, a speaker playing a death metal album, they could potentially mimic all those sounds too?  And since they can make more than one sound at once with their cords, they could actually mimic instrumentals and vocals simultaneously?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the Lyrebird for example is known to mimic such things as chainsaws, rifle shots, crying babies, mobile ring tones, etc.</p>
<p>Music might be too high definition for them to reproduce, but I'm sure they could get an adequate sample if they were exposed to it properly if they can do ringtones.</p></div>		</li>
