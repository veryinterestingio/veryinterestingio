<p>Bottom line, if you eat a healthy diet, getting a shot of B12 won't do as much, if anything. There are some other stimulants in energy drinks, typically they work similar to caffeine - and in some cases simulate the same responses in the body.</p>
<p>Everything in these drinks has a ceiling dose. Sugar too. That's why they are legal. Illegal drugs do not. Contrary to people who claim caffeine would be banned if it was discovered today, it wouldn't. Caffeine has a ceiling dose. Cocaine and methamphetamine do not.</p></div>		</li>
