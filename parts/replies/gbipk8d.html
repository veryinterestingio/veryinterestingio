<p>&quot;The smell hasn't changed in a while, so it isn't interesting anymore.&quot; —your nose</p>
<p>Eyes are kind of the same way. You are constantly shifting your view, mostly unconsciously, in order to maintain vision. When you choose to stare at a fixed point, you notice an afterimage gets stuck for a while. The light-sensitive chemicals your eyes need to see need to be replenished, like paper in the copy machine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not like you get used to the smell, but the nose needs a difference on a molecular level to identify a new smell. If nothing changes your nose literally can't understand what is the smell.</p>
<p>Think of it like swimming in a pool with your eyes closed, you can't tell if you are in the right side or the left side because the water is all the same, but you can if one corner is full of jelly and another side is full of floating toys.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if it's along the lines of, we don't sense temperature absolutely, but relatively.. we can feel the difference in temperature.</p>
<p>Same with food? We taste the difference? So when the food stuff lingers in the mouth, the difference is less pronounced.</p></div>		</li>
