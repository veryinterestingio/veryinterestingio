			<div class="markdown"><p>If you click the link then click the See Also link, you'll find a better explanation. My situation is similar to OP's but instead of a fall and sudden wake up, it's like an explosion of sound that wakes me up right before falling asleep. Sometimes it's a sound like Intense bones cracking or someone laughing right by your ear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A theory for why it happens is as parts of our brain “shut down” for the night, the part that controls balance shuts down too early. We don’t need balance when we sleep, but since it shuts down early our mind interprets it as falling. The jerk is simply our body trying to catch itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another theory is that it's a throwback reflex to when our primate ancestors lived on trees. They slept on trees and the reflex would jerk them awake if they were about to fall.</p></div>		</li>
