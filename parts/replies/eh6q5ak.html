			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you put that into the context of the question?  </p>
<p>Pro athletes that do a lot of cardio are probably quite healthy and probably have a lower resting heart rate due to the cardio right?  </p>
<p>That in no way indicates their heart is healthy?  </p>
<p>And someone who does no cardio may have just as healthy a heart by lifting?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Good health <em>usually</em> leads to a low heart rate, but a low heart rate doesn't always indicate good health. There's a statistical correlation when looking at large groups of people, but when looking at an individual you need more information to say anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So to sum up: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The initial assertions are incorrect, pro athletes who do cardio don't have lower resting heart rates. </p>
</li>
<li>For a given person having a lower resting heart rate doesn't mean you have better cardiac health.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for the info!</p></div>		</li>
