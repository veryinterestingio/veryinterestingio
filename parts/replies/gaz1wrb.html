You can't see the physical stadium at all you can only infer it's boundary from where the tall people are sitting. Past a certain point you can't see any tall people even if they are there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because we do not have a good vantage point. It is more like being surrounded by a huge crowd. You can only see people close by.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that’s not entirely true. We actually have a pretty decent vantage point, but not ideal. We can see about 2/3 of our host galaxy. The other 3rd is mostly blocked by the galactic center and the demolition derby happening there. We can get glimpses through to the other side, but it’s still very difficult to map, let alone study anything hiding behind it. </p>
<p>However, there have been recent studies that have been able to draw up a pretty accurate map of our galaxy and image it from an outside observers perspective. In another comment, I go into more detail and explain a few other things those studies have found. I believe it was Veritasium that did the video I’m referencing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Less surrounded by a huge crowd and more having a huge crowd largely right in front of us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more, we are standing in a supermarket isle, one of the edge ones, and we can see a window towards another supermarket and garage. We see similarities to what we can observe (isles), and differences to the garage (petrol stops). Except multiply that by a lot. We see many galaxies and they come in a set number of shapes. We see similarities to only the spiral galaxy, so we can deduce we are a spiral galaxy from that.</p></div>		</li>
