			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally yeah. A lot of early work on vaccines was looking at the spike proteins on covid19, because they're what attach to your tissue cells in order to infect it, like a puzzle piece from a different puzzle that fits really well. Immune cells will bond to those spike proteins (if they've identified them) so they can no longer attach to cells they want to infect. Vaccines would teach your immune cells the shape they need, in that they'd basically teach cells to show it, signaling to your immune system &quot;hey this puzzle piece doesn't belong here you need to figure out how to bind to this shape&quot; before you have an actual infection.</p>
<p>That's why earlier in the year you may have seen headlines that they isolated and mapped the spike proteins, and there was excitement that they appeared stable. It means they didn't think that part of the virus that the immune system would need to remember mutates a lot: it wouldn't change and become a different puzzle piece shape (like HIV, for example, which is one of the reasons why it's so hard to vaccinate).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe these vaccines are targeting the <a href="https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20200314_FBD001.jpg" target="_blank">spike protein</a>. Basically training some of the bodies cells to manufacture a bunch of those spikes. Immune system develops a response to the spikes, and then if they see the entire virus in the future, they'll attack the spikes and kill the rest of the virus along with it.</p></div>		</li>
