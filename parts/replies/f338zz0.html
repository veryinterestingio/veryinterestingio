			<div class="markdown"><p>Protip:</p>
<p>To eliminate this type of jam, try to go at a speed where you never have to use the brakes. It's ok to have a large gap in front of you, but dont speed up to catch the other car u til you're sure you're out of the jam.</p>
<p>It's easier on you, easier on your car, and better for mileage. And it helps out everyone behind you as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tell that to the sweaty anus that decides my following distance ought to be filled with their shitbox, then tailgates the person in front of them and slams on the brakes far harder than necessary when they finally notice the person in front of them slowing down, because they weren't paying the least bit of attention, so I have to stop hard as well, and then the whole thing starts all over again.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only issue is that cars from your right or left will merge into your lane if they see that much space being created. Then you're forced to break anyways, causing the same thing to happen anyways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is entirely impossible when there are multiple lanes. People who seem to think they will move faster by changing lanes as soon as there is any space at all will fill up that space almost before it exists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>gas and brake drivers and tailgaters cause literally all the traffic. if you leave enough room between you and the car in front of you to where if they slow down you don't have to brake not to hit them you make life so much better for those behind you.</p>
<p>otherwise you brake, the person behind you brakes, the person behind them, and on and on and all the lost time accumulates.</p>
<p>traffic is very much like a wave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I taught my kids - that unless the traffic is really slowing or stopping, you should NEVER touch your brake on the highway, this includes exiting (until clearly in the exit lane), merging, changing lanes - etc..  With a proper gap, you can just let off the gas and slow to match most normal conditions.  Disrupting traffic flow is a sin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife thinks I take my role in traffic too seriously. I just understand that one dumb fuck up can affect hundred and even thousands of people's days with real economic costs (late to work, an actual accident, poor fuel economy) and detrimental environmental impacts (poor fuel economy again). So if I drive well and avoid/limit my interactions with bad drivers, I make the world a better place.</p>
<p>So yes, sometimes I have to drive 80mph to put distance between me and the guy texting/swerving at 75mph. But it's for the greater good. The greater good!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, if you assume a safety distance of 3 cars length between you and the car in front, that is enough for a car to merge, let go of the gas, and get that safety distance back.</p>
<p>Cars will always merge to your lane. Safe or less safer. The best thing you can do is to control the environment for others to merge.</p>
<p>The bad thing if you do this, everyone will get in front of you, only if others don't do it too.</p></div>		</li>
