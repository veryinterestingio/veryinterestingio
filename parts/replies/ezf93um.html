<p>Itâ€™s hard to image that happening in a vehicle, but but if you could make it do it, it would feel similar.</p></div>		</li>

<p>edit: another thing to think about is if you didn't actually stop at 0mph and started going backward.. you would never feel that lurch since your acceleration wouldn't stop.</p>

<p>My favourite answer so far, but please could you elaborate on this part?</p>
<p>How would you not feel a lurch in a car that is travelling forwards, decelerating, and then continues moving in the opposite direction?</p>
<p>If a car is reversing and suddenly the driver starts accelerating forwards the car would at some point hit 0mph and then start travelling forward and the driver would feel a strong lurch? Is this not the same concept but in reverse?</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is precisely the same situation and the only lurch you'd feel in either case (assuming constant acceleration) is when the acceleration begins, not when you cross 0 velocity. Velocity is no more perceptible than position is. When you drive East, you cannot feel an increasing sense of Eastness. Neither can you sense your velocity, excepting what you can infer from eg sound or vision. You can, however, feel acceleration because acceleration implies that there is a net force acting on you and you can feel yourself pressed back into your seat (or in whatever direction, depending on the direction of the acceleration.)</p></div>		</li>
