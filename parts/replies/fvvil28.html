			<div class="markdown"><p>In the cases you mentioned it's used to open up the tube that connects the inner ear to your nose/mouth/sinuses. Because that channel is normally sealed the pressure inside the inner ear cannot rise if the outside pressure rises (e.g. under water). That's why you need to open it up once under water and you're good until you dive deeper. If you go back up the pressure inside your inner ear will be higher then the outside pressure but that's not such s big deal because the tube inside your ear can open by itself if the pressure inside is high.</p>
<p>Now if we have snot and other junk in our sinuses we can get relief by increasing the pressure. Sometimes it makes it even worse though. Instead of 'pushing' while you close off your nose you can also &quot;suck&quot; air in and decrease the pressure inside your sinuses. This can sometimes help too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That and after so much time, you learn to increase/equalize the ear pressure without holding your nose or just shifting your jaw and increasing/equalizing the pressure there in a certain way. </p>

<p>Learned to do this when I was REALLY young as mine is an aviation family, so I went flying quite frequently - and my grandparents watched me a lot during the summer and after school, so we'd go up a ton, and then when I was working on my PPL my uncle explained in detail what the &quot;maneuver&quot; was called and a few different ways to go about it while still paying attention to everything going on if I had to do it whilst in the pattern or while talking with the tower/ATC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, I've found that it works best if I do the &quot;yawn&quot; and then shift my jaw forward a bit, then if they're still not equalized, shift away from the still-&quot;plugged&quot; ear and do another little &quot;yawn&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
