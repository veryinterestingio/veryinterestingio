			<div class="markdown"><p>Japanese bonsai is typically trying to make a tree appear to always be perfectly sculpted young tree with a very specific set of rules where a branch can or cannot be etc. </p>
<p>The more modern western bonsai is more about making a natural looking tree. You imagine the snow weight in winter and what it will cause branches to do, or cold winds from one constant direction then try to turn that into miniature. I personally prefer the modern style. Less rules, less &quot;sculptures&quot;, more &quot;that awesome tree I saw&quot;.  If you Google some pictures the difference is pretty noticeable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much for your comment, the idea of mimicking winds and snow fall is very cool. I haven’t researched bonsai at all really, just a little to get the basics and I’ll figure the rest out on my own. So hearing that that inspires me to try more things in the future. I’ve seen some amazing bonsai online like you said, I’d love to create something as beautiful as those ones. (I know anything is possible) </p>
<p>I’m from Australia, so I’ve been thinking of creating some bonsai by using Australian native plants, already have a banksia I’m planning to shape. Quite exciting!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the right way to start, native trees are far easier to keep healthy if you don't have climate control greenhouses. First comes keeping it alive, if you can't pull that off all the work goes on the burn pile. Then you slowly start progressing toward the tree that's in your head (while not killing it in the process). It might take 5 years to get close and by then you'll know far more and question your original styling decisions or why you ever dug that gangly thing up in the first place.</p>
<p>Most people can't stop with one tree though so the disappointment is lighter. Oh and don't try to grow them indoors very few trees are ok-ish with it.</p></div>		</li>
