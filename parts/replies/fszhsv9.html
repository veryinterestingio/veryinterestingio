There's a lot of cases in the 70's, 80's and 90's where the original &quot;studio&quot; version of an album had tracks that were originally recorded by the studio artists and/or individuals who wrote the original, and not the actual band. The band is simply covering the songs at that point, which is why they always sounded different live.</p>
<p>This is around the same time that &quot;modern&quot; music replication became a thing. Often it has nothing to do with the methods (aka an LP does <em>not</em> have better sound reproduction than a digital copy) and more to do with the quality of the reproduction and distribution. (aka they had to reduce the sound quality on the digital copies to fit the entire album on a single CD).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oh man if you said that on other subreddits you'd be downvoted to hell.  You'd still be <em>right</em> though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is nonsense. You can't fit more onto a standard audio CD by varying the quality- the spec is fixed at 16-bits / 44.1 kHz, uncompressed, and can't be altered.</p>
<p>That in turn means a fixed bitrate, and therefore a minute of CD audio will always take up the same amount of space, limiting the maximum recording time to 80 minutes regardless (on a 700MB CD).</p>
<p>Some CDs may sound better than others, but that's down to the quality of the mastering. Horrible-sounding, badly-mastered CD audio takes up just as much space as the best.</p>
<p>Perhaps you're confusing CD with later sound formats like MP3 that allow variable levels of compression and different sample rates. DVD video is also compressed- you can squeeze an almost arbitrary amount of video on a single disc (though below a certain point the quality is going to get unwatchably horrible).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Curious where you got that info regarding the Stop Making Sense audio being Pre-recorded studio recordings. Itâ€™s one of my favorites, and I have never heard that. Maybe I need to rewatch with that in mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this what happened with David Bowie's Live at Nassau Coliseum? I noticed it got released in 2010 and frankly sounds better than Bowie's studio stuff from the same era. Or any of his other stuff, honestly.</p></div>		</li>
