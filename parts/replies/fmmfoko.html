			<div class="markdown"><p>While the video is a good example of modeling without knowing the underlying process, arguing that the golden ratio is the most irrational number there is, is just nonsense. In the definition of an irrational number there is nothing that would allow one to say a number is more or less irrational. In the video he arbitrarily uses a continued fraction version of a number to state that one number is more irrational than another, even suggesting that the square root of 2 is more irrational than pi. Alternatively, one could claim that transcendental irrational numbers are more irrational than algebraic irrational numbers, but that too would be a specious claim. </p>
<p>Much of the magic in the golden ratio comes from being a solution to x^2=x+1. Relating a squaring or multiplicative process to adding 1. But understanding that takes a lot of time thinking about recursive and iterative processes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought a numbers degree of irrationality was understood to be how often a particular series of numbers occurs in its infinite sequence? Eg, 0.xxx(...)23, where the 23 repeats forever is less irrational than pi. It seems like a real niche thing to want to describe about a number, but mathematicians are pretty weird like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think it means that it's the furthest away from a rational approximation, like how pi is nearly 22/7.</p></div>		</li>
