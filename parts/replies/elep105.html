			<div class="markdown"><p>Although &quot;enough random localised matter&quot; is how star systems are formed, the only difference being that a single planet would require less - would that not be more probable rather than less?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Much less plausible, just due to how stellar nurseries work. It's not implausible to have large amounts of floating material hanging out where former star ejected matter, and then have them coalesce into a solar system.  The idea that something like that can happen on a much smaller scale (and we really have to appreciate how much smaller a planet like Earth is compared to a star, 98.7% of all of the mass in the Solar System is the Sun) would mean a very precise localization of matter that probably would very rarely happen, if it would happen at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My impression is that &quot;less&quot; matter won't do much of anything and that star formation is a bit of an all-or-nothing sort of deal due to how weak gravity is. There isn't a strong enough attraction for a &quot;little&quot; bit of matter randomly in space to interact much, but once you get enough you eventually coalesce into a star, though there may not be quite enough heat/mass for a fusion to start so I guess you could get a big lump of failed-star mass that you could call a planet but I think there's another word for that.<br />
From perusing wikipedia I think these are called Brown Dwarfs.  </p>
<p>So you wouldn't find planets like the inner planets or asteroids forming in the middle of space/nebulae because they're too small and are generally the side effect of stellar formation. But you could find planets like the gas giants forming out of nebulae, though again probably at minimum many times the mass of any of the ones in our solar system, and they'd be called Brown Dwarfs. At least that's what I've gathered form skimming some wiki articles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is too simplistic of a view. To form a planet the gas pressure needs to be less than the gravitational attraction of the self gravitating cloud. You can not ignore pressure when it comes to these things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More probable now as there are more metallic elements in the universe. Higher metallicity -&gt; higher planet formation rates -&gt; more flops</p>
<p>edit -  just realised you mean formation on their own. No it is still very unlikely due to the criteria for Jeans instability</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be more probable now than in the early universe because the matter has become more stratified.  The early universe was so homogeneous that even galaxies took a while to arrive on the scene, let alone planets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not correct. Rogue planets have been ejected from a star system due to exchanges of angular momentum within a (normally young) system.</p></div>		</li>
