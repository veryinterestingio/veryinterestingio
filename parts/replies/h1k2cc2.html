			<div class="markdown"><p>Only to snap out of it and realize you have been staring at someone the entire time and are now getting the stink eye from.</p>
<p>I've done that before while working, pushing a uboat full of product around, while physically exhausted I just kind of retreated into daydream space as I walked. A worker at the store asked me if I wanted her to get the girls number I had been staring at. Which immediately snapped me out of lala land and embarrassed the crap out of me. Like no thanks I literally didn't see the person in question until you said something.</p></div>		</li>

I still cringe at the thought of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man this hits home. I've always done that unfocused eyes accidental staring thing but two incidents in particular stuck with me.</p>
<p>1) I was in fifth grade bored during a lecture. Started daydreaming. Didn't realize I'd been staring at this girl in my class for like five minutes, only realized when she gave me a weird look.</p>
<p>2) I went to some friends house for dinner. They were a married couple. We're all in the kitchen talking. They start talking about something so I started daydreaming. Didn't realize I was staring at the wife's chest until she put on a larger shirt. Ugh. I'm still embarrassed about that one.</p></div>		</li>

My eyesight was just good enough to get by before that, but now I realize how much I struggled before I got glasses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Based on this comment and your profile pic, I assume you’re a woman? I mention it because I was noticing as I read through all of the other anecdotes that they’re almost all about staring at a girl, which struck me as a ... weird coincidence. It appears this is at least something that doesn’t just afflict guys.</p></div>		</li>
