<p>Not only can IgG neutralize the virus by preventing it from binding the receptor, it can also activate complement, aid in opsonization, and interact with a number of FcRs which can modulate both the innate and adaptive immune response as well</p>

<p>Very well said!</p>
<p>IgG passive antibody transfer has a long history. IgG, unlike IgA, circulates in human blood (in the plasma fraction). It is relatively easy to isolate plasma containing IgG from one convalescent individual. However, as IgA is primarily found in the respiratory and digestive tracts, it would be difficult (impossible?) to perform meaningful IgA passive antibody transfer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK, but what does this have to to with my question? Apologies for being blunt, but this have not addressed any of my questions asked. (To be fair, neither did the other responses.)</p>
<p>The thing is I am not asking an undergrad immunology question; I thought I could get more information from colleagues who know more about lung mucosal immunology than I do.</p></div>		</li>
