			<div class="markdown"><p>A bee stinger get stuck in us because it has a barb on it.  Wasp stingers on the other hand dont have a barb which is why they can remove it and sting multiple times.  When a bee stings you and flies off the stinger and some of its guts are still stuck in you because of the barb.  This also kills the bee.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is wrong, or at least incomplete. Generally speaking insects attach to objects using some combination of surface tension from their excretions and van der Waals forces. Physically grappling surfaces is much less reliable and less efficient for creatures that size than using adhesive organs on their feet.</p>
<p>My source is that I spent several years getting a Ph.D developing bio-inspired dry adhesives, and had to read and publish many papers discussing exactly this topic for a wide variety of insects and small animals.</p></div>		</li>
