			<div class="markdown"><p>I lived in apartment next to the freeway it was horrible loud. Couldn’t never open the window also because of debris flying into our apartment.</p>
<p>Anyways, the loudest sounds I remember were 18 wheeler trucks. Stopping and going. Their breaks and engine sounds are insane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Engine brakes (jake brakes) are absolutely the loudest thing on a freeway if the city doesn't ban them.  I lived over I5 in Seattle and the traffic created a low-grade rumble/hum at all times, which you could get used to, but the goddamn jake brakes would sound like a missile had been fired.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately in the grand scheme, jake brakes are better for the environment and roadways and create less dust.  So it's a mixed bag, banning them everywhere isn't the answer.  But where there are thousands of people trying to sleep, yeah.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol, &quot;ban them.&quot;  They're technically banned in the city limits where I live, but the drivers don't care one little bit.  3AM?  Sweet, great time to hit it right in front of this row of houses.  When I finally moved, being out of ear-shot of a main road was a requirement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>on the off chance you happen to be an expert on big rig braking systems, what do engine brakes actually do and why do they make that noise? also curious about application, why would a driver make a decision to use one brake instead of the other in any given situation?</p></div>		</li>
