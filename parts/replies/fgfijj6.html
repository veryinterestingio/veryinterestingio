			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely, this happens a lot, there’s a reason why in SPELD testing looks at multiple areas, my partner and my step-son both suffer from dyslexia and Dysgraphia (as well as ADHD something which occurs rather frequently ). My step son in particular has learnt how to compensate exceptionally well recently, and my partner is a excellent literacy writer. It’s amazing how we can overcome/mitigate things (and so often people aren’t aware of all the advantages that come with dyslexia either)</p></div>		</li>
