<p>Chronobiologist here. New account as I have been a lurker but felt compelled to make this one to dispel the totally wrong answer below.
Circadian rhythms are actually generated by endogenous mechanisms that do NOT require input to exist: that’s a definition of a circadian rhythm. Think cell cycle.
In mammals there is a genetic circuit that is made up of transcription factors. Two of them (CLOCK and BMAL1) activate expression of their own repressors (CRY1,2 and PER1, and 2), which create cycles in activation and repression. Anyone telling you that input or hormones dictate circadian rhythms is wrong. It’s the other way around, if we get to the very basic mechanisms. What light does is reset the clock (I can explain if you wish but it has to do with differences in the intrinsic period of the clock not being exactly 24 hours: circa (about) diem (day) - about a day)
To answer your question, chronotype (owls and larks) is genetically determined so no, you would not become a lark or an owl. There may be a difference in how quickly you’d  adapt to the new schedule depending on whether you are advancing or delaying.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different person than op but provided I understand your question correctly no, subjective time experience has no bearing on circadian time. The pace of the clock is determined by protein accumulation in what is known as a transcription-translation feedback loop. To put it simply, protein 1 stops its own production so that when a lot of protein 1 builds up it stops being made. The protein of course degrades so the cycle can start again. That cycle takes a certain amount of time which forms the biological circadian rhythm. To date only genetic manipulations have been able to change the clock in an appreciable way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cycles like these are called exotic cycles and they do funky things, some depending on the species. Really short cycles like this (you’re talking 6h:6hLD) can result in desynchronization of internal clocks in the scn and other regions it enervates and lead to things like separation of activity into two components, the clock just not able to entrain (there’s a limit to how much you can push the clock) so that you start seeing behavior normally seen on one phase drifting into another (eg a nocturnal species starting activity on the first dark phase which continues into the first light phase instead of stopping).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's funny someone asked this as I was just looking at a poster about this at my university earlier today, the fact that the circadiem clock is actually ~26 hours was surprising! It had mentioned something about bursts of light at just the wrong time can throw off the mechanisms that lead to &quot;sleepy time&quot; by two hours. I'm about to finish my bs in molecular bio/cell bio/ biochem, I'd love it if you could provide some more detailed information on how light is involved, specifically blue light (if at all, would it be considered an input and not have any impact at all?).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the human clock is 24.5 (which is why it’s easier to entrain to a delay than an advance in sunrise). Mice have one ~23.5.
in mammals, there is a specialized receptor called melanopsin (Opn4) which is a GPCR that uses a chromophore to absorb light. That chromophore absorbs light maximally in the blue range. When light excites the chromophore that triggers a signaling cascade that feeds into the molecular clock. Other wavelengths can affect it, but maximal absorption is if I recall is 470sh. A far enough red won’t impact it, which is why doing stuff under dim red light is a-ok when having to do things under DD.<br />
Light’s a zeitgeber and it does impact the clock. Not making it tick, but an input impacts the mechanism.<br />
There’s another effect light has that’s called masking that’s not clock dependent: light will suppress mice activity on its own (in mutant mice, eg) so in that way you could impose activity cycles but they would go away under constant conditions.  </p>
<p>I should at this moment point out that the circadian field is enormous, with hardcore neuroscience areas (of which photoreceptors, SCN function and it’s interplay with other brain regions etc belong).  While versed in this subsection to some extent (based on my career trajectory), my sauce is the molecular mechanisms of the circuitry that underlies the basic clock mechanism (which itself gets pretty complex), and how these are shared metabolic mechanisms, and certain other kinds of diseases.</p></div>		</li>
