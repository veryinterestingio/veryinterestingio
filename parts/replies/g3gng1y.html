			<div class="markdown"><p>Was looking for this comment. Everyone was talking about the design of the anchor to drag across the sea floor but on my ship, we were always taught the chain does all of the work. My ship was nearly double 50,000 tons. To add, when the anchor is no longer touching the sea floor, it's aweigh. Anchors Aweigh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The nice answer is that the OP was talking about a 50,000 tonne ship in the first place, so the comment above was referencing that in relative terms.<br />
(I prefer the funny answers though.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The correct answer is: I was referencing the OP. But, my ships tonnage varied based on what we were carrying on board anyways. It was at least nearly double 50,000, most of the time. That's a number available on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Aye, It be a bad omen to let loose from your lips the real tonnage of your vessel. Any ol' salt will tell ye that Davy Jones is always a listenin', lookin for an excuse to drag you down to his locker. Only those mariners who have sworn an oath to King Neptune have the privy to know what weighs on His kingdom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On really big ships the shape and function of the anchor is mostly ornamental.  Its main purpose is a counter weight to pull the very heavy chain up from the chain locker.  My experience is an aircraft carrier.  The anchor weighs about 30 tons to pull the links.  Each link weighs about 200 pounds.</p></div>		</li>
