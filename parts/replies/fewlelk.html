			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people answering the question about how the brain gets damaged, but nobody is explaining how the loss of consciousness occurs. </p>
<p>There's a part of your brain called the reticular activating system that is basically acts as the hub for a bunch of critical regions of the brain, one of them being awake. Usually with brain trauma the reticular activating system is one of the most sensitive to any sort of damage. As long as the reticular activating system isn't permanently damaged (due to hemorrhage or herniation) , it recovers relatively quickly and you regain consciousness.</p></div>		</li>
