			<div class="markdown"><p>Tobacco has a similar effect. Found out when I was 28 that my until then undiagnosed ADHD was the likely culprit of my very long term nicotine addiction, since I was essentially self medicating with it. As soon as I started taking adderall, I never felt the need for nicotine, and my caffeine use dropped dramatically as well. The body be crazy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This comment has made me genuinely interested in what your description of the opposite of ADHD would be, since it can vary a lot between people. I'm imagining you as the complete opposite of myself.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My wife’s side of the family has prevalent ADHD so I know well, what it is. </p>
</li>
<li>My capacity for focus, attention to detail, seeing it through, finishing what I started, stick to itiveness, etc., piss most people off around me and I’ve had to learn that when it’s something solo, I can let it rip, but when cooking Beef Wellington with the wife, sometimes it’s best to look the other way when a mistake is clearly coming if we keep on this current trajectory.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, stimulants still have the same effect on the body whether you have ADHD or not - including boosted dopamine levels. The result is different because it boosts ADHD brains to normal levels of dopamine, and non-ADHD brains to <em>above</em> normal levels (causing anxiety/agitation if too high). This can lead to strange situations such as the ADHD mind being totally calm but the body going haywire because it's still experiencing the increased heart rate, sweating, lack of appetite, etc.</p>
<p>More anecdotally: I rarely drink coffee because by the time the physical stimulant effects wear off enough for me to stop feeling nauseated, the energy/focus boost are also gone so there is no net benefit from it. My medication is extended release so even if the initial side-effects are bad, I'll have the rest of the day with a better brain chemical balance.</p></div>		</li>
