			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh the good ol' days when a sociopath throws a kid in the river knowing full well that he can't swim and the kid is just super happy afterwards and didn't experience any trauma at all and it definitely won't manifest as an adult in the form of crippling alcoholism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adults are such a mess when it comes to kids and water. On the one hand, you have the parent who telegraphs extreme anxiety to their children if they venture out even a little. On the other, you have the one that will throw a screaming child into the deep end.</p>
<p>I did fine in the water once I got away from my adults. I had family friends dunking me against my will on one side, and my <em>mother</em>, who I think would have preferred I never accomplish anything over her having to face even the smallest amount of anxiety (and tbh, she largely got her wish). But once I was just in a pool with peers, I overcame my crippling fear of the water and learned pretty quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the “old way” for teaching how to swim is just to drop someone in the deep and let them figure it out themselves. This is what I heard from my father, uncles and all older generation people on how they learned to someone.</p></div>		</li>
