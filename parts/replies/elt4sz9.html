			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, each atom has an x% chance of decaying during some given time interval. Let's say that an atom of some radioactive element, let's call it Examplium, has a 10% chance of decaying in any given hour. This means if you start with 100kg block of it, and wait an hour, then you can expect that 10% of it will have decayed. You now have 90kg of Examplium. </p>
<p>But atoms don't have a memory, and don't know how many of them are in the block. I could have easily said that there was only 20g of it, and that 2g decayed. This means that in the next hour, you can expect that 10% of your Examplium will decay. Since you have 90kg of it, then 9kg will decay, leaving you with 81kg, then 72.9kg, then 65.61kg, and so on. </p>
<p>You can see that this is just a=b*0.9^t , which is exponential. With a little algebra, we can figure out that Examplium has a half life of about 6.57 hours.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>So even though it's statistically improbable by many many orders of magnitude, it is <em>possible</em> an entire chunk of Examplium could decay all at once, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding the chance to decay, is it something like an inherent instability that might manifest - or a probability that a neutron will show up and cause the decay - other possibilities/methods of decay?</p>
<p>Is half life a measurement at 'standard temperature and pressure'? Can environment be a significant factor to decay rates? Excluding purpose built environments like an atomic bomb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We describe these processes in term of the probabilities of them happening because one can’t calculate a point in time when the material will break down. Radioactivity doesn’t work that way, so instead we describe it using things like Poisson statistics or quantum mechanics calculation (which are really just probability with physics principles).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because decay is a random process. If the half life is 1 year, than any given particle has a 50% chance of decaying within the first year. If it survives the first year, it has a 50% chance of decaying within the next year. The particle doesn't &quot;know&quot; how old it is so strong any given time it has a 50% chance of decaying within the next year. This chance of decaying is constant over time. So now imagine having a large number of particles. Based on the probability, we expect about half of them to decay in the first year, about half of the remaining particles in the second year, etc. If you graph this out you can see it fits an exponential curve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now I'm confused. IF you have e.g. 100 particles that have 50% chance of decaying in 1 year. Lets say you lose 50 in first year. So you have 50 left. Now why in second year you do not lose the remaining 50. They are now in their second year, shouldn't they all decay now? Why does it reset the counter?</p></div>		</li>
