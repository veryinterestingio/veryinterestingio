			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally anything over 60 (an average resting heart rate) will give you a bit of an energy boost. Anything below that will chill you out (reggae tends towards lower BPMs, for instance).</p>
<p>A lot of songwriting is tweaking BPMs when you perform. A drab trundling mess at 70bpm may turn into a propulsive and lively song when performed at 100. Equally if you slow a pop song down and swap over to a nice foreboding acoustic guitar you can make a fortune in the movie trailer business.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was referring to another post or two I saw covering types of melody patterns to induce different sensations and personal investments that people can associate with certain songs. Figured my original post could be complimentary as a few others hit some key points that I thought covered with more broad strokes than my post.</p></div>		</li>
