<p>As a direct answer to your question, here is a list of chemicals that RJ Reynolds uses in their cigarettes. You can also sort by brand and product for the chemicals. Most are flavorings; ammonium hydroxide (ammonia) is added to make the nicotine compound basic and more readily absorbed by your lungs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why do they add so many different flavorings?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I smoke a roll-your-own tobacco that's tobacco only.  Except for <del>water/moisture</del> dihydrogen monoxide it has zero additives.   I use filter tubes.  It's tastes fine.  Most commercially packed cigarettes taste awful to me now.   No, it's not as addictive as regular pre-packed cigarettes.  I can go several hours if need without feeling desperate for a cigarette.  With regular cigarettes the addiction felt more 'hard core' and I had trouble going more than 20-30 minutes.</p>
<p>edit: chemical name</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add to this that just because a chemical doesn't have a common name, doesn't mean it's dangerous. </p>
<p>Smoking is bad for you, but it would be even with raw tobacco leaves. Most of the chemicals in this list aren't responsible for the cancer-causing effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, people see chemical names and lose their shit (often). I mean, water's technical/chemical name is Dihydrogen monoxide, a over-used joke here on reddit, which surprisingly still a lot fall for.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone, ever that has consumed dihydrogen monoxide has died. Stop this now!&quot; and such.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've just checked out several different tobacco brands additives list using the link to RJ Reynolds additive list in the original post &amp; none of them had any fruit or vegetable extracts in their additives list which makes me think they're added for flavour or (as I heard a Dr say a couple of years ago) that tobbaco companies are starting to put fruit &amp;/or veg compounds in their cigarettes to make smokers see them as more healthy</p></div>		</li>
