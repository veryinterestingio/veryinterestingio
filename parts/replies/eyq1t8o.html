<blockquote>
<p>The Hatter introduced in Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland wears a large top hat with a hatband reading &quot;In this style 10/6&quot;. This is the hat's price tag, indicative of The Hatter's trade, and giving the price in pre-decimal British money as ten shillings and six pence (or half a guinea).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The parent poster is wrong unfortunately, in several ways.</p>
<p>Firstly, / wasn't used as a separator- it was the symbol for shillings. So 1/- would have meant 1 shilling and no pence. &quot;-&quot; was the most common separator. Figures with pounds in would be written £1-2-10, with the smaller symbol usually omitted in the same way as it's not written &quot;$10¢50&quot; or variations thereof.</p>
<p>Secondly, &quot;d&quot; wasn't the symbol for shillings, it was the symbol for pence. &quot;S&quot; was the symbol for shillings (and the / was actually a very very stylised S). &quot;D&quot; was the symbol for pence, and &quot;L&quot; for pounds (£ being a stylised L). This is easy to remember as it was the &quot;LSD&quot; system.</p>
<p>Your question still stands- why those letters? The answer is all three of them are actually the letters for Latin words (it's just a coincidence that shilling also starts with an S). £ is the L in &quot;librae&quot;, S is for &quot;solidi&quot;, and D is for &quot;dinarii&quot;.</p>
<p>Sidenote- it's also common to write pounds as in weight as &quot;lb&quot;. This is an abbreviation of the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Since originally, 1 pound was worth an actual pound (as in 16 ounces) of silver.</p>
<p>The term &quot;pound sterling&quot; is quite literally a pound of sterling silver. It's also why you wouldn't find any 1 pound coins in the middle ages; they'd weigh a pound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wasn't, OP has it slightly off there. It was pence that was denoted as 'd'. Probably dating to something Roman for why it wasn't just 'p'.</p>
<p>£/s/d is what we had here in the UK. The system dates back hundreds of years and was called &quot;LSD&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

Solidi for the middle one
Denarii for pence</p>
<p>If you look carefully, &quot;£&quot; is a really stylised L with a line through it to denote that it's a currency. It's easier to see handwritten, though.</p>
<p>EDIT: Solidi,  not Sestercii.  My b.</p></div>		</li>
