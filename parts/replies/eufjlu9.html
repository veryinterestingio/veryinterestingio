<blockquote>
<p>We found that male alarm calls are composed of an acoustically variable stem, which can be followed by an acoustically invariable suffix. Using long-term observations and predator simulation experiments, we show that suffixation in this species functions to broaden the calls' meaning by transforming a highly specific eagle alarm to a general arboreal disturbance call or by transforming a highly specific leopard alarm call to a general alert call. We concluded that, when referring to specific external events, non-human primates can generate meaningful acoustic variation during call production that is functionally equivalent to suffixation in human language.</p>

<p>Reading words like „suffix“ and „[word] stem“ in the context of animals blew my mind. We underestimate what animals are capable of in regards to syntax and morphology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that this is still communication. Not language.</p>
<p>There's large semantic, pragmatic, and even philosophical reasons for this, but what it comes down to is the range in which communication spans determines if you can consider it language.  </p>
<p>There is a suffix like phenomenon which monkeys use to indicate alarms for different animals, but the key idea here is &quot;alarm&quot;.</p>
<p>I have not read this article in a few years now, but I don't remember the authors even arguing for this to be anything more than communication, but marveling at the complexity found therein.</p></div>		</li>
