			<div class="markdown"><p>To be perfectly honest, it is a bit less interesting than it sounds. One can observe, e.g. from measuring the velocities of distant stars, that the universe is not only expanding, but that the expansion itself is getting faster and faster, i.e. it is accelerating. From general relativity, we think that to drive such an acceleration, we would need some sort of energy as a sort-of source, and we have simply named this energy &quot;dark energy&quot;. We have no real clue what it is though, or where it comes from - scientists are pretty squarely on step one here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's an awesome channel but it is NOT easy to understand. Honnestly I probably understand under than 30% of most of their videos.</p>
<p>... not because they are not well made, but because they are targetted with people who have are knowledgable on the topics.</p></div>		</li>
