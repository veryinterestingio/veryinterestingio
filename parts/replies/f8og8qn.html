<p>If you have 1000 people who will pay £5, 100 who can will pay £10 and 10 who will pay £50 you don't want to sell to them all at any of those price points - you want everyone to pay they max they are willing to.</p>

<p>Ah yes, this is so obvious with the iPhone as well.. 100-200$ price difference for a few GB's of extra storage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work for a company that had some 50% market share for a particular product in the construction market. We were making a good margin on it, too, mostly on the power of the brand and the superior (independently tested) quality.</p>
<p>Now, there were competitors taking the other half of the market by offering lower prices. We could match those prices and increase sales by lowering our margins, but we didn't. If we lowered our prices by 20% it would cut the profits by some 30-40% and that would require near 100% sales volume increase to make up for the lost profits. And doubling sales isn't possible when you already have 50% of the market!</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the explanation for basically 100% of perceived pricing anomalies. This is why competition is essential to drive down prices for consumers, and the CPU market is one where competition happens only during brief overlapping windows which are sometimes decades apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>> This is why competition is essential to drive down prices for consumers</p>
<p>Yes, but it's important to avoid being simplistic (please note: I don't mean you are, just it seems that a lot of people stop with this thought and I want to elaborate to avoid readers doing that).</p>
<p>Competition can certainly stop price gouging. But it comes with a bunch of caveats. Pressure to reduce product quality, misleading advertising, time spent by consumers researching the market, buying quality brands and running down the quality while selling on a premium, outright adulteration of products, market manipulation/collaboration, etc.</p>
<p>Unregulated and unethical competition is bad for everyone. You can choose to regulate the profits (so you don't need strong competition) or you can choose to regulate the competition (truth in advertising, product safety, monopolies+mergers oversight) but you can't have a healthy product space without regulation of some sort.</p>
<p>Analogy: people probably run quicker times in races if they have other people running alongside them, also trying to win. They probably run slower if they have to worry about  those other people trying to trip them up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>lol I was about to say, “no, that’s just a conspiracy!” And then remembered that’s why coach class is so terrible on airplanes, and that we studied it in business school.</p></div>		</li>
