			<div class="markdown"><p>That range is rarely relevant, although you are correct in that it can point to certain  pathologies. If the range gets too narrow, it means your blood is not circulating very well at all, which can lead to lack of oxygen in tissues. This is usually limited to critically ill people. If the range is huge, like 160/60, then likely you have a lot of calcification in your arteries, and their elasticity has decreased significantly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wide pulse pressure (pulse pressure being systolic minus diastolic pressure) like the other user said, is not usually a frequently discussed metric. It can be a predictor of cardiac disease when pulse pressure is high (&gt;40).  I also see it in patients with severe aortic regurgitation, but we don’t run around monitoring it. </p>
<p>I don’t think I’ve been remotely worried about pulse pressure outside of a neurological patient at risk for increased intracranial pressure (widening pulse pressure is 1 of the 3 signs in Cushing’s triad, the other two being low heart rate and irregular respirations).</p></div>		</li>
