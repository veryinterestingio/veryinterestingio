			<div class="markdown"><p>I also work in healthcare, and I rarely get sick, but when I do, itâ€™s intense. Like, knock me on my ass sick. It only happens like once a year if that though. I agree with your suspicions: hand washing and exposure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah.  I recently made the move from a rig to hospital.  I've been sick more this last year than I ever was when I was on a rig.  But this flu season I only wound up with a slight cold.  So I think I may finally be getting my immunity up</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And it doesn't hurt that there are sinks and soap as well as sanitizer dispensers literally everywhere in a hospital, so you never have to put off cleaning your hands. It's way more convenient than trying to wash your hands out in public after touching doorknobs, escalator hand rails, ATM buttons, etc.</p></div>		</li>
