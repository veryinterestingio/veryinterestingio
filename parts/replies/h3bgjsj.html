			<div class="markdown"><p>Legs arent the problem in size, moving blood around and energy/ oxygen requirements are.  Which still exist in large sea animals.  This also ignores pressure acting much like gravity at deeper depths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pressure doesn't act like gravity at any depth. Most of any animal is water, and the water inside it's body will be the same pressure as its surrounding, because that is where it comes from. Deep sea creatures notice the weight of the sea as much as we notice the weight of the atmosphere. (which is to say, ignore it completely)</p>
<p>Land animals have to use more energy moving because they fight against gravity with every step. This means they need more food to move the same distance as a sea animal, which in turn limits their size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sea animals have to fight against the pressure as well, especially those that move through bands of pressure (squids and whales).  And humans certainly notice when we move up and down as well.  Deep sea animals use energy to regulate pressure just as land animals use energy to mitigate gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And yet there are sauropods that exceeded blue whales in length and in mass. It's not like you can't have strong enough legs to get that big on land. </p>
<p>Not needing to fight against gravity is a big reason large marine animals are so much more common than terrestrial ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Again: oxygen and blood flow are far more important.  Figuring out how to pump blood stories into the air and how to get enough food are far more limiting.</p>
<p>That comment is also only true for our era, and wasnt in the dinosaur eras.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Legs are certainly A problem. The main issue is muscle increases in strength linearly with increase in size while volume/weight increases at a cubic rate. You need WAY more muscle to compensate for size increase on land than you do in the water</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a problem that hasn't been conquered already, however.  There are ways to decrease bone mass and be bigger while weighing less without sacrificing much.  It's not something we tend to think about because mammals don't currently, but dinosaurs most definitely did and did very well at &quot;impossible&quot; sizes (for mammals).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Land animals are also affected by oxygen and carbon levels in the atmosphere. That’s why the dinosaurs and some prehistoric mammals were massive. If it was gravity alone they’d all be no bigger than an elephant</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This made literally no logical sense. Between a basketball and a marble, the basketball is the one that’s all surface area as it is hollow. The marble is solid. Not that it really makes the analogy any better though..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didnt explain it great. Tried to make it simple and must have missed the mark. I took it down to avoid confusion. I guess i wrote at a 6 year olds level if you dont understand the entire volume of a basketball is larger than a marble. The fact still stands larger body sizes are more efficient for deep sea creatures due to their surface area to volume ratio. Again that isnt the only reason but it does play a part</p></div>		</li>
