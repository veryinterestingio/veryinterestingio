			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the type of bacteria and the composition of what is being frozen.</p>
<p>Some bacteria have thicker or structurally hardier cell membranes/walls which make them more resistant to freezing than others. Freezing typically damages bacteria because they’re made of water; during freezing, ice crystal formation damages their cell membranes and tears them apart from the inside.</p>
<p>The ice crystals are where composition comes into play. Water freezes at 0C, but say you’re sticking bacon grease in the freezer. At 0C, it will solidify but it won’t form the same crystal structure as water so bacteria would be less likely to get damaged (this would probably preserve them fairly well tbh - in a lab, bacterial cultures are typically stored in glycerol at -80C). </p>
<p>So low temperature isn’t what kills bacteria, it’s the physical/structural damage. That’s why for food purposes, freezing is not a good solution. Freezing does damage some bacteria but a good portion will likely survive and can rapidly multiply and spoil the food upon being warmed back up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best information provided for the topic. </p>
<p>The main takeaway should be that cold can be used to some degree for sterilization, but it’s at a level not readily available to the consumer or consumer markets. And it isn’t nearly as reliable as appropriately cooking, </p>
<p>It is simply not economically feasible to have bulk -80c (or lower) refrigeration along the supply chain from packing facility to grocery store to consumer fridge. It is economically and practically feasible to ask you to cook the meat to an internal temperature of 165f.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bacteria do not become harder to kill while cooking, but may produce toxic byproducts that are not destroyed by cooking. If they multiply enough those byproducts can be enough to make you sick.</p>
<p>Hence the recommendation to not store certain foods in that range, and throw them out (not just recook them) if they have been stored within that temp range for a number of hours.</p></div>		</li>
