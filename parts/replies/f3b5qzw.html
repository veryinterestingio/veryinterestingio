<p>Naturally these answers are not mutually exclusive. It can be a little bit of nature, plus a little bit of culture. But it's a really interesting topic!</p>

<p>Absolutely, this was my first thought after watching the video. </p>
<p>I wanted to ask which camp you fall into more? To be honest I think it really is an innate quality of humans to gravitate to the regularity of 4/4 and that comes before societal factors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, it's very hard to say! As /u/TheProfessaur rightly points out, it's very difficult to step outside of your own cultural frame of reference. I can only speculate, but I think the popularity of 4/4 is similar to the reason why a lot of popular music gravitates towards either side of 120bpm; it's 'baby bear's porridge'. There seems to be something about these values that feels temperate, like a happy medium. 4 beats per bar seems to be neither too short nor too long for a lot of compositional purposes, repeating phrases etc.</p>
<p>Of course, you can still argue the same points about cultural relativism at this idea! This could be total baloney, and there are probably a lot of problems with this theory, but it seems to ring true to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>120 bpm is also divided by 60 (seconds in a minute) twice, and I wonder if 120 bpm is common because we’ve calibrated ourselves to a superimposed time structure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, totally! Do you have any links to read about cultures that don’t grow up with this kind of thing? I’d love to read about that stuff. </p>
<p>There’s a book: <em>How Musical is Man</em> by John Blacking, which is a really good one for looking at musical tradition in various different cultures (it’s also a fairly short read, which is nice). It doesn’t go to deep into time signatures though, and focuses more on tradition and the role of music if I remember.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally I believe that 4/4 is a lot simpler to associate because you can interpret 1/4 2/4 and 4/4 all in one, while triplets are used more melodically within 4/4</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder what his take on iambic pentameter for English speakers would be. It’s the sort of natural cadence of speech in English for poetry (including heroic epics), which is more of a 6/8 time. We also seem to have a large body of work in 6/8 and 3/4 meter.</p>
<p>Edit to add: I think we use 4/4 because it’s an easy time signature to use and most pop music is lazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't call any time signature &quot;easy&quot;.  It's more an issue of the fact that most people are so used to 4/4 that when they hear something that deviates from it it feels strange, as if there's something wrong. As pop music is made to appeal to as many people as possible, it's only natural it doesn't deviate from it too much.</p>
<p>Another issue is dancing. 4/4 is the easiest for people to dance to, likely again because they're used to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. Lazy is probably not the best word for it, but 4/4 requires less skill, at the base, than others, I think. 6/8 time requires more work to play  basic pieces than 4/4. So does learning to dance to it. There are certainly a number of dances out there in 6/8 that are learned. </p>
<p>We could also look at certain tribal dances that, depending the region of the world, are also going to have non-4/4 meters to them. </p>
<p>As a base, 4/4 is the easiest time signature for pop music because its easy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, this is a really interesting point actually! And I agree that there generally seems to be a beat at the end of a line of iambic pentameter, giving it a 6/8 feel. For lack of a better term, waltz rhythms seem to have a 'sing-songy' quality to them, and I feel like this imbues spoken word with a melodic feel more effectively than 4/4 seems to. Again, I can only speculate why this is, and I'm only going off my own perceptions!</p></div>		</li>
