			<div class="markdown"><p>How many hours a week do you work? I'm thinking about starting an apprenticeship as a plumber and while I don't mind working a lot of hours the last time I worked in construction they really fucked me by scheduling me 70+ hours a week. Is the workload bearable I guess is the simplest way I can put it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ehhhh yes and no. It really depends on what you're doing. There are classic IT roles that are going away because developers are making it easier for non-operations folks to deploy infrastructure. </p>
<p>For now they need us because even though it's easy to get a server up and running a lot of developers have no idea on how to do it correctly because they don't understand how the bits and pieces relate to each other. So they end up with a mess of bad routing logic. Things are publicly accessible when they should be private, etc etc.</p>
<p>But down the line, as turn key solutions get better more and more non-ops folks will be able to more things while the system holds their hands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. Currently management can run a larger number of servers with fewer sysadmins. Virtualization of the servers and the network reduce operator workload, and containers are simplifying roll outs. All of these cloud technologies will become more and more ubiquitous and more polished, reducing the skill set needed.</p>
<p>A devop position means that management wants a sysop who is also a programmer and intends to pay them like desktop support. </p>
<p>Operations is not a bulletproof industry for job security. Learning more won't necessarily help, since the overall demand is being reduced.</p></div>		</li>
