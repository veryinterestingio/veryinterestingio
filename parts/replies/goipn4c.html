			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ll point that there’s also a bit of coaching that happens, if you have someone who’s not experienced with TV. When you’re telling a story, you normally will want to speak in the past tense, but that doesn’t work with interviews that they’re planning to intercut with the events as they’re happening. So if a person says “I didn’t think Gary was ready to take on that responsibility”, the director may remind the interviewee to speak in the present tense and go back and say “I don’t think Gary is ready to take on that responsibility.”</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even though Jeff didn't know there was ice they've fabricated a narrative that he was waiting to see someone to slip on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Producer: Okay, so do you think it was unfair for Hannah to win that round?</p>
<p>Mike (show participant): Well, I mean she got the same exact time as Melinda so they both shoulda won. So yeah, it's unfair.</p>
<p>Producer: Can you say it like I didn't ask you a question?</p>
<p>Mike: Sure. I think it was unfair that Hanna won despite getting the same time as Melinda.</p>
<p>Producer: Thanks. Also, I heard you got in some sort of spat with the craft services lady. What happened?</p>
<p>Mike: Oh yeah, she dropped my food and it got all over my shirt. So like, I had to go get another one. that lady in craft services was something else, though, let me tell you. I don't know what her problem is, but she was a real bitch.</p>
<p>Then, three months later, this airs:</p>
<p>[DRAMATIC MUSIC, Hannah confessional]</p>
<p>Hanna: I won fair and square. I don't know what Mike's problem is.</p>
<p>[Cut to Mike confessional]</p>
<p>Mike: I think it was unfair that Hanna won. She got the same exact time. I don't know what her problem is, but she was a real b-[bleep]-tch.</p>
<p>(Yes, you can easily do non-linear edits in the middle of speech in sound and video and make it sound and look natural. I used to do it. The trick for the video part is to change the zoom factor a small amount at the edit and make sure the audio edits don't overlap.)</p></div>		</li>
