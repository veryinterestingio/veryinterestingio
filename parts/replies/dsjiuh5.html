			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm gonna hit you with a bunch of questions, so watch out!</p>
<p>How wide of a range of frequencies is a given wifi channel? How spaced out do we need to keep different devices from each other's frequencies so there isn't noticeable interference (in terms of performance)? </p>
<p>If that range is tiny, then we've got a whole lot of spectrum to divvy up to everything, but if it's a large range that we have to space them out by, does that set a realistically attainable finite number of different types of devices you can have in a given area?</p>
<p>Also, happy cake day! ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know the standard for Wi-Fi is a 20 MHz bandwidth per channel, I'm not sure of how much of a guard band that they use but the physical hardware is set up to filter out harmonic distortion and intermodulation effects. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11</a></p>
<p>Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other devices all use the same 2.4 GHz ISM band which runs from 2.4 GHz to 2.485 GHz about. They each use their own scheme for communication and are required to not interfere under normal conditions. Cells phones are the same way, there are specified frequencies for everything. The collection of frequency allocations is called the frequency spectrum:

<p>If you overload a receiver with sources there begins to be too much interference that you start dropping calls or dropping usable bandwidth. If you ever are on something like a busy train during rush hour you'll actually notice a drop in 4G speed due to the amount of sources in one location. One of the real big things to point out is that each signal being sent has a power associated with it and that power is summed with all other transmitters talking to that receiver so at some point the power level becomes too high for the receiver to handle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if anyone answered all ready, but there isn't a guard band really. What you mentioned is only 2.4 GHz. There is also the 5 GHz space, all the UNII bands. Same principles though: 20 MHz base channels with -20 dBm being the point at which they overlap. The way speeds have increased though is channel bonding: 40, 80, and 160 MHz channels. So as WiFi speeds increase, the amount of devices operating simultaneously fails. I say that loosely because 802.11 use CSMA/CA, and as I'm sure you're keenly aware, two independent signals operating on the same frequency are basically noise. That's essentially your last paragraph but with a technical name, not exactly ELI5 though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can try to answer. I work at an EMC test lab where the main revenue for the business is doing FCC radiated emissions testing.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wireless Internet access points broadcast in either the 2.4GHz or 5GHz bands. For 2.4GHz, there are 14 channels, however, the most commonly used ones are 1, 6, and 11. The occupied bandwidth of a given broadcast channel ideally is ~22MHz. Higher-end APs can be set such that their bandwidth is larger, but most default to that. In the 5GHz bands, there exists a much larger amount of channels to use, which, yields greater bandwidth to be used without interference, i.e., 40MHz and even 80MHz. Using spectrum analyzers or built-in scanning features, channels can be allocated appropriately, such as in the case of a football stadium or concert arena (I help with IT from time to time in venues like those).</p>
</li>
<li>Essentially, yes. Part of the FCC governs the usable spaces of the electromagnetic spectrum and allocates as necessary, here in the US. The frequencies extend from near-DC (0Hz) all the way up to the hundreds of GHz. The spectrum isn't getting any less crowded, that's for sure. One thing at the event venues I have had to deal with was migrated wireless intercom beltpacks and microphones due to the first-of-its-kind Incentive Auction that happened recently. A portion of the spectrum, specifically the 600MHz band, and some above, was reallocated to be used for 4G and 5G mobile testing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully that helps a bit. All three jobs have pushed me to learn a lot about wireless devices. Taking an electromagnetic theory class as an EE student now, too, so I'm hopefully going to be well-versed in a few months...</p>
<p>Edit: Realized I didn't explain what the radiated emissions testing I help with is. That is testing to a couple of standards that govern the stray EM emissions from devices that occurs during normal operation. Different standards are used in regards to 'intentional radiators', such as access points, and non-intentional ones like a guitar amplifier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How about ultrasonic (or other technology) used in lane assist and backup sensors?   How do they prevent interference from other similar vehicles in the area?   The proliferation newer vehicles will make this spectrum more congested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ultrasonic actually refers to acoustic sensors so you won't see much in the way of interference with RF. The power levels and frequencies mentioned in the other comment also make for lack of interference. They could also use some type of code in the signal sent to make sure they specifically know which signal is theirs </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty spot on, few additions:  </p>
<p>Wifi 2.4ghz can only use 1-11 in the US. Channels 1,6, and 11 which do not overlap. In countries that allow all 14 channels, channel 14 DOES NOT overlap with 1, 6, or 11. For a total of 4 non-overlapping channels.  </p>
<p>Some US cell provider used to, and in some cases still use CDMA. However, my understanding is LTE is OFDM and that is now the dominant standard across the US.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I reallly hate when a retarded old router uses a channel that is not 1,6 or 11 because it slows everyone else down. Wish they made it like only three channels could be used. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The new ones are worse. Ever since they introduced &quot;wideband&quot; 2.4ghz, I have seen routers programmed to use channels 1 AND 6 out of the box, effectively using 2/3 of the available spectrum.  </p>
<p>I hate my neighbors for this, and many other reasons...  </p>
<p>My solution was more access points and more reliance on 5ghz.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually forgot about OFDM because the cell phone calls were still being done using CDMA pretty recently. I think it was about 2 or 3 years ago that they pushed out VOLTE which migrated the voice channels onto LTE</p></div>		</li>
