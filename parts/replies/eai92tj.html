<p>The big thing you never hear about marijuana is that every strain of weed will effect you differently.  </p>
<p>I have MS and use medical marijuana.  Some strains are magical and better than any drug out there for my issues.  Some strains make me feel like absolute garbage.  You never know until you try.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my experience (not the person you replied to), manufactured products (edibles, tinctures, oils, etc.) have incredible variability. They may specify indica or sativa, but the actual plant used is highly variable. I have found a product that worked amazingly well, and when I go to rebuy it, the next one is wholly ineffective. </p>
<p>The best thing to do, in my experience, is to find some other people who are interested in trying it out, but for different uses. Everyone buys a product and tries it. If it works for them, GREAT! If it doesn't, pass it on to the next person. Something that doesn't work for me may work for someone else who has a different condition. </p>
<p>This way, you limit your exposure to financial loss.</p>
<p>Whenever I find a new product that works for me, I tend to go back to the store and buy them out of that lot. In the same lot, the variability is low.</p>
<p>A lot of this stems from us really not understanding exactly what all the chemicals do, how they interact, etc. This is a result of a lack of study.</p>
<p>For anxiety, high-cbd derived from Indica (as opposed to hemp, or sativa) has had the best results for me. Indica tends to provide for full-body calming, whereas Sativa tends to energize you a bit more. I have also found that some (10-15%) THC in the mix helps with delivery of the CBD, while providing little to no cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>I would suspect that this is a good place to start for MS treatment as well, since you are trying to tamp down the neurological symptoms. </p>
<p>One further bit of advice:
Edibles are the easiest and most discreet things to use, but you have to be very careful; take a dose and then DON'T TAKE MORE! It can take between 15 mins and 1-2 hours for the full effect to hit you, depending on what you take, how much food was in your stomach, etc. Start LOW, and slowly increase the dose.
Tinctures hit faster; you hold them under your tongue for a minute or so before swallowing, so it is absorbed straight to your bloodstream. This method is my currently prefered method, and hits in about 5 minutes.
Vape cartridges hit almost immediately, don't smell like much at all, but are less discreet and there are health concerns with vaping.
Smoking is probably the cheapest, but it is time consuming, you smell, and there are significant health concerns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should ask this in one of the &quot;weed&quot; sub reddits. I'm unsure how to link them but /r weed is a very mellow and helpful sub and will gladly give you a bunch of strains to try. Also go in and ask your local shop but make sure you look around.</p>
<p>Also just for fair warning strains from different growers can change as well. White widow from one grower can effect you in a different way then another.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a heads up, a lot of CBD oils will show POSITIVE on cheap OTC drug tests (like you might see at work or anywhere you would pee in a cup).  Depending on why you are &quot;sober&quot;, you might want to be careful.</p>
<p>(If they send it to a lab it will likely be under the requisite % to be actually positive for THC but by then you might be fired or violated probation or whatever).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is where isolate vs full spectrum comes into play. If you have an isolate oil there is no chance of failing, whereas, when  using a full spectrum oil those contain trace amounts of THC. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably the same test as I do. I work at a nuclear power plant which is heavily regulated by the federal government, and we are subjected to random drugs tests at anytime while at work. They test for Marijuana, Cocaine, Amphetamines, Barbiturates, Benzodiazepines, PCP, Opiates and Alcohol. I've always wanted to try CBD for my anxiety but I am afraid I may fail for a random for Marijuana as I've heard CBD can give a false positive for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just out of curiosity, do you know if the CBD oil was &quot;full spectrum&quot; or &quot;whole extract&quot; or was it &quot;CBD isolate&quot;? </p>
<p>Full spectrum and whole extract usually refer to CBD oil products that have &quot;trace amounts&quot; of THC (&lt; 0.3%) and I know this can show up on a lab test. However, if it was a claimed &quot;CBD isolate&quot; product, then that's alarming</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One problem may be that CBD as it is sold is not regulated at all, and preparations may contain THC which could be a problem for some people. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This needs to be upvoted. The market unregulation is a serious problem, and this is why lab test results are so critical. We've seen &quot;CBD oil&quot; that is 99% olive oil before...</p></div>		</li>
