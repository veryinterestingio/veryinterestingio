			<div class="markdown"><p>Cervical cancer, too. In my mid-20s I had a Pap test come back with irregular cells. Second test confirmed stage 2 pre-cancerous. I went for a LEEP procedure and they basically laser cut out the outer layers of cervical tissue, which had by then gotten to stage 3. The next stage would have been full-on cervical cancer.</p>
<p>LADIES: GET YOUR YEALRY PAP TESTS. And everyone should get the modern 9-variant HPV vaccine. <del>Even if a man is rarely physically affected by HPV, you’re sure going to be emotionally affected if you accidentally kill your wife or girlfriend with a preventable disease.</del></p>
<p><strong>edit</strong> turns out men DO end up with cancer from HPV nearly as frequently as women. Mainly throat cancer. Get those vaccines, folks. </p>
<p>If you have medical coverage, see if they cover the ‘9-valent’ HPV vaccine. If they don’t, but you can afford it out of pocket, it’s worth it. Ignore shitty docs who say you’re out of your teens and so shouldn’t bother. I don’t understand this medical penny-pinching at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh wow, sorry to hear you’re being put through that. Hand-waving away an irregular pap is incredibly negligent! Step 1 is to take that deep breath and not panic. Sometimes smears are irregular and it’s nothing. My cells were nearly cancerous and a quick LEEP completely eradicated the issue. I’ve been fine for a decade since. BUT, it needs to be confirmed either way with a second test.</p>
<p>I’m Canadian so my doc ordered another pap ASAP. If you’re in the states, then I’d suggest skipping your dingdong doctor and going to the nearest Planned Parenthood for a second smear. Planned Parenthood is wonderful and they take sexual and reproductive health seriously. If you’re outside the US and don’t have any good sexual/reproductive health clinics then even a walk-in clinic is better than fighting your doctor if you don’t feel like they’ll respect your body.</p>
<p>You should be able to have your current doctors office send the first result to the PP office so that they can track the difference between the two smears. If they push back, remind them that they’re <em>your</em> medical records and you have a legal right to them. You do. Push hard on getting a copy of the smear results.</p>
<p>In the longer run, try to find a doctor who isn’t dismissive of women’s health. I know it’s sometimes disturbingly difficult, but they do still exist. Good luck. Feel free to pm me with any other questions that may arise in the future if it wasn’t just a one-off irregular result. Nobody should have to be in the dark about HPV.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had that happen once. Turns out, if you get the test done during a certain stage of your menstrual cycle, it can show as irregular. My mom also had cervical cancer so I pressed her on it, and she told me. They had the test done again a few weeks later and it was fine, so you could ask for that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I’ll be. Turns out men frequently get throat cancers from HPV. Thanks for the update. I read this on the CDC website:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on data from 2013 to 2017, about 45,300 HPV-associated cancers occur in the United States each year: about 25,400 among women, and about 19,900 among men. Cervical cancer is the most common HPV-associated cancer among women, and oropharyngeal cancers (cancers of the back of the throat, including the base of the tongue and tonsils) are the most common among men.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>All the more reason everyone should get that 9-strain vaccine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this person meant that men don't get cancer from HPV, but they are most certainly affected by it! There are many different kinds of HPV - some cause cervical cancer, some cause warts (and men can get those), and some are silent infections.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wish I could get the 9-valent vaccine. It's approved in my country but they just don't sell it. </p>
<p>I got a LEEP done last year. Stage 1. Still horrible experience.</p>
<p>Btw I had the Gardasil vaccine since 2014.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No pharmacy sells it? That’s wild. Have you asked different pharmacies if they can order it in? </p>
<p>Gardasil is still a very good vaccine. It protects you from the four worst strains.</p></div>		</li>
