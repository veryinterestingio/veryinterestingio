			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of the CO₂ is put through a sabatier process, where it is reacted with waste hydrogen from the oxygen-generating electrolysis system, to form Methane and recover some of the oxygen. That Methane could be put through thermolysis to break it down to Carbon and recover the hydrogen, but that isn't done because Hydrogen is a waste product on the ISS.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is wrong,  LiOH and CDRA are separate things.  LiOH canisters are the third method of removing CO2 from the ISS atmosphere and cannot be regenerated on-orbit.  The first are two regenerate, preferred methods are two CDRA assemblies, which use a solid amine for CO2 adsorption.  One CDRA is in the US Lab and the other is in Node 3.  The second method is a Russian system called Vozdukh.</p></div>		</li>
