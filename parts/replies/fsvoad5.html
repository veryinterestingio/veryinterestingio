			<div class="markdown"><p>Winds can get very strong at the higher altitudes (as B-29 crews found to their dismay in 1944), and those winds are more consistent than at low altitude. With the right migratory patterns, the birds can get a lot of help from tailwinds.</p>
<p>Used to know a former F-106 pilot who'd had a partial engine failure when it ingested a bird at 30,000 feet. They found a fragment of beak in the combustion chamber, which was enough for an ornithologist to identify it as a Canada goose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, the Nene (or Hawaiian Goose) on Hawaii is related to the Canada Goose.</p>
<p>One of the theories is that a flock of giant Canada geese were blown off course by a storm and managed to make it to the islands - the idea of them being able to fly at that altitude helps the theory.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the case of the bar headed goose, one hypothesis is just that theyâ€™ve always flown that route, and probably started when the Himalayas were much shorter.  Geese are apparently one of the older species of birds....
