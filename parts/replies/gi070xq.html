			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol no worries! You know those moments where reality just changes for you? Well I was hardcore obsessed with being a vegan for over 3 years. I genuinely was never tempted by anything if I knew it had animal products. And then I heard a quote (I forget who from) saying something like... the animals eat each other, it's part of the food chain. And we're part of the food chain, too. So if animals eat each other and it's not immoral, why is it immoral if I do?&quot; And that made so much sense to me. It felt like I was just really connected to everything,not outside of it.</p>
<p>Also, I had to go on a keto diet for health reasons and it was very hard to maintain, as a vegan :/</p>
<p>BUT. I think the way our culture consumes animals is so fucked. I think, being a part of the circle of life doesn't give us the power to just kill things carelessly and torture animals. I think, if you're going to eat meat, be respectful of the animals life, say thank you, don't support unethical production, don't just gorge yourself on animal products and be so disconnected to the fact that you're eating a dead animal. </p>
<p>Another thing was that, I was so worried about eating specifically vegan, that I ended up consuming a lot more. Physically I ate more food, and then I bought more food, so bought more plastics, spent more on buying foods that had to be transported further. I think veganism can just be very black and white. Like yeah eating animals can be problematic and it definitely is, how we do it.... but it isn't just... everyone stop eating meat and that's how we'll save the environment. And also.... if everyone ate A LOT less meat, we would still be able to do a lot of good. </p>
<p>Tldr: I think the how is more important than the what</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Other animals do many things we would find distasteful -- for example, regularly raping the shit out of each other -- so I don't know that that's the strongest basis to make an assertion of morality upon.</p>
<p>My personal take has always been that if I have the option to not cause a direct negative effect to another living being by simply doing something that causes me marginal inconvenience when getting into it and then zero inconvenience once I'm into the swing of it, how is that not the more moral choice than having the same basic level of inconvenience while causing a direct negative effect to another living being?</p>
<p>That said, I really don't maintain a vegetarian diet and am a huge hypocrite, so don't worry about listening to me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a terrible, terrible, <strong>turboterrible</strong> reason. It's a naturalistic fallacy: just because it's nature, it's good, inevitable or at least morally neutral. Almost all rigorous ethicists also regard animal predation as ethically reprehensible. The difference with humans is that they currently have no alternative to survive, and until humans can develop technology to eliminate predation in the animal kingdom (preferably without impacting/altering the lifestyle of carnivores. Conceivable with future technology within a couple centuries), the idea of it is purely hypothetical, whereas the topic of meat/suffering is very much an applied ethics issue.</p>
<p>More importantly, this entire angle of approach for the rationalisation is moot from the start:  animals are not moral actors as the lack the necessary sapience for the concept, so we can't involve them as an acting entity at any part in the evaluation of a moral argument without producing vacuous (empty, hot air, sophistry) statements.
They are not <em>actors</em>, but that doesn't remove them any more from the equation, they simply can't be involved in questions involving agency.</p>
<p>By contrast, we humans hold ourselves to a higher, no, to <strong>a</strong> standard. We are capable of reflection on a moral choice, and make a decision. We also have, unlike beings in the natural world, purely materialistically a superabundance of alternatives to a diet that don't involve its most blatant producer of suffering i.e. meat.</p>

<p>The notion to end all suffering, no matter its provenance, is a serious stance in philosophy.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pearce_(philosopher" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pearce_(philosopher</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His self-published internet manifesto, The Hedonistic Imperative (1995), outlines how pharmacology, genetic engineering, nanotechnology and neurosurgery could converge to eliminate all forms of unpleasant experience from human and non-human life, replacing suffering with &quot;gradients of bliss&quot;.[7][8] Pearce calls this the &quot;abolitionist project&quot;.[9]</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>A vegan, Pearce argues that humans have a responsibility not only to avoid cruelty to animals within human society but also to redesign the global ecosystem so that animals do not suffer in the wild.[14] He has argued in favour of a &quot;cross-species global analogue of the welfare state&quot;,[15] suggesting that humanity might eventually &quot;reprogram predators&quot; to limit predation, reducing the suffering of prey animals.[16] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I disagree somewhat with changing predators. I would prefer it we introduce synthetic unfeeling &quot;zombie&quot; constructs that predators can hunt, and dissuading them from sentient creatures via a deterring mechanism.)</p></div>		</li>
