<p>Sometimes the fear is so great that the child will forget what they did wrong.</p>

<p>I never heard this before but it makes so much sense of what I remember in my childhood. For example, my dad once came into my room and was yelling and picked me up by the throat. Everyone reacted as if we both did something wrong but I've never been able to remember or find out why this happened.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I am afraid for my sweet,bright niece's mental health and i feel helpless. </p></div>		</li>
