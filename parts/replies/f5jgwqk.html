			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like the definition of “nightmare” might be different from one person to another.  I rarely ever have nightmares, but I remember my dreams and find them very interesting. Maybe if my sister had that same dream, she would call it a nightmare.  I’ve noticed that my sister is much more cautious, afraid, anxious and risk averse than I am.     Maybe she has dreams she would call a nightmare but I would say it’s just an interesting dream.</p></div>		</li>
