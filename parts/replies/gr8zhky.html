			<div class="markdown"><p>You said mars being further away it's slower. </p>
<p>Is orbital rotation dependant on distance from orbiting body or is just coincidental in this instance? I'm not questioning your math or your point just trying to understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But how do I reach higher orbits? I always assumed that acceleration would put me in a higher orbit, and deceleration would eventually lead to me falling down and back onto the planet.
But obviously you are right, geostationary satellites take 1 day to rotate earth while the ISS takes about 90 minutes or so. I'm confused.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To borrow a phrase from the author Douglas Adams, the secret of flying is to throw yourself at the ground and miss.</p>
<p>In the case of an orbit around the sun, you're basically moving fast enough <em>sidewise</em> that despite the sun's gravity pulling you towards it, you're just perpetually 'missing'. The further away you are from the sun, the weaker its gravity pulls on you, and the slower you need to be moving sideways to 'miss'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good way to put it. Would increasing the orbit speed move the planet closer to the star? Or would it be able to maintain the existing or it at a higher speed? Like if a comet hit a planet for example?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The closer you are other mass, the more it is pulling you in. (technically mutual pulling). The heavier the objects are, the more they are pulled in.</p>
<p>You need more speed to counteract that gravity.</p>
<p>So the closer you are, the faster you need to orbit, in order to orbit and not fall into the object (orbits are basically an energy free way of pushing away from an object by the same amount you are pulling into them) </p>
<p>If Usain Bolt could run in space, he could create a stable orbit for himself around the sun at about a thousand trillion miles away (ignoring other sources of mass), because it would barely pull at him. </p>
<p>The earth is at 145 million km away, moving at ~100,000 km per hour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why not wait until Earth is in front of Mars and send it back to meet Mars. Or would it spend the same amount of energy decelerating on the landing end?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you mean by back? As in Earth is 'ahead' of Mars and send the rocket backward (relative to Earth) toward Mars? That would require canceling out all of the speed imparted by Earth (30 km/s) and then gaining the necessary speed to overcome the Suns gravity (30km/s) and then gain the additional velocity to push out towards Mars. Once you intercepted Mars your relative velocity would then be Mars orbital (~24 km/s) PLUS your velocity around the Sun. Not good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if it were launched sideways (as in straight from our orbit towards Mars' orbit). It would still go forward in relation to Earth's orbit but not so fast. Timing would be harder though.</p></div>		</li>
