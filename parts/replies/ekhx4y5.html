<p><a href="https://nccih.nih.gov/health/probiotics/introduction.htm" target="_blank">https://nccih.nih.gov/health/probiotics/introduction.htm</a></p>
<p>However, we do believe that the C. Difficile treatment in question works because the FDA allows it to be tested/used under &quot;enforcement discretion,&quot; (i.e., not approved, but the FDA won't prevent it, either) based in its early promise and the lack of good alternatives... and the clinical results thus far are quite good.</p>
<p>C. Difficile infection is a potentially fatal opportunistic infection that occurs after conventional antibiotic treatment kills off most of your normal gut bacteria - bacteria that ordinarily keep the pathogens in check.  </p>
<p>The procedure, called fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), seeks to restore your gut microbiome by directly transplanting a portion of someone else's healthy microbiome into it, thereby seeding a recovery.  In short, it replaces almost exactly what was lost, in all its diverse microbiological glory.  </p>
<p>FMT product is either processed in a one-off batch from a single donor or purchased from a stool bank (props to Openbiome, the nation's largest such bank).  The efficacy rates are generally believed to be in the range of 80-90% for this approach.  </p>
<p>A few companies are now trying to recapitulate this approach using carefully curated, lab-grown blends of specific gut-derived bacteria, the idea being that such treatments would be more safe/more consistent/more scalable than donor stool.  None are yet FDA approved, but several are in clinical trials... time will tell of they will work.</p>
<p>In contrast, most commercial &quot;probiotics&quot; - the yogurts and such - are monocultures of low microbiologically-diverse products that don't always replace the diversity of what you have lost.  There are a few small clinic trials suggesting that large, well-controlled doses may have some beneficial effects for a variety of gastrointestinal conditions (or otherwise), but the likelihood of things like yogurt recapitulating this (already quite limited) effect is quite low.</p></div>		</li>
