Many studies show peer review is not able to capture fraud/mistakes, is biased, is not recognized, and credited and is not transparent. See articles below for example:<br />

and it is open to manipulation and fraud:<br />

Raising awareness, and transparency can go a long way in fixing the issues I listed, and recognizing the peer review role of researchers in the academic evaluation and grant application can help rewarding and crediting this voluntar-based and unseen but hard work of academics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the groups of funders that I have seen and worked with I have noted that some are great at providing peer reviewer training and others are not. There seems to be an expectation that if you are a researcher or scientist you just know how to do peer review! Would be great to see funders globally learn from each other about what works and in particular I have seen issues with reviewing research impacts (beyond academia)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to Bahar's answers, I think it is also very important to clearly formulate the goal of peer review. In my view, one of its main goals is to filter manuscripts ensuring research ends up being evaluated by the right scientific community by means of publication in specific journals. It can be argued that after publication the real evaluation takes places, where good and valuable research ends of being cited and further built upon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks u/sexrockandroll for your question. There are always flaws unfortunately - as long as we keep improving and making the experience better, that is what is important. From my experience certainly peer review communication: peer reviewers comments/tone - often the tone used when someone has written something, is not received how intended. There can be some comments a reviewer sends that can seem quite brutal when actually the reviewer thinks they are being clear and helpful. Better peer reviewer communication here, and also Editorial feedback (this may take place already but if just minor revisions, the Editorial team may not read and just send back. For quality assurance someone should read and check them in the team).</p>
<p>In addition, I did an article in Research Information about Rogue Peer Review - A Polysemy In The Making - the podcast is here - <a href="https://www.internationalbunch.com/podcast/episode/1b9cba7e/rogue-peer-review-a-polysemy-in-the-making" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.internationalbunch.com/podcast/episode/1b9cba7e/rogue-peer-review-a-polysemy-in-the-making" target="_blank">https://www.internationalbunch.com/podcast/episode/1b9cba7e/rogue-peer-review-a-polysemy-in-the-making</a></a></p></div>		</li>
