			<div class="markdown"><p>I looked up my phone number from the house where I grew up and it said it was in my father's name--except he died 26 years ago.  It even said he was 80 years old, which he would have been if he were still alive today.</p>
<p>It also listed my cell number as belonging to its previous owner, but it's been mine since 2010.</p>
<p>So yeah, a bit outdated.</p></div>		</li>
