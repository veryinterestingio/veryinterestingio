			<div class="markdown"><p>This is it. I remember this question coming up so two people decided to map out professional baseball outfielders. They looked at a lot of paths they took to catch fly balls and they were never straight lines. They were curved. These curves matched up with what you said - keeping the ball at a certain point in your vision.</p>
<p>They then proved this was the case by using a computer program that followed the same basic rule. The lines it drew were identical to typical outfielder lines when catching flyballs.</p></div>		</li>
