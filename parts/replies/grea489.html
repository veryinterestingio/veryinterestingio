			<div class="markdown"><p>The rhythm disruption is real. Going up against an expert boxer as a newbie, they can see when you breathe and if they recognize that you hold your breath while avoiding, they can start throwing jabs just to mass up your breathing and planning. You think you know what you are doing until you go up against someone better than you and just get knocked silly wondering what just happened and why your body couldn't function.</p></div>		</li>
