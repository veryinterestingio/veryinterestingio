			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m pretty sure this is the real answer. I work for a Texas facility and most things are insulated to conserve process energy but heat tracing is used as little as possible because it’s difficult to maintain if you rarely need it. I’m sure that’s what happened to several pumping stations for natural gas and power generators. We knew we were going to struggle to keep even our cogen up in these temperatures as soon as the forecast came out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heat trace is also notoriously unreliable, I have little doubt they left it off to avoid having to spend the money to constantly fix it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know a lot of heat trace (here) is sometimes kept on or turned on during summer months to test if they work. Especially frost protection, since it is rarely run even in winter, since we might get maybe a week with temperatures under 4 degrees celsius.</p>
<p>At one site I work at, built during the 80s, they installed Pyrotenax. Which in turn is notorious for breaking down when you need it.</p></div>		</li>
