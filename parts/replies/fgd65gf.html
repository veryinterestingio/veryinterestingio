			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Any company that sends you an email containing your password is completely shit at security and shouldn't be trusted with anything sensitive (like credit card details)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any website who's &quot;forgot my password&quot; actually returns you your original password should immediately go on a list of do not trust with any personal or financial information, and also immediately change any account that uses the same password (even though you shouldn't be using the same password most people do or have done it at some point in their online existence)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. If they actually email you your old password, they are storing them in plaintext. Not only this is insecure as hell (and you should stop using the website NOW), but if the website works in Europe, it’s breach of GDPR and they can be fined pretty heavily if they decline to fix it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not necessarily.  The passwords could also be encrypted which allows them to also be decrypted.  This is a step up from plain-text but still not as secure as a proper hashing algorithm.  Encryption is 2-way whereas hashing is one-way (cannot retrieve the source string) and is one of the primary reasons why it is preferred over other methods.</p></div>		</li>
