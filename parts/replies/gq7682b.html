<p>More efficient, but also more expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as electrons are concerned, a stranded wire is one conductor as the strands touch everywhere. If you want to counter the skin effect, you need to isolate the strands against each other.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not true. </p>
<p>Granted, they they are testing under high frequency and normal 120/208 should not see much of a difference, if any that would matter. </p>
<p>But there is definitely a difference.</p></div>		</li>
