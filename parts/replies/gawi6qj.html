<p>To expand on it a bit further, the idea is that instead of targeting a single keyword (i.e. the name of the recipe), when they write a whole story, the search engine now can match that 1 page with tons and tons of other searches. </p>
<p>Now a search of something similar to the recipe might land you a spot further down the list on another search, or better yet, in the #1 position of some random search that most people don't usually search for. </p>
<p>These random, infrequent, search terms are what someone above called the &quot;long tail&quot;. It's not worth a lot of effort in targeting them directly, but you can accidentally get some by writing lots of content.</p></div>		</li>
