			<div class="markdown"><p>OP does find that interesting! My whole reason for asking is I'm working on a navigation system for a sci Fi book I'm writing, so this is great food for thought and a good jump off point for some more research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good luck to you too! Glad I could help indirectly. I hope you find some good stuff here. Sci Fi is great fun to write, but no picnic when it comes to nailing down the &quot;Sci&quot; aspects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could still use this idea in your book as sort of a failed system that someone tried to use but got lost or something. Sounds like an interesting read. How long until it hits the shelves?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A very long time I'm afraid. I'm about 80 000 words into the first draft, which I hope will be about 100 000 words. There will be lots of revisions to follow, so I'm looking at a couple years at least!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;this system isn't terribly likely to be immediately useful beyond a few light years from Earth&quot;</p>
<p>Maybe let's cross that bridge when we get to it.
I do realize this is how the Y2K problem started.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, it would be quite amazingly useful here in the solar system and I'm often confused by the sudden lack of interest in the systems continued development once this &quot;weakness&quot; was discovered. As I said, there are some ways around it. Not perfect solutions of course, but still useful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. It makes me think about tools. We have precision tools to make precision tools, but how did we make the first precision tool? Someone made a tool, that was used to make a better tool, and a better tool, so on and so forth. Just because an idea isn't perfect, doesn't mean it can't be built upon later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A following question, albeit slightly unrelated.. We (the solar system including our sun) are hurtling through space in our galaxy at some really high speeds.. I recently watched this Vsauce vid - <a href="https://youtu.be/IJhgZBn-LHg" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/IJhgZBn-LHg</a>. Even at such speed, I'm surprised our fixed point is space to see constellations remains the same and it had done so for 100's if not 1000's of years.. Is this because of the distance we have travelled around our galaxy is immaterial compared to the position of those constellations. If so, this is incredible sign of the magnitudes we are dealing with as far as space travel is concerned. Would love to know.. ????</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is in fact part of the weakness of the GPS system as well, particularly in a possible FTL environment.</p>
<p>In a normal use-case, we've got a pretty fair idea of the various pulsars movement vectors and it happens over such a long period of time over such a vast distance that only very rarely would you HAVE to update the catalogue for this information. In reality a catalogue entry would PROBABLY give an origin point of some sort, a vector, and then a time for when the measurement was made, so you could calculate it out yourself.</p>
<p>However, if you assume an FTL environment, then you do get into the annoying usecase that you can get those effective millenia of drift in a very short period of time.</p>
<p>My own amusing most-likely-untrue-but-it-makes-me-happy-to-imagine-it theory for why the efforts to develop the system have pulled back is because of this unsuitability for an FTL navigation system...which would imply that such a system is under development with nearish term prototype schedules.</p>
<p>To more specifically answer your question: the galaxy is so huge and the speeds of things are &quot;slow&quot; by comparison. So yes, it takes a LOOONG time for drift to occur. Pop back 5000 years and you'd still recognize the Big Dipper, Orion, etc, pretty easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It takes about 230 million years for the sun to orbit the Milky Way galaxy. On average that’s 639000 years to move just 1 degree of that circle. Other stars in our part of the galaxy have similarly long orbits, and clusters of stars can stay in the same spots relative to each other. </p>
<p>It shouldn’t be any surprise then that changes in constellations since humans first learned to record them are negligible.</p></div>		</li>
