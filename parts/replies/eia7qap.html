			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know, man. Just last night, I was watching The Breaker-Uppers (which was pretty funny) and I started to doze off and heard myself snoring. I woke up, stared at the tv for about 10 seconds, dozed back off and heard it again. I’m sure that I wasn’t in a very deep sleep.</p>
<p>Also, when you hear yourself snore, you realize how disgusting it sounds. It really makes me feel bad for my wife for about 10 seconds before I doze back off.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If someone’s snoring wakes them up, it’s most likely an apena event and you’re choking in your sleep. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is what I am saying, 'if it doesn't wake you up right at first'. Snoring starts when you relax tissues in your throat enough that they partially block your airway. So, what happened to you happened as you transitioned into deep sleep. If you hadn't noticed it right then, you would have been way gone within a few minutes and probably just kept on snoring. For me, I always wake up. I think it has to do with people who transition into deep sleep very quickly or all at once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily! I can't get into deep sleep because my snoring, basically I stop breathing and then I wake myself up without realizing it and then go back to sleep and the cycle continues!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also what you are describing sounds like sleep apnea and can really mess with your quality of life. Have you tried any CPAP machines or other solutions?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude.  I just started using a CPAP a month ago.  I feel like I wasted years of my life.  </p>
<p>You need to go get a sleep study and try a CPAP.  It takes about a week to get used to sleeping with it.  After that, the quality of your life improves so much as to be beyond description.  You just have to experience it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife used to fart when she was nervous. She had all sorts of wonderful little idiosyncrasies. She used to fart in her sleep. I thought I’d share that with you. One night it was so loud it woke the dog up. She woke up and went ‘ah was that you?’ And I didn’t have the heart to tell her. She’s been dead for 2 years, and that's the shit I remember: wonderful stuff you know? Little things like that. Those are the things I miss the most. The little idiosyncrasies that only I know about: that's what made her my wife. Oh she had the goods on me too, she knew all my little peccadilloes. People call these things imperfections, but there not. Ah, that's the good stuff.</p></div>		</li>
