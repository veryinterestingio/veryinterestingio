<p>Nowadays however we dont really &quot;need&quot; it all that much, assuming we keep our stuff clean, and dont exert pressure on our wounds. </p>

<p>This works somewhat for adults, but I think pain is also very important for children. Learning how to walk, how to fall, keeping things out of your eyes etc. is all really hard without pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree! But the poster asked why the brain doesnt turn off the pain for cuts and bruises, and thats what i meant in my response. Assuming we take care of a cut/bruise the pain would be unnecessary.</p>
<p>Other pains though, like falling, or touching a hot stove. Or pain in your throat when coughing, is still incredibly important, but I figured the OP was not reffering to them in his post.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ever accidentally brush your hand against a hot stove for a tenth of a second, feel that burning pain, and rip your hand away fast? Even that brief touch often causes a minor burn, right?</p>
<p>Imagine what happens if you don't do that. You feel your hand brush against it and don't notice what it is you're touching, because there's no pain.</p>
<p>And that's just one example of why pain is important.</p></div>		</li>
