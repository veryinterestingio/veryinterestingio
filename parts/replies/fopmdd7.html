			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be generally a bit sceptical of anything bought off amazon, specifically if it connects 110/230v products. At least when bought locally the seller has some degree of accountability thus you can go after their head if the cord sparks and causes fire. Not so much for near-anonymous amazon seller from across the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's got UL Certification. If you can find their UL cert info, you're able to look it up online to determine if it is legitimate or not. </p>
<p>For electrical safety, UL Certification is probably the most important to have. Underwriter's Laboratory was originally created by insurance companies because they were tired of how many electrical fires they were paying to cover. </p>
<p>Instead of stopping coverage for electrical fires, they created a company that would use their insurance data to determine how to ensure products were safe and unlikely to cause fires. </p>
<p>It's one of the few times that insurance companies used their greed for good. Issuing a UL cert to a manufacturer creating faulty devices would cost them more money than requiring the company to fix it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wall warts don't draw 13 amps. Maybe 1-1.5 amps. Also, you shouldn't be plugging in multiple things in one socket (or one CIRCUIT) that draw 13 amps or more. You shouldn't even have a consistent load drawing 13 amps on a standard 15 amp circuit.</p>
<p>In other words, these extender plugs are more than fine for their purpose.</p></div>		</li>
