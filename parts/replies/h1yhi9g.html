			<div class="markdown"><p>LED grow lamps should include some UV LEDs, particularly for plants that usually grow in direct sunlight. Plants can be harmed by overexposure to UV same as us, but in the correct amount it's essential for some biological processes. The same is true for us - without enough UVB we can develop a vitamin D2 deficiency.</p></div>		</li>
