			<div class="markdown"><p>An atom is sort of like a puzzle piece. The electrons are what determine where it’s holes and protrusions are, which in turn determine how it can fit together with other atoms. Taking away or adding electrons changes an atoms “shape” which changes how it can bond with other atoms.</p>
<p>The shape analogy isn’t very real world accurate, but the general idea is the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow on question: does increasing the atomic number, or adding more protons, change the element in predictable ways or is it sort of random?</p>
<p>For example, do elements become more solid when you add more protons? Is there some sort of a threshold (1 - 10 protons = gas, 20 - 50 = metal etc)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding an extra electron at times changes the orbital of the electron. Electrons circle an atom in a variety of shapes called orbitals. The &quot;first&quot; shapes that have to be filled before the others are spheres around the nucleus. After these spheres are filled with electrons, the next 3 shapes are shaped like a dumbbell along the x, then y, then z axis of the atom. This dumbbell shape &quot;reaches out&quot; from where the spheres do, increasing the propensity of forming a bond.* There are several further shapes after dumbbell shaped, too. &quot;Filling&quot; any shape is desirable for an atom because it is more stable, and &quot;higher&quot; shapes have more energy due to being magnetically repelled by the already-existing electrons in the shell. Therefore, adding an electron can put that electron in a position where it really needs another electron -- from any available atom -- to be stable.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>You are correct that p orbitals extend further from the nucleus. However, that doesn't make them more likely to form a bond (directly). They form covalent bonds because filling out the p-subshell completes the outer valence shell, which stabilizes an atom a lot. If the s is your outermost subshell, you'll get a lot more stabilization from dropping electrons entirely or spreading them around a group (metallic bonding).</p></div>		</li>
