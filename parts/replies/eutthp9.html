			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not the case. The justice department will pursue almost any case, guilty, innocent, indifferent. The entire issue here is one if jurisdiction, the only person that can have any meaningful effect on a president in office is Congress, and they need to impeach him. Trump is guilty. He committed a crime, several really. Mueller said as much to Congress in person today. But Congress is the one that needs to impeach and possible oust him, that’s the only Constitutional method we have at our disposal.</p></div>		</li>
