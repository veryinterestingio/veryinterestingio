			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! This answers my questions quite thoroughly, do you have any studies I could look into about catch-up sleep and partial sleep deprivation? I saw a lot about restricting sleep to 6 hours or even less, and I'm more interested in the cumulative effect of 1 or even half an hour less every day for a long time. Only study I found along these lines is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5491935/" target="_blank">this</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Again hard to answer because “normal” is fluid and not a standard number of hours across populations and individually. Quality vs quantity plays a role too… you may have a slightly better sleep one night vs another, this may be enough to make up the debt. So I just can’t see how a study could look at this easily.</p>
<p>Biology isn’t simple or black and white, we are boney meat bags of electricity after all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly I'm interested in the following question:</p>
<p>Is it possible to recover from months of slight under sleeping with a single day of good rest? As far as I could understand it is not, the amount of sleep required to rest obviously varies person by person, and is affected by sleep quality.</p>
<p>But I'm searching for evidence on the fact that under-sleeping accumulates, and then needs to be compensated with extra sleep as compared with a baseline of sleeping the required amount for your body to remain in peak efficiency. Or evidence of the contrary, that sleeping the required amount for your body for a single day completely recovers the accumulated sleep deficit. There might be scenarios where one or the other is true, that's why I wanted as much studies/information as possible to answer this question.</p>
<p>Mostly I want to get deeper into the detail of this statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>regular catch up sleep is likely to be sufficient to avoid significant health implications from mild cyclic sleep restriction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is regular catchup? How much is enough? How does it affect cognitive performance vs subjective sleepiness? Etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The human body is pretty amazing. As Phil said, people have differing sleep needs. But even within an individual, the body’s need for sleep operates similar to neuroplasticity (Sleep…finds a way). </p>
<p>If you have an individual “requirement” of 8 hours a night, but you consistently get 7, your body will help you fulfill that requirement by improving the quality of your sleep (i.e. increasing the amount of deep sleep and REM sleep while decreasing the n2, or “normal” sleep). </p>
<p>That is good news for you. Bad news for researchers trying to study the effects of long-term, minimal sleep debt.</p></div>		</li>
