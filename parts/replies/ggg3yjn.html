The browning on the bread is the maillard reaction. Breads are carbohydrates, which are sugar molecules.  The protein contains amino acids, and break down into them with heat. These molecules(sugars and amino acids) reduce and react with each other, creating a handful of new molecules, which is what causes the browning effect.<br />
