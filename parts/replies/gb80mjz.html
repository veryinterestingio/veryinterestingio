			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say, because they are uncomfortable.  No more, no less.  I'm sure there is a physiological component, but it's unnecessary to know.  Rubbing stimulates tears to lubricate your eyes.  Hyper-focus causes the same rubbing response.  Less blinking, less flow of tears.  Likely why we pinch the bridge of our nose when we think very hard over a long period of time.  Less about being tired, more about blinking less.</p></div>		</li>
