			<div class="markdown"><p>OPs question seems more like a theoretical question, and it kind of makes sense, how did we go from one sick person to a gonna pandemic?</p>
<p>But also, we need to look beyond just the obvious answer and loo at the framing of the question. It makes it sound like we're screwed because we'll never get rid of it. Or it makes it sound like this kind of pandemic is inevitable, we're going to head having them no matter what. Or it makes it sound like everyone's going to get sick eventually, so what's the point of trying to stop it?</p>
<p>Ultimately, it's framing the question in a reductionist way (either the chance of a pandemic is zero or it's more than zero) and also pessimistic. The truth is, when there's one person with an infectious disease the only threr possibilities are:</p>
<ul>
<li>They spread it to someone else, now there's two people spreading it</li>
<li>They get better, now there's zero patients</li>
<li>They die, also zero patients</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't think there's a good chance we'll get to zero infected people any time soon. But if we do, the <em>only</em> way to get there is to have one infected patient first.</p></div>		</li>
