			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question! I have never worked at this myself, but I have been following these topics. Planetary chaos is the principal reason we cannot robustly extend our simulations back in time. As the uncertainties grow exponentially with the few Myr timescale, there is a big difference between integration back to 55 and 66 Myr ago.  Sources of uncertainty include the past interaction in the Earth-Moon system, but also gravitational influence of large asteroids like Ceres, the orbits of which are chaotic on shorter timescales. Few years back getting to the K-T boundary was a major goal, so I am not sure that we can go to Paleozoic with a robust unified timeline, rather than producing a qualitative match to the orbital cycles.  The way to push back further is to calibrate simulations with geologic data, so that we can determine things like the rate of the Moon's orbital recession in the past (no amount of precision in measuring the planets' current motions could tell us that). I believe that some teams are doing exactly this kind of work,   but I have not had time to read up on the latest results.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My only guess would be tidal rhythmites. But there's still the problem of not knowing  the time interval those deposits cover. And you'd need several sections of rhythmites, up and down the strat column. You could make some good guesses and take rhythmites from one spot and correlate them to a proximal location if you can't get enough data out of one locale. This is guess is only related to the rate of the moon's orbital recession.</p>
<p>The other way to do it is a huge undertaking. You'd basically take a global stratigraphic record, find a way to roughly estimate what percent of the climate is linked to biologic, geographic, and geologic factors, then cancel that out to find the % of the climate that's linked to our orbital position in relation to the sun.</p></div>		</li>
