			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in Australia. Most people I know have made the comment at some point ... “why don’t we just create a massive lake in the middle of Australia” .., implying that if you could get a lake big enough, it would change the weather patterns of the Australian desert enough that the interior would have significantly more rainfall and therefore change the landscape.  </p>
<p>I am wondering if you dropped a body of water (let’s say lake mead size 640 km2) in the middle of the Australian desert, would it be enough to create a significant change in rainfall patterns and /or become a self sustaining water source.  </p>
<p>I am sure there are many variables that would have to be taken into consideration, wind currents, long term changes (El Nino, La Niña) that would effect the outcome but I guess the question is, would it be possible at all, or would the lake just dry up and return to desert in a few years?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason it’s so dry in the middle of australia is that the different layers in your atmosphere are very very dry. If you managed to saturate the air enough for it to rain enough to make any difference, A) it would flood a lot B) most of the rain would be pushed away from the “lake” by wind so unless the lake was in a valley where all the water would filter into, it would only take a couple of months/years to run dry. HOWEVER, this is ONLY the case if you can get it to rain. The atmosphere normally cools down as you go up, but in desert areas you develop something called an inversion. That’s when the atmosphere heats up as you increase in altitude, if the air below the inversion isn’t hotter than the inversion, air cannot rise and thus wouldn’t precipitate out. So even if you managed to get a massive body of water, you’d have to change the wind to not blow the moisture away, situate it in a valley, and somehow change the atmosphere to remove the persistent inversion. All of which is rather unlikey as you can imagine</p></div>		</li>

<p>What causes an inversion? Normally, air gets very cold as you get higher. Why would air get hotter as you go higher in an inversion?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't there need to be a valley to trap the dense air in to cause the inversion? If it were flat on all sides I've the dense air pocket, the wind would have more options in terms of direction to dissipate the air.</p></div>		</li>
