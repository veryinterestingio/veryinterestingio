			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a nurse in Interventional Radiology and I watch paracentesis procedures every day. 19 and 20 L is the most we ever see. I always want to take pictures of before and after but can't and I couldn't share them anyway. Stupid HIPPA. The difference can be astonishing. Hell, 6 L can make a huge difference in people's physical appearance. Also, 1 L = 1kg = 2.2 lbs. So people can drop some legit pounds in about 15 minutes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if you start getting ascites and get to this drastic point of needing to be 'drained' weekly, were you able to curb it and stop that and 'heal' the condition? Presumably by drinking drastically less or nothing at all? It's not 'permanent' after a certain point?</p>
<p>This whole thread is making me really plan to curb my weekday drinks and save it just for the weekends. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was like this for about a month and a half, with lower amounts before and after. All together about 7 months. At the high point I hadn't drank for six months. I stopped retaining fluid eventually. Still have a long way to go though. My kidneys and liver are very damaged. Anyway, alcohol abuse will cause severe health issues eventually. I recommend just weekends or better yet not drinking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn, you think you got it and then you realize you are addicted.  Never expected it or anything.  Nah, “you got this”. “You won’t get addicted.” No.  You will.  And you will wake up one day regretting it and seeing what a missed opportunity you truly had... ugh.</p>
<p>Thanks for the silver fren :). Sorry it had to be under these circumstances, but I still appreciate it!</p></div>		</li>
