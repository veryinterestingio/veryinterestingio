			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, there is also the question of information content, or entropy. For example, in English text, there are always 26 possible choices for the next letter, but not all of them are equally likely. If you have ‘th’ on the page, the next letter is almost definitely ‘e’ for ‘the’. So probabilistically, you kind of have only two choices, ‘e’ and everything else. When people measure English, they find that on average you only ‘use’ about 2-3 of the 26 letters (or 1.3 bits of information instead of 4.7 bits).</p>
<p>I imagine something similar would happen in music. I’m sure someone has tried to estimate this mathematically, but you can also just do a thought experiment and get something close. Let’s say we limit ourselves to a 4 bar melody because lots of music repeats after 4 bars. And let’s say we limit ourselves to eighth note rhythms. And let’s say for every eighth note we have three choices - go up the scale, go down the scale, or hold the same note. Even with this pretty restrictive set of choices, we wind up with 3^32 possible melodies. That’s 1.9e15 - more than 200,000 songs for every person alive. So if everyone on earth sat at the piano at 120 bpm and banged on the keys like monkeys at a typewriter for 40 hours a week, we’d play all the possible songs under this framework in about 3 months as long as no one played anything twice.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very true. Many composers follow sets of rules based on what kind of music they are composing, and this can limit what they choose next. For example that if there is a chord progression of I-V, it is extremely common and almost a rule that you would end it with a I, to be I-V-I. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an important thought, since what the human mind usually considers as harmonious music is a HUGELY smaller subset of the possible harmonies -- like you said, probably 90% of current popular music in most countries leans vastly disproportionately on home key pentatonic scale (5 notes out of 12) and extremely heavily favors starting/returning to the tonic (I) almost always as a result of having visited the dominant (V) and this cadence can then be altered in just a few ways to produce all the common progressions seen in most (popular) music styles -- I/IV/V, II/V/I etc.</p>
<p>I understand the topic is about the theoretically possible permutations, but the fact is that most music only uses perhaps a tiny percent of the available note options (not to mention timbre choices considered appealing to the ear vs noise etc.) -- I doubt most people here listen to modern 12-tone music or very 'out there' stuff like Stockhausen where the choices might widen substantially from the strict adherence to harmony (not to mention 4/4 type rhythms etc.).</p>
<p>So, yeah, most of the flighty mathematical speculation above and below here and talk of Fourier transforms delineating n\^x permutations possible etc. have little to do with most 'music' that the human brain would find palatable.... at least in 2018.  My opinion there</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with that is that the majority of it won't be even decent. You need to involve a lot more music theory if you want to produce something that sounds good overall, and then you need to teach the program to break the rules occasionally to make the song interesting, and then you have to teach it <em>when</em> to break them so that we can assign emotional meaning to the piece overall. At that point, it basically has to pass the Turing Test but in a much more difficult medium. Or you just make it totally random and accept that the vast majority of it won't be worth listening to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems like that answer considers all sound within the audible spectrum.  To be fair, what makes music is pretty subjective. But if we're talking all possible combinations sampled frequencies in a finite time length, with consideration of the volumes of each frequency, it seems like that's too broad a swath.  It's all sound, not all musical combinations (and that might be okay because of the subjective nature of what is music).</p>
<p>For instance, load two minute wave file of a dog barking and then a two minute file of a musical piece - they both are valid values in the original spectrum of possibilities defined above.  Or am I misunderstanding the answer? It seems it gives a range of possibility of all audible frequency combinations of anything audible. It covers the answer, but it seems broad. Please correct me if I'm wrong. IANAS.</p>
<p>The same song file, but remastered so that the dynamic range is different, or put through mastering reverb would occupy a unique value set and by the answer's qualifications, could be considered unique, but a human would know it's the exact same song, just louder, less dynamic, etc. Even the same song with a bump in EQ of =1 db at 10K would qualify as a unique result, but still would be the same song.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>To answer OP's question, wouldn't there need to be boundaries set: what tuning (equal temperament or non), what scales, etc.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also, most pop music is rehashed chords with the various instruments changing, differences in rhythm maybe, some recycled-but-slightly-different lyrics. No one seems to mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely it depends on what constitutes a different song. I mean the answer above included one song transposed into all 12 keys and the same song transposed in all those keys but then the tubing is different. It the same song except one of the notes is changed in a single drum fill out something like that. This is a very valid point. That what defines a distinct song is a tough question to answer that people have really struggled with for a long time. We don't even have a good definition of that in legal terms right now. </p>
<p>The answer covers the question of &quot;are there a finite number of 5 minutes songs&quot;. The answer is yes. How big that number is depends highly on how you define a song. </p>
<p>There literally are noise artists where they combine random noise to make &quot;music&quot; so I am fine with that being a song. But there are you know 2^16 possibilities for that 5 min audio file to have every single sample be the same value which would just be nothing. No song at all. So you would probably have to remove that. </p>
<p>So the question of how many unique songs you could make is a whole other question where you first have to define what constitutes a unique song. If you ignore temoo, and key signature and just focus on distinct note patterns the question gets a lot smaller. But then also consider this. If tempo doesn't matter then you are ignoring the 5 minute song limit. And then the question is the same song that is 5 mins when played double time so 2.5 minutes a distinctly unique song? Not in the musical sense. So in that context what does the time mean? Not a whole lot. </p>
<p>But then when you go down that rabbit hole you can have  limitless number of verses which means you can't limit the song length and then you can say &quot;hey there is an infinite number of songs.&quot; </p>
<p>BUT even with that it is unclear. Because if in terms of how we as humans interpret a song if you take a 2 minute song play it and then add like 5 minutes or more versus is that a whole knew song or is it a variation of the original? Or is it really two songs back to back? </p>
<p>How you answer that question makes a huge difference. Because then it you say &quot;that's the songs back to back&quot; that would open another can of worms or where do you draw the line? So then is a series of verses and choruses put together are they one song are a series of different songs? </p>
<p>Bassically you need to answer this question with some limitations. Or else it's meaningless and confusing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These are some really good new points you add to the conversation here .  It really does make you think about what qualities of two different audio recordings make them perceived as &quot;unique songs.&quot; You can do all sorts of things to a bitstream:  Compression, equalization, reverb, phasing, distortion...things that I imagine change the digital information around a great deal...yet in the vast majority of cases it's easily recognized as the exact same song.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I can pick up a guitar and pick an existing song, use its basic chord progression and some of its riffs as a template, modify them a little, write some new lyrics and a different vocal melody, play and sing it myself, and it's perceived as a completely different song.  And it's not even limited to a &quot;real&quot; instrument.  In the hands of a sufficiently skilled DJ/Producer, a &quot;unique song&quot; can be crafted by careful slicing, splicing, and manipulation of existing audio.</p>
<p>So really, it seems like there's something to music that's not captured in the collection of bits that make up a WAV or MP3 file.  It sounds counter-intuitive, I know, because in theory all the information should be there, or else how would our computers play the music?</p>
<p>Is there something more than information theory, signal processing, or acoustics going on here?  Something hidden in the human brain we don't yet fully understand?  I have a feeling that music is finite only insofar as human experience is finite...</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a cool approach to answer the question, but I think its missing something. Pardon my lack of information theory knowledge.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a song that is exactly two notes, where the sum of the note durations are a fixed length of time. You can have a truly infinite number of songs by adjusting the two note lengths by infinitesimally small amounts, which you can do since both note durations have continuous values.</p>
<p>Of course in an information sense, you could simply define this song as two real numbers. And obviously in order to notate this song at arbitrarily narrow lengths of time, you would need an increasing number of decimal places. The number of decimal places is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(signal_processing)" target="_blank">quantization noise</a>, similar to noise in an AWGN channel and so I think Shannon-Hartley still applies here. But even still, you can make that quantization noise arbitrarily small. It just takes an arbitrarily large amount of data. So really, there can be a truly infinite amount of fixed-length music.</p>
<p>The constraint I think you're looking for is fixed entropy, rather than fixed length. (Again, not an information theory person so maybe this conclusion isn't quite right).</p>
<p>Now this is less science and more personal opinion from a musician's perspective, but I don't think it's artistically/perceptually valid to assume fixed entropy, and I have the same objection to vsauce's video. While yes, there is a finite number of possible 5-minute mp3's, music is not limited to 5-minute mp3's. John Cage wrote a piece <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_Slow_as_Possible" target="_blank">As Slow as Possible</a> that is scheduled to be performed over 639 years! Laws of thermodynamics aside, from a human perspective I think there is no limit here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So quantization noise is important, but that is actually a distinct implementation.</p>
<p>The Shannon-Hartley theorem is so cool precisely because it does not need to consider a discrete alphabet. In fact, to prove the direct portion of the Shannon-Hartley you have to choose finite sequences from continuous distributions. </p>
<p>Notice my definition of two songs being distinct is that they can be reliably discerned. It is not that the two noiseless waveforms are distinct. The number of differing continuous waveforms is of course <del>countably</del> uncountably infinite.</p>
<p>To restrict the answer to a finite set, all that you need to add to the consideration is noise. Considering any possible physical environment  (such as a concert hall or recording studio) would contain some noise there then exists a finite set of songs that would in fact be unique. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By this same reasoning then, there are a finite number of lengths of rope between 0m and 1m (or any other maximum length), because at some point, we're unable to measure the change in length below the &quot;noise floor&quot; of actual atomic motion (or other factors that randomly shift the lenght of the rope such as ambient forces of air molecules on the rope, etc), so we might as well digitize the length at a depth that extends to that maximum realistic precision, and then we have a finite number of possible outcomes. Right? I'm not disputing the argument, just making sure I understand it. The entire thing rests on the notion that below the noise floor, measurement is invalid, therefore only the measurements above the noise floor matter and that range can always be sufficiently digitized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes indeed - answers to this question usually rely on oversimplified definitions of a &quot;note.&quot; </p>
<p>You can attack this with math, but your answer will be wrong. For example - assume a symphony lasts an hour. Assume it has a maximum tempo of x bpm. Assume the fastest notes played are x divisions of a quarter note. Assume no more than y instruments play at once. Work out the number of permutations of each note in each instrument range... And that's the maximum number of one hour symphonies. </p>
<p>Except it isn't, because music is not made of notes. Music is made of structured audible events. In some kinds of music, some of the events can be approximated by what people think of as &quot;notes&quot;, but even then any individual performance will include more or less obvious variations in timing, level, and tone. And even <em>then</em>, the audible structures - lines, riffs, motifs, changes, modulations, anticipations, counterpoint, imitation, groove/feel/expression and so on - define the music. The fact that you used one set of notes as opposed to another is a footnote.</p>
<p>And even if you do limit yourself to notes, you still have to define whether you're talking about composed music - i.e. notes on a page - or performed/recorded/heard music, which can be improvised to various extents. </p>
<p>The answers based on information theory are interesting but wrong for a different reason. Most of the space covered by a random bitstream will be heard as noise with none of the perceptual structures required for music. </p>
<p>It's like asking how many books can be written, and including random sequences of letters. There is no sense in which hundreds of thousands of random ASCII characters can be read as a book - and there is no sense in which Shannon-maximised channels of randomness will be heard as distinct compositions.</p>
<p>So the only useful answer is... it depends how you calculate it, and how well you understand music. Enumerating note permutations is not a useful approach. Nor is enumerating the space of possible sample sequences in a WAV file.</p>
<p>To calculate the full extent of &quot;music space&quot; you need to have a full theory of musical semantics and structures, so you can enumerate all of the structures and symbols that have been used in the past, and might appear in the future. People - annoyingly - keep inventing new styles in the music space. So no such theory exists, and it's debatable if any such theory is even possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the answerer clearly stated that it presupposes a fixed time length. And for a fixed time length, there are a finite number of digital audio representations of sound. This must include everything conceivable as music, although you rightly point out that it will include vastly more than that in the form of noise and &quot;unstructured&quot; material. The only way the answer is incorrect is when you lift the time constraint. You don't need a theory of musical structure to answer OP's question which is only about the finitude or infinitude of musical possibility. Granted, as the original answerer did, if you lift the time constraint the problem becomes intractable and the number of possibilities extends infinitely, but even if you cap the length at 5 millenia, you're still in a finite space of possible human-discernable sequences of sound events.</p>
<p>I think the most legitimate counter-argument to the answer is that a music recording is not a complete representation of musical experience. The same recording can be played back in different contexts and will be felt as different musical experiences. A rock concert where everyone around you is head banging is much different than listening at home in headphones. And because music is always perceived contextually, even a finite set of recordings becomes infinite its possible range of experience.</p></div>		</li>
