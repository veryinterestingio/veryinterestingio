<p>No, you are!</p>
<p>Seriously, though, thanks for the tip. I didn't think of that before, and it might have affected some egg-based meals. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, moisture can pass through. Of course the shell is a barrier, so it's not the same as just pouring water over a cracked egg, but the semi-permeable membrane allows water molecules to diffuse through. There are a couple ways to test this. You can submerge a raw egg in water with food coloring and when you crack it, the egg will be dyed. Conversely, if you submerge an egg in corn syrup, water will flow the other way and the egg will shrivel up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember putting eggs in vinegar as a kid and they would swell up and the shell would seem like it disappeared. It's been a long time but I'm pretty sure I'm remembering that right. Is that a form of osmosis or something with the vinegar?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this is the reason why people put a pinch of salt when boiling eggs. It will cause the eggs to shrink a little and the shell can then be removed easily. </p></div>		</li>
