			<div class="markdown"><p>You've heard of most of them--self-driving cars, phasing out coal, etc. But here's one that's not on anyone's radar: SIT (sterile insect technique) for mosquitoes!</p>
<p>With climate change, mosquitoes are advancing northward incredibly fast, making more people sick in more places. Insecticide and genetic engineering are both problematic. But Verily (Google's sister company) performed an amazing test in 2017, 2018, and 2019, where they released millions upon millions of modified males into Fresno, CA. (Not genetically--just infected by a harmless common bacteria that made their offspring non-viable.) Within a single summer, the mosquito population dropped by 95%!</p>
<p>Their next experiment is Singapore--they're going to try to eliminate Dengue fever entirely! This is the kind of safe, smart approach that gives me real hope!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! I had seen the documentary on the genetically modified mosquitoes, and was worried about the second order effects of that approach.  </p>
<p>Iâ€™ll follow up on this and read more about SIT tonight.  </p>
<p>Thanks for that - it certainly gives me hope too!  Cheers</p></div>		</li>
