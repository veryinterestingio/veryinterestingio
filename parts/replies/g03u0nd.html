			<div class="markdown"><p>To answer OP's question, the laws of physics limit the condensation rate from air to liquid. You can only cool off a certain amount of air at time depending on your surface area. Because of this limiting factor, the water in the clouds cannot all instantly fall. </p>
<p>Think of a cloud as a volume of water, and the surface area acts like osmosis. Osmosis is transferring water through a semi-permeable material. The material will let water seep through, but very slowly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even if this were theoretically possible anyway, everything in the atmosphere is gradients and mixes of conditions, so it would be literally impossible for a cloud to just instantly have the pressure changed on it.</p></div>		</li>
