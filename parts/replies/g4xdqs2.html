			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty accurate. I'd expand that while satellite imaging technology existed during the SR-71s reign, it's the cost equation that killed the program.  The SR-71s were aging and replacement would need to be considered. Additionally, they required special fuel and thus an entire independent global refueling network which added considerable expense.</p>
<p>Coupled with emerging surface to air missiles that could intercept them (modern ones are just being able to even hit low satellites), retiring the SR-71 with no replacement was an economic decision.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also at the time the satellites taking picture were still doing it on films. So basically you would launch a satellite, and have it reenter after a few orbits to recover the pictures (with a helicopter, while the payload was hanging from a parachute). That is quite expensive.</p>
<p>Edit: they just caught a canister with the film: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona_(satellite" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona_(satellite</a>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Somewhat unclear from your post, but the satellite itself wouldn't re-enter. It would eject the film canister which would re-enter and be caught in mid-descent by a helicopter or plane. Fascinating stuff, really.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think before the SR-71 the common solution was to go higher as they did with the U-2.</p>
<p>Higher the anti aircraft guns could reach, higher then the enemy fighter planes could fly.
In that time if they could not reach you with their guns or get behind you and fire somekind of unguided missile, you where safe.</p>
<p>In response everyone developed fighter planes that could go higher.
So the next step was to make the surveillance planes faster.
So the fighters also got faster and the missiles too.
Just look at the MIG-25</p>
<p>With fast and guided missiles, be it from air or ground, the speed increase lost all of it's appeal.</p>
<p>In the end, the lower aerodynamic footprint of a missile will win every race with a faster plane that will have to carry humans and a huge amount of fuel for a long distance mission.</p>
<p>Maybe with great cost we could build a plane with flying with mach 5, 6 or 7.
But there already are missiles almost that fast.</p>
<p>It's the same with maneuverability.
Back in the day the guy with the machinegun could be outmaneuvered, the same with the straight flying missiles.
The first guided missiles had target systems with a very limited field of view, so you could still outmaneuvered by a clever pilot.
Nowadays some systems can hit planes right behind you.
So no more topgun romantics.</p>
<p>It's just a question of who pulls the trigger first.
So radar, stealth, range of missiles are way more important then dogfight skills. </p>
<p>The whole air combat game got way more strategic.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Part of the thing with high speed high altitude planes is mach 7 isn't always enough to actually hit the planes. If you do the math on the SR71, you essentially have to fire a mach 6 missile when the SR71 is something like 50 miles away and inbound, and if everything works it might hit the plane 50 miles after it passes. So the missile needs to do 75 miles at mach 7. If you had a plane that went faster you would need to fire the missile at the plane before it came over the horizon and it would need to go significantly faster than the plane. In practice, something like the SR71 is still hard to hit because even with a good enough missile, you have to be really fast with targeting.</p>
<p>We only hit satelites because we can measure their orbit for days, and predict their location, and then lob a missile in front of it so it hits. And it only works because the sattelite has no avoidance mechanisms at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The U2 was so fast and high the Soviets could not intercept it - their jets weren't fast or high enough. They finally shot down Gary Powers with a lucky missile shot, and rumor has it the intercepting aircraft pushed the limits and basically destroyed its engine doing so.  The SR71 was higher and faster again, but as the Soviets perfected smarter and more powerful missiles, the risk became too great. </p>
<p>The US was pretty sure Gary Powers died and his U2 had been destroyed when it crashed, so Eisenhower denied the Americans had been overflying Russia, Then the Soviets trotted out Powers, who survived, for a live-on-TV confession. He was eventually traded for one of our prisoners.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another reason the SR-71 was still needed in the early years of satellite surveillance is just coverage. We only had a few satellites and the people we wanted to watch had a pretty good idea of what orbits they were in. Usually the inclination of the orbit was selected to make sure the satellite would pass over certain military establishments. So knowing the orbit, the soviets knew what to hide and when to hide it.</p>
<p>If we wanted to see something at a different location or even just at a different time, we would send an SR-71 out. It's important to point out, that's no trivial task. An SR-71 mission required a world wide network of air-air fuel tankers as well as spotters at takeoff and landing (including spotters available at alternate landing locations).</p>
<p>I'm sure we and other countries still keep track of when there's not a satellite looking at certain military establishments, but with how many satellites there are in various orbits, the amount of time between passes is probably a lot less. When it's just one satellite watching you, you get a 6ish hour window where you're not in range. Adding a handful more greatly reduces that so hiding things only at certain times is no longer practical. Plus, we have tons of satellites in polar orbits that pass over a different area every period essential photographing the whole globe over a longer time interval. This means the targets can't just build something in a new location without us being able to get pictures of it.</p>
<p>Basically our satellite surveillance system has improved so much that spy planes are just obsolete. Why fly a mission into a sovereign country's airspace when you can just get images from a satellite that's going to pass over anyways?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the official strategy for SR-71s to deal with missiles is to outrun them. They're insane planes, they leak fuel on the tarmac because they are designed with gaps in the body so that when it's at speed, the heat causes expansion which then seals the plane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Satellites can be hit by missiles, and pre-date the SR-71 It's just not done because everyone orbits over everyone else. The SR-71 was extremely expensive to fly for a whole host of reasons. Also it wasn't all that reliable, crashing over enemy territory is about the same as getting shot down. It should also be noted that it's retirement came about during the open skies negotiations. If everyone agrees to let everyone fly spy planes over each other. You don't need bleeding edge technology to conduct those missions so why keep it in service?</p>
<p>E: Sats are easier than SR-71s to shoot mostly because a satellite is highly predictable and can't maneuver. Anti air or sat missiles work by calculating where you are going to be when it gets there, and will try and meet you there. Generally speaking. So avoidance maneuvers baisicly serve the purpose of making that math harder and or unsolvable. A satellite will come around the earth at a known time, speed, altitude and angle. If a country had the technology to get a rocket to near orbit, they can solve that math problem. Blackbirds show up when they want, where they want at up to 3.5 times the speed of sound, and can change those things at any time during it's flight. Often by the time a math problem can be presented it's no longer solvable. Or if a solution exists all that speed can simply put it out of reach again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus, missiles got &quot;smarter&quot;. At the time, air-to-air missiles were fired from chase planes. Now they have surface-to-air (SAM) with the radar and/or heat seeking to lock onto a plane. They don't need the speed because they can come at it from forward, and maneuvering doesn't shake the missile.  We've seen assorted shows where aircraft drop metal chaff to confuse radar, and flares to confuse heat-seekers; but there's always laser targeting, where the missile is directed by a laser either built in and locked on, or from the ground. </p>
<p>It's almost like it was an arms race.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And what they are doing is flying to a launch box, simulating firing cruise missiles. The premise is a pretty scary one, which is that when they did decide to begin a nuclear war the flight would yield an actual barrage of nuclear tipped cruise missiles (which they now have, purportedly, hypersonic variants). Those cruise missiles are the assurance that even if the whole &quot;star wars&quot; missile defense thing got some or all ballistic missiles, there's lots of fearsome cruise missiles that are very hard to shoot down.</p></div>		</li>
