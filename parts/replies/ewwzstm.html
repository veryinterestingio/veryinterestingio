			<div class="markdown"><p>It all depends - there are a lot of factors that affect wild fish coloring. A lot of the &quot;impractical&quot; colors probably come from old world cichlids - especially Lake Tanganyika or Lake Malawi. Others come from South America - especially tannin heavy blackwater rivers. </p>
<p>But hey, there are plenty of beautiful species native to north america/the US - my favorite is probably the Okefenokee Sunfish. Also there are a ton of amazing looking darter species - orangethroat or blue mask darters in breeding colors are stunning.</p>
<p>A lot of fish you find are bred in captivity specifically to attract a particular color or pattern. The same practices that took wolves and turned some of their descendants into pugs took your regular goldfish and turned it into a bubble eye or a wild guppy into a leopard tail x blue tuxedo. Or they get created in captivity - one of the first genetically modified animals to be patented/commercially sold is actually an aquarium fish. The glofish - they're genetically engineered with bioluminescent jellyfish DNA.</p>
<p>Beyond that, a lot of it is just the conditions they're kept in - food and lighting can be selected to enhance the colors of a fish or display thing. In general aquarium fish have access to better conditions and food (most are probably overfed actually)</p></div>		</li>
