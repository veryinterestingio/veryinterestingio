			<div class="markdown"><p>The clouds from large nuclear detonations, of which many were set off in the Cold War, move globally, dropping little bits of radiation as they go. <a href="https://twitter.com/wellerstein/status/1072594664216281089" target="_blank">Here are some maps showing where the clouds from the first two H-bombs set off by the USA in 1952 and 1954 went</a>. The net result of this kind of testing (and the US, Soviet Union, UK, France, and China tested hundreds of bombs in the atmosphere) means that there are tiny remnants of these explosions everywhere on the planet. This is one of the reasons that atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons was largely banned in 1963.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chemically they act the same as their inert isotopes (a big bonus for nuclear plant designers when figuring out how to extract specific elements is being able to use inert isotopes so they don’t need radiological shielding), and would reflect light in the same way.  In theory a sufficiently advanced sensor in our solar system could detect the radiation levels and see they’re from fission which doesn’t happen enough on the surface to be naturally occurring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I realised this when watching Chernobyl, I was wondering why they went to such lengths to hide it from the rest of the world and it was because the radiation moves in the upper atmosphere and contaminates as it goes!  So they were accountable to the rest of the world.  So fascinating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, large clusters of nuclear detonations have happened in these regions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pacific Islands (Americans, French and British)</li>
<li>Australia (British)</li>
<li>North Africa (French and British)</li>
<li>Western North America (Americans and British)</li>
<li>Siberia (Soviets)</li>
<li>Central Asia (Soviets, Chinese)</li>
<li>Indian subcontinent (India, Pakistan)</li>
<li>Far East (USA in WWII, North Korea)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLCF7vPanrY&amp;t=733s" target="_blank">Here's a video showing the detonations from 1945 to 1998</a> (very likely that you were already alive by then, actually).</p>
<p>(LATE EDIT: forgot to post the video!)</p></div>		</li>
