			<div class="markdown"><p>How did it land safely? Manual control? The landing capability of rockets is mainly what spurred my intrigue with spaceX.  I know that is different.</p>
<p>However those self landing rockets have millions of computer calculations that go into stabilizing it and controlling the landing.  And I’m sure millions of simulations were done to get to this point.  </p>
<p>Did they put that all in the hand of the crew?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neil Amstrong (despite the advice of all the scientists at mission control) landed manually. </p>
<p>there is a famous story of an astronaut manually firing rockets and valves to return from orbit:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The astronauts had to have final control; there simply weren't the automated systems and sensors to even begin to do it any other way, back then. They couldn't be sure exactly where the module would touch down; they couldn't be sure what would be on the landing site; they weren't even sure whether the surface would be entirely solid (one distinct possibility being touted at the time was that some of the flatter areas of the surface could be dust pools of an unknown depth). There WAS a digital computer on board, but we're talking extremely early stuff here - the phone in your pocket has around 100K times as much processing power. The best piloting computer on board was the sheer experience in the grey matter between Amstrong's ears. And in the end the landing was seat-of-the-pants stuff - they had about 15 seconds-worth of fuel left when they touched down, according to Buzz Aldrin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The landing could be hand flown or computer flown.  All the landings were hand flown though.</p>
<p>The process for landing on the moon itself isn’t that hard.  The lower gravity gives you 3x more time to react.  Also, because of the lack of air, it becomes a simple physics problem to land.</p>
<p>edit: slight typo, I typed 30x instead of 3x.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AFAIK it's slightly more subtle than &quot;hand flown&quot;. It was a combination of the computer controlling all the right angles and throttles, but the pilot essentially had a switch to go &quot;lower&quot; or &quot;higher&quot;, so he could control the rate of descend. The biggest problem was to pick a good spot to land without too many boulders or craters, so that's essentially what the pilot was controlling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea but didn’t they only have just enough fuel? I read that Neil only had a few seconds of fuel left when he landed because thrusting uses it up. He barely was able to land but did it. Also they had a computer problem that almost stranded them but they used a pen or something to take off.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It really was! </p>
<p>The Apollo Program cost $163 billion in today's dollars or about $16 billion per year.  And that does not account for the faster than inflation increases in things like skilled labor, construction, manufacturing, etc. SpaceX operates on about $2 billion a year and NASA, in total, is only about $20 billion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get this, and this is the most logical explanation so far.  The Hail Mary attempt seems to be the only explanation.  </p>
<p>However coming from a computer science background, technology has advanced exponentially in the last 60 years.  </p>
<p>Additionally NASA is five years away from going back.  </p>
<p>I in no way want to put on a tin foil cap here, and I fully believe that we went, it just seems impossible today which makes it more than impossible 60 years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. The chain of production for Apollo hardware is long gone and it was titanic. One of the reasons current space startups are creating such an industry splash has to do with the government being one of the only games in town as far as customers go. This means the current official NASA sponsored launch system is just made of recycled shuttle parts so as to maintain the jobs at the sites that build each component. This is wildly inefficient and comes at a much higher cost than nominal, but prices in the space industry public sector are a hotly debated mess.</p>
<p>The moonshot had a nation laser focused on a goal, while anything a fraction of that scale today would go to die in congress.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that the need to go further than low earth orbit is not there. Why would SpaceX go to the moon? There is nothing there. They couldn't earn money with it. That's why noone was to the moon for last 50 years. Only very lately SpaceX sparked the interest for further exploration again with their Mars program.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The need isn't currently there. The goals of Moon then mars aren't de-facto cost effective but they enable asteroid mining technology (low cost, high payload etc).  Asteroid mining *if* it could be made cost effective could be massively profitable; and 'coincidentally' for substances like lithium (light, relatively abundant in asteroids) may be the best source.We tend to be focused only on 'Moon and Mars' but really they're the stretch goals which enable a host of other benefits.<br />
