			<div class="markdown"><p>Deadlifts (barbell), kettlebell swings (kettlebells), pull-up/chin-ups and back bridges (body weight/calisthenics) are all good options.
I’m in my 30’s and if I don’t do kettlebell swings 2-3 times a week my lower back starts to ache. I have a few at home so for me that’s the easiest option to stick to regularly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Deadlifts and rows are back fixers. You don't have to do them super heavy like everyone thinks, just get those back and glute muscles working.</p>
<p>I used to have a &quot;bad&quot; back, it was just a weak back from sitting around too much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really like yoga because you can get a strong core/back workout but also do flexibility and other things.</p>
<p>I found that doing a routing focusing on core with some &quot;flows&quot; (these are a series of positions that flow one into the next) was really good and after a week of 30 minute sessions in the morning it greatly reduced back pain I had from poor posture from sitting on my couch during lockdown.</p>
<p>There are tons of tutorials online and you basically only need comfy clothes with good freedom of movement and a yoga mat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've done at least 30min of yoga a day since March and it's been a godsend. I'm 27 and fairly sedentary and I've never had more muscle in my life than now just from learning how to properly do chaturanga and other upper body strength poses.</p>
<p>I use a mix of live classes from a local studio and auto-generated sessions from an app called Down Dog. It's 100% the best thing I got into this year. Finally achieving a pose you've been working toward is so rewarding, and the mindfulness aspect has been helpful in staying sane in this chaotic world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yoga with Adriene is a great place to start! She has tons of free YouTube channels and beginner playlists and videos that breakdown specific poses so you can get the alignment right from home and not hurt yourself. </p>
<p>I’m 27 and my upper back and necker were chronically tight and NOTHING helped—heat, massage, etc. Then I started exercising regularly, doing mostly yoga for 45 minutes a day. You don’t need to do it for that long. Anything helps!</p>
<p>I can sit in a cheap kitchen chair for 8 hours a day working from home and my back doesn’t hurt at all. The difference is incredible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This: Yoga saved my back. Check vinyasa yoga, bridge pose, warrior 3, etc... I reinforced my core and balance, got way more flexible as well as learned to stand straight. For whatever you want to do, even if it's sitting in front of the tv, yoga is the base.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Step aside kids....
I’m 53 and for the most part experience no back pain.</p>
<p>Swim, yoga, stretching, exercise. Anything that stretches you wi the out damaging you is a great way to go. During the pandemic I went back to nuke riding because the pools were all closed and started to suffer lower back issues due to it hitting parts of my body I hadn’t worked on. THC at bed time and a heating pad fixed it in 2 days and now I’m riding daily with no pains. You might also invest in a good mattress.</p></div>		</li>

<h1>Results</h1>
<p>Abdominal muscle strength of subjects in the low back pain group, and with history of falling, was significantly lower compared with that of subjects in the non-low back pain group, and in subjects without a history of falling, respectively. There was a moderate positive correlation between abdominal trunk muscle strength and one-leg standing time with eyes open.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By age 40, 78% of people have disc degeneratio to a degree, partially due to age but also because of habitual posture and overloading our L5S1 vertebrae. . Make sure you’re not putting yourself in postures that overload your low back. Consider yoga. Being kind to your spine doesn’t mean you stop being fit. You can help reduce the pain significantly and still be muscular.</p></div>		</li>
