<p>5 years old, bed of a Ford Ranger.</p>
<p>16 years old, bed of a Ford F-150.</p>
<p>Friends that had trucks, I'm in the bed, standing up at 90 mph on the interstate bc I was stupid.</p>
<p>Fucking good times, even I'm amazed I'm I'm still here. Lol!</p>
<p>Edit: kids, don't be me. I have had 7 broken bones, one hyper-extended knee (2 torn ligaments, no cartilage in my right knee, chipped and bruised bones), 3 concussions, and more random scars than I'd care to admit.</p></div>		</li>
