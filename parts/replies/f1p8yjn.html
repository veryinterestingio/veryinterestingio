			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, don’t be confused by books that carry the tagline “by New York Times #1 Bestselling Author”.  This means that the same author has previously had a <em>different</em> book reach #1 on the list, not the one you’re looking at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of that, I believe many books will just leave out the #1 part, so as long as that author has had one book on the list at any rank, they can put &quot;by New York Times Bestselling Author&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean yeah, that's what that statement is saying lol I don't think that's a trick, it's pretty clear. Bestselling author. It's sort of on the consumer if that somehow confuses them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Publication dates and many books actually don’t get second run in paperback (but anything that hits the NYT list will) Let’s say hardcover comes out first and hits the list for two weeks, then 6 months later the paperback comes out and doesn’t hit the list at all. Shows the book didn’t have a lot of lasting popularity</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hardcover books are considered &quot;more prestigious&quot; usually from established authors and released for an exclusive period of time before the paperback comes out. It's sort of like being able to see a movie in the theater vs renting it. They differentiate because they're considered two different markets and comparing numbers is apples to oranges.</p></div>		</li>
