			<div class="markdown"><p>Plant require O2 just like you do, to process the sugar into energy. That sugar is produced by photosynthesis taking in CO2 and that gives off O2 which they can reuse which is why a sealed terrarium works but if you create an environment where the O2 is removed before the plants use it they wont do well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plants actually take in O2 when there’s not enough sunlight to photosynthesize, even just for short periods like at night. They don’t constantly intake CO2 and output O2 like a lot of people think. Like you said, they’ll suffocate if you deprive them of oxygen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plants are really the combination of two organisms.  A free-living bacterium engulfed another bacterium (a cyanobacterium) that could photosynthesize.  So they are descended from oxygen breathing organisms that just internalized another organism that could make food for it to eat.  They still need oxygen in order to use that food that the internalized organism makes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What about methane? As far as I understand it it doesn't have to come from a biological source and it also existed on the early Earth as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP asked if fires were uncommon, not totally lacking. Yes rare sources like a methane seep?spring?leak? could burn. No it doesn't have to come from biological material (see Titan) but its also going to not be found in large concentrations unless biology produced it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In a hydrogen-saturated, low-oxygen environment, carbon is expected to be found locked up in methane. There is vastly more methane in the atmosphere of Titan (over 5%) than in Earth's atmosphere (1.8 ppm).</p>
<p>The biological part here is that we don't expect to see both methane <em>and</em> free oxygen in an atmosphere without biology supporting that disequilibrium. For atmospheres without free oxygen, methane concentration can climb very high.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most oil forms 252 to 66 million years ago long after plants appear on land.  Oil also tends to form in shallow seas so any older oil (yes there is some) would have to form and be pushed back up above the sea level in order to burn. That older oil is only about 10% of the oil out there, then add the time window for creation and the time to raise it back above the sea and the likelihood is very small.</p></div>		</li>
