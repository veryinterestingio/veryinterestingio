			<div class="markdown"><p>It would depend on the size of the shark and the octopus. But octopi are pretty strong for whatever their size is, have eight limbs to work with, and they’re also quite intelligent. If you YouTube “octopus attacks diver” you can get a pretty good idea of how tricky they can be for even a person to remove once they latch on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fish use gills to extract oxygen from the water, gills look kinda like a book (lots of thin membranes) and require water to constantly move past them both to support the weight of the membranes and to keep them in contact with oxygenated water and move the deoxygenated water away. When held upside down there's no movement of water, it's more the being held than the upside down that does it although being upside down also disorientates them, and their brain starts to shut down due to lack of oxygen. Similar to how some snakes constrict, it stops your diaphragm contracting which creates negative pressure in your lungs and sucks air in. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I chased down the rabbit hole for 10 minutes and could not find anything beyond speculation.  Perhaps a more knowledgeable person will see it and enlighten us both!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah they (octopuses) have had 400 million years to take over the planet and they didn't. Theories say its maybe because fire is mega important to get civilisation and of course fire is not useful to octopi and pretty hard to achieve in water. But I suppose if they ever made the move onto land we might have something to worry about, eventually. </p></div>		</li>
