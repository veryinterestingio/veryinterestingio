			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true! But the 50 years is not 'another guess like fusion'. </p>
<p>The reason for the 50 years is due to it not being financially beneficial to look for more oil as long as you already have reservoirs of 50 years already discovered. </p>
<p>So the 50 years is more like: &quot;Right now we have discovered reservoirs corresponding to 50 years worth, and we are certain there is more than that, buut there is no reason to look for it right now&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's still a useful observation, since it also means &quot;we're not sure if we'll <em>find</em> more oil that we can actually extract.&quot; Not to mention energy demand only goes up and up. I don't think anybody that's taken a few minutes to think will expect every last drop of oil to be exhausted, but it's certainly not unimaginable that scarcity might lead to prices too high to support a country like the US where practically every household has a car.</p>
<p>(However, it's hopefully more likely that alternative / renewable energy becomes inexpensive much faster.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's like fusion in that the estimates are always approximately that far out, 30-50 years. Though right now fusion is over 50 years out thanks to the ITER, DEMO, PROTO timelines being presented and even then there's no promise that PROTO can possibly compete with 50 years of advancements in solar tech which itself takes advantage of an already existing massive fusion reaction in our sky and battery tech which is currently solar and wind's biggest bottleneck.</p>
<p>Oil running out keeps getting pushed back because we make no adjustments for undiscovered oil, like you said, and advancements in technology. But also because we are simply terrible at forecasting basically anything at a global scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technology has advanced over time, and allowed new, increased, and more efficient extraction. Global warming is also opening up huge reserves that were previously unthinkably inaccessible. I think the biggest factors pushing the timeline out were the guesses about increased consumption, and the rise of renewables.</p></div>		</li>
