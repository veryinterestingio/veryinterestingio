<p>If you do a super in-depth genetic test, you can tell the difference between the twins and if you get matching SNPs in the child then you can be sure that that twin fathered the child.</p>

<p>but will it be as accurate as a regular dna test? (how in court the scientist will testify it's a 1 in quadrillion chance or whatever)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Um, I'll try to do an ELI5 then a bit more technical below it:</p>
<p><strong>Simple</strong></p>
<p>Everyone has DNA but not everyone's DNA is the same.  You can chop up a sample of someone's DNA using a <em>restriction enzyme</em> which is a special type of protein.  When you chop up their DNA, you get <em>fragments</em> of all different lengths and my lengths will be different to your lengths because there are small bits of our DNA that are just random and can be different lengths.</p>
<p>So you get a whole bunch of those different lengths and you compare them to the same test on the child.  If enough of them match then you can say that there is a &gt;X% chance that the child is mine (or yours).  You can never ever get to 100% chance because it is possible that we could have the same randomness just by accident.</p>
<p>The super in-depth test goes one step further.  It looks for single changes in the whole length of DNA and it's far, far less likely that those single changes will be the same because you need the same change in exactly the same position.  So it's actually much more accurate than a standard DNA test.</p>
<p><strong>In depth answer</strong></p>
<p>Standard paternity tests use restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) to establish a statistical likelihood that the DNA of the child matches that of the father.  This works because all of our DNA has areas that are filled with short tandem repeats (STR) of &quot;junk&quot; DNA and if you select the restriction site on either side of those STRs then the variability will be quite unique to an individual if you analyse enough of those sites.</p>
<p>The problem is that it's slightly likely that someone else will have the same lengths or will be close enough that the test can't distinguish between them.  This is because separation via gel electrophoresis isn't very sensitive to small changes in the DNA length ie. 1500 bp could look like 1510 bp.  In reality, the chance is pretty small but it <em>can</em> happen.</p>
<p>With the new test linked in the paper, they're looking at changes at the single nucleotide level.  With 4 possibilities for each nucleotide and ~3 billion of them in each person's DNA, you have a quite small chance that another person would have the exact matching SNPs that you have.  You are literally looking at quadrillions (or more) to 1.</p>
<p>In court, you would have to explain that you are looking for a small number of needles in a very, very large haystack.  In the example linked in the paper, they found 5 SNPs which were different.  Assuming each of them are independent (which is probably but not definitely true) then you're looking at a probability of 2.5 in 10^49 ( chance that those SNPs could have randomly been duplicated.</p></div>		</li>
