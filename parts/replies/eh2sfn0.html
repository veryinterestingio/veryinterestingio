			<div class="markdown"><p>I can answer this. It USUALLY goes back to blood flow. Depending on the headache, caffeine can trigger or inhibit a headache. Blood vessels tend to open as a headache comes on and caffeine constricts blood vessels, this inhibiting a headache. </p>
<p>But it’s REALLY easy now a days to over consume caffeine (especially when trying to break a headache). This causes a rebound or crash which can make a headache (especially a migraine) SOOO much worse. </p>
<p>With food, the same as above can apply (about constricting blood vessels) but usually chemical imbalances can cause headaches and if you haven’t been nourished in a while, chemical imbalances are an absolute certainty. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's photophobia, and I noticed I have that too. Photophobia is usually a symptom of migraines or cluster headaches, and are common together. About 80% of people who have a migraine/headache are light sensitive. Not sure exactly what the process is that makes it so painful though.</p></div>		</li>
