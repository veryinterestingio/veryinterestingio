			<div class="markdown"><p>'Pyramid' just defines the shape of the organization, and they can be either straight ponzi schemes or MLM (for lack of a more inclusive term).  MLMs are like AMWAY, and they've always got a bit of something in there for sale like soap or energy drinks.  They're dodgy because they usually depend on recruiting for their real money.  People join, pay fees, the fees go up the pyramid, and people try to recruit others, their own 'downlines'.  Anyone who joins pays their own fees, the one who recruited them gets a cut, as do all the people up the line.  If people move some of the product, the profits too get passed up the line but like I said, most of the real money comes from recruiting new folks.</p>
<p>These things are a bit dodgy because people often don't make much of any money, just pay their fees and get sick of it.  People who recruit you will gloss over this fact.</p>
<p>Ponzi schemes have nothing in them but greed.  People who are recruited early can get paid back plus a bit, but it's just a matter of time before there's no one left to recruit and the whole thing collapses.  People (sometimes) join them not because they don't understand that they're ponzi schemes, but because they think they've gotten in early enough to get some money back before the inevitable collapse.  </p>
<p>Ponzi schemes are straight-up illegal, MLM are not.  Both are pyramid schemes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak to all MLMs, but my wife did an essential oil one for a bit.</p>
<p>In order to get her paycheck she had to be at a certain tier, and one of the tier requirements was buying $100 worth of product.</p>
<p>So it wasn't a &quot;fee&quot; but it was mandatory.</p>
<p>She doesn't do it anymore, at all, but she still gets a little over a hundred each month in paychecks, so she has to buy a lot of the product.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Ponzi scheme is an investment scheme: “you give me $X, and I’ll make it 2x$X” (by telling people in lower levels the same thing, and using their money to pay off the initial investors) </p>
<p>A pyramid scheme would be “give me $X, and I’ll let you on an an opportunity to get rich quick” The opportunity is to just tell more people the same thing, and get their money. </p>
<p>The two are different and (annoyingly) often confused, but the basic idea of no product being sold remains true. Most MLMs function as pyramid schemes by charging a large fee to sell product nobody will buy, and recruiting others to do the same.</p></div>		</li>
