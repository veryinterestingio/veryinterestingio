			<div class="markdown"><p>The good mold in blue cheese is a close relative of the good mold we grow to produce penicillin. Itâ€™s called Penicillium roqueforti and it is perfectly safe to eat. When mold grows on other cheeses after they have been in the fridge too long, those are mystery mold species that just came from the environment and could make you sick</p>
<p>Edit: a shiny!! Thank you!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™ve heard some people are told to avoid it, but my educated guess is that itâ€™s probably fine for most people because penicillin is a specific metabolite produced by a particular Penicillium species, and apparently the cheese-producing species do not produce that same metabolite.</p>
<p>Not a doctor though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a doctor, but I am studying antibiotic production in bacteria. I just downloaded the genome for <em>Penicillium roqueforti</em> and ran it through prediction software we use. This strain of fungus doesn't appear to have the genes required to make Penicillin, so you're likely fine. It also seems from the comments that others with a similar allergy are fine eating bleu cheese.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The wiki for this fungus is really well written and gives you hints about the possible toxicity of this strain and why we can eat it too.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The roqueforti part is because of the cheese. The Penicillium part is because the species has little broom or brush like structures under a microscope, taken from the Latin <em>penicillus</em> for paintbrush. </p>
<p>Penicillium as a genus was discovered and named before the different species were all catalogued, and the yummy cheese mold was named Penicillium roqueforti because it was found to be a Penicillium species after microscopic observation. So /u/CheeseheadDave is correct, I believe Roquefort is a region in France where cheeses like this were traditionally made.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mould has been used for making this cheese long before anyone knew what it was. Once it was studied and classified by scientists, it got this name because this was it's principle use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How far are the cultivated molds able to fend off undesirable ones? </p>
<p>Foods preserved with bacterial help change the environment around until it's no longer easy for anything else to take hold. Dry, salty cheese is a difficult thing to settle on no matter what, but does a camembert mold protect its substrate in some way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The containers and tools used for making cheese are cleaned and sterilized to prevent contamination by wild  bacteria or molds.</p>
<p>Moldy cheeses like Roquefort or Stilton are deliberately inoculated with mold spores  during the cheese making process.</p>
<p>The spores are introduced early in the cheese making process so they have a head start over any random mold spores that may exist in the aging room.</p>
<p>The head start might allow the blue mold to out compete competing molds. I don't think it's likely that the mold creates chemicals to kill off other bacteria/mold as someone mentioned that blue cheese mold doesn't create penicillin while growing.</p></div>		</li>

Camembert and Brie - the white stuff on the outside? That's also mold (and it is the mold that makes it so creamy on the inside)</p></div>		</li>
