How close you are to the earthquake is the other big one, since the seismic waves attenuate or lose amplitude as they travel. Other factors can also play into how far away the shaking can be felt. If the earthquake is shallower the waves don’t have to travel as far to get to you, so the same distance thing comes into play. If the earthquake ruptured toward you instead of away, the shaking can be more intense. If you are standing on solid hard granite it won’t amplify the shaking like if you were standing on unconsolidated jiggly soil or fill. What type of rock the waves travel through can be a factor, with older colder rock like on the Eastern US dampening the seismic waves less than the younger warmer and heavily faulted Western US. That last one is one reason why the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2016/08/23/remembering-the-2011-virginia-earthquake-that-rocked-the-eastern-u-s/?utm_term=.3e45a48fc178" target="_blank">2011 M5.8 Virginia earthquake is likely the most widely felt earthquake ever in the US</a>, because the older colder rocks in the eastern US transmitted the seismic wave energy very effectively to the major population centers in this region.</p></div>		</li>
