			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Both in the bombardment by cosmic rays and general increase in radiation. Saturn is more than 90% hydrogen and the increase in radiation (i.e. temperature at Saturn) would give that hydrogen enough kinetic energy to escape the grasp of Saturn’s weak gravity. As it loses hydrogen it loses mass and gravity weakens even more, before you know it Saturn would be nothing more than a rocky planet.</p>
<p>Edit: changed “tiny planetoid” to “rocky planet”. I meant tiny compared to current day Saturn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In order to form in the first place, there needed to be a rocky planet at last a few earth masses. This planet then got its hydrogen envelope by accretion of the proto planetary gas disc. Meaning even if you strip away all the hydrogen, there will still remain a 'giant' rocky planet. Current estimates put the rocky core at 9-22 earth masses, that's a bit more than a tiny planetoid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt the sun will be in the red giant phase long enough to turn Saturn into a tiny planetoid. Even Mars lost its atmosphere over something like a billion years, and Saturn is way heavier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting! Have we found any planets that were likely gas giants at some point but were stripped by their star? Or would they be so small they are hard to detect with current tech?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. There wouldn't be much of a habitable zone around a red giant sun anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After the sun leaves the main sequence, it only has about 120 million years left, and only about 20 million as a red giant. I'm not sure that that's enough time for most of the methane to be lost, nor enough for the lack of magnetic field to be significant. This process took over a billion years on Mars. It may be that Titan survives the red giant phase as a water world with a very thick N2/EtH/MeH/CO2 atmosphere. Triton is another interesting case. Saturn and even Jupiter won't lose much at all due to very high mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More likely they would become temporary &quot;hot Jupiters&quot; that would phase into &quot;icy Neptunes&quot; as the sun's output fades from a red giant to a white dwarf...right?</p></div>		</li>
