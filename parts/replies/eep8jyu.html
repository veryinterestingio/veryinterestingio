			<div class="markdown"><p>I see. So in an nutshell, it's really then more someone settling deeper into their comfort zone as opposed to moving along the spectrum, if I'm reading that right? As an example, staying home to avoid places with too many people and too-bright lights tends to make be more comfortable leading them to avoid those places more in a self-reinforcing cycle? And getting older tends to make folks less willing to push themselves out of that comfort zone in the first place?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The more common thing would be people getting used to school life/education whilst they are young and then transitioning to the world of work. The structure you are used to is gone. If you have not learned to cope by this point it is much harder to deal with. </p>
<p>One of the biggest things with ASD (at least high functioning which is the form I am most familiar with) in younger people is preference for a routine and difficulties when said routine is broken. A lot of people can learn how to handle this over time, but if you never have the chance it is a lot to take all at once. This stress builds up over time and can lead to other issues.</p>
<p>Not really about comfort zones per se, but more not developing skills you rely on later in life. Hiding in a comfort zone all day would lead to it but it is not the only reason. Some people need support they do not receive or do not get the right type which fails to prepare them. A lot of research points to adults with autism developing anxiety and depression (amongst other mental health issues), which would potentially lead to people becoming a lot more withdrawn as they reach adulthood unfortunately. Depression can lead to a self-reinforcing cycle (even when people don't have ASD), as can anxiety.</p>
<p>On the other hand ageing does not always lead to negative development, there is a lot more support for people who have ASD and a lot of systems in place to help develop coping skills t avoid issues. Hopefully over time enough is understood about it to diagnose almost all children as early as possible and prepare them for later life as much as needed.</p>

<p>&quot;However, depression in those with autism has been found to present in different ways, and is often seen in the form of behavioural changes such as withdrawal, increased aggression or an increase in repetitive or ritualistic behaviour&quot;

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm in my 50's and have ASD, along with either bipolar or schizoaffective disorder (depends on the doctor). It is harder for me nowâ€”it always has been, but I just quit my job of 14 years because I just sat and cried all day. This is with medication. I feel sick when I'm around people (I wish this were not so). We did move around a lot when I was young, so I'm sure that didn't help my coping mechanisms. Anyway, I like your answers; thanks for your helpfulness! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm....would comfort zones then apply to someone older, say in their 50s who's routine really hasn't changed very much for 20 years or so?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>**Edit:** I asking as it seems this response seems to apply more to someone either entering or currently in early adulthood, and less to those older, late middle-age or older.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking as someone with Asperger's, an ADHD wife and three kids on the spectrum in addition to having been a DSW in-class resource for kids on the spectrum:</p>
<p>The coping strategies you list are the aversion kind. Learning what you can't handle and coming up with ways of avoiding them. But there are more outward/positive coping strategies as well. With practice you get better at handling the stuff you struggled with when you're younger. </p>
<p>There is also a change in environment. It's hard to express the vast difference in social environments between school and adult life. School, particularly high school, is an absolute pressure cooker socially. There's just more room for individual quirks in adult life than there are in school. (though schools have been trying hard the past decade to over come this)
In addition, over time people in general have become more knowledgable and more tolerant of autistic issues. Some of the myths about it are fading away. (I grew up in the &quot;refrigerator mother theory&quot; days and I'm glad to see that notion DIE) We're seeing characters in books, TV and other media who are either explicitly on the spectrum (Monk) or display a classic set of symptoms though it's never explicitly mentioned (Dr House, Dr Cooper etc)</p>
<p>Finally, there are changes in brain function and mental perception as we mature out of puberty. In some ways, puberty lasts until your late 20's. I don't know if that means your brain changes and gets &quot;better&quot; or if you just get better at dealing with it mentally because you no longer have all that other adolescent stuff going on between your ears</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To my understanding (I'm a million miles from knowing what I'm talking about) autism and related disorders are diagnosed purely based on the symptoms. How is it meaningful to say that symptoms have become less pronounced but your position on the spectrum hasn't changed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You learn to deal with the symptoms, they don't go away. I have not heard of a case where it dissipates, just gets easier to control. The same things that irritate still irritate, you can still freak out. You don't feel comfortable out in public you just make people think you are. </p>
<p>To tests you may show as being &quot;less autistic&quot; i guess, but it is not the same as moving on the spectrum. The bits of you that don't work right still don't work, you just bypass them.</p>
<p>Best analogy I heard is that if you were born without a hand but grew up with a prosthetic that worked the exact same way, you are still missing a hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you comment further on the incidence of people with both ASD and a mental illness of some kind?</p>
<p>I have both (mental illness diagnosed as a teen, ASD in my mid-20s) but always got the impression that a dual diagnosis was pretty rare.
Is that not the case? </p>
<p>And are people with one sort of brain difference perhaps more susceptible to another?</p></div>		</li>
