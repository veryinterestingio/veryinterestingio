			<div class="markdown"><p>I did that once during the few months in my life when I became a nervous flyer. Never before or since. Noticed one of the ailerons was fully up the whole time we were at the gate and taxiing to the runway. Almost didn't say anything but all I could do was remember the multitude of air accidents involving an incorrect configuration during takeoff. I had that thought: &quot;Is this that moment when nobody says anything out of politeness and another preventable accident happens?&quot;</p>
<p>Anyway, I figured 99% chance it was fine but I asked an attendant anyway, who then told the Captain, who then sent a flight engineer back to take a look and chat with me. </p>
<p>TL;DR it's apparently normal for the control surfaces to float around somewhat before configured for takeoff, and the air pressure once we get going will push it back to the normal level. Still sounds sketchy now that I'm typing it out but hey, we made it.</p></div>		</li>
