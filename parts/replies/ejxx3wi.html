			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question and we agree is an important one to address. NIEHS supports research on how the environment affects a large number of different diseases and disorders. In many cases (such as cancer), it makes sense to talk about reducing exposures to prevent disease. This is more complicated in the case of autism. The ‘prevention’ issue is one that has sparked lively (and productive) discussion at the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC, for short).</p>
<p>As background, IACC is a Federal advisory committee that coordinates Federal efforts and provides advice to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on issues related to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). NIEHS is one of the institutes represented on the IACC. Through its inclusion of both government and public members, IACC helps to ensure that a wide range of ideas and perspectives are represented and discussed in a public forum. IACC members include individuals who have an ASD diagnosis, and this brings great value to our discussions. You can learn more about the IACC <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/about-iacc/overview/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past year, members of the IACC came together to consider the different perspectives around prevention as we updated the Strategic Plan for Autism Research. The plan is organized around seven questions. In previous years, the third question was “What caused this to happen and can it be prevented?” After listening to and discussing different perspectives, the title of this chapter was changed to “What causes ASD and can disabling aspects of ASD by prevented or preempted?</p>
<p>The published introduction to the Question 3 section provides a nice summary of why this change occurred. I have quoted directly below because I don’t think I can say it better:</p>
<p>The title to this chapter has changed (from &quot;What caused this to happen and can it be prevented?&quot;) because the neurodiversity movement has had a great impact on the IACC and on the premises of the <em>Strategic Plan</em> enterprise. It is fully appreciated now that some features of autism should not necessarily be targets for prevention. As discussed above, it is the most disabling features of autism that are now the major targets of prevention or preemption. Discussions of the causes of ASD always ultimately touch on efforts at prevention. In the hypothetical situation that a known cause of autism is identified, the question arises whether the cause should be eliminated thus preventing some cases of autism. If the discussion were related to cancer, the answer would be clear. But, in autism it is not. There is clearly an increased sensitivity to any procedure or practice that would be directed at preventing the totality of autism, and this is reflected in the emphasis of this chapter.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great question! I'm most familiar with how this issue pertains to ASD, but I imagine there are other discussions taking place for other disorders like the one you mention above. Thanks for your question!</p></div>		</li>
