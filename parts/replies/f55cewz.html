			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, it certainly should be. Wrong, I mean. You would think, more money, more growth, more to go around, more mobility, less hardship, less to sacrifice, less to struggle. I know the world isn't out to get me personally. But it's hard to shake the feeling someone got conned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We all did the mega wealthy we have now came from them winning the capitalism game.</p>
<p>Capitalism is like monopoly the game. It has a winner and that winner ends up being a defacto king, that is just fucked for the public at large. No need for creative theories of why on this one. Uncontrolled capitalism is a short road to totalitarianism. This is political science 101.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's definitely true about higher education (which isnt the only reason housing is expensive though). Colleges that have the reputation/ability to charge a ton of money have no downside for doing so. They can use this huge amount of capital to invest in new programs and buildings, attract even more student interest/applications/alumni excitement, and then their ranking rises. The colleges not doing this are at risk of being left behind even if they have the best interest of their student, a cheaper good-quality education at heart. So why wouldn't these colleges increase tuition by 2k a year? And once they do, the average millenial has a significant amount of debt that they need to pay off before they can even think about buying a house</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You realize this is just dead wrong right? You are acting like a conservative here. You need evidence and it really points a completely different direction.</p>
<p>Great story though. Fox news could use this level of writing.</p></div>		</li>
