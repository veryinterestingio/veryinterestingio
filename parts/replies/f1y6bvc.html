			<div class="markdown"><p>The most surprising thing about forest distribution is the frequency and scale of ecological surprises - controls that even great ecologists did not at first consider. </p>
<p>So for instance, yellow-cypress is declining rapidly in Alaska: the trees' roots are freezing to death because there is not enough snow to keep them warm. The trees are freezing due to global warming and so dying of drought in the rainforest.</p>
<p>Hemlock in the Rocky Mtns is controlled by fire which is controlled by pine trees to the south. That is, because pine trees burn so readily the hemlock are unable to establish.</p>
<p>And then there are the bugs....</p></div>		</li>
