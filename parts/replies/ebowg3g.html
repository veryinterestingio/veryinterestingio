			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Currently, we do not vaccinate people for smallpox anymore (no point in giving vaccinations for an extinct disease), so whether you get vaccinated or not does not affect your chances of getting smallpox.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s not entirely true. Military personnel are often vaccinated against it. I got mine in 2003 (they lost the shot record and tried to do it again in 2009, but I’d kept a copy) and the US Military still has an active smallpox vaccine program. It’s more limited now depending on where you’re deploying to. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are samples left in the US and Russia that we know of. If they were to be weaponized, most people under 50 would be at risk. We no longer vaccinate against smallpox.</p>
<p>As to the anti vaxx question, they are mostly to blame for the rise of measles cases, a disease we had almost completely eliminated in Canada/US. This is a group of people who have rarely experienced childhood diseases or seen them. Vaccines have saved millions upon millions of lives. </p>
<p>Just as an interesting side point, it was noticed that milkmaids never got smallpox. This was because they caught a related virus (cowpox) which gave them immunity. Jenner, about 200 years ago, noticed this, and made his vaccine with it. Before that, the riskier method was taking live smallpox virus from an ill person and using that to vaccinate.</p>
<p>The history of vaccines is pretty interesting stuff! </p></div>		</li>
