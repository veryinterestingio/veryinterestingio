			<div class="markdown"><p>For the average person, you're looking at 400-500 mL before you <em>feel</em> really full, but that's nowhere near maximum capacity.</p>
<p>I actually asked that to a urologist friend of mine a long time ago (we have strange conversations I suppose). He said it's basically unheard of that a human bladder would rupture from overfilling alone because a) it's very elastic to begin with and b) if the obstruction is chronic, the bladder itself can grow and become larger over time, like the excess skin of a formerly-obese person. In cases of obstruction, he has personally seen cases of 2 liter bladders.</p>
<p>I did some googling and found this extraordinary case report of a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3650792/" target="_blank">6 liter bladder</a>, but that is an extreme outlier in the literature. It still did not result in a ruptured bladder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holding my bladder on a long drive, I once filled a 1.5 liter bottle completely. To this day it amazes me the bladder could hold so much.</p>
<p>Fun fact: I pulled over on the side of the road, not two minutes from my house, after driving 8 hours, to piss in a bottle because I couldn't hold it anymore. Glad I did, since now I know how much that bad boy can hold.</p></div>		</li>

I personally drained 1750mL when the catheter partially obstructed with sediment. The patient was feeling no discomfort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing to consider, when talking about rupture, is that the bladder walls are tougher than the internal and external urethral sphincters that hold the urine in the bladder. Your sphincter will be forced open, and the urine will leak out of the urethra long before the bladder walls will burst. </p>
<p>This is, of course, if you are intentionally holding it. This is not accounting for obstructions.</p>
<p>Other variables to consider when speaking of max capacity include conditions and diseases that reduce the elasticity of the bladder, like scarification, cystitis, benign or malignant masses, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends. The bladder is an extremely versatile organ. It can contract and expands depending on the amount of pressure and volume it holds.</p>
<p>In a normal person a bladder will feel full with about 500mL of fluid. More than that and it will start to feel painful. A normal bladder will try to fight whatever is causing the blockade and it contracts. If the obstruction is not relived there will be a back flow of urine back into the kidney. This is called <em>hydronephrosis</em> and is a possible cause of kidney injury.</p>
<p>If the urinary retention has been going on for a long time (months to years) the bladder will loose its contractile abilities. That means it will be able to hold much more liquid. In chronic retention there have been report of bladders with over 4 liters of urine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weird. I wouldâ€™ve assumed (and a quick google seems to indicate) some sort of valve to prevent back flow. Anyhow, my question was about the physical limit of the bladder wall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a radiologist in Brazil, we are the ones that do ultrasound here (no usg technicians). I've seen patients with almost 2 liters crazy with pain, but never a ruptured bladder.</p>
<p>Most people will complain they need to pee when they're between 150-300 ml</p></div>		</li>
