			<div class="markdown"><p>The muscle parts? Yes, they would grow and you will be better at doing some of those.</p>
<p>But not the actual joints, they don't grow/heal like muscles do. Same reason why older people are more likely to have joint issues as their joints have been used for longer.</p>

<p>Edit: I felt I didn't express myself clear enough. When I said 'actual joints' I meant the touching section of two bones (where cartilage is), not the connecting tissues (tendons, ligaments).</p></div>		</li>

<p>For example, 100 trillion mouse clicks and we start deteriorating, 1000 trillion and it's torn beyond repair?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's less a hard limit and more a balancing act between repair processes and activities. Think of it like a leaky boat with 10 sailors with buckets. If the boat is new and barely leaking, then the 10 sailors aren't doing much work; they're just hanging out. If the boat fights in a battle and has damage and starts to leak more, those sailors start having to work harder filling their buckets and dumping them over the side. Maybe after the battle, there's so many leaks that the 10 sailors can't actually keep up, although they can keep the boat from sinking right away. While they're doing that, the repair crew can come and fix some of the leaks and the sailors with the buckets can catch up and drain more water than leaks in. But if the ship fights battle after battle and the leaks are never quite fully patched or some of the sailors with buckets get killed during one of the battles, it becomes much more likely to sink. Muscles are big ships with lots of sailors with buckets. Joints have relatively fewer buckets, so it takes a lot longer for them to recover from damage.</p>
<p>That's a pretty long and tortured analogy, but it explains a bit how RSI and overtraining and indeed a lot of physical injuries work. If you're familiar with athletic training, there's a concept called &quot;deloading,&quot; when athletes train above their sustainable capacity to build physical attributes, but then they &quot;deload&quot; to recover (allow their bucket brigade and repair crew to fix the damage). RSI happens when someone does the same motion too much and never takes a break to recover. There are some other not-ELI5 factors that contribute to it, but that's kind of the basis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol you’re getting a lot of weird responses that aren’t true. You have no hard limit. This is mostly because the body is not a battery or video game where a hard limit is hit. </p>
<p>The ELI5: of this should start with “we don’t understand the body 100%”. We know that the body has the ability to regenerate and fix injuries in some areas, and build muscle tissue bigger after microtears in other areas. We know that joints do not repair and regenerate <em>as well</em> as muscle does. This is not to say they don’t or can’t do it at all. Joints are made of different cells than muscle tissue, but lots of other things in your body regenerate (blood cells are the easiest non-muscle* tissue example). </p>
<p>This is an EXTREMELY basic response, the field of joint regeneration is massively funded and still not very well understood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Joints are one thing; they do have a finite usage although it's a pretty insanely high amount. It also depends on what joints you're talking about. As I understand it fnger joints are pretty robust as long as you take care of them. Degenerative conditions are where you start to have trouble with joints and that's often caused by diseases or your diet.</p>
<p>As far as being torn beyond repair, it really has more to do with how hard/how often than total usage. Both muscles and tendons are designed to heal and if you allow them to heal after working them, that's when you get stronger. As another comment mentioned, the problem is - and especially with carpal tunnel - tendons take much longer to heal than muscles do, so they wind up getting torn apart quicker than they can heal and when that damage gets to a certain point your body is unable to heal those damaged tendons and that's when you need surgery. If you catch it quick enough you can usually skate by with resting your hands and following up with physical therapy, but again if you overwork them you'll go right back to square one.</p>
<p>Not really a ELI5 but I couldn't find a good analogy for this.</p>
<p>Edit: I forgot to add that over the period of several decades we're alive a lot of things begin to break down and fail. That's part of the reason you see older people with joint issues. Just like how an old car, even if it's taken care of and not driven much just doesn't run like it would brand new.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got a new job hauling ass, lifting stuff 9 hours a day and my joints definitely got stronger (elbows, shoulders, fingers.) I know they don't heal and grow like muscles, but they still heal and get stronger, right? It seems like you know about this stuff so I figured I'd try asking you. I think it's just longer developing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Physical activities are good for our body, as long as we do not overdo them, our bodies would adapt and make us stronger to perform the same tasks. Once you go over the capacity, that's when you start hurting your joint.</p>
<p>Some tissues of a joint normally wouldn't regenerate naturally for adults (i.e. the cartilage between two bones), but the muscles/tendons/ligaments around a joint would grow stronger/denser. As they grow stronger/denser, technically you would have stronger joints (that's why counterintuitively people say weightlifting (by doing it right) is actually good for your knee). So as long as you are not going over your capacity, by getting enough rest and eating well, you would have stronger joints by doing physical activities.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm a physical therapist. All of the tissue you can load can get stronger. Bones, ligaments, joint capsules, etc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, they would get denser. But AFAIK, it normally involves weight lifting in order to make them denser, typing is unfortunately not generally considered as weight lifting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strain injuries in the fingers and wrists are more likely to be a tendon issue, which are a whole other matter on which I am not sufficiently versed to provide a full answer. However, speaking as a bassist, those muscles absolutely do get stronger. Doesn't stop the tendons from getting mad if you pull on them wrong</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are over use injuries in the tendons and joints. They take longer to heal and are effected a lot more as you age. Your body becomes less efficient at absorbing the nutrients required to repair them. Scar tissue can form and diet and sleep patterns can effect them as well. As people age they tend to sleep less (for different reasons, lifestyle, pain etc) and your body just slowly over time breaks down.</p></div>		</li>
