			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, i have had a long chain of coincidences lately this being the most recent. I was just wondering yesterday how many atoms need to be split for an atomic bomb. How much power would the split of a single atom have?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does, in fact release energy, though not that much on our scales. </p>
<p>&quot;splitting the atom&quot; causes an explosion because you're not splitting one, you're making chain reaction that causes many many atoms to fission. For example, the plutonium core in the Fat Man weighed about 6kg, and about 15% of that core underwent fission. That's about a kilogram, and with fissile Plutoniums molecular mass of 239, that's about 4.2 moles, or 2.51x10^23 atoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a common misconception that &quot;splitting an atom&quot; causes a huge nuclear explosion. A single uranium atom fission releases ~200 MeV which is unnoticeable to us. Fission energy is only significant to us when many of these atoms fission. I can talk more in-depth about this is you'd like!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>200 MeV isn't exactly unnoticeable... when adjusted to complete darkness the eye can sense ~10 photons of visible light or ~25 eV. If only a millionth of the energy of splitting one atom were converted into visible light, you could see it easily... and I believe this is exactly what a scintillator crystal does.</p>
<p>When compared to any other kind of stimulus, such as pressure or an electric shock... yeah it's totally unnoticeable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's alpha, beta and gamma decay plus a load of other much rarer variations of the above. All though they all have similar results on a quantum mechanical level they all are very different.</p>
<p>But there are some similarities. Every nucleus has what is call its binding energy and it depends on the number of protons and neutrons and what energy state they are in (if you're familiar with electron orbits nucleons also come in shells).</p>
<p>So if you were to take two nuclei and subtract their binding energies you calculate what is called the Q factor, the energy released or required to change from one nucleus to another. If the Q factor is positive the transition is energetically possible, there are a lot of other quantum conservation laws that have to obeyed as well for it to be truly possible.</p>
<p>For every element there is what's called the valley of stability where one or two isotopes will provide the ideal number neutrons for a given amount of protons. So beta decay which can change a neutron to a proton (beta minus) or proton to a neutron (beta positive) will act in a chain until it reaches the bottom of one of these valleys.</p>
<p>Beta decay is weird, because it is mediated through the weak force it is the only force which can change the nucleons themselves into something else.</p></div>		</li>
