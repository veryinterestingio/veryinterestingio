			<div class="markdown"><p>Skin effect doesn't really come into play at 50/60 hz unless the wires are quite large as the skin depth is 8.5 mm. The smallest wire with a diameter greater than 8.5mm is 2/0 which is rated for around 280 amps which you don't see in residential applications. The max service current in residential applications is generally 200 amps.</p>
<p>So the skin effect should not be a factor in residential wiring. Any stranded home wiring is simply for convenience as stranded is easier to work with. </p>
<p>Above 2/0, the skin effect must be taken into consideration at mains frequencies. However, solid wire of that size are rare due to how hard it would be to manufacture and transport, anyway. Usually for high current applications they will run more conductors of smaller guage for practical reasons which obviates the need to worry about the skin effect. Power poles generally have 3 distinct groups of conductors on them. If you've ever seen power lines that appear to be close enough to each other to touch, it's because they're the same phase and there's no potential difference between them and thus no risk of short circuit. They can keep adding conductors of the same phase to carry more current.</p>
<p>As a result the skin effect is usually only an issue for very high frequency applications (communications, switching power supplies, etc)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really don't see why solid wire would be more expensive. Most of it is drawn down from 8 mm copper rod anyway. Then you have to strand it before you can put the pvc or other vinyl on it with the nylon on top. Solid wire is just draw down to size and coat at the same time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except it kind of does. You can look at a chart of different wire constructions and their rated currents to prove this. The stranded wires will have a higher current rating than solid cores in a similar gage.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, it's not a huge factor for lower frequencies, but it is still a factor - especially over longer runs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;having multiple strands allows the wire to carry more current for less copper.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is wrong for domestic wiring. Multiple wire strands will not reduce skin effect if they are not insulated from each other. Add to that that the skin depth at mains frequencies is a couple of cm, making skin effect negligible for domestic wiring.</p>
<p>People should stop mentioning skin effect, it is a fully incorrect answer to OP's question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the real technical reason transmission lines and even the wire coming in from your weatherhead. Flexibility is a happy little accident unless you are talking about appliance power supply cord. Power line cord uses very small gauge wire in order to have crazy flexibility. Kinda like what you would see in a normal speaker wire.</p>

<p>Or any internal component wiring. Solid core is annoyingly stiff when you're working in an enclosed space like a control.</p></div>		</li>
