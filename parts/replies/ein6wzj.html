			<div class="markdown"><p>That can go both ways, depends on the drummer’s personality. My good friend is a perfectionist and a drummer, and if he really likes the song you’re playing he’ll keep time perfectly because if you speed up that ruins the song in his eyes. He’d be more likely to oscillate tempo if he’s not into it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ha, I've definitely been guilty of that.</p>
<p>But I must say, depending on your genre a few extra bpm for the chorus or solo is great for increasing emotional impact of a section. As long as you're locked in with the band!</p></div>		</li>

Getting a bunch of professional musicians to play like school children lead to everybody playing off pitch and botching notes... but playing with perfect timing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What always amazed me in middle school chorus was how everyone was completely lame until it came time to sing the school fight song. They'd been singing timidly for an hour, and then suddenly they'd come out with these big, full voices, perfect pitch, and total confidence. I always wondered why the hell they couldn't sing like that all the time. The fight song was stupid as hell, too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not a professional musician, but played through college level. It's weirdly hard to play out of time in the way that beginners do. It just becomes second nature to play with correct timing, so if you're told to play differently, the instinct (at least for me) is to play it with incorrect timing in a thought-out way. As in, &quot;Okay, this is supposed to be a quarter note, I'll play it as a half note&quot; or something. Players that are earlier in their training aren't necessarily playing incorrect timings that.. rigidly? I've then tried things like just clipping notes a bit shorter than they should be, or playing a group of 8th notes unevenly... it's weirdly hard though.</p>
<p>It's kinda like once you get really good at riding a bike - taking a basic corner feels perfectly steady and if someone told you to take a corner wobbly like someone new to biking, you've somewhat sort of lost the ability to do that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you don’t play with an overeagering drummer that’s  fueled by adrenaline. The worst part is when you have a song with some insane solos and you’ve practiced them in 120bpm and the drummer goes into the song at 140bpm that’s when you know it’a going to be a long night, lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We would always set the tempos by playing the solos or an intricate part over and over until it felt right and set the song’s tempo from there. I’ve done the same things with drummerless bands too and have vocalist get comfortable. If they’re a tempo nazi and have bad internal timing this will not work. </p></div>		</li>
