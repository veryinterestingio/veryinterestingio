			<div class="markdown"><p>No. We should tell people clearly what drugs do. They make you feel good and some make every worry in the world go away for a few minutes. That's the truth. And the negative effects that come later are also the truth.</p>
<p>Lying to people about how horrible drugs are does not work. Being honest works better.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Read out loud here.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/7bt8ge/heroin_feels_nice_still_the_best_video_everyone/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/7bt8ge/heroin_feels_nice_still_the_best_video_everyone/</a></p>
<p>It felt brutally honest and scary in a way that most other descriptions have not.  Because I cannot imagine anything more addictive than a drug that just makes things go better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely, i actually only got curious about drugs after smoking weed and feeling lied to all my life by people with zero theoretical and real-world experiences with any drugs, and taking a single example they saw on TV as the rule of any drug user, addiction can happen with so many things and it doesn't need to be a &quot;drug&quot; (quotation since drug shouldn't be necessarily a pejorative term) to be unhealthy, and in so many places alcohol is not only accepted but glamourized/encouraged, same for many benzos, yet if you talk about LSD people will start bashing and criminalizing you without even knowing what it is, cannabis is getting more popular but still, in some places saying you smoke weed is like saying you murdered someone, it's actually ridiculous.</p>
<p>Drugs can make your worry go away while under effect, but it's not the single reason for taking drugs at all, and if you're using as a way to escape reality, you have deeper issues which should be treated and faced, not avoided.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Hey doc, every worry in the world has gone away for a few minutes, but my neck's been hurting and I can't move my arms and legs anymore&quot;</p>

<p>This is not lying about how horrible drugs are.  As a radiologist in an area where heroin is prevalent, I see stuff like this about a dozen times a week and could write a book about all the damage I've seen drugs do to the body.  I have never seen any public/educational presentation mention the negative physical effects of drug use in a way that is anywhere near as bad as reality; D.A.R.E. as a kid was always &quot;you can get addicted and sad and ignore your friends' phone calls&quot;, not &quot;your hip might turn into a handful of gravel suspended in pus, and you have 14 broken needles stuck in your neck&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really wish there were more honesty about drug education. All I ever heard was &quot;don't do it, it's bad&quot;, but it didn't make sense to me why people did it, then. At a certain age, most kids are mature enough to understand why people want/enjoy it, but also learn how it can completely ruin you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really liked the &quot;heroin is awesome&quot; post. (It started describing all the positive effects people feel at first, and you'd think it was a heroin ad until it continued to describe, in the same style, the tumble down the neverending dark hole of addiction.)</p></div>		</li>
