			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious, is it triggered by orgasm or just generally post-coital? I've had women friends who confessed to me they had been with men for years who rarely made them orgasm and that just seems like such a physiologically different approach to sex than most men have, where the emphasis is so much on &quot;completion&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surveys of why men and women have sex might explain this.</p>
<p>Men generally have sex for one of a small handful of reasons.</p>
<p>Women, on the other hand, cite all sorts of reasons, including things like relationship maintenance, feeling more desirable, and meeting social expectations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t. I have a crazy high libido and sapphic. Non of the other gay women I personally know have it.   Like which orgasm is supposed to cause this clarity? Will a weeks worth cure world hunger?</p></div>		</li>
