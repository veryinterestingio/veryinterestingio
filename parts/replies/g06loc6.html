			<div class="markdown"><p>lol.. Didn't mean to burst that bubble.</p>
<p>But if you care to test it, ask a few close friends if they think you have any qualities they might consider sociopathic.</p>
<p>Don't worry.. it's been discovered that even if your brain is wired to be psychopathic, you still have to CHOOSE it. So you're good unless you kill small animals when no one is looking.</p></div>		</li>
