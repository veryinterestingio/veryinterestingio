<p>one star is orders of magnitude more massive than the other and gravitationally dominates the entire system.  This isn’t super likely because supermassive stars form and die too quickly to generate stable planetary systems.</p>

<p>If one star is a red dwarf (which, from memory, can be as small as 0.08 solar masses) then the other one could be a couple of solar masses, which wouldn't be too bad--I imagine a red dwarf that small would be practically invisible in the sky against a primary star that bright, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dwarf stars are pretty dense because they’re not energetic enough to inflate themselves like more massive stars.  The smallest are 80x the mass of Jupiter but actually slightly <em>smaller</em> than Jupiter due to compaction.</p>
<p>Definitely not visible as a disk, maybe not visible at all other than a bright reddish “planet” in the night sky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh it would definitely be brighter than even the Moon. A single sunspot, about the same temperature as a red dwarf and significantly smaller than one would shine brighter than the entire Moon were it separate from the Sun. Now imagine what an entire star, however small, could do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ironically this would make that red dwarf fit the original meaning of &quot;planet&quot; which was &quot;wanderer&quot; as to people whose only tool was the Mk 1 Eyeball, they appeared to be wandering stars. In some languages the names of the planets still have &quot;star&quot; in them because that's how they were named in antiquity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably, depending on size and luminosity.</p>
<p>Like an outer planet it would also vary in distance, apparent brightness, and position as it moves from opposition to conjunction.</p>
<p>To get a Star Wars binary sunset you’d need case 1 and a very compact binary system, where the two stars are orbiting eachother very tightly and complete the rotation on a period of days.</p>
<p>They have to be close enough that they act as a single gravitational object for the planet, but not so close that they begin to merge.  Stars aren’t solid objects and they will start to pull eachother out of shape and decay the orbit if they pass too close.</p>
<p>You have double the luminosity from the two stars, but you also need a pretty large orbit for the planet to be able to ignore the dancing gravity in the center.  I’m not sure how close a planet can get to a borderline-detached binary before you get punted into space by the gravitational wobbles.  The stable orbits are likely pretty wide and cold.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Although the cold bit is helped a bit by the fact that you have two stars to put out heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is 5x further away. But for the Sun to really appear as a star, it'd have to be about half an arcminute across, about the same as Jupiter or Mars at opposition as viewed from Earth, and sixty times smaller than here. So even Neptune or Pluto wouldn't do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do two stars orbit each others what does that mean ?
In my head if it's big, other things orbits around it.</p>
<p>So it's like they met each others on their way at some point and they were so big they attracted each others  and started turning around each other ? </p>
<p>Will they technically end up meeting or splitting or is their speed stable ?</p></div>		</li>

<p>In a simple system with two equally sized stars, this would be a point midway between the two stars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In most cases, they would eventually end up meeting and merging into a single ball if they were close enough to act as a single mass that other planets are orbiting around.  But it's possible that under just the right circumstances you could get two stars that are just far enough apart to remain discrete, but keep dancing around each other in a stable system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth noting that if conditions weren't exactly right, it could still take a long long time for one star to consume the other one. There's potentially a little wiggle room for Tatooine.</p></div>		</li>
