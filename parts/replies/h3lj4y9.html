			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey that was definitely a well written response. Thank you for all the links as well! So I guess while mass clumps aren't homogeneous across the universe, the distribution of different atoms is. Its really fantastic to think that every planet contains all elements and yet they're all so different because of different amounts of said elements!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might find [Theia](<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theia_(planet" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theia_(planet</a>) interesting.</p>
<p>Basically, it is a hypothetical planet that could have collided with the Earth and created the moon.</p>
<p>One consequence of that collision is that, if Theia formed outside of the frost line, it may have been of a different composition than Earth and carried other elements and materials with it. Even if it was of similar composition to the Earth, the collision itself could have caused heavier elements of both to surface and allow for wider dispersal. It is also possible that the collision led to the Earth have a thinner crust and more significant plate tectonics, which may also have caused further dispersal of the elements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a thought experiment, but if theia was still around, but was the opposite side of the sun to earth and on the same orbit, would we know about it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep!</p>
<p>All that said, exactly how much of each sort of atom is found on a given planet is very variable! When, where, and how a planet forms can have very significant effects on how much of an element we find there proportionally!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also something to consider is that everything on our periodic table is found on earth because we’ve searched on earth and found everything on our periodic table. Somewhere deep in the universe there may be a whole Nother hundred elements that we know nothing about but we haven’t found them because they’re not on earth. It’s the chicken in the egg, the earth is so perfect not because it’s been made perfect because we are perfect for the earth, kind of scenario</p>
<p>Then again I’m not an expert in these kind of fields but it’s just something to think about perspective wise. What we know isn’t all there is to know, it’s just all we know so far.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A slight amendment to your description. Our sun is small, relatively speaking, but it is massive enough to fuse all the way up to carbon (via a helium flash), actually, which should happen during the last 10% of its life.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know humanity will be long gone before the sun dies, but it's sad knowing one day it will be gone. I hope humanity can spread around the universe and find more galaxies, and even live in colonies in deep space. Mars is only the first step, we have millions of miles to walk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of growing up is learning that things don’t need to last forever to be worth experiencing. The same holds for our species, I think.</p>
<p>Exploring is great. Trying to sustain life on our planet is a noble cause, but colonizing space to extend human existence forever is childish folly. Try to imagine living your <em>entire life</em> in a bubble on mars, seeing pictures of earth but never experiencing it. It could very well be unbearable.</p>
<p>Even if we could eek out a miserable existence elsewhere, why is it so important that <em>humans</em> live millions of years from now? We could take just as much pride and hope from seeding primitive life on thousands of worlds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So all the iron and oxygen (for example) the Sun spits out in solar particle events was there in the gas cloud that formed the Sun?  Right now the Sun fuses up to what?  Just H into He or other light isotopes?  Thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anything heavier than helium in the Sun was incorporated into the Sun when it formed from the stellar nebula (itself from previous supernovae). Right now, the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium and that's it. As it ages, the core will become denser as more helium accumulates there, which increases the pressure, which increases temperature and brightness. Once the temperature and pressure reach a critical threshold, it will then begin fusing helium into heavier elements.</p>
<p>Fun fact: Carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen are used as a catalyst in fusion reactions. This is called the CNO cycle, and can only happen in stars that already have those elements from previous generations of stars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm mistaken, but isn't the helium flash driven by the triple-alpha process in which helium nuclei are fused together (to form said carbon)? It's honestly been a while since I had any classes in this material, I'm afraid!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, that's correct. It seems our star is massive enough to have this happen, but should not be able to fuse carbon after this point, leading to a carbon-rich white dwarf.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Other high-energy events can also create lots of certain elements. For example, two neutron stars (the remnants of dead large stars) merging creates a lot of gold and blasts it out into space, and it appears that much (perhaps even most) of our gold was made in such a merger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow. this is mind blowing. Think about how much &quot;gold&quot; has to do with humanity in general throughout history. and it all comes from that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that was a really weird fact when I heard about it, too. Neutron star mergers aren't exactly common, but there are enough of them (and they're violent enough) to produce a significant quantity of our gold!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/image/ligo20200902a" target="_blank">We've also gotten much better at observing neutron star mergers in the last few years, too!</a></p></div>		</li>
