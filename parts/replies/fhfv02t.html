			<div class="markdown"><p>not quite. with achalasia it’s where everything you eat gets caught and drinking water sometimes may help. i suffer from it and i get caught especially bad with foods that are dry like bread or chicken. if it happens once it’s not much to worry about but if it continues to happen more often and gets worse then it’s definitely worth looking into. this disease has caused me a great deal of pain and suffering, emotionally and physically</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>esophageal spasm and achalasia are different things. Spasms are transient. Achalasia is the inability of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax</p></div>		</li>
