<p>The entire natural diamond world is trying their best to keep prices high though.</p>

<p>So is the artificial diamond world. Why would the makers of artificial diamonds hope to see the prices of their own product come down? They are all on the same page. High diamond prices = good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This condenses down to &quot;why don't they compete with each other&quot;, usually the answer is &quot;they ignore the law&quot;.</p>
<p>It just takes some time to get the evidence that is good enough to get them to compete.</p>
<p>In this case it already took decades, but &quot;cheap&quot; products should eventually enter the market, they might not be 100% as good, but cost 80% less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d argue that some will pay more, not less. Wouldn’t your fiancé love a diamond that is 100% pure, real, and high quality —yet free of blood and guilt? I’d argue that a diamond made by a nice middle class white person in Canada will be able to command a premium over a regular diamond, mined by a child slave in Africa. And so it should.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope same hardness. Synthetic rubies have been around so long that they’re insanely cheap to produce. Fun fact. Jewels in watches are all synthetic rubies and have been for some time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ruby is one of the most commonly used synthetic gem stones. Heavily used in the measurement industry for probe tips. Ruby is a form of Sapphire. Single Crystal Sapphire is colorless (although it scatters a bit if violet) and is grown in labs. Used it just about anything that needs a durable window. From watches to missle tips.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sir, do you mean that the synthetic ruby extruder heads are 1/20th the cost of real ruby extruder heads?  Sorry to be picky.  I’m Not trying to criticize but when people in general  use fractions and percentages improperly, it obscures the meaning in the sentence.  Thanks for not getting upset.  Kudos for making an effort to join in.</p></div>		</li>
