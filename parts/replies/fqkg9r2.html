			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, that was a major problem: It would often take a couple of chops to get the head off. Especially during times of many executions. It really was a quite gruesome death, at least by modern standards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought it was because the force (weight * deceleration) is distributed over the contact surface.  In a flat blade, there is more contact surface, so the force is distributed.  In an angled surface, the force is (initially) concentrated in one point.</p>
<p>Same reasons why some swords were curved?</p>
<p>Am I wrong?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are not wrong. You are very close. Just need a few tweaks...<br />
Force = Mass * Acceleration<br />
The force is not only initially concentrated with an angular blade it is concentrated the entire way thru the slice. This is exactly the reason the Japanese katana was such a devastating weapon. The sweeping edge applied maximum force thru the entire slice. Hence the reason it was one of the only handheld weapons that could cut thru another human being.</p></div>		</li>
