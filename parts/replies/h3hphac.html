			<div class="markdown"><p>Landlines work differently than cellphones, as the connection runs through wires the whole way through.  These days phone networks are more complicated and often digital now, but back in the analog days they would literally create a giant, cross-city (or cross-country) circuit connecting your telephone to the telephone of the person on the other end.</p>
<p>There's two ways for wires to cross like that.  The first way is if the wires are literally crossed:  Either the operator screwed up and connected the circuits incorrectly, or something damaged the wires and two different circuits happen to be touching, causing signals to bleed through.</p>
<p>The second way is through interference:  Radio waves are generated any time you've got a changing electric current running through a wire.  With analog telephone wires, the waves aren't very strong since they're using DC current and are not designed to be antennas.  However, despite that, they're still strong enough that if they wires are not shielded properly, an adjacent line can act as a receiver and pick up those waves, causing the voice to show up on the second line.</p></div>		</li>
