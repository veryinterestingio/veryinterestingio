<p>Your crew boss walks around and checks the spacing/overall quality of your plot before its deemed as being planted.</p>
<p>If he feels that the trees will die for whatever reason, he will make you replant.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It can take anywhere from 1-3 years for the seeds to grow into saplings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm asking the question for anyone reading this thread who knows.   When you buy large numbers of seedlings, the price per seedling is quite low, say 25 cents.  I suspect they can be produced rather quickly.</p></div>		</li>
