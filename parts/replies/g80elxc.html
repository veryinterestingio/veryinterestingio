<p>For reference, 4kts is about 4.6mph or 7.4kph. So the Mayflower crossed the Atlantic at the speed of a slow jog.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>10 weeks to cross &amp; 102 people in 1600sqft of living space, according to Wikipedia. The north Atlantic is a notoriously stormy stretch of water and they did encounter some bad storms.</p>
<p>&quot;The passengers were forced to crouch in semi-darkness below deck as ocean swells rose to over a hundred feet.[2]:50 With waves tossing the boat in different directions, men held onto their wives, who themselves held onto their children. Water was soaking everyone and everything above and below deck.&quot;</p>
<p>It was a VERY long jog.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Biggest warship Sweden ever built. Sank in the harbour on her maiden voyage in 1628. Salvaged in 1961 and plopped into a museum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, by all means visit the Vasa Museum if you have an opportunity and join one of the free tours. Everything was fascinating from how &amp; why it was built, the possessions of the sailors showing daily life and how they brought it up. </p>
<p>Best thing in Stockholm, imho, among many great things to experience. I thought I would spend an hour or two, but ended up staying closer to four hours and that’s only because it was closing time. </p>
<p>I hope I will have another chance to visit again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know if they count as ships but Thames barges use their topsails inshore precisely because they are high up and so more likely to catch a steady wind above the various wharves and so on.</p>
<p>Additionally the fore and aft sails of a large sailing ship (ie the jibs and jigger of a Barque) would not be adequate to propel the ship, not least because of the rather drastic imbalance that would make steering impossible. Going further back the full rigged ships obviously didn’t have this option at all.</p></div>		</li>
