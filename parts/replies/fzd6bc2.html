<p>The first step is sorting which eliminates items too small to bother.  This step also eliminates plastic cutlery.  Truth is, there's too much out there, not enough demand, and it's really expensive to recycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked at a junkyard/recycling place (Wertstoff Hof in German) last year for a month and a half. </p>
<p>It's not just straws that fly away like that. Styrofoam is the worst. People pack it in these weak ass bags and they rip apart way too quickly. Then you have the styrofoam flying around EVERYWHERE.</p>
<p>All these little things, you can bet your ass that that shit won't be recycled properly. It flys around everywhere and I'm pretty sure it looks like that on most of these recycling places. </p>
<p>Where I worked it was on a tiny island. The dumping ground was right by the ocean. So much flew over the tiny brick wall and the seagulls are everywhere picking apart trash and scattering everything even more. </p>
<p>If you want to make sure everything gets recycled properly, do it yourself.
That applies to pretty much everything.</p>
<p>Everything we let other people take care of, is not taken seriously in a lot of instances. </p>
<p>If you want something to be done &quot;right&quot;/your way, you're better off figuring out how to do it yourself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: you can melt down plastic and make plastic stuff at home with a powerful heat gun or a spare oven. Technically you can also do it with your food oven but then you might contaminate your food accidentally. Look up tutorials on YouTube.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How much private recycling is allowed? The extent I mean.
You're usually not allowed to burn your trash for example (understandably), at least in germany. </p>
<p>Is it possible to &quot;recycle&quot;(or however repurpose) all sorts of trash that accumulate in a private household? I'm genuinely interested, because I'd like to be as self sufficient as possible one day. That doesn't work if I'd drown in trash and I would like to minimize the negative impact on my environment. </p>
<p>Anyone who has recycling tips please share them with me :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: the joke was the guy I commented on said &quot;im short&quot; instead of &quot;in short&quot;. Was just a gag, he noticed my comment and edited it</p></div>		</li>
