			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, that's interesting. I'm an electrical engineer and we use that term a lot, but in a much different way. Similar concept though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then you will probably appreciate that if you take your telegrapher's equations, and replace inductance with mass density, capacitance with 1/elastic modulus, and your resistances with something based on coefficient of restitution, you can replicate the same wave propagation behavior.</p>
<p>E: And throw in a few constants to fix the units as necessary, of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely! In fact, electrical circuit analogies are used quite often in acoustic engineering due to how analogous the two fields are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, air is truly the enemy to ultrasound imaging because it blocks and distorts the waves to an extent that everything beneath the air is completely obscured. This is an issue INSIDE the body as well because we contain many loops of bowel, filled with varying amounts of gas.</p>
<p>So if you are really gassy when they do the exam, the images look bad because your bowel gas is blocking everything. This is why they tell women to not pee before a pelvic ultrasound. If the bladder is full, the ultrasound can go through the abdominal wall, then through all the water in the bladder, without any significant distortion, and that allows you to see the uterus and ovaries which are behind the bladder. However if the bladder is empty, you may end up having a gas filled loop of colon in front of the organs you are trying to image, which will partially to fully distort and obscure the images.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I came here to say.  I'm an ultrasound technician, and the jelly (we call it couplant) tricks the ultrasound so it actually goes inside of whatever it is we're testing.</p>
<p>Every substance we inspect has a known velocity (speed) at which the ultrasound travels.  If that ultrasound were to travel through one substance to another substance, we get a blip on our screen.</p>
<p>Let's take a carbon steel to stainless steel interface.  The speed at which ultrasound travels through both materials is very similar, so we will only see a tiny blip on our screen.  What is happening is that most of the ultrasound travels through the interface, but a small portion gets reflected back.</p>
<p>An interface of water and steel would have a larger difference between the two velocities, so less ultrasound would pass through, and more will be reflected back (a larger blip on the screen).</p>
<p>In air the molecules are spread out, so the ultrasound travels slowly through it compared to steel.  In fact, almost all of the ultrasound is reflected back at the interface between air and steel, because the velocities are so different, essentially blinding us from seeing into the steel.</p>
<p>We use the jelly (couplant) to trick the ultrasound, so it goes in and out of the part we'd like to inspect.</p></div>		</li>
