			<div class="markdown"><p>The LHC is tough because one if its most consistent achievements is doing exactly what we thought it would. Even with the Higgs, that wasn’t really new physics - the mass is an interesting number, but the idea behind it was already very solid - it was more about finally getting the capabilities to observe what we were damn near sure exists. That’s how it’s been with many of its other discoveries. “Math has said this for decades, and we can only now go out and experiment, and it turns out math was right” is the story for a lot of it. Many of these examples are basically just very exotic states, like four and five quark particles. There hasn’t been much in terms of mind-shattering and unexpected discoveries. Nothing turned the particle physics table upside down. Don’t get me wrong though, these observed confirmations are themselves extremely valuable. Just because they aren’t game changers doesn’t mean that aren’t useful. We have much more solid footing for lots of particle physics because we actually went out and saw it happen.</p>
<p>Everyone wants radically new things. A big reason why we made the LHC so huge is because we wanted to give it the chance to find things we never thought about or haven’t fully accepted. To a large extent, that hasn’t happened. That means our physics is pretty good, but it also has been useful for pruning off theoretical branches that should’ve manifested themselves at those energies (in particular, it has not been kind to supersymmetry). There definitely are some anomalies in the data, so don’t get the impression that I’m saying nothing has been discovered, but the anomaly to confirmation ratio is very small. Still, even one anomaly can completely upheave all of physics, so things may change.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It discovered many new composite particles, including two new groups of composite particles (tetraquarks* and pentaquarks). It found some very rare processes of high interest to theorists. It improved the precision of hundreds of measurements (most of them are also tests of the existing theories).</p>
<p>*previous experiments found strong hints but it was an LHC experiment (LHCb) that first managed to confirm them clearly.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the Higgs boson is the main thing and this then lead to the proof of many many things in physics later on as well, some from the same team others not. It helped solidify the electro-weak force into an electric force and weak force, helped solidify the theory of QFT, and a lot of other smaller tidbits that filled in our understanding of Quantum Mechanics but it’s somewhat hard to just say discovered the Higgs Boson and many more without going past ELi5. But overall helped develop particle physics further. I am not too familiar exactly, but others may fill in better</p></div>		</li>
