			<div class="markdown"><p>A series diode will stop it from frying itself if batteries are inserted backwards, and a bridge will allow the circuit to work no matter how batteries are put in. However, diodes have a voltage drop across them; when you lose a few tenths (or more) volts when you only have 3 or 5 volts to start, it matters (plus cost). Easier to make a mechanical solution that prevents batteries from making contact when put in backwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To protect your circuit from damage if the battery is inserted in the wrong direction. I used to do this all the time back when I built circuits more often. It can protect expensive circuit elements (like $20 instrumentation amplifier integrated circuits) from complete destruction. I only started building rectifiers to isolate the battery from the rest of the circuit after I blew a couple of these more expensive elements by accident, and I never went back. </p>
<p>EDIT: People below are concerned about circuit efficiency. The question wasn’t about that. It was just whether it was possible, and it definitely is. There obviously are design trade offs (energy loss due to diode turn-on voltage), so you wouldn’t want to use this in a very low power device (whether it goes to market or not). But I found it very useful just to isolate my circuit from my own silly mistakes when working on a breadboard. <em>shrug</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trying to think of a list of things that “work” regardless of polarity. </p>
<p>Incandescent bulbs</p>
<p>Motors (reversed)</p>
<p>Speakers (out of phase)</p>
<p>Conductors</p>
<p>Resistors</p>
<p>Capacitors</p>
<p>Electromagnets</p>
<p>Heating elements</p>
<p>With my high-school level electronics education it seems like most things that don’t contain diodes/tubes will work. Is that true?</p>
