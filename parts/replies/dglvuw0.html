			<div class="markdown"><p>It is definitely an interesting (and real) phenomenon. </p>
<p>I enjoy a variety of alcohol and I've found over years that certain beers and wines (specifically) will make me congested, and that other heavily-hopped beers and high-rye bourbons tend to give me a splitting headache the next day even if I only drink a couple. </p>
<p>It didn't start happening until I was nearly 30. At first I chalked it up to middle age, but it is very pronounced and only happens with specific brews/wines/whiskeys which I have learned to avoid. </p>
<p>When I was 16 I could (and did) drink just about anyone under the table and be squared away and fully functional the next day. </p>
<p>Enjoy youth, young people. One day you will understand the hell of a three-day hangover when all you had to drink was a twelve-pack of Miller Lite ??. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your friend has gluten or yeast tolerance issues, or histamine sensitivity, but not alcohol intolerance.  I myself can't drink beer anymore (suspect yeast intolerance), but hard liquor or ciders are fine.</p>
<p>People with REAL alcohol intolerance - the genetic disorder, which is more prevalent in people with Asian lineage - get very ill as the liver can't break down the alcohol well and they suffer symptoms of alcohol poisoning.</p>
<p>As for congestion it can also happen because mucus gets thick due to alcohol being a diuretic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was/am a big fan of Belgians, particularly Quads... Gulden Drak 9000 Quad, especially.</p>
<p>Sadly, now, one of those and I feel like total crap the next day.  Chest muscles ache, body run down, etc.</p>
<p>I like aged Irish whiskey or good rum on the rocks, or cider like Angry Orchard, when I do feel like drinking.  I was never one to drink much, either - I only drink alcoholic beverages for the taste, as I really don't like feeling drunk or even tipsy, so if I had to give up drinking alcohol I wouldn't completely miss it.</p>
<p>I already had to give up milk/cream/soft cheese (mozzarella and anything with it) due to true allergy... now THAT sucks to give up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could this explain why when I wake up lately after drinking the previous night, once I get going for the day my sinuses are draining constantly, a lot more sneezes than I'm accustomed to (my normal is on average 2 sneezes per day) and mucous is constantly produced until about midday?</p>
<p>It's a new occurrence though, and I've been drinking beer for about 12 years now each evening. The only change that sort of correlates with the emergence of this runny nose issue is buying a house around the same time. I'm in a far better environment than where I was previously though as far as air filtration systems go, and I've never had any allergies that I know of. I'm just wondering if this unexplained emergence of allergy-like symptoms is related to a change in the way my body is processing alcohol versus a new environment.</p>
<p>Guess I could experiment by laying off the booze... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the reason you wake up early is because alcohol, as a depressant, makes your body create more glucosamine, a stimulant, to balance you out (homeostasis). For this same reason, alcohol sleep is not quality sleep because you never get to the r.e.m. stage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a slight allergy and only sneeze/have to blow my nose if I chugged the beer. This is only when I get started drinking too. I just realized I have a runny nose each morning that I drank the previous night but it goes away after blowing my nose.</p></div>		</li>
