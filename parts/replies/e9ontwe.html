			<div class="markdown"><p>My experiences on the porcelain throne oddly lead me to believe some people may be an exception to the rule; I have let out some embarrassingly massive turds, like the size of a frickin' paper towel roll, although while I didn't inspect the consistency, it very well could been as soft as mashed potatoes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>because most of the time it gets sucked up there, past the turn described above. when you're trying to poop, it's basically trying to push the object into the sacrum/turn. the basic idea is that you have to guide the object past the turn and straighten things out to make it past the turn</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sphincter complex stretches and potentially ruins the elasticity of the muscles there.</p>
<p>Other than that the colon and rectum can blow up kinda like a balloon animal balloon. Sometimes people get so constipated that it gets up to 15 cm wide before potentially popping.</p>
<p>Other than that, length wise you can probably get to the splenic flexure of the colon pretty easily with anything semi straight. On average that can be about 50 cm or so. After that itâ€™s a sharp turn to the transverse colon and not so easy to get further than that. </p></div>		</li>
