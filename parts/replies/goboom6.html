			<div class="markdown"><p>All this is great, but it's noteworthy that the point of no return for humans has been estimated to be 2,000 instead of the normal 5,000. Probably something to do with how we choose mates, and assuming in such a massive crisis, people would be far less picky about who they mate with. Other animals don't have the same luxury.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would guess it's most likely because unlike animal we have an understanding of the risk of inbreeding. We would be able in dire time to artificially keep track of genealogy and avoid inbreeding.</p>
<p>The usually 5000 are for animal that actually also inbreed naturally. In most cases, a little bit of inbreeding is mostly harmless. It becomes an issue with repeated cases. Animals are unlikely to repeatedly inbreed if there a big enough population. 5000 is the point at which the probability of inbreeding become higher than the probability of safe breeding. The species is likely to collapse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nearly all animals have an instinct to not inbreed. Humans might be more cognitively aware now (but not 300 years ago, or even depending on the culture today), but we aren't alone in preferring to not inbreed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it+/- 5000 for all species? I would imagine quick breeding animals like insects, rats, rabbits etc could come back from much smaller numbers than that, and on the other hand, some species, like whales, might just generally have low populations, so &gt; 5000 might also be a viable number?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's probably a a genetically safe number, not necessarily a measure of real world species survival. The first european explorers like Colombus would drop off one boar and sow on an random island as they went along, and when the next ship came a few years later there was huge pig populations around the Caribbean.  Whereas 5000 of a species spread evenly around the world would be useless if the majority never meets each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess there are a lot of factors that come into play. In the Columbus case, the boards probably didn't have any natural predators and so it's natural that their numbers would explode. If a species exists in a &quot;natural&quot; environment, i.e. one in which it has always existed and so predators exist, it probably can't increase its numbers that rapidly. And if that environment is already under threat by things like deforestation or habitat loss or whatever, the chances are even slimmer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A quick context thing for the rest of my comment - in ecology, a population of a species refers to a subgroup of that species living together and interbreeding, not the species as a whole. So a species is often made up of different populations that are different sizes living in different places. </p>
<p>So, generally each species does have its own unique minimum viable population size. If a given population is less than that size, it might last for a while but just be incredible susceptible to the next catastrophe that comes its way, or it might slowly dwindle away over time due to genetic issues from inbreeding or because the species just reproduces really slowly. Each species is unique and has a different minimum size because different species reproduce in different ways and at different rates (for instance, plants can reproduce asexually very quickly, but when they do they’re all clones which makes them susceptible to disease, so that kind of thing will play into the minimum viable population size)</p>
<p>All of that said.... my lazy ass did not read the article linked in the comment, so I can’t tell you if that 5000 number is referring to minimum population size in the sense that I’m using it or if “population” is being used more colloquially to refer to the entirety of a species instead of subgroups. It also might only apply to mammals, or not. It might be taking into account specifically only inbreeding issues, or it might include other things that would influence population sizes. </p>
<p>Basically, yes each species has its own unique minimum required size for a population to survive long term, however this may or may not have anything to do with the article quoted above.</p></div>		</li>
