			<div class="markdown"><p>The question with 5g is when I think. </p>
<p>My company installs and services cell phone boosters in most of our customers buildings and we are already getting requests to put in 5g gear because people think that the existing 4g isn’t new enough to handle their phones since the boosters were installed a couple years ago, and they buy new phones every few months. </p>
<p>I can install 5g boosters no problem, most customers take one look at the proposed cost and decide they can survive as is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>4g is nowhere close to the max speeds, which on paper can get up over 600mbps. There may be other efficiencies or reasons that you may want to go to 5g, but max speed likely isn't the problem. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some are smart to get ahead of technology while they are doing buildouts or remodels. Normally the idea is remodel today with top of the line stuff so that it will last a couple years and you won’t be digging into your budget for new equipment in a year or two when 5g hits the market in force. </p>
<p>About half the time I have to explain that the booster is working just fine and show diagnostics that proves it. It’s almost always the carrier and usually it is solved be restarting their phone (not even kidding). </p>
<p>It seems to me like it is really that  some people just assume that the box that is the oldest is the problem. </p></div>		</li>
