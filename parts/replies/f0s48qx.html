<p>Cracking joints that I don't crack as often as others is a lot harder and slightly painful. So I don't think it would be that satisfying. Just very strange and perhaps unpleasant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. I can crack my thumb by pulling it, which feels amazing. But if I do it, I get an ache later which is only removed by pulling it again. Then the ache comes back later and quicker the more I crack it (but abates after a few days). The only winning is to not play the game and not crack it. Guess the parallels with addiction are pretty evident.</p>
<p>Funny thing is, I crack a lot of other joints but don't have the above remotely as intense as with my thumbs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hell, that's assuming said hand would be willing to crack anyways. I remember as a ^roughly 5 year old trying to &quot;show off&quot; and crack my knuckles, and nothing happened. They just bent like normal. Now I'm 35 and can crack my knuckles (all of them, up to the last one near the fingertips like Yuriko on X-Men 2) my shoulder, hip, knees, ankles, toes, back, neck, clavicle ^I ^think, ^at ^least ^that's ^where ^it ^feels ^like ^it ^cracks and ribcage.  </p>
<p>Don't know if it's age related, or a mechanical action that needs to be &quot;learned,&quot; but there's plenty folks out there that can't crack a single joint on purpose.</p></div>		</li>

<p>He's part of nocrack. Not to be confused with Say No To Crack. But rather they are like nofap, but with their hands.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Okay, I can see how this could be confusing. Let me try to explain another way.</p>
<p>You know how you can use your hand to bring yourself great pleasure? They don't do that.</p>
<p>I hope that clears it up!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, my sister believes it because she has bad arthritis and used to crack her knuckles, but that is far from definitive. She has always had horrible health issues as she got older, so it is very possible she would have arthritis either way.</p>
<p>Because of this, most of my family yell at me when they hear me crack my knuckles. Still do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a chiropractor once who told me not to crack my knuckles because it will cause arthritis. </p>
<p>&quot;But arent you going to crack my back?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, but thats different.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because I'm a doctor&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've only cracked the fingers on my left hand for as long as i can remember (am 34 now).</p>
<p>At this point, i can only crack the right hand if i make a fist and give a quick, hard push on a solid object. The left is super easy, i just pull the fingers back.</p>
<p>Funny side effect: If i pull back the fingers on my left, they're angled back to the point where my little cousins give me puzzled looks when they see it (especially the pinky, i can almost touch my wrist when i fold it back). I can't do that with my right. </p>
<p>Other than that, i feel no differences between the two. </p>
<p>I always wondered if that would somehow be of interest to someone in the medical world, guess somebody beat me to it.</p></div>		</li>
