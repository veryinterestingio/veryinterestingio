			<div class="markdown"><p>I realise this is anecdotal but I used to distill spirits from a sugar wash and there was a definite lack of hangover from the middle bottles of spirit. The methanol was distilled out in the first flow from the still and any heavier alcohols propanol etc was distilled out at the tail end of the run. Also using a sugar wash has no cellulose that you get in grain washes so there shouldn’t be too much heavier or lighter alcohols produced. It was a reflux still not a pot still like you see in moonshiners so the ethanol had no flavour either, this tended to cause people to get very drunk very quickly as it was difficult to gauge how strong the drink was without the manky flavour which was your favourite tipple. A lot of the flavour from drink especially whiskeys is provided by the contaminant ‘heads’. Someone with more distilling experience might correct me but this was my take on things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While that sounds nice, most of what a hangover is is simple dehydration because alcohol is a diuretic. If you drink a couple cups of water through the night and take a multivitamin with another glass or two of water before you go to bed, you will be fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which cider though? Some is sterile muck which tastes actually okay but then there’s the rough stuff sold by the half pint only at festivals and looks like used sump oil. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Cider country in England it's sold by the 1/3 pint and you can only buy two, that's it.
It also gets you drunk from the toes up, so your head will feel fine, then you will go to get up off the barstool and crumple because your brain didn't realise that your legs were offline. </p></div>		</li>
