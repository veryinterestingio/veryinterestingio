			<div class="markdown"><p>It is possible that dietary factors could be contributing to the increase in autism. Research to date is very limited, and has tended to focus on specific nutrients, rather than whole diet quality. This is an area we and others are looking into. There have been major shifts in diets as the prevalence of ASD has risen. -RJS</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP but I'm going to assume that the increase in low nutrition processed foods has something to do with it. </p>
<p>We stopped eating balanced home cooked meals with ingredients that are what they are (fish, chicken, beef, green beans, spinach, carrots, potatoes, rice etc.) and started eating more frozen, boxed and bagged food. Granted, frozen that is what it is can be fine but TV dinners, breakfast sandwiches, and pizza rolls etc. aren't great. </p>
<p>This was made worse by the anti fat craze that increased the amount of processed sugars in those kinds of foods. </p>
<p>My assumption is that we are lacking nutrition necessary for proper fetal development and that is a possible cause.</p>
<p>Again, I am not OP and I have limited reading on the subject but so far that seems to be the likely cause based on what I have read.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Glad you asked! Yes, the <a href="http://marbles.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">MARBLES cohort study</a> is examining fecal microbiome right now in relation to ASD outcomes and breastfeeding/child diet. We plan to examine links with maternal diet and supplements down the road. - RJS</p></div>		</li>
