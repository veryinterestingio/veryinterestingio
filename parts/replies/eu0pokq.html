			<div class="markdown"><p>I have them as well, but never use them. For one they don't really work as well as ice at getting the drink cold. Secondly, many drinks benefit from the ice melting. Many whiskeys, even nice whiskeys taste better with a little bit of water added. A single ice cube in a glass of whiskey is enough to chill the shot, but only dilutes it a minor bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s also not something you can just collect, clean, and put back into service like glassware or silverware. You need to clean them, and then put them in the freezer until they get cold. The turnaround time is long, which means you need to stock even more of them. </p>
<p>That said, I have been to bars that use frozen stones as ice cubes. They typically only use it on certain drinks. Things like whiskey on the rocks (literally I guess), old fashioneds, etc. (anything in a small glass that shouldn’t be watered down).</p></div>		</li>
