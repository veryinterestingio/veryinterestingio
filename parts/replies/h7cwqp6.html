<p>in the form of a growing half sphere</p>

<p>Because lightning is such a brief event (about 70uS for the main strike), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_effect" target="_blank">skin effect</a> has significant influence on the distribution of the current. The skin effect is the tendency of rapidly changing current to be concentrated near the surface of a conductor. There will be far more current 10M away horizontally away from the strike than 10M vertically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is the skin effect applicable when ground is in the bottom and not horizontally on the side? In a cable the current is going horizontally but how does it go in the ocean, is the ocean ground itself or do it need to hit the bottom?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ocean is the &quot;ground&quot; itself. The ground is an electrical engineering term and doesn't have to be a literal ground, just some relatively large object that can absorb a large amount of current without any measurable change to its own level of charge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where are you getting your information from? Lighting occurs predominantly over land, by about a factor of 3. The majority of lightning happens within the clouds and doesn’t involve the surface at all. When it does occasionally strike the ocean, the current spreads mostly horizontally, so only animals very near the surface would be affected. Turbulent waters are the result of strong surface winds, but that’s not a requirement for lightning, so it could very well strike still waters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well if it's a factor 3 in strikes per area it still comes out that more than half strikes are over sea since there's more than 3 times as much ocean area than land area</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the correct way to say it is that the ratio of 2d surface area of expanding lightning strike to the 3d volume reduces in a proportion to the square cube law. So the proportion of 2 dimensions to 3 is squared.</p></div>		</li>
