			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy shit, I just remembered something. The first and only time I tried to meditate I couldnt imagine anything (I used a site which guides you through the process with a nice voice) that the voice told me to imagine but near the end of the meditation I could almost imagine things, not even pictures or movies but more like strong feelings and blurry yet detailed objects. Really weird stuff.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Remember it is nothing like seeing with your eyes. You have to forget your eyes are even there. I can see how you might expect it to be even kind of the same but it really isn't. </p>
<p>It's sorta like trying to look at something with your peripheral vision and 50% it actually appearing and 50% just knowing it's there in a sense. But remember it isn't an eyes thing. </p>
<p>This is all so fascinating. A major TIL.</p></div>		</li>

I think I get some very faint images after meditating for like 15 minutes. And I think it's improving ever so slightly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just anecdotal evidence. I started meditation maybe 4 to 5 years ago. When I first started I couldn’t visualize anything. It was literally just black and that made it so much harder to sit still doing nothing. Eventually I challenged my self to visualize myself on a mountain top and initially the image would could and go. Like I could get it one minute and it was gone the next. I did that maybe 30 minutes a day for a couple of months and by the end I could visualize a whole meadow surrounding me and the mountains. I eventually challenged myself to come down from the mountains and just enjoy it and I can only get flashes of it. Like I can’t constantly visualize that. </p>
<p>Now that I’ve stopped doing it consistently it takes a bit more effort just to get on the mountain top again.
Long story short Id say it’s possible but that’s just my experience</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like I had some sort of maybe mild aphantasia before in that I never 'got' counting sheep like OP,  I just assumed 'mind's eye' was a metaphor or something- I'd have to kinda think of things instead of 'seeing' them. But I actually managed to get to the point of imagining images and sounds with a good amount of clarity, and surprisingly enough it was psychedelics (and ketamine) that did it.</p>
<p>During a trip my mind's eye would be amplified and I'd be able to imagine things with more clarity each trip, and I've found it even carries over each time in part to when I'm sober. Just throwing my experiences out there, but I wonder if those could be a treatment for aphantasia, or if it's just a weird quirk of my brain chemistry or 'realising' vivid mind-eye images were a thing then practising?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mind is really weird. I've tried those &quot;guided meditations&quot; as I'd call them, and I can imagine things, but it is hard to keep on track. My mind keeps popping up new pictures and &quot;videoclips&quot; of other stuff. Like, if the voice tells me I'm in a green field of grass with the sun out I imagine that for a second, but then suddenly the grass is on fire and the sky turns dark. Stuff like that, like I actually have a hard time controlling my visualization. Even when doing my &quot;personal mind movies&quot; as my last comment mentioned, it often goes off rails a lot and I have to keep forcing it back to what I want it to be. It's like my minds eye have it's own will. I can at some point &quot;get it rolling&quot; where my mind just goes on auto pilot and kind of makes the plot and visualization of my &quot;personal mind movie&quot; without thinking. It is almost like dreaming except I'm awake.</p>
<p>Maybe it would be fun for you to try some more meditation. Like I mentioned, I were not able to <em>not</em> have pictures in my head but learned to empty it - you might be able to learn to visualize better. Who knows.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If the thoughts that pop in your head tend to be negative like this, they are called “intrusive thoughts”.  They are completely normal - it’s your brain processing “what if” scenarios - though they can be more common and more severe for people with post-traumatic stress disorder.  Imagining what would happen if you pushed that lady in front of that bus, or if you walk to the cliff and just jump*, doesn’t mean you’re homicidal or suicidal.  In fact, the revulsion you (presumably) feel when those images get in your head and you want them out proves you’re not.  </p>
<p>(* this one is so common it has a name in some countries, the “call of the void”)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I had a brief period of interest in lucid dreaming, but never learned it. But my &quot;personal mind movies&quot; can be quite distracting. I actually always have music or podcast on when working because otherwise my mind keeps slipping into my own fictional stories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you still have slight interest in training yourself in lucid dreaming I would really recommend you put some time into doing it, it's really rewarding. Also, once you have got the basics down you no longer have to consciously try and maintain what you have learned, it's like riding a bike from that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had similar issue. I absolutely love and would very highly recommend learning lucid dreaming to anyone, it's life-changing, but sometimes it did get to the point where there was just way too many images and false memories from my dream worlds floating in my mind and distracting me to no end during the daytime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes. This. Also, if you have an 8 AM lecture to get to on a friday it's not advisable to learn how to fly in your dreams on your way to a threesome with Natalie Portman and Keira Knightley. Tends to make you hit the snooze button.</p>
<p>Or did that really happen? We may never know. ^We ^may ^never ^know</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. Whenever I try to mediate and clear my mind I end up going on a mental space exploration, complete with astronaut suits, some form of craft, and heavenly bodies (my favorites being ringed gas giants and solar flares)</p>
<p>As near as I can figure my mind goes &quot;nothing? You mean like space! It's full of nothings and some somethings! Here are some nothings and somethings for you!&quot;</p>
<p>The closest I figure I can get to nothing is by imagining a nature scene, sitting by a babbling brook, or a small waterfall in mid autumn. Attempting to clear my mind is just something I can't seem to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can totally relate there, the closest thing I can get is to imagine a constant movement like a flowing stream or something similar.</p>
<p>Instead of space I've got this annoying thing now, I watched this video on meditation a while ago where the guy describes your &quot;monkey brain&quot; that's always active, and you have to keep it busy. Well they played a little video of a monkey jumping around all wild and now all I can think of is &quot;monkey brain&quot; and I just see this monkey jumping around until I shake it off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It honestly took me over a year reaching it, and even now it takes a lot of focus. I just listened to a ton of different &quot;guided hypnosis&quot;. At the end I learned the sensations and that a &quot;guiding voice&quot; didn't necessarily help me anymore. It was what eventually taught me, so I would recommend it.</p>
<p>Now, there are a few things I <em>needed</em> for it to work in the past. First of all, darkness. Like, complete darkness - so I can't do it with the sun up - curtains isn't enough. Secondly, lay down. Thirdly, I can't have clothes on. Okay, I realize this starts to sound creepy, but just let me explain! When I want to empty my mind <em>completely</em> it is like a vacuum. If anything comes near it will try to fill out the vacuum. Having clothes on touches my skin and I become hyperaware of that sensation, which in turn sparks thoughts. I start to think about the sensation. It is not much of an active thought, but it ruins the &quot;emptiness&quot;. I can't have a draft either, and I can't really be too cold, same effect with sensations. It is like those sensory deprivation chambers, you want to remove all your senses. This also means no sounds (well, aside from the hypnosis if you listen to that).</p>
<p>Okay, so laying in complete darkness, nothing that touches you and then you need to learn to relax your body. This is where guided hypnosis can help, as they often start by helping you relax your body and different hypnotists will do it differently. Try many so you learn all kinds of ways and find what you prefer. Now, this is important, as it is not just the same as relaxing your body. It is a whole new level of not using your muscles. Once I learned it I realized I never actually had my muscles fully relax in my life while being awake. Even your scalp skin feels relaxed. You kind of learn to do it when focusing on a given muscle and the trick is to keep that muscle relaxed when you move on to a different muscle. It almost feels like your muscles becomes weightless and kind of meld into the bed. Like your bodily shape is a bit more blurred out. Hard do describe. Should be noted, breathing exercises really help with this.</p>
<p>This is the state that helps me empty my head. Once all above is done I start to push out any thought or image or sound in my mind. They keep coming, often bombarding my brain, but I keep &quot;cancelling&quot; them all. At some point you learn to become better at this and less and less thoughts bombard you. In the end you learn to shove them away and they just kind of stay away. It feels kind of like holding your balance on a rope - you know that you are in a fragile state, a little off balance will bring more thoughts. The weird thing is, in this state you can still do some &quot;thinking&quot;, but the thinking is different than normal. No visuals, the inner voice is different, you feel like you are in nothingness in some way. Even overusing your inner voice might break your balance.</p>
<p>Okay, so after years I've eventually learned to do it without all of above. I can now do it with clothes on, just curtains and quite fast. This is kind of like a light version still, I don't feel that amazing relaxation nor that weird &quot;nothingness&quot;, it just stops my brain from being bombarded by thoughts. I need all the tricks to feel this &quot;nothingness&quot; even now. A last note, I always have headphones on - even without hypnosis. I feel more &quot;enclosed&quot; and cut off from the world with them on my head, which helps.</p></div>		</li>
