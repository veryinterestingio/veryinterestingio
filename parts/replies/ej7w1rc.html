			<div class="markdown"><p>Seedless grapes are also treated with hormones to develop fruit. It basically tricks the plant into thinking that the fruit have seeds so that it keeps throwing resources at it. Otherwise you’d have a lot of aborted, hard, tiny fruit.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seedless watermelon can be completely seedless, they use the same technique mentioned above. Grow to crops and breed them to get a third crop that has seeds that grow the fourth crop seedless. Then repeat from the beginning. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn’t limited to plants either. Triploid shellfish are becoming very popular as well! Mainly because being sterile means they grow faster and taste better during times of year when wild shellfish would spawn and taste watery</p></div>		</li>
