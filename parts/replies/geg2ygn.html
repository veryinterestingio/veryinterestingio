<p>Gravity isn't a field or a force at all. It is the effect that matter in the universe has on space-time.</p>

<p>I've seen the Veritasium take on this as well, but isn't 'something having an effect on something else' the most fundamental definition of a force in physics? (in this case, mass affecting spacetime)</p>
<p>To me it seemed he was a bit liberal with his sematics to make a more clickbaity statement. The way the average person understands 'force' (the Newtonian one) and the way it's treated by physicists is very different.</p>
<p>Edit: Why the downvotes? They're literally called the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/fundamental-interaction" target="_blank">fundamental forces or interactions</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It looks like a force and it's useful to treat it as a force, for practical reasons. That's why we can use Newtonian physics in daily life and even in engineering, even though they are, if you get down to it, completely wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not talking about F in Newtonian physics, but the fact that every basic interaction in physics is also called a 'force'. Last I checked, gravity is still very much among those.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do know if something received a force or not. Well, by Newton theory, if an object don't receive any forces, it moves in straight lines at constant velocity. So if gravity is only thing that affect an object and it moves straight at constant velocity, gravity isn't a force.</p>
<p>But how do you know if a line is straight? If you try to apply geometry to the real world, you need to be able to looks at stuff, and that depends on light, or some other straight moving things. So, you can't abstractly define the concept of &quot;straight line&quot; without coupling it to a physical process. In GR, straight line is defined to be the line that objects go through without being affected by anything but gravity. Because of this, gravity doesn't make object moving off of straight line, so it isn't a force. It's a fictitious force cause by us seeing object straight line intersecting. </p>
<p>You might think this definition is arbitrary. Why just exclude gravity in the definition of straight line? Well, the reason is because gravity, unlike other force, affect everything the same way. Every other forces have some sort of &quot;charge&quot; that different matter can have different amount of, which tell how much the force will affect them. So it makes no sense to define their movement as straight line, at least in a 4-dimensional spacetime setting that can't account for their charge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you describing T=S/V or in this case T=S/c ? But how much is matter deforming space? Is there a ratio like 1 ton = +1 cm of space, for example? Or something like that? Or maybe I have the wrong idea here.</p></div>		</li>
