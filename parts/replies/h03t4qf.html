			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes this happened to me. The battery died and suddenly a bunch of stuff like my wireless dongle stopped working. Turns out the date reset to 1970. I put a new battery in, changed the date, and all was good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So here's a fun side fact. All computers count time using the number of seconds from midnight on January first 1970. This is called Unix Time and the second the clock struck twelve is referred to as The Epoch. So when your battery died it essentially reset to 0 which according to the computer is 1970. Another fun fact is that at the time of this posting the current Unix Time is <code>1622505116</code> which means that many seconds have passed since 1970</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's even more fun is all the systems that use a 32-bit integer to store Unix Time.  Fun things are going to happen in 16 years, 7 months, and 18 days when a few hundred million clocks roll over to zero and decide it's 1970 again.</p>
<p>Y2K seems like a joke now but that's because people took it seriously and threw a decade of effort and hundreds of billions of dollars at the problem.  Y2K38 will likely require equal or more effort...</p>

<p>*Also, a bunch of lazy Y2K fixes started causing problems last year.  Programmers took shortcuts like year 01-19 = 20xx and 20-99 = 19xx.  Didn't really make headlines because of the other bug going around.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Except for all of the ones that don't, such as Windows computers. Windows counts from Jan 01, 1601. A number of other systems count from various other dates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just the battery, there is a Real Time Clock which is basically a digital watch with no screen.  When the computer starts up it reads the current time from the RTC.</p>
<p>CuriousMarc repaired a bunch of antique HP clock modules from the '70s and they actually used clock chips meant for funky '70s LED wristwatches and would simulate all the button presses needed to set or read the time.</p></div>		</li>
