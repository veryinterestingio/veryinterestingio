			<div class="markdown"><p>You can have water sit at 100 C all day long and not boil (it will evaporate, though). You have to provide extra energy to make it change from liquid to gas. It's called &quot;latent heat&quot; and is associated with any and all phase changes - liquid to gas, solid to liquid, solid to gas, etc. I don't think it's particularly relevant to the case described by the person who asked the original question, however. But anyway, now you now about latent heat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The liquid in the can is effectively boiling in this example. It boils much lower than room temperature. It needs a little extra heat for the liquid to change to gas, which it gets from the aluminum can. The ambient air temperature is basically the heating element of the kettle using the example above. Except the energy isn't being replaced by fire or electricity.</p>
<p>The net effect is the can gets cold because the warmth is being used to boil the liquid inside.</p>
<p>(i don't know if any of this is true or accurate, just trying to reword the post to maybe make it easier to understand.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At what temperature does it “boil”? Does this mean if I spray the can in a cold enough atmosphere (e.g. South Pole in middle of winter where it’s like -50F) that the fluid coming out will remain liquid? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When something feels cold it is transferring the heat of your body to it. A room can be 70 degrees and water can be seventy degrees but the water will feel colder because it transfers that heat away faster. The aluminum can also transfers the heat away faster than air. And even more so when you shake it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In this particular case there needs to be. Any pressure drop with a liquid, especially in a can, will not cause a noticeable difference in temperature until there is some major expansion, such as through a phase change or through expelling the pressurized gas from the can</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not liquid to gas phase change. This is gas coming coming out of solution, which also has a latent heat and is endothermic. The shaking creates disturbances and bubble nucleation but the latent heat is not the same as liquid to gas phase change for latent heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you further explain, my understanding is latent heat is a by product of phase change.  Heat added but no temperature rise= latent (phase change).  Heat added and temperature rise= specific heat (no phase change).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When something is dissolved and then evaporates out of solution, it's essentially the same as a phase change. It takes energy to reassemble as a gas, and eventually, without more shaking,  the gas will dissolve back into the liquid and release said energy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)" target="_blank">phase</a> is a region of space in which all the physical properties of a material are uniform.</p>
<p>Therefore, a well mixed solution of dissolved gases is a phase.  The gases in a pure form (after it escapes from solution) is another phase.  That means a phase change has occurred.</p>
<p>On a more intuitive level:  say the solvent is made of A atoms and the solute of B atoms.  In solution you would have AB bonds. When the gas escapes, there are only BB bonds.  The type of bond has changed, so it's a phase change, vs just adding more heat, which would not change the type of bonds.</p></div>		</li>
