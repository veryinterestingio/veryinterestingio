			<div class="markdown"><p>It looks a lot like (read: exactly the same as) the integral (dv) of p  = mv for constant mass. Is this just a coincidence or is there an actual link there?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes there is. Force is the space derivative of energy dE/dx and the time derivative of momentum dp/dt. Trigger warning for mathemeticians: I’m about to do some real handwavy engineering math here. So we can write it like </p>
<p>dE/dx = dp/dt</p>
<p>(dE/dx)dt = dp</p>
<p>dE/(dx/dt) = dp</p>
<p>dE/dv = dp</p>
<p>So we can see that momentum is indeed the velocity derivative of energy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand this at all. If a non equal mass is &quot;sent flying&quot; then that just means there will be a change in speed which will preserve both the momentum and the energy. If you change <em>m</em>ass and <em>v</em>elocity also changes as a result, momentum is conserved. So why can't it just be a different amount of mass?</p>
<p>No, this answer doesn't address the question at all. If you imagine a &quot;cradle&quot; that only has 2 balls and they are of different sizes (masses), they would still go clack clack clack. They would just have different amplitudes from each other. Of course a variation of the mass is possible. (Ohhh... actually, I think the rhythm would be a little off.. like clack, clack..... clack, clack.....ckalck, clack.)</p>
<p>So this doesn't explain what determines the number of balls that move in a traditional Newton's cradle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mass of one ball is m, and velocity of balls hitting the others after being dropped is v. k balls are dropped.</p>
<p>Momentum when two released balls hit the remaining ones: k<em>m</em>v</p>
<p>Kinetic energy when two released balls hit the remaining ones: k<em>m</em>v^2</p>
<p>Number of balls which go up at the other, receiving end: n</p>
<p>Momentum and kinetic energy is preserved.</p>
<p>New velocity is u</p>
<p>n<em>m</em>(u) = k<em>m</em>v since momentum is preserved (new momentum = old momentum)</p>
<p>n<em>m</em>(u)^2 = k<em>m</em>v^2 since kinetic energy is preserved (new KE = old KE)</p>
<p>Which is only solved for positive reals (v, u) and integers (n , k) if n = k, v = u.</p>
<p>Therefore as many balls go up as down, with the same speed as the balls that went down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea this comment is accurate. Top level comment wouldn't allow any possibility of systems with unequal masses (whether or not it's 1 big ball or 2 distinct little balls)  </p>
<p>THat being said, I'm also having trouble finding the error in his math that would allow for that possibility. In the 2 ball cradle example (one big and one little with half the mass) would the little ball go twice as fast as indicated by the momentum equation or sqrt(8) as the KE equation says?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Momentum is mass times velocity. Energy is (half of) mass times velocity (speed) squared.</p>
<p>If you halve the mass, you must double the velocity to keep the momentum unchanged (half the mass times twice the velocity, ½ × 2 = 1), but then the energy is doubled (half the mass times twice the velocity, squared = ½ × 2 × 2 = 2).</p></div>		</li>
