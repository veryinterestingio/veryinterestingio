			<div class="markdown"><p>My vet in the US did that to one of my cats (cat and I are now in England) when she came to give him his annual vaccinations at home.  I’d not seen that done before, I was impressed.  17 lb cat, bam, over on his side like that <em>clicks fingers</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's fine as long as you're not just picking the cat up like that (and you can see it's kind of a controversial topic! Some people are saying it's OK as long as you support the rest of the body weight with your other hand/body; others are saying it's animal abuse).</p>
<p>I highly prefer to err on the side of caution personally. Like our cat now needs to have ointment applied to parts of her body - the easiest way we've found is to wait for her to lie down on a &quot;trap towel/blanket&quot;, then wrap her up so she can't scratch / get out, then apply the ointment &gt;_&gt;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do this all the time when it's time to cut my cat's nails. Without it I'll be fighting a semi liquid fur ball with teeth and claws. With the chip clip I'm done in under a minute and have a calm, still cat to work on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah and if it fails you will have a scared cat and the expression in their eyes will make you feel bad for the next days.
Edit: I always seem to do it wrong or I am not using enough force because I fear that I might hurt them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know I still have a kitten and I doubt I would even try it with higher weight as I heard you can do some serious damage which isn't worth it. When i pick them up I hold their hands and let them put their feet on my other hand and it's fine</p></div>		</li>
