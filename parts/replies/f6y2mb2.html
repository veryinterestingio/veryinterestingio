			<div class="markdown"><p>Now for the why this all happens: you see that most other mammals are covered in thick pelts that do not have much variance in length. Why do humans have such weird hair? It's because we have a mixed cooling system of sweat and hair to keep us from overheating and freezing. You have more hair in places that either A) need more protection from the heat or cool, like your head which contains your brain, or B) need to be kept airated because they produce the most sweat (hi pubes and pits!). Normally if you were walking or running naked as our original ancestors (Australopothicus, homo erectus) that lack of hair and the various lengths would allow the wind and air flow of movement to naturally keep a body cool. But much of our old cooling systems are now obsolete in the wake of our technology (clothing, central heating, etc). Not sure if anyone was interested, but I am about 80% sure most of my memory on basic bio-anthropology is accurate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only tangentially related but have there been any studies or research done on the effects clothes have on skin health? I think a lot about how little sun and air circulation we get in areas like armpits and the groin when wearing underwear and pants when like you said, the pubes evolved to increase surface area enough to quicken evaporation and regulate temperature. The part you wrote about pubic hair made me think about that but the torso and upper legs as well. Hard to get sun all over if you aren't at a nudist colony or have tons of private land.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth keeping in mind not all fabrics are created equal. It's good policy to, for instance, wear breathable knickers to let your undercarriage air out. But from there it's a crapshoot- everyone has different skin, and there are hundreds of fabrics, to say nothing of the way they're treated. </p>
<p>Generally, plant fibres are good for breathability. Older synthetics like polyester can trap sweat against your skin. Modern wicking fabrics will keep you drier, which helps prevent bacteria friendly environments which can cause rashes. All fabrics can rub. With the possible exception of silk, some people are sensitive to animal fibres due to oils in them, like lanolin in wool. It is good policy to always wash your clothes when you buy them. Some chemical treatments at the factory leave residues that can cause contact dermatitis, especially if it's in contact with sweat, like your socks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of what you were saying, but I once shaved my down belows (Im male) and it was the worst thing ever. Think Itchy beard, but ichy male parts from the hair regrowing and pricking the skin.</p>
<p>But also they help when combined with I think it is sweat to prevent alot of skin irritation from doing things while running or exercising. </p>
<p>Sweaty hair is a good thing in the short term, so can always just wash later!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like this, the nest of hair under your arm catches the perspiration as it beads off your skin. Hairless armpits, the moisture rolls away and into your clothing-- negating the purpose of sweat. ith the hair, the moisture is trapped in the cluster of hair, and evaporating normally over the area that needs cooling. As the water evaporates it creates heat transfer, and air passing over the moistened skin/hair cools said moisture down which in turn cools down the skin beneath. Our bodies work like a swamp cooler, water collects and air passing over it is cooled by the evap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might increase the surface area for evaporation. But I think hair might be there to reduce skin on skin friction. I read a story years ago about a skater who decided to use Neet on his crotch and ass. He said the baldness caused horrible chafing. One time, for reasons I can't rightly recall, I did a little too much manscaping with electric clippers and experienced the same effect. Awful. I don't know how women do it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Cells get copied and pasted all the time and one day that lazy dna motherfucker wrote a 66 instead of a 6  and now your one hair grows for 66 weeks and becomes the long bullshit hair you have to keep up with.</p>
<p>That is also why you see that mostly on moles, since that skin is also kinda whacky itself</p></div>		</li>
