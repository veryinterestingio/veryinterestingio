			<div class="markdown"><p>Depend on what ammunition you use. classic cannonballs produce a lot of shrapnel from whatever they hit (like a wooden ship, a house, or the ground), and punch cannonball sized holes in stuff. (doesn't really matter what part of you is hit, you're out. And it won't stop just because it hit you, it will hit all the guys behind you too)</p>
<p>There was also exploding shells with timers, producing lots of metallic shrapnel over a battle field.</p>
<p>Or scatter shot (grape shot), basically turning your cannon into a huge shotgun, efficient at closer ranges.</p>
<p>Or shots that were basically two balls with a chain, that came flying spiraling, efficient for messing up rigs on ships (or cutting guys in half)</p>
<p>And that's just some of the more common types.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was more variety avalable to artillery in 1776 than just solid round balls, which in themselves, are pretty devastating. A 3 pound solid iron ball traveling at 200meters/second (450mph) is not going to just stop when it hits the first thing in it's path, especially if the first thing is a person. There will be a long trail of it flying through and bashing things up, other soldiers, horses, wagons, anything.</p>
<p><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/3204/2747667922_6b76f63a44_b.jpg" target="_blank">Explosive shells</a> for field artillery existed, as well as <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/93/07/26/930726c0d65c269847576fb6bcf8712c.jpg" target="_blank">grapeshot</a> and <a href="https://thumbs.worthpoint.com/zoom/images4/1/0517/20/civil-war-revolutionary-war-cannon_1_52df965dd6473e223be2d19be599122f.jpg" target="_blank">chain, or bar shot</a> which would tear through the ranks while spinning on a common axis. Chain and bar shot was primarily for tearing the rigging out of ships, but was also a rather effective anti-personnel weapon. And if you've got 'em, use 'em.</p>
<p>Fun fact; The old pirate trope of the phrase &quot;Shiver me timbers!&quot; (Old time sailor talk for (Holy Shit!) refers to a cannonball blasting through the side of a wooden ship. Splintered pieces of wood were then known a &quot;shivers&quot;, and the ball would blast dozens if not hundreds of sharp, broken, high speed pieces, &quot;shivers&quot;, of the wooden ship hull out of the ship's wall, and likely into anyone near by. Not good, not good at all.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those either fired solid shot, grenades or canister. Solid shot is just a big steel or rock ball. Only dangerous if it hits you directly. Grenades explode just like today's grenades. Canister is filled with small steel balls. When it's fired it's like a shotgun, except the pellets are an inch wide. Don't be in front of it.</p></div>		</li>
