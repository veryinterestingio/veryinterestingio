			<div class="markdown"><p>Cetyl and stearyl alcohol, sometimes called cetearyl alcohol when blended together, have 16 and 18 carbons in a straight chain attached to the alcohol. These are usually made from plant or animal oils or fats, and even though they're alcohols they are kind of close to butter or wax in a superficial sense and resemble them in some ways. The alcohol portion is kind of small compared to the rest of the molecule, so the behavior is a lot different than something like ethanol or isopropanol. These don't evaporate at room temperature to any significant extent, so I don't see how they'd have any drying potential (but skin interactions are getting into biochemistry, so it can be tough to say that without doing or looking up research to check).  But basically the alcohol part of the molecule is something like 5-10% of what's there, but since the other 90% or so is basically wax that's how it tends to act under most (but not all!) circumstances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh, fascinating. As someone who's allergic to cetearyl alcohol (among other things - including beeswax. Connection? Hmmm), I appreciate this. How do you know so much about the makeup of cetearyl alcohol and stuff?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why wouldn't they put the more specific term on the ingredients label? Ie list glycerol instead of just saying alcohol which is generic and leaves consumers wondering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think they are usually pretty specific, though that may depend on the country. In the US, there are strict regulatory requirements about listing the components as named according to an organization called INCI. But in addition to legal requirements, companies have noticed that customers want specific lists that tells them what's in there. This can cloud things in some cases, since companies are pressured to use simpler and greener names than might otherwise be employed. It seems assumed that longer or more complex chemical names are inherently more toxic, but 1,2,3-trihydroxypropane isn't any more or less toxic if you decide to call it glycerin. A chemical by any other name, I guess.</p></div>		</li>
