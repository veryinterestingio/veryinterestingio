			<div class="markdown"><p>that's interesting... but after I'm back to the grind it takes a couple weeks before the stress really gets back to me, and after a couple months I feel like I just can't make it through the day unless I get away, and a one day vacation doesn't really fix things, but 5-6 days seems to be a huge difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So here's one of the reasons.</p>
<p>Stress causes a feedback loop. Remember, stress is a fight or flight response. It's designed to keep us alive from danger.</p>
<p>Your brain detects something it needs to react to. It could be a bear, or a boss that threatens to fire you, or just normal everyday effort. Your brain releases a hormone that triggers another hormone to release in your body. That hormone causes many physiological changes, including stuff like adrenaline. It also travels back up to your brain and basically tells your brain to keep looking out for the danger. Your brain is then hyper aware of the danger, and keeps releasing hormones.</p>
<p>That feedback loop can be very harmful. It keeps your body and mind in a constant state of readiness even when you don't need to be. (off topic, but this is one of the symptoms of ptsd) </p>
<p>A vacation removes the outside stress, which lets your body and brain calm down and break the loop. It takes awhile for that loop to go away, which is why 1 day off doesn't help but 5 days does.</p>
<p>Edit... Removed a ' from let's. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cortisol actually suppresses the inflammation response in our bodies, but the other things you say are about right.  We DO release cortisol in response to stress but idk how much of it contributes to our overall &quot;stressed&quot; feeling.  If you chart the cortisol levels of a normal healthy human over a day, you can see that it fluctuates quite a bit.  highest in the morning and lowest in the evening.  In a person with pathologically high cortisol levels (adrenal tumor, pituitary tumor, exogenous steroid use, small cell lung cancer) , you will actually see physical manifestations, like...</p>
<p>- central weight gain</p>
<p>- fat accumulation on the back of the neck (buffalo hump)</p>
<p>- fat round face (moon face)</p>
<p>- belly stretch marks (abdominal striae)</p>
<p>- thin skin</p>
<p>- high blood pressure</p>
<p>- high blood sugar</p>
<p>For normal people, there are probably more psychological factors rather than endocrine that contribute to the stressed feeling.  I'd reckon your brain is making too much norepinephrine or acetylcholine but thats just a wild guess.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well cortisol was incredibly important thousands of years ago.   When a stressful situation, like encountering a wild lion,was basically life or death and required our bodies to have the maximum amount of nutrients (glucose) available in our blood to be able to run away or fight.  The short term benefits of cortisol are that it...</p>
<p>- raises blood sugar (fuel for brain and muscles)</p>
<p>- raises blood pressure (more blood for brain and muscles)</p>
<p>- lowers inflammatory response (bodies resources are directed towards external threats rather than internal threats)</p>
<p>Humans back a long time ago didn't exactly have the vast amounts of food and energy that we have now, so they needed to use every last drop of it to its maximum effectiveness in survival.</p>
<p>Nowadays, we think of stress as work, homework, social responsibilites, dating, and what not.  Clearly cortisol would be detrimental to these activities but our bodies dont know the difference between these kinds of stressors and actual life or death stressors so it just pumps cortisol into your body indiscriminately.  Humans are sort of stuck with modern problems and ancient solutions</p></div>		</li>
