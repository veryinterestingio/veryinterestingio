			<div class="markdown"><p>As you get closer to light speed it takes more and more force (and therefore more energy in whatever propulsion system you use) to maintain that acceleration. This growth is exponential and doesn't have a limit, so eventually you need infinite force to get exactly to light speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also you become more massive due to your momentum.  That extra mass must also now be pushed along. As u approach the speed of light your mass becomes infinite. Special relativity something something</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Acceleration isn't speed. To have acceleration you need a force acting on the object. You don't lose acceleration because of resistance, you lose speed because of resistance. For example, you push a box, the friction of the ground is the resistance of you pushing the box. You can still push the box even if there's resistance, but as soon as you stop pushing the box the box will start to slow down because of the resistance. You pushing the box is acceleration and the time you stop pushing the box is desacceleration, but if there was not friction or desacceleration that doesn't mean you will accelerate forever, after all you aren't pushing the box forever, what will happen is that the speed you accelerated the box to, will stay constant until another force is applied to the box, thus changing the acceleration from zero to anything else.</p>
<p>I just explained this because the way people phrased some replies made me think they were using speed and acceleration as the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>you lose speed because of resistance</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just to add to this, the above quote tells us that this &quot;resistance&quot;  is causing an acceleration. Acceleration involves a change of velocity, so if you &quot;lose speed&quot; it means there's an acceleration involved (since speed is a component of velocity, along with direction).</p>
<p>In this case, the direction of the force due to the resistance, and thus the direction of the acceleration, is opposite to the direction of motion, so we call it &quot;deceleration&quot;, which is just an acceleration with a negative value.</p>
<p>With that in mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You don't lose acceleration because of resistance, you lose speed because of resistance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You do lose acceleration because of resistance, since the resistance is a force which causes a reduction in your acceleration. This in turn will reduce your speed compared to what it would otherwise be. If you're not pushing, then your net speed will reduce; if you are pushing, then your speed will increase by less than it would otherwise without the resistance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You pushing the box is acceleration and the time you stop pushing the box is deceleration</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is correct, although what I've attempted to point out above is that these are <em>net</em> accelerations, that are the result of both the acceleration due to your pushing and the acceleration due to resistance pushing in the opposite direction. </p>
<p>(Conventionally, this would be expressed in terms of force, with the acceleration being calculated from net force, but you can just as well do the calculations directly with accelerations.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just because there’s no resistance, doesn’t mean you will accelerate infinitely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think this is the best way to word it. You can accelerate as much as you want at any speed. But more of the acceleration goes into the inertial mass as you approach the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>
