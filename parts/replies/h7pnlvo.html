			<div class="markdown"><p>Panamanian here. There's a bright and dark side about the Panama Canal. </p>
<p>The bright side is that the Panama Canal Zone has been kept  &quot;green&quot; as a sort of National Park because it highly depends on rain and the ecosystem surrounding it. The dark side is that in order to create the Gatun Lake, a whole forest was flooded. You can still see trees in the middle of the lake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, they also had to literally remove a few mountains (and continue to deal with occasional landslides because of it to this day).  Some peaks where left in the lake where they've become isolated islands where animal and plant populations have been able to thrive in isolation, both genetic and from human influence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's only expanding existing canals or adding canals alongside, the immediate impact from the build should be minimum. The impact from the additional traffic itself however would be worse, either from carbon emissions or the erosion from the waves they create, etc.</p></div>		</li>
