			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s also important to note that using an optical disc for data, the data can be fetched at very fast speeds. When you think of the disc as a record with a groove for the music or video, imagine the machine is setting aside its amazing superhuman speed and versatility to basically play it like a record using a laser instead of a needle (there’s a layer removed from this analogy since the data isn’t a wavy groove like on a record but rather a binary representation of the wave) and when the machine is told to retrieve data, it is able to move much faster, and, as the technology advanced, spin the disc much faster while reading that data, so “playing back” files is happening differently than playing back music. The laser that reads the data trucks along slowly when playing music or video, but jumps around fast when retrieving files. </p>
<p>And in all computers including consoles like Playstation, etc- the data isn’t always used instantly as it’s being read. Data is played back by the CD-ROM drive and then gets stored in random access memory of the computer/console and used as needed. The system knows where to put that data in RAM for most efficient retrieval. Loading screens happen when the program needs to reorganize data from the disc in RAM because the game knows you’re about to be using certain chunks of data next. </p></div>		</li>
