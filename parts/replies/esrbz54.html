			<div class="markdown"><p>Isotretinoin is taken orally and has many side effects, you need to talk to your derm to consider it.</p>
<p>Tretinoin/adapalene/tazarotene can be found in prescription creams, so you need to ask a derm/md too. Unless you live in a country where it's not prescription like Spain, Andorra, India...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm from the EU, so I trust the EMA and my country's (France) recommendations: hydroquinone is not safe (and is forbidden in the EU, potential carcinogenic and harmful to the environment), so I prefer legit and safe depigmenting solutions (vit C, exfoliating, niacinamide, and time).</p></div>		</li>
