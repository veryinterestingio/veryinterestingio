			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea (roughly) was that when children had mental/developental illnesses show up either quickly or too slowly to notice, people claimed the real child had been stolen and swapped for this &quot;Changeling&quot;.</p>
<p>A horrible but.... somewhat understandable belief.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And by changeling we don't mean a creature that is an expert shapeshifter, able to flawlessly impersonate a known being, like Odo, the T-1000, or Queen Chrysalis.</p>
<p>We mean a being that is trying, but FAILING, to imitate a human.  Uncanny valley, just aint right. poor attempt at alien fakery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was specifically an otherworldly child that was left, a fairy in Irish and Scottish tradition. If you think about the age of kids when they start to show signs of autism, it makes sense that people might think the child is a fairy imposter. It was occasionally used to explain away a murder too, as in the case of Bridget Cleary who was killed by her husband with the aid of neighbours and a priest. </p></div>		</li>
