			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it’s quite fascinating as I usually always fall asleep after my boyfriend I will witness his body reacting to him falling asleep. He’ll have multiple twitches between 2-9 nightly before I hear his little snores and then I know he’s off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah I previously mentioned this on a separate comment actually - He doesn’t snore loudly, the occasional loudish snort will be let loose but other than that it’s just kind of breathing louder than normal, no restricted airflow that I can tell.</p>
<p>I’ll keep an ear out though because he does say how he hasn’t had the greatest nights sleep quite often.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am as certain as I can be with no medical degree that my SO has sleep apnea. He snores SOOO loud. Then there will be silence(I don't see his chest rise or fall) for several beats and then a loud snort/gasp/snore(it seems to be on an inhale). He falls asleep all through the day if he sits down for a moment. I have tried to talk to him about this and it is very difficult. Would you mind sharing what your spouses heart condition is? I would like to try to share what I have read here with him to try and convice him to see a Dr.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is possible medication can cause this. I had a side-effect from Welbutrin where I literally couldn't fall asleep for three days. Every time I would start I would jerk awake like this. I had to be weened off it immediately while being prescribed Ambien to force me to sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was prescribed Wellbutrin 10 years ago and was taken off after 6 months because the jerks were so out of control, during the day as well. I actually wound up in the ER one night because I thought it was a seizure. I was taken off Wellbutrin yet the daytime and nighttime jerks have continued ever since. Been to 3 neurologists and no one can tell me why....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>very interesting... i take wellbutrin and my new-ish boyfriend has been saying that i do these hypnagogic jerks a few times before falling totally asleep every night. i also had an odd episode of sleep paralysis a couple weeks ago. never thought the medication could be causing this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went through something very similar. It started immediately, and it was like I was being electroshocked. I didn't sleep for literally days, and it got to the point that I was sitting in a bookstore trying to doze off and I would jerk so violently that it scared the other patrons.</p>
<p>Fucked me up good for <em>years</em>, and I only took it for a few days. Worst mistake of my life to touch that stuff. Would rather have broken both legs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Clinical health psychologist with particular expertise in sleep and there is so much wrong with this comment. There is no evidence (even with our evolutionary psychologist brethren) that what OP is claiming is remotely true. The last theory I heard on this was that when our simian ancestors slept in trees the jerk was our bodies way of keeping us from falling off a limb. Again, just ideas/theories. </p>
<p>Your post sounds appealing but there is nothing substantive to back it up. You’re also confusing hypnagogic and hypnapomic jerks.  </p>
<p>Edit. People are asking for sources. There aren’t any, same reason OP isn’t providing any. This is in the realm of evolutionary psychology theory which can’t be disproven or substantiated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scrolled way too far for this comment. I was looking for someone asking what happens when body is already paralyzed, either para- or quadriplegic.  Would the brain still attempt to send this signal (ie phantom limb) and if it did would that mean people with reduced bodily functions fall asleep faster than those without?</p>
<p>The whole explanation seems too convenient to be applied across all mammals, animals or just the general population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seriously. How are people just reading right past the &quot;your brain manufactures a scenario that would startle you every single time you're falling asleep&quot; and just nod to themselves thinking &quot;Yup, that sounds about right&quot; despite the fact that they are humans with brains and don't experience this.</p>
<p>Jerking awake from dreams is a thing. It's familiar to most people. They're describing this happening while still mostly awake. Also, it's just a super complex and outlandish thing even if you hand-wave that off with something like &quot;well, you just don't remember it happening.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read it and thought 'yeah... that sounds like a useful mechanism'. However a theory I heard and was looking for is if your heart rate and breathing slows down too quickly you will jerk awake because of the sudden decrease in your body removing CO2.</p></div>		</li>
