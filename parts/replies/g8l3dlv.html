<p>I've had to teach this exact topic of how plants and their roots work to not just children but also adults of all ages. There are some people that don't know what cells are or why plants have roots. Some might think this would be &quot;basic knowledge&quot; or stuff that &quot;everyone knows&quot; by the time they're adults. However, <a href="https://xkcd.com/1053/" target="_blank">everyone learns about something for the first time in their lives, some earlier than others, and still some later than others. Every day there are, on average, 10,000 people in the US hearing about it.</a> In keeping with the spirit of this sub, I tried to make my explanation simple. There are plenty of topics that I still don't know anything about, and this sub is a great resource to have others explain things simply for me!</p></div>		</li>
