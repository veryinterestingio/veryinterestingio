			<div class="markdown"><p>you can shed production, which is not destroying energy, but has a similar function.  It hasn't been incentivised so it isn't done, but as power gets negative value more often you will see it more often. </p>
<p>Another issue with doing things as efficiently as possible is feed in tarrifs.  If you are getting $100 + the spot price you are going to keep selling until the price hits -100, much to the detriment of all of the power producers who don't have the ability to production shed. Hydro, Wind and solar are the biggest factors in this, and I think that they are some of the easiest to curtail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually haven't read anything about production shedding. I'd assume it's problematic because renewables are far easier to shed, but they're the ones we want running at full capacity.</p>
<p>I suppose that's what we get for building colossal coal plants to feed half a state at a time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem isn't cutting production of renewable resources. We <em>want</em> to use them as much as we can because the electricity is more or less free.</p>
<p>The problem is that the gargantuan coal and natural gas power plants we have take hours if not days to increase or decrease their output that far. The fossil fuel plants <em>can</em> just produce less, but only if you want less tomorrow instead of right now when demand is too low.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fossil fuels don't have a problem load following.  Most do it now.  The real sufferer is nuclear power plants.  They don't move up and down as easily and aren't designed to change power levels often.  They are safest at 100% power.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well there's that key phrase: &quot;as much as we can&quot;. Obviously if the electricity price is negative, then we can't use them that much.</p></div>		</li>
