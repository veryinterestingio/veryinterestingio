			<div class="markdown"><p>The same goes with cannabis. it does damage to your lungs when smoked just as bad.</p>
<p>when I was a kid I started smoking weed, and totally was in denial about the consequences but still had a serious aversion to cigarettes I didn't wanna get addicted to anything, especially something that harms you. and I didn't even know what nicotine did to you other than harm you.</p>
<p>Because the propaganda that weed wasn't bad for you and was good for you and they don't &quot;put&quot; all these &quot;chemicals&quot; in it. I smoked weed</p>
<p>If I had done more research on my own, or if the education system didn't fail us by parroting propaganda you could see through. and then falling for other propaganda. rather than real information I wouldn't have chose to smoke weed.</p>
<p>the fact is that smoking is bad, and there are other routes of administration that are magnitudes less harmful. edibles beverages and stuff like that are the safest. vaporization (heating something up to a certain temperature where it doesn't burn the stuff and turns the nicotine into a vapor, where you aren't inhaling burnt plant) </p>
<p>there is debate in the medical community about how harmful vaporization is, but it is generally agreed its less harmful then smoking.</p>
<p>don't smoke please. enjoy the rest of your life</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may harm your lungs, but that isn’t the main deterrent when it comes to smoking cigarettes vs cannabis.  It’s the cancer and mutation causing element.  For whatever reason, smoking cannabis results in almost no increase in your chances of developing cancer whereas cigarettes increase your chances immensely.  So the worst case scenario for a heavy pot smoker is having much weaker lungs and whatever other neurological changes being high all day for years causes.  Certainly better than having to talk through a hole in your throat and dying of cancer at 50.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One important consideration here is dosage.  Per puff, tobacco and marijuana might be about the same, but a two pack a day habit is close to a full ounce a day.  I don't think even the most hard core wake and baker is going to be smoking that much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are additives in cigarettes. It is just that they are, for the large part, not responsible for the harmful effects of the cigarette. I have seen some figures that say that the tobacco is responsible for 90% of the cancerogenoes substances of cigarette smoke. There are some additives, such as glycerol, that also contributes, but they are a clear minority.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two things: American Spirit probably does not use added aroma substances, and - more importantly - there are no conservatives to protect it from growing mouldy.</p>
<p>The latter also means it has to be dryer than typical shag, which means it can end up being powder-like, which really sucks for people who roll joints.</p>
<p>For those, I recommend Pueblo. Same principles, but <em>slightly</em> higher humidity, and much more usable end-product per pack.</p></div>		</li>
