			<div class="markdown"><p>Second, birds. Let's stop here and examine the terms you're using. The Mesozoic Era, 250 million years ago to 65 million years ago, is only one slice of prehistory. I believe you may be conflating the age of dinosaurs (not all of whom were giant) with the age of giant animals in general. However, as I noted above, the largest invertebrates we've found had died out long before the Mesozoic started - and the largest birds we've found appear long after it ended. </p>
<p>The large birds you're thinking of may be the &quot;Terror Bird&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phorusrhacidae" target="_blank">phorusrhacids</a>, 10-foot-tall monsters that hunted across South America and then exploded across North America after the formation of the Panama land bridge. Thanks to the magic of convergent evolution, we've found similar large predator birds in the Old World and in North America before the phorusrhacids appeared, but none of these flightless predators appear until a few million years after the extinction that ended the Cretaceous Period (and the Mesozoic Era). </p>
<p>Very sadly, the largest bird we have evidence for is the elephant bird of Madagascar, which went extinct between 1000 and 500 years ago. (The largest flying bird ever discovered, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelagornis_sandersi" target="_blank">Pelagornis</a>, had a wingspan of up to 24 feet, although its weight was probably only five percent the weight of a living elephant bird. It lived 25 million years ago.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Third, fish. Now this is fun- the largest extinct fish is from the Mesozoic! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leedsichthys" target="_blank">Leedsichthys</a>is from the Jurassic, and at 60 feet is twice the size of a modern 30-foot whale shark. (Of course, its most famous competitor, the 50-foot <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalodon" target="_blank">megalodon</a>, arose about 150 million years later, living 20 to 2 million years ago.) The Tethys Ocean of the Jurassic sat between the supercontinents of Gondwanaland and Laurasia; it was shallow, warm, and fed with nutrients from the rivers of both supercontinents. <a href="http://www.sepmstrata.org/CMS_Images/Forams/Paleoeco/jurassic%20mid.JPG" target="_blank">In this map</a>, you can see the vast continental shelves, the warm tropical location of the Tethys (largely insulated by the supercontinents from mixture with the colder waters of the Panthalassic Ocean), and the many sources of minerals from continental erosion. </p>
<p>It's no surprise the Tethys was amazingly productive, and that the predators of the Tethys grew to enormous size. However, Leedsichthys was a filter feeder like today's baleen whales or the whale shark, not a ferocious predator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seeing that map you referenced is amazing. Never considered how different the oceans could've been over time (it's always just a huge mass of water, right?) - but all those shallows and being insulated by the continent is super interesting, thanks for your detailed explanations! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know the blue whale is a mamal but isn't it the biggest sea animal that ever lived? And I know it's not technically a fish but wouldn't it speak a against tge giant size being so unnormal? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally, being big is very expensive for a creature.   A lot more food, potentially less mobility, all of that.   So usually when we see megafauna, it's because there's an advantage great enough that it outweighs the disadvantages.     </p>
<p>In the case of ice age mammals, for example, it's more thermally efficient to be massive.    With others, like sauropod dinosaurs, very tall trees presented a unique ecological niche.   Like modern giraffes.    </p>
<p>Other times, it's an arms race.   When the prey species get big, you the to see big predators emerge too.    This can start an adaptive arms race.    Whales might be an example of this.    There are predators that eat young whales, while they're small.   Orcas do this.   But nobody preys on a big whale.   Well, except humans.   </p>
<p>Which is another pressure: predation.    Natural predators tend to go for the weak; very young, for example.   Human predation seems to like the big ones.   Studies of fish populations have shown that we have put evolutionary pressure on some heavily-fished species, and their adult size is actually becoming smaller.   It's entirely possible that other species of animal have experienced similar pressure from human predation.  </p>
<p>There were some birds soon after the k-pg extinct event that filled the niche of apex predator.   They grew very large.   The trouble is, very large predators are usually specialized for very large prey.    Look at what happened when the Moa died out.   The species of eagle that specializes in hunting them fell soon after.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Out of curiosity how long did the reduction in size of insects take to evolve?</p>
<p>Obviously it would have been quicker than a similar change in birds or mammals due to the breeding speed that insects have.</p>
<p>Just want to know how long I need to put aside to evolve my massive bug army.</p></div>		</li>
