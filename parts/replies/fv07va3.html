			<div class="markdown"><p>Memory B cells reside in the bonemarrow and circulate.  B cells traffic to lymphnodes where they interact with Cd4 T cells and FRC during infection, proliferate and undergo somatic hypermutation.  Often they lose CXCR4 and CXCR5 and leave the lymphnodes to the site of infection or into circulation.</p>
<p>Depending on the strength of antigen binding, they either return to circulation or die in the red pulp of the spleen as short lived plasma cells.</p>
<p>B cells that encounter moderate antigen binding undergo transcriptional changes that lead to a memory B cell phenotype (IL7R, suppression of BLIMP1, upregulation of memory bound IgG and BCLXL etc).  These cells are recruited BACK to the bonemarrow where they originated and reside there indefinitely.  Some continue to circulate, and some might even become tissue resident though that's up for debate.</p>
<p>Long lived plasma cells undoubtedly go to the bonemarrow where they can propagate in some cases for the duration of hte organisms life span and produce soluble antibody of many differen flavors.  </p>
<p>Most plasma cells in the peyer's patches are actually SLPC and are constantly recycled with exposure to foreign/tolerated antigen brought in by microfold cells.  These cells almost exclusively produce IgA, though they also create some muscosal IgGs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really! You still have your spleen and other lymphatic tissues so that B and T cells can come together with antigen presenting cells in order to generate an immune response. The reason your tonsils had to come out is that the antigen presenting cells migrated there from the site of infection carrying live virus or bacteria, and caused the cells of your tonsils to become infected....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is tit possible to store more (or higher concentrations) of those memory cells for your long-term immune system? I assume recency is important, but can your body, for example, store a lot of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in your tissue to strengthen your immune system against it in the long-term?</p></div>		</li>
