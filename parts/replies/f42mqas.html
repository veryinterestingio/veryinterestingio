			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly I’d say it depends on how high of a degree you got and what you’d want to do with it. Looking back I wish I had done a dual major with mechanical engineering because it opens up more options with just a bachelors degree. A lot of nukes go to grad school too. But off the top of my head (places to work rather than specific roles)... national lab work, shipyard/naval work, commercial power plants, startup companies, fuel design/fabrication, health physics, probably some environmental stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since it's not relevant to OP's question I'm responding to yours. But interestingly, oxygen poisoning and radiation are &quot;kind of similar&quot;. From what I remember, oxygen free radicals are actually responsible for the lethal damage cause by both oxygen poisoning and radiation.</p>
<p>Respiration is basically a very slow form of oxygen poisoning. It's estimated (Lovelock study) that the damage done by breathing for one year is equivalent to a whole-body radiation dose of 1 sievert. Theoretically, breathing would be 50 times as dangerous as all the radiation you receive in the course of an entire lifetime. To be fair, this was a study based on 'hits' to DNA, which also includes junk DNA, so depending on &quot;vital hits&quot;, it may be much less dangerous (since most of our DNA is junk DNA). Feel free to correct me tough, I just got this from reading the book Oxygen by Nick Lane, which is an interesting read.  </p>
<p>I do have a question tough, you say polonium is only harmful when in direct contact with organs.  From reading the book, my assumption was that most reactions take place with water in our bodies, so I assume you then mean the water in that tissue? Or specific molecules inside those organs? I also assume, that the fact that the alpha particles barely penetrate anything, they need direct contact with organs/water to be harmful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's correct they need to be about a millimeter or less distance to cause damage. But they are subatomic particles. Water molecules and everything are huge compared to the proton-neutron alpha particles.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics compared respiring and non-respiring yeast cells. When respiration was activated, there was a direct increase in the cells’ tolerance to oxidised substances; however, contrary to expectation, this was not accompanied by a rise in the concentration of free radicals. This proved that respiring cells are entirely capable of dealing with the increased formation of free radicals and keeping them at the level of the non-respiring cells.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the primary radiation from a banana is from Potassium (K-40) which emmits a robust gamma ray and beta particle. Gamma rays are typically considered weaker than alpha particles when interacting at contact distances of unprotected flesh. Also, Betas are slightly weaker than alphas. The energy of the gamma ray / beta particle emited seldomly by a banana is about 1.4 MeV and 1.3 MeV, respectively. The energy of the gamma ray is about 5.3 MeV. </p>
<p>The half life of K-40 is also much longer than the 138 day half-life of Polonium 210. The specific activity is significantly less and thus in a given hour of time there are fewer radiations from a banana. </p>
<p>The calculated dose from eating a single banana is about 10 microRem. The average dose from a 6 hour flight is 4,000 microRem. The expected dose from smoking 1.5 packs of cigarettes a day is 36,000 microRem (and this breaks down to about 3.6 microRem per cigarette). Astronauts can exceed a dose of 10,000,000 microRem from radiation in space.</p></div>		</li>
