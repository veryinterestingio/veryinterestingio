			<div class="markdown"><p>Magnetism is derived from the spin states of the electrons of the atoms in the lattices. When it says the material is aligned, it means that the valence electrons, those in the outmost shell, have aligned spin states (called up or down). The ferromagnetic elements are iron, cobalt, and nickel, which you’ll see are next to each other in the top of the transition metal block. They have election configurations with 6, 7, or 8 electrons in the d orbital, respectively, out of a possible 10. But by Hund’s rule and the Pauli exclusion principle, these have 4, 3, or 2 unpaired electrons, whose up or down spins are not cancelled out, producing a magnetic moment. It’s these ones that create the aligned spins that produce a ferromagnetic effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An electron has a magnetic value we call 'spin'.  It can be either spin up or spin down (don't ask why it's called that, it just is).  In an atom, an electron has strictly defined spaces it can occupy.  These are called 'orbitals', because they are kind of (but not really) like specific regions that an electron is allowed to orbit the nucleus.  When adding electrons to an atom, you have to put them into one of these orbitals.  Because electrons negative they repel each other, and therefore they don't like to be put into the same orbital. So when first adding electrons to an atom you give each its own orbital until there are no orbitals left.  Then you have to double up. </p>
<p>For very complicated quantum mechanical reasons, you can only have 2 electrons in each orbital and these electrons MUST have opposite spins.  So when you have two electrons in the same orbital their spins cancel and there is no magnetism.  If you have a bunch of electrons in separate orbitals, however, they are allowed to have the same spin and so their magnetism adds up.  Some metals (e.g iron, nickel etc.) have the right number of electrons and the right type of orbitals to allow them to separate like this, others have the wrong number and the electrons are forced to double up and cancel each other out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You aren’t explaining orbitals correctly.  Each electron doesn’t get its own orbital until you have to “double up”.  It also doesn’t have to do with electrons repelling each other.  Each orbital represents an energy state, and electrons fill from the bottom energy states upwards and every electron you add will usually end up in the lowest available energy state, which means doubling up from the getgo.  </p>
<p>What you are meaning to say is that in an individual orbital, electrons won’t spin pair until the orbital is otherwise full (for instance, if an orbital holds 8 electrons, all of the electrons in that orbital will have the same spin until more than 4 electrons are added)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so, in a sense, does a spin up and spin down attract each other like a hydrophillic head would point outward and a hydrophobic head would point inward?</p>
<p>So would a North end magnet (for example) be spinning up, while the South end magnet would be spinning down?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope.  A ferrofluid is essentially a suspension of magnetite nanoparticles in oil.  The particles are solid but so small that they behave like a liquid when in suspension.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ferrofluid isn't actually a liquid.  Its tiny little particles of solid metal suspended in a non-magnetic oil.  The metal dust is treated so that it is chemically attracted to the oil and doesn't just settle to the bottom of the fluid like it normally would.  It is the metal which responds to magnetic fields, not the liquid oil.  </p>
<p>Additionally, ferrofluids usually aren't magnetic themselves, they just respond to external magnets, like any piece of non-magnetized iron.  You could create a ferro-fluid using magnetized iron dust, but the magnetized iron particles would clump together through magnetic attraction instead of staying evenly distributed through the oil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, rubbing a magnet on a non-magnetized piece of ferrous metal helps re-orient the tiny magnetic crystals and &quot;magnetizes&quot; the new piece of metal.  Because it is already solid, you are only able to reorient a very small portion of the magnetic crystals, so it will be a fairly weak magnet.  Creating a strong magnet requires heating the metal up to a point where the crystals can be reoriented more easily, and allowing it to cool in the presence of a strong magnetic field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't need to heat the metal to magnetize it, you just need a strong enough magnetic field. How well it retains the magnetization when you remove the field depends on the material and the size/shape/orientation of the grains within it.</p></div>		</li>
