			<div class="markdown"><p>I would also say that the size of the contact lens helps-  their edges are outside your general blinking area, meaning that your eyes are less likely to notice a contract lens as a foreign body in your eye. An eye lash on the other hand is small and rather course, meaning as you blink, your eyelid and brain registers there is a foreign body in your eye at a particular spot</p></div>		</li>
