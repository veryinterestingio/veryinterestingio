			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably a great behavioral trait for female cougars, who may recognize kinship or familiarity with their mother or sister, and in areas of high food density, staying close to their natal territory reduces chances of dying while in dispersal (which is pretty dangerous). I think the important thing is that cougar mating tactics do not always involve the same male and female. The females are probably less mobile than males, so the risks of the a father cougar visiting and mating with his daughter is lower. If there were behavioral traits for male cougars to remain near their related mother and sisters after adulthood, inbreeding depression could occur and that trait would be negatively selected against.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should also be noted that this behavior will be genetically reinforced by evolution.</p>
<p>You share a fair bit of DNA with your siblings, so supporting their success in life means your Nieces and Nephews share 25% of their DNA on average with you.</p>
<p>Thus, increasing the odds of your Nieces, Nephews, and even grandchildren is a further way to propagate your genetics.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In domestic felines, it’s documented that daughters may share or overlap territories with the mother. Some even share a nest. </p>

<p>Feral domesticated cats form colonies. Unlike wild cats, they're social, even with unrelated cats in the same colony.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was a study on feral cats. They found that familiar daughters stayed closer than unrelated. It did not state if they were super concentrated city cats or not. territory for domestic colonies could be as big as a block or a front porch depending on concentration. Male offspring wanders off and is tolerated by his sisters and mom more so than say, a totally strange male.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They only form colonies when resources support it. It’s a strategy based on the environment, NOT their default. Otherwise mothers scatter their young who find their own territory.</p></div>		</li>
