			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was growing up I was told the most important thing to be taught in high school is to think critically in different ways (hence why there were so many &quot;critical studies&quot; classes on various subjects) and that university or TAFE was for developing a skill in an area you like.</p>
<p>If you come out of high school without the skills for self learning and evaluation then your teachers failed. Miserably.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't learn to critically think until college. My high school education left me lacking a lot. There is still so much to learn with limited amount in my storage to memorize it all. It's all about forming a process to critically think so that regardless of what facts may have passed through your brain, hopefully you can still come to the same conclusions if you don't have the RAM to just recall the information.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Early 70s, Jimmy Stewart had a TV show with his name on it. He played an archeology professor. In one scene, he was lecturing the class and part of his monologue was &quot;It's not that I want you to answer my questions, I want you to question my answers.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where do you live that people come out of school with critical thinking skills?</p>
<p>Maybe it's just my experience but I feel that if a teacher could build life skills in their students like that, it would be a massive success. Failing to do so is just average.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, your experiences mold you. Some of the questions are like, &quot;Where's the catch?&quot; because you've been burned and know the signs of a bad deal. </p>
<p>I also, on rereading it again saw the &quot;learned how to ask&quot; as the other side of the coin where, for instance, there are times and ways to ask people for things or information that depend on the situation.</p>
<p>Lastly, I don't know who to attribute this to, but here it is:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sadly that's not how math was taught to me back in school.</p>
<p>solving equations for example was more or less always the same sequence that you had to memorize.</p>
<p>&quot;when there's a fraction like this i just need to do this and that and then i get the result&quot;</p>
<p>and then you repeated that on end until you were able to solve a ton of equations in the test where you needed to know all the sequences by heart. I also felt like that was similar with all other topics.</p>
<p>I love solving logical problems, but they never sparked my interest in math with how they taught it.</p>
<p>I might be kind of wrong, but that's how I feel about it. It was all pretty unenthusiastic and dumb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is because math education in school never really overcame the shackles of the industrial revolution. The goal was to produce skilled workers who could work in a factory or firm and used the math training they had to get the right answer.</p>
<p>It was not really important that they understand why they get the right answer with those steps. Op said, math is about solving puzzles. I differ slightly. Math is about learning how to solve puzzles in a generalised way by using a formal language and rules to capture the essence of the puzzle.</p>
<p>Even today, for most people, if you don't go to University and take some math classes, you have no idea what math is. You only have been trained to use a narrow range of mathematical tools that the industrial revolution thought was useful to produce good workers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why we teach a variety of subjects. Because life is full of all kinds of puzzles and no one subject prepares us for all of them. Math helps with a lot, but here’s no cost of living calculator for bad relationships. You need a well rounded education to deal with the chaos and nuance of life</p></div>		</li>
