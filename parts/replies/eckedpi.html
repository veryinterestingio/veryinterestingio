			<div class="markdown"><p>This is so interesting. I'm an art teacher, and it made me think of how students always think they're bad at drawing because they can't draw a likeness of someone, when the problem is actually that humans are crazy good at identifying the tiny details of other human's faces, so we're sensitive to the tiniest mistake in a portrait of someone. It sounds like similarly, we're way better than we think at recognizing all the flavors of meat, so we'd recognize even a really close replica as being somehow off. Am I understanding this correctly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the other hand...</p>
<p>When you talk on the phone with someone, it sounds like the person, right?</p>
<p>But in reality, that voice is just data. And it's not even really all that accurate compared to reality. Typical Phone lines just can't handle that much data.</p>
<p>So why does it sound just like the other person?</p>
<p>Well, it's because the brain fills in the missing details!</p>
<p>You know how their voice sounds, so the brain just supplies the rest for you. Handy, huh?</p>
<p>And, totally contradictory. :| human brain is weird </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the difference between missing details and WRONG details. </p>
<p>It's why Johnny-5 is adorable, but those humanlike robots are nightmares. Similar for cartoons and other drawn media. When its representational enough we fill in gaps. When there are details we switch from symbol-making to pattern-finding, and turn from 'really good symbol' to 'horrifyingly bad real thing'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if you don’t know how his voice sounds. Say a telemarketer contacts you on the phone. You have never met him or spoke to him before. </p>
<p>Now somehow you meet him in person. His voice will sound different then how you heard it originally?</p>
<p>Where as when you know the person your brain fills it in over the phone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might not apply here or to everything but with things like these our perception can change between 'close enough' and 'almost indistinguishable' to make the latter worse. An easy example is humanoid cartoons: the more realistic they're trying to get CGI imagery and facial animation, the creepier it looks compared to classic hand drawn stuff. For me at least the 'new' disney stuff like Frozen is the firsts where the bobblehead effect is not so noticable.</p>
<p>So I wonder if it's the same for meat substitutes, if something simple like soy with MSG would taste better than something with 99% taste of meat, just because for the former we expect the difference while the latter is almost right yet a bit off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It'd be hard to find an essential vitamin or nutrient that's not present in liver. Literally everything you need. Even things not common in meat like folic acid and vitamin c. Liver truly is the greatest super food. And some fucking idiot convinced everyone that cholesterol is bad for us now people don't eat liver anymore. </p></div>		</li>

<p>now people don't eat liver anymore. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember when I was a kid and I ate liver at least once a week, because it was 2 dollars a pound and we were poor. I always looked forward to that day... Some livers fried in olive oil are about the best tasting thing on earth. Add some mushrooms and vegetables and oh my god...</p>
<p>Growing up I thought this was a thing normal people ate. I still cook them weekly but my wife won't eat them. It makes me so sad. I mean you like what you like but... I cook some amazing chicken livers. It's often said that rich peoples food imitates the poor, and there's a bit of truth to it. But in reality my wife won't eat it because it's a &quot;poor persons food&quot; and that makes me very sad. She won't even try it.</p>
<p>I love her in every other way, and maybe she just doesn't like liver but man if for one minute I could erase her mind and give her a bite I know she'd like it. The only reason she doesn't is because of the <em>implication</em> of eating liver.</p>
<p>Blows my mind how chicken muscle is fine but some chicken livers cooked in olive oil are EWWWWWW GROSSSSSS...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weird. Here we have numerous ways to cook livers and it is in no way considered food for the poor. It is delicacy when done well and often served with rakı or between meals or with soup. I recommend this recipe, not chicken but it is perfect: <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/arnavut-ciayeri-turkish-fried-liver-onions-3274322" target="_blank">https://www.thespruceeats.com/arnavut-ciayeri-turkish-fried-liver-onions-3274322</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. For chicken, I can't stand the feeling those fibers and muscles in mouth and usually end up gagging trying to get any kind of chicken down. </p>
<p>But chicken liver? It ain't got any of that, so I'm able to eat that much more easily. The implication still grosses me out but still.</p>
<p>Y'all got any tips on overcoming these... limits? I'm struggling to get my protein intake for every day due to this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I got myself to love liver is to start eating  faux gras which is duck liver and absolutely delicious! It can be pricy but tastes like meat butter and is awesome. After I got a taste for that I started to enjoy other types. I really like grilled pork liver. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer is likely yes. The science is definitely not settled, but the largest ongoing study of vegetarian diets in the US suggests people who abstain from eating meat have a range of health benefits. The top comment is extremely biased in this thread. </p>
