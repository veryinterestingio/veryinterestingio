			<div class="markdown"><p>They're stop gap measures at best really. Animals often don't like to use those.</p>
<p>There's wildlife bridges all over my country like that, they're virtually unused. One of them is famous for costing millions and being equipped with camera's and sensors to track the way wildlife use the bridge. In five years time it detected a single hedgehog crossing a bridge big enough for entire herds of deer and boar to cross.</p>
<p>They called it the 15 million euro hedgehog.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but the bridges are not for the wildlife. They for humans, in order to assuage our guilty consciences and pretend like we are doing something positive for nature, instead of our massive total negative effect on the world. $15 million is very inexpensive way in order to pretend like we are doing something.</p>
<p>Now let's get back to killing off all other animal life on the planet, humans. We can do it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it is. mountain lions are regularly spotted in the residential areas around suburban LA, and are sadly killed on occasion trying to cross the numerous freeways that divide up the various tracts of land. hopefully a bridge such as this will help. theyâ€™ve been successful elsewhere.</p></div>		</li>
