			<div class="markdown"><p>Your circulatory system is less like a water line coming into your house, and more like city roads and highways. If there's a blockage in your veins, the blood will back up right there a little, but the pressure will back up and send blood through other veins - not unlike when there's an accident, cars take alternate routes.</p>
<p>A chronic backup of your veins is bad because it makes your heart have to work harder to move blood, which is bad for your heart, or if it's a major &quot;highway&quot; like a big main artery, it's cutting off the blood to your whole body and there aren't many &quot;side streets&quot; for your blood to get there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure there's a lot of damage being done that totally depends on the situation— like where the person is stabbed, the size of the veins/arteries it hits, etc. This might sometimes be the case, but there are likely more severe problems going on.</p>
<p>Also the knife doesn't form a perfect seal, so veins do still are emptying out around the wound into the inside of the body and outside of it. The knife is temporary stopper in that it restricts the flow more than the open wound would. You'll still bleed out if you don't get help if the wound is bad enough.</p>
<p>Picture trying to hold the wound with your hand instead of the knife, or applying pressure with a cloth. It helps. Not entirely, not in any way that's gonna save you, but it buys a little time. Not touching the knife helps in a similar way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is good to try to picture because i always imagined veins as being a mass of just branches and ends if that makes sense, like if one got cut off there'd be no way to the other end</p></div>		</li>
