<p>I don't really know why it is that I care so much about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lodoicea#Threats" target="_blank">Lodoicea</a>, but I think that the world will be diminished if we lose them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, reading the history and mythology of it, it's really cool.  The fact that it's nut was found washed up in the maldives and no one knew where it came from until the seychelles were explored is incredible.  It was literally an artifact of a land no one knew of is kinda romantic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Wollemi Pine was only known in the fossil record until a living stand of them was unexpectedly discovered in a remote region of NSW.  The location of the live trees was kept a closely guarded secret while botanical gardens bred baby Wollemis, eventually putting them on sale to an Australian public eager to own and grow a 'living fossil'.</p>
<p>In Tasmania, the Huon pine was prized for its distinctly golden wood, and rapidly felled until people realised it is an exceptionally slow growing tree, taking a thousand years to reach maturity.  A strict logging ban was put in place.   Very occasionally old logs from the timber sites drift down the Derwent river and are retrieved.  They are the only legal source of Huon pine timber today.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.kauridieback.co.nz/why-are-kauri-so-important/" target="_blank">Kauri Tree</a> is one of the cornerstone species in the New Zealand Bush. They are also one of the longest living organisms with them living upwards of 1,000 years. they are currently being killed by a micro-organism that attacks their roots and eventually kills the whole tree. It appeared about 15 years ago, and New Zealand is desperately trying to slow down the spread of the organism. Currently, the <a href="https://www.newzealand.com/int/feature/waitakere-ranges/" target="_blank">Waitakere Ranges</a> are 95% closed to the public currently, because we seem to be the major carriers of the organism (through us hiking through the ranges and passing it around). Dogs and feral pigs also spread it, but the dogs usually accompany us and there is few pigs. </p>
<p>Also the Government is spending millions to try and find a way to stop it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kauri (<em>Agathis australis</em>) is in serious trouble and we will likely lose most of our ancient trees like Tane Māhuta, but they are not likely to go extinct because a) there is a successful treatment (not cure) for the disease (<em>Phytophthora agathidicida</em>) b) some kauri are showing resistance, suggesting that a resistance breeding programme is possible (if deemed culturally acceptable) and c) there are significant plantings of kauri on the south island and natural stands on minor offshore islands where the pathogen has not spread.</p>
<p>However, Bartlett's rātā (<em>Metrosideros bartlettii</em>) is much closer to extinction in the wild. There are only around 13 adult specimens in the wild, and it's quite susceptible to myrtle rust. Pōhutukawa (<em>Metrosideros excelsa</em>), ramarama (<em>Lophomyrtus bullata</em>), swamp maire (<em>Syzygium maire</em>) and rōhutu (<em>Lophomyrtus obcordata</em>) are also hard hit by myrtle rust and we are not yet sure how bad the impact will be. It's entirely possible that any one of those could be wiped out within the next decade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a real shame. I am glad that Kauri will (hopefully) make it but it’s devastating losing Tane Māhuta. </p>
<p>Thanks for the info on the other trees. Poor NZ :-(</p></div>		</li>

<p>Followup part two, does it not have seeds that can be planted?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a pennantia baylisiana.</p>
<p>So, it's maybe one of those trees that has males and females, but scientists only have one... And they aren't totally sure which. The trees that exist elsewhere were grown from clippings - essentially they're all clones of the tree. </p>
<p>So, the tree on the island doesn't produce fruit (or seeds).  </p>
<p>I'm am definitely not a tree expert (I've killed a shameful amount of nature) and I learned about the tree in college a decade ago, so it's definitely possible that things have changed since then. Hopefully someone who knows more accurate information will pop in and enlighten both of us :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Update: I know someone who studied trees in college and apparently knew. She said that this tree needs both male and female parts to reproduce, but it actually has both of those on it. She said scientists have successfully made it reproduce and there are saplings, but it will be about 10 years until they're old enough to reproduce. She also mentioned that it'll be a very non-diverse species since they all come from the same tree.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You made me curious, one of the recorded observations on iNaturalist (there are four reported sites on the mainland North Island) suggests that it's actually from asexual reproduction from the original Three Kings tree rather than cuttings. <a href="https://inaturalist.nz/observations/1493965" target="_blank">From the observation description</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three seedlings noted within leaf litter accumulated beneath planted (seed grown) Pennantia baylisiana. This adult tree was grown from seed from one of the first P. baylisiana seedlings to ever be raised from the original parent tree. Fruiting in this planted tree is sporadic but at times heavy. The seedlings are not hybrid in origin (this tested by DNA sequencing). However, as all seedling raised trees I have so far seen are 'female' it is possible that the such fruiting specimens in cultivation have arisen through apomixis (or at least partial apomixis). This needs to be studied further. In the interim spontaneous seedlings appear from time to time in the vicinity of the planted tree but also in nearby hedges. Few survive longer than a few years due to drought or frost damage.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really cool. But also very sad at the same time. Pretty cool that they grew more from clippings! Thanks for all the info.</p></div>		</li>
