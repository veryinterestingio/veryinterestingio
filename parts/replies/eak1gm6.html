			<div class="markdown"><p>I get hives when I have hot showers, so every time I shower. It doesn't itch, just looks weird until I've cooled down. I don't have this when the air temperature is hot or when i sweat. What is my body reacting to?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have the same issue. Dr told me it's still heat, it's just that hot weather temps never get anywhere near as hot as a steamy shower. My water heater is set to 125° which is kind of on the low end so I suppose that makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think so. My skin reacts to things easily but not to scratches. I do have keratosis pilaris and eczema but the symptoms are different to the ones I mentioned and appear on other parts of my skin. Not sure if they are related to this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have the same issue every winter when I’m usually not as physically active or sweating as much as I do in the summer. Usually if I go a week or two sweating a lot most days it’ll go away and stay away until I go back into hibernation mode. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ditto. I thought it was interesting/ amusing all the red all over (after exercising and sweating in the cold) but my MD wife was quite worried. Apparently hives can result in bad things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I break out in hives when exposed to cold temperatures as well. It's really bad if it's cold water. I once jumped into a cold lake, and when I came out, I was covered from head to toe in hives.</p>
<p>Normally the cold air just effect my hands and feet the most, where I get the hives. Mine weren't red bumps though, they were white bumps.</p></div>		</li>
