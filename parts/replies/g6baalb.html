			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to the other replies - I think there are different things that are missing here:</p>
<p>- lack of communication to authors what the review practices are, and what they can expect</p>
<p>- lack of communication to readers what kind of review published papers underwent and lack of publishing of important information (i.e. number of review rounds)</p>
<p>- Lack of recognition for participating reviewers. </p>
<p>There are several initiatives trying to solve this - developing a standard taxonomy for peer review, more transparency about the process, and initiatives like Publons giving credit to reviewers. We're not there yet, but we're moving in the right direction I feel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In this case, I really do think that the conference organisers would or should provide guidance on the peer review of the abstracts of papers because ultimately they are the people deciding on what they want from the submissions and the type of content for the event and any subsequent publications. It does baffle me that often there is no clear rubric for assessing grants in particular as in this case it is a competitive process and decisions change lives.</p></div>		</li>
