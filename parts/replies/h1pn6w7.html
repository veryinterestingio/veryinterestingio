<p>intelligent  life is rare. Life has thrived on Earth for billions of years before one species developed spaceflight. Evolution doesn't inevitably lead towards developing life that can invent advanced technology. There may be many planets out there full of animals and plants, or even just bacteria, but it's possible that humanity is a bit of a freak accident.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>my intuition leans hard in this direction. the CHONPS elements are some of the most abundant (non-helium) elements in the universe; we've found large numbers of simple organic molecules in space -- the chemistry is there. Self-replicating chemicals becoming common in places that don't physically forbid them seems.. like an almost inevitable conclusion?</p>
<p>but there have been SO MANY SPECIES on Earth and only one small genus ever developed metallurgy. To invent electronics and radio transmitters and the like, you need a (highly?) social species that is capable of complex communication to share technological information from generation to generation. Probably needs to be eusocial to have group size big enough to allow for sufficiently high rate of technological progress. I'm guessing the life would have to be on land, because I don't see how you could invent metallurgy under water, but that may be a lack of imagination on my part.   </p>
<p>There's no reason for something like humans to evolve. We're not necessary or inevitable. Earth made lots of weird and cool life before us and probably will continue to do so after us. Animals can be very smart (corvids! cephalopods! cetaceans! other great apes!) and extremely successful without ever picking up a soldering iron or blueprinting a factory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I lean towards myself as well. Perhaps there are a lot of planets that are just covered in something like algae. Or perhaps as you say they have a lot of successful animals but none that special in tool-making to the level that we do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is also important to recognize that multicellular life might be incredibly rare. The evolution of the mitochondria has only happened once and from an evolutionary standpoint appears to be bafflingly absurd. From the viewpoint of a geneticist, I have more trouble accepting the rarity of intelligent life than with the rarity of mitochondria like organelle or multicellular life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also could be that we are truely amongst the first intelligent species.</p>
<p>We might just be in the early phase of the universe in which enough time has passed to create intelligent species, it certainly took a long time on earth and for all we know the evolution of intelligent life could in average take even a lot longer than this.</p>
<p>The counter argument to that is obviously statistics ie how likely it is for one species to be amongst the first of an overall enourmous population.</p>
<p>Still, there will always be a first / a group of early intelligent life by definition and I think that is even more likely if we just take our galaxy or even local group as context.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The counter to that is that several species on Earth independently evolved tool making and using ability in a very short period of time once the right ecological niche was available for it. <em>Homo sapien</em> wasn't the first tool user, or likely even the first tool user that had the brain and social capacity for civilization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. If Earth had not been hit by a comet that extinguished all larger life forms (\~66 Million years ago), it's pretty safe to assume that there'd be no humans or intelligent life in general because the existing species were so dominant and occupied all the available living environment. After all, dinosaurs roamed the planet for 10 times that duration and didn't develop human-like intelligence.</p>
<p>Also, such super-events must be far spread out and the environment must be relatively stable for a long time. It takes a lot of time after such a &quot;reset&quot; to develop intelligent life. A planet that is hit by a comet every 10 million years or so will never have intelligent life even if it seems to be very life-friendly from afar.</p>
<p>This is of course assuming that intelligent life needs to develop above ground and needs to have a certain size, but given that brain size correlates with intelligence this is probably also a safe assumption.</p>
<p>If you add all those obstacles up, it might be that it is quite rare for a planet like Earth to exist. But this doesn't mean that we're &quot;super lucky&quot; to live on exactly this planet, we are it's product.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the less fun hypothesis of &quot;The great filter&quot;, where the Fermi paradox is explained by there being some kind of barrier that intelligent species aren't able to cross before they wipe themselves out. Nuclear war, or as seems likely considering where we're heading: Environmentally destroying the planet's ability to hold life before we're able to leave it.</p>
<p>edit: As others have pointed out, it doesn't necessarily have to be one barrier. It could be many, where passing each isn't necessarily unlikely, but passing every filter is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alternatively it’s a filter we’ve already passed. Maybe we are uniquely safe from asteroids relative to most planets or something. Someone said if we encountered alien life that would mean it’s more likely the filter is still ahead of us, which is terrifying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I prefer the many small filters explanation. Just a ton of things having to go right, and divide by two a couple times and the probability is small enough for there to only be one in the observable universe.</p></div>		</li>
