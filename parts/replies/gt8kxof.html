			<div class="markdown"><p>My meteorology professor explained it like this: we know when clouds form and can predict how much it rains but not where it starts to rain. It is like a large pot with water on a stove. We know when it will start to boil and how much but we don't know where the first bubbles form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm seeing a lot of engineer examples of chaotic physical systems, so here is a mathematical one: pseudorandom number generators. They are totally deterministic -- give the same seed value the outcome is the same -- but a small change in the seed results in wildly different outputs. </p>
<p>Different PRNGs have differing properties of interest. For example, if I have the output values, can I predict the next output? Or if I have the output values, can I predict the seed? These questions are especially interesting in Cryptography, where prediction of values or a seed might mean you can break a code. Fun stuff!</p></div>		</li>

<p>slight early changes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Including differences so small that we cannot measure them.  These might be subatomic (where an attempt to measure things changes their state), or it might just be too much information (like measuring current weather conditions to try to predict the weather too far ahead).</p>
<p>Chaos theory says that, if two tests start out a few femtometres different -- which is too small to measure -- the end result will be measurable but in an unpredictable direction.  You should still be able to quantify it, so throwing a marble 1 million times while on the surface of the Earth will not result it in flying away and landing on the moon.  That marble's initial conditions, differing by a centimeter or two, will result in a much larger range of end results, potentially differing by meters (and more, if bounces and rolling are allowed for).</p>
<p>Back to a more practical example, we have thermometers, hygrometers, barometers, and anemometers to measure temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed/direction.  These, plus an observation of cloud amount, type, and movement, allow a quantitative measurement of the weather at an exact spot.  If we set up eight additional weather stations 25 km in each cardinal and ordinal direction (cardinal means north-south-east-west, and ordinal means northeast-northwest-southeast-southwest), we can make a very good guess what our weather will be in the near future.  If we extend that out further, our guesses can get increasingly accurate further into the future.  Depending on the conditions, we will need to rely on weather stations hundreds of km away to predict the weather more than a day or two out.  However, to accurately predict the weather further out than that can require more weather stations than we could possible install.  (Plus, too many weather stations -- one every meter or so for example -- could actually affect the weather!)  We can always get the average weather for an area, but the specific details that get lost in the average can affect the weather in unpredictable ways.</p>
<p>Again, note that this randomness/unpredictability is not magic.  It is simply because we cannot possibly know enough about the exact starting (and intermediate) conditions, and those changes cause disproportionately large changes later.</p>
<p>For weather forecasting, the better information we can get, the better our forecasts get.  Satellite imaging has been a tremendous boon for forecasting.  The Internet allows individuals and non-meteorological (non-weather related) organizations to set up weather stations and add their information to the weather models.  Computers get progressively faster, which allows the weather models to more accurately and more quickly predict conditions, and as processing has gotten cheaper, they run more models at the same time for the current weather, and run existing models against old weather to see how accurately it would have predicted conditions.</p>
<p>Chaos theory rears its head though, and says that, no matter how good our measurements are, there will always be a limit to how far ahead (estimated to be about four weeks or so, I think) we can accurately predict the weather for any specific location, even with the best possible measurements and models.  There could be some massive improvement in technology that would increase that, but it would be impossible to ever get an accurate prediction far into the future.</p>
<p>I believe, and this is where it has been a little too long since I have learned about chaos theory, that even if we had the exact starting conditions, an absolutely perfect computer model, and an infinite amount of storage and processing, we could still not completely predict/replicate the outcome of something too complex, like the Big Bang/beginning of the universe.  Our infinitely good attempt would not accurately and consistently predict the Earth in its location and conditions (unless we tweaked the model, but that is cheating).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Throwing a marble in the air doesn't have topological mixing. You're not going to get wildly divergent results. It is not a chaotic system. This is a bad example.</p>
<p>I mean, x\^x is also very dependent on what you choose for x, but it increases monotonically. </p>
<p>A chaotic system needs both sensitivity on initial conditions AND topological mixing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm confused as to what you mean by the first part.</p>
<p>The second part is wrong unless you add &quot;increases monotonically for x &gt;1/e .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I actually meant for x&gt;1</p>
<p>And it's sensitive on x, because a small change in x leads to a large difference.</p>
<p>Going from x=100 to x=100.1 leads to something like a 700e199 change in the output.</p></div>		</li>
