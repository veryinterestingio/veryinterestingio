			<div class="markdown"><p>Acalculia would cause inhability to calculate, if its associated to understanding and writing it would be alexic or agraphic acalculia/discalculia or dislexic/disgraphic depending on the degree, I also suspect, although when I studied neurology I didn't see it, that there has to be disorthographic discalculia for when you write f√≥rmulas XD</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is arguably what a lot of statistics boils down to. Just in a really nuanced way. How else to reverse engineer something than to play spot the difference?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At first, by opening up people's heads and probing/cutting to see what happened (e.g., lobotomies more or less) or by looking at the brains (after death) of people who had some issue with an apparently neurological source. For instance, an area in the brain responsible for speech, Broca's area, was discovered by Paul Broca who noticed lesions on certain areas of brains in people with speech issues. </p>
<p>In current times, there are a number of different instruments we can use (e.g., fMRI, MEG, PET) to look at brain activity as it's happening. So, if you use these techniques and ask someone to speak, you can see an area of brain light up. If you then ask them to do math, you might see a different area light up.</p></div>		</li>
