<p>Some chess masters have reportedly burned 6,000 calories</p>

<p>That's not from their brains lol, that from the stress. Increased heart and breathing rates, muscles tightening and blood pressure rising. They're not burning calories by thinking, they're burning calories by freaking out</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The muscle and skeletal weakness was the precursor to rapid brain development. Humans have always been mentally superior we just lacked instinct and had to be taught many things each generation. Even Neanderthal man was far superior mentally than lower primates.  Humans evolved to suit their environments, the needs of a tribe living in the savannas of Africa were far different than those living in the Himalayas. To this day it is highly uncommon to see superior physical strength coupled with genius level mental acuity in the same individual.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Genius level is a meaningless phrase. Whales and primates are both strong and intelligent.</p>
<p>You're mixing up knowledge with intelligence. Modern human brains basically significantly increased in size when we discovered fire and thus cooking. Cooking increased our energy intake by so much that it enabled us to support bigger brains.</p>
<p>We'd already lost much of our strength by that point because we evolved into walkers and runners instead of climbers. Entirely separate development from intelligence.</p></div>		</li>
