			<div class="markdown"><p>Since there is so much going on in each barrel, how do major companies maintain a distinct characteristic flavor over years? Or do they? Does the Jack or Makers I'm drinking today vary much from last year/last decade or next year, etc.? Are there noticeable variations within the same year? Are there purists talking about Jim Beam spring 2008 vintage?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the consistency comes from blending barrels together. While there is technically some difference between individual batches, they are blended in such a large quantity and consistency that you will really never tell a difference in that “Jim Beam 2008 vintage” but there is some distinction overonfer periods of time. I’ve tasted a bottle of eagle rare from 1984 and it is a very different taste. You can still taste the same idea but it does taste different for sure. If I’m not wrong I believe the recipe may have changed a touch which would cause some of that but not very much. Now with things like single barrel and small batches there is a little more variation but the average drinker will rarely notice it unless you really compare two bottles and even then it’s tough. With single malt scotches and such there is no blending going on so again the variation is more pronounced, whereas blended scotches tend to have more consistency. So in general you would have to be pretty experienced and have a good palate to notice the difference but technically there is potentially some difference. </p></div>		</li>

<p>A single malt is simply a malt whiskey that is produced by a single distillery. They still blend various barrels from that distillery together to great a distinctive flavor profile. These barrels may be of various ages and come from different locations within the warehouse, but it is still single malt. If an age statement is made on the bottle, all of the above is true with the added requirement that the barrels used in the product be of at least the age stated on the bottle. To add to that, for it to be marketed as a single malt <em>scotch</em>, other requirements are added, namely that it be produced in Scotland. Single malts can and are produced in other countries, but they can’t be marketed as scotch. </p>
<p>For instance, a bottle of 12 year old Glenfiddich is made from many different barrels of whisky, which have been produced by the Glenfiddich distillery, and aged for at least twelve years. Because it is produced in Scotland and meets all the other requirements to be called scotch, it is marketed as a single malt scotch whisky. <em>it is not bottled from a single barrel</em>. A whisky produced from a single barrel may be referred to as “single barrel” or “single cask”. The blending of barrels allows a distinctive flavor profile to be created. So, a bottle of 12 year old Glenfiddich will almost always taste the same no matter the year it was purchased. There are single malts from India, Japan, Ireland, and other countries that use a production process that is almost identical to that employed in the production of single malt scotch. However, because they are not produced in Scotland they are marked simply as single malts or “Irish, Japanese, etc.” single malts. </p>
<p>EDIT: I’ll also add that, as it pertains to scotch, the term “blended” refers to scotch that is made by blending barrels from many different distilleries to create a product. Blended scotch may also contain grain whisky, in addition to malt whisky, instead of being exclusively malt whisky. Less commonly used, the terms “blended malt” and “blended grain” refer to blends that use exclusively malt or exclusively grain whiskeys, respectively. Johnnie Walker, for instance, lists 11 different distilleries on their site as being contributors to their various blends. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A single malt has whisky from a single distillery. It can be from many barrels and many years. A single be barrel burbon comes from a single barrel and single year. There will be more variation in taste from the latter than the former.</p>
<p>That said your are right that almost all of us could not taste the difference. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And to add to this, when you go to an expensive tasting bar you do find those old single malts that are considered 'best year' or whatever that bar calls it.  That's why you're paying $50-250 for 150 mL.</p></div>		</li>
