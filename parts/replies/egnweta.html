<p>Rindler horizons should produce Unruh radiation, and accelerating a mass to sufficient speeds will effectively torch your rocket ship</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unruh radiation depends only on acceleration, not speed. Indeed, it would violate the principle of relativity if it depended on speed, because measuring its intensity would give you an absolute frame of reference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Causally disconnected means that no part of one can affect the other in any way. If two regions of space are causally disconnected (e.g. the area inside and outside an event horizon) then nothing - energy, mass, information, charge, angular momentum etc. - can move between them. One region cannot be the <em>cause</em> of any effect in the other region.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The regions inside and outside a black hole event horizon are not causally disconnected. However, events outside the event horizon cannot be in the absolute future of any events within the event horizon.</p>
<p>An example of causally disconnected regions would be, say, our observable universe and some region of space that is well beyond a current distance of 65 Gly. These two regions can never and have never communicated with each other, i.e., no signal in <em>either</em> direction.</p>
<p>A black hole is different because someone outside the event horizon can certainly cause an event inside the event horizon, but not vice versa.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be causally disconnected it means that the particle at spot A cannot by any means affect or be affected by a particle in spot B.</p>
<p>Since information transfer is limited to C, accelerating masses effectively disconnect themselves from portions of the universe until they stop accelerating. This is similar to the interior of an event horizon, in which regions of space time are causally removed from the universe because no particle could ever reach speeds to carry themselves or information at a fast enough velocity to escape the gravity. Relativity tells us that there is really know difference between an accelerating frame and a frame inside a gravitational field, and these examples are parallels of that.</p></div>		</li>
