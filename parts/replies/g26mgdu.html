			<div class="markdown"><p>For the first link, did you even watch the video? He's not saying he's trying to shut down to post office to stop people voting. Everything in the video is perfectly reasonable. There's not a single quote you can lift from that.</p>
<p>For the second link, that's a link from 2019 that says USPS will be sold in 2020 (spoiler: it won't be).</p>
<p>On December 31st this year are you going to go back and apologize from spreading misinformation that the post office would be sold in 2020? I don't think so. You'll be on to the next conspiracy.</p></div>		</li>
