			<div class="markdown"><p>Migraine is a disorder with many symptoms, one of which is headaches. Headache is a symptom. When people use the word &quot;migraines&quot; colloquially they usually are referring to a &quot;migraine attack&quot; which is like a headache with additional symptoms like photosensitivity, aura, neck pain, etc.</p>
<p>Super simplified:
Headache = head pain;
Migraine attack = headache + other specified symptoms;
Migraine = disorder caused by frequent migraine attacks and other symptoms</p></div>		</li>
