			<div class="markdown"><p>I always love seeing different peoples explanations for why base 10 isnt the only logical choice.  </p>
<p>And to be clear I'm in no way being sarcastic, I genuinely like seeing the variety of reasons people think of for it.  </p>
<p>This specific one is great, basically on a base 12 theres a fair amount more mental math doable without fractions or decimals needed.</p>
<p>Edit: as pointed out below this is still base 10 (I misspoke).  I more meant in using numbers that aren't 1, 10 100, 1000, etc. As the main numbers on systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In base 12, you would write 144 (base 10) as 100. Similar to in binary, we write 4 as 100. No matter the base, 100 is the base squared and 1000 ISA the base cubed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is one of the least logical choices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no way. you could make arguments for binary hex and base 12 depending on the context.</p>
<p>but i challenge you to make a compelling argument for base 173 or base 1406</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a fairly strong statement, why is it one of the least logical?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm seconding that as the reason too. A lot of algebra and geometry was invented to deal with physical transactions. Buying and selling goods, taking stock, counting animals, creating and dividing land plots, paying wages etc. In all of those applications, having whole number factors was hugely important. Nobody wants a 50 x 66.6666666 foot property. A lot of current systems are carryovers from then. And in the case of circles, it's <em>still</em> useful that they're evenly divisible so many ways.</p></div>		</li>
