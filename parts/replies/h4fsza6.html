			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s height based. although gravity differs at different points of the earth’s surface, a couple hundred meters here and there isn’t going to cause enough of a shift in gravity to cause the water to flow to the “heavier” side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The height from the ocean floor to the mountain tops that stick above the water is very small compared to the size of the earth. </p>
<p>Like 1mm on the surface of a basketball, wouldn’t really unbalance everything. (i just made up the 1mm thing, but the ocean is really a thin layer on the planet. )</p></div>		</li>
