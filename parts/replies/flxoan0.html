Thanks for the info :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They need to absorb UVB.  </p>
<p>Sunscreen blocks UVB, but not a lot of UVA (which is more dangerous, in terms of skin damage).  UVB activates your melanocytes as well, which give you pigment (tan) and do a decent job of blocking UVA light.</p>
<p>Oblique angles, like higher latitudes or morning/evening during the winter months, also allow little UVB to reach the surface.  Clouds and windows also absorb the light.</p>
<p>So, you need a genetic predisposition to being efficient at creating Vitamin D, you need to live at the right latitude, at the right time of day, during the right time of year, and have a cloudless sky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here is an article about that:  <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/we-can-thank-poor-evolutionary-design-for-vitamin-d-deficiencies" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/we-can-thank-poor-evolutionary-design-for-vitamin-d-deficiencies" target="_blank">https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/we-can-thank-poor-evolutionary-design-for-vitamin-d-deficiencies</a></a> </p>
<p>Also different animals have different &quot;vitamins&quot;. Vitamins are essentially molecules that are plentiful enough either in our diet or, as in the case of vitamin D, through other methods that the ability to make it was not essential to our survival or fitness as a species. Thus we lost the ability to make some of these and never had the ability for others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ability to do this decreases with age, along with the ability to absorb enough from food. Most older people (50's and up) should be supplementing, beyond what a one-a-day vitamin provides. D3 is probably one of the cheapest pills you can buy, so it's not a hardship.</p>
<p>Doctors can do blood tests for vitamin levels to see what dose is needed. But this probably isn't a good time to be hanging around the waiting room just for this...</p></div>		</li>
