			<div class="markdown"><p>The strange thing is that there's a distance at which a cloud seems solid.  It might be as little as 100m, but closer than that it's just fog.  There's no edge to it.</p>
<p>The faster you're going, the more solid clouds seem, because you go from not-cloud to cloud quickly and the sudden transition makes it seem solid.  OTOH, if you wanted to slow down and reach out to touch the edge of the cloud, you couldn't, because it has no &quot;edge&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's similar to when you're driving. When you're looking at the side of the road close to the car, you can see many things passing you by, so you get a sense of how fast you're going. But if you look out into the distance, it feels like you're barely moving because you can't see things moving as easily for a point of reference. </p>
<p>There are very few circumstances where you will have both clouds and stationary things to pass -- most attainable would be driving though mountains where clouds form, <a href="https://youtu.be/jrHQjN-baDA" target="_blank">like this</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We were once flying internationally, and when I looked outside the window, we were flying just level with a very thin, wispy layer of clouds that gave a strong illusion that we were a boat skimming the water.</p>
<p>It was amazing.</p>
<p>I’ve always wanted to ask a pilot: do you reckon the pilot did that on purpose, do pilots see that type of cloud layer and go “hey, water skimming time! This is going to blow the passengers’ minds!”?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As cool as that would be, it’s definitely not intentional as our route and altitude are determined by air traffic control and dispatch. We can’t just choose to fly at a certain altitude because that could cause a loss of adequate separation between us and other aircraft. That being said, there are times when we’re inside the clouds at our cruising altitude, so we ask for a little bit higher to get above the tops as clear air is generally (but not always) less turbulent. So, there’s a slight possibility that was the case!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s so weird to think about all these planes zipping around each other all over in the sky, and it’s little guys in a tower ‘controlling’ them like puppeteers.
Not to say pilots aren’t totally awesome and have a hard job also, but it’s just so weird to me.</p></div>		</li>
