			<div class="markdown"><p>AFAIK, there are a couple of reasons we have inflammation. The main reason is to concentrate the good stuff in your blood which helps you heal. Stuff like extra nutrients to repair damaged tissue and white blood cells to fight off infections are essential to the healing process.</p>
<p>A secondary benefit of painful swelling is that it signals you to “lay off” the damaged part of your body so it has time to heal without further exacerbating the injury.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Should you still take anti-inflammatories when you can handle the pain?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes yes sometimes no. For example if you have some kind of pain that affects your posture, or the way you walk, or makes some muscles tense all the time - better to kill the pain than let other problems accumulate. But it depends on the situation and there’s no general rule. Ask a pro.</p>
<p>Also, small single doses of ibuprofen (eg. 400 or 800 mg) normally have no adverse effects (for a healthy person, not combined with other stuff, blah blah etc). So if the pain is something minor and temporary it’s just pointless to suffer for no reason. </p>
<p>Wouldn’t take them for hangovers though, like some people do. Since the stomach and liver are already dealing with the alcohol, the added stress is not a great combo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So all of the lay-man`s health guide say &quot;You should eat as many anti-Inflammatory foods as possible&quot;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If they are telling us to eat lots of anti-inflammatory stuff, Is the anti-inflammation that comes from foods different then those that come from medicine?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the context.</p>
<p>In general, inflammation is simply the body's response to some sort of cellular injury (e.g. necrosis or infection). This is usually a good thing, since if your body never responded to something like a minor skin infection it would eventually eat you alive (literally). Inflammation also cleans up all of the necrotic cells and starts repair pathways. It can be harmful to you if the response is excessive (e.g. septic shock), prolonged (e.g. persistent infection like TB), or inappropriate (think autoimmune disease).</p>
<p>The acute inflammatory response has five signs: redness/warmth, swelling, pain, and loss of function. Pain medication like NSAIDs are generally ok to take in this context because the inflammatory mediators it inhibits only really stops pain and fever, which makes you more comfortable without really messing with the body's immune response. There is some literature out there which advises against turning down the body's thermostat (bacteria and viruses are really picky about what temperatures they like to replicate in), but this is up for debate and really only relevant in the setting of critically ill patients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This would explain why when I had TB 16 years ago the doctors were pumping me full of antibiotics but refused point blank to give me any Pracetamol. They said “Paracetamol lowers fevers and we really want you to have a high fever right now”.</p>
<p>So instead for the pain/general feeling of crap gave me morphine. For a couple weeks. Was ultimately a precursor for 10 years of opioid addiction a few years down the line. Yay.</p></div>		</li>
