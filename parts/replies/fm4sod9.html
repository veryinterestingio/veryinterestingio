			<div class="markdown"><p>There's two types of tests. One where they shove a swab down your nose to the back of your throat to grab some virus on the swab. That sort of test only works when you're actively infected. The second type of test is an antibody test, where they take some of your blood and see if your immune system has learned to recognize the virus. The antibody test isn't so useful in detecting active infections, because you could be spreading the disease and your body hasn't learned to fight it yet, but it is good for testing to see if people have had the disease in the past and have gotten over it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure about the near future, but I believe serological tests were just approved by the FDA so once they're in mass production we'll be able to see who has antibodies and it thus immune or fighting the virus. Serological tests can't catch a virus in the early phases, but can catch <em>antibodies</em> against a virus as the body ramps up or has already finished off the virus. </p>
<p>This is <em>critical</em> for two things: proving someone is immune, so they can go to work without fear of infection or spreading the virus, and identifying people who might be able to donate those antibodies for serum therapies that can help people survive COVID-19. It's a promising but novel treatment avenue that they're investigating in Wuhan and New York. Here's hope it works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes we can, but current tests are not reliable. They have many false positives (you are not infected while the test says you are) and false negatives (you are infected but the test says you are not). You can order these tests online, but there is no guarantee that you can trust the result. </p>
<p>If you would use tests like these on large groups of people, like blood donors, then this is not such a big problem anymore. You can use it to see how the disease spreads, but you don't inform individual people. You can even use samples from the past few months to see how it started. The false positives and negatives cancel eachother out, and there are statistical methods to handle the errors. If you're not sure if the positives cancel out the negatives, results still tell you something about the development, how it spreads, increases, decreases etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It already kind of is cold and flu and covid season. Many common colds are caused by corona viruses. This one just happens to be new so it’s hitting everyone at once because we have no immunities. Once there is mass exposure and eventually a vaccine, this will just be one of them the same way the swine flu is just another one of our flues now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think you’d show antibodies if you’ve been infected, regardless of what symptoms you had or didn’t have.  </p>
<p>The good news is a COVID vaccine should be more effective than a flu vaccine, since it’s less prone to mutation.  Eventually, you’ll just get your COVID shot once a year or once every few years, just like a flu shot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honest question, do you have a medical background or some authority on the topic? What you're saying seems to contradict what I've been reading from professionals, and even some versed comments here on askscience. But, that doesn't mean it's wrong of course. </p>
<p>From what my layman understanding is, while SARS-CoV-2 is not double stranded (which helps prevent mutation) it does include an error checking mechanism. Which is rare for an RNA virus. This would drastically slow mutation. </p>
<p>This is distinct from the 60+ different viruses that make up the &quot;common cold&quot; family. Even if you got one of those per year until you were 60, the first one has now had 60 years to mutate. Cold viruses don't need to mutate fast in order for you to catch a lot of them. </p>
<p>This is especially different from influenza viruses. Again laymen understanding, their genome is sectioned off into portions that it can essentially randomly shuffle while still functioning. This causes it to mutate rapidly. Notably changing its markers so that antibodies do not react to it. This is not at all similar to coronaviruses. </p>
<p>If you know something I don't please educate me. Cheers!</p></div>		</li>
