			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC this is an important distinction. A headache isn't actually in your brain. There are no nerves to feel pain in your brain. A headache is tension or pain in your scalp neck and head in areas other than the brain itself. Migraines give dizziness and hallucinations etc because it's neurological, an issue inside the brain itself.
