			<div class="markdown"><p>LHC (at design capacity for run 2) has two beams, with each 2808 bunches, each 1.15x10\^11 protons, so each filling consist of \~6x10\^14 protons. LHC is filled anew each 10 hours, when running at full capacity.</p>
<p>A commercial 5 kg hydrogen bottle has roughly 10\^27 atoms in it, so even with the inefficiencies of ionisation and taking into account that the preaccelearators feed more than just LHC the bottle should outlast the life of LHC. I guess the current bottle will lose more hydrogen due to leakage than due to use.</p>
<p>However the old preaccelerator Linac 2 was just replaced by Linac 4. It doesn't seem unlikely that the bottle was also exchanged in the process, but you would have to ask one of the technicians.</p></div>		</li>
