			<div class="markdown"><p>Good analogy! And might I  add: the booster in general contain less antigen (or inactivated pathogen) than the first vaccinations administered. No need to hit the warriors too hard - just give them a little something to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right! And I meant to clarify that the reason it is ok to get a tetanus booster after a puncture wound is that assuming the wound is colonized by the bacteria that causes tetanus, it takes over a week at the least for the bacteria to multiply and for sufficient toxin to be present to cause disease. So you have a little time to make sure your little soldiers are present and correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is treatment for tetanus. Antibiotics and immune globulin. It's a really unpleasant disease though, could require extended hospitalization, and is potentially fatal. So it's a no brainer to give a jab that costs less than $50 to prevent the possible but unlikely outcome that a patient's muscles will start involuntarily spasming for days or weeks, occasionally so severely that they break their own bones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah we can treat tetanus. Tetanus antiglobulin is basically an injection of those antibodies your body would have made itself if vaccinated and still protected.</p>
<p>However: Since those a complex molecules that can't be easily synthesised but rather need to either be extracted from horse blood after injecting the toxin or be made from envineered bacteria or yeast it's very expensive.</p>
<p>The vaccine in the other hand barely costs anything.</p>
<p>So it's much simpler to just give the booster rather than waiting and seeing if an infection sets in to then start antibiotics and immunoglobulins.</p></div>		</li>
