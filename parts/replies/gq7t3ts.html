			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll also add that, from a listening experience perspective, as long as you're sampling above the Nyquist frequency and with adequate bit depth, both an analog and digital recording will have captured every tiny nuance of a recording there is to capture, and at &quot;ultimate&quot; quality. For music playback, the storing a waveform at CD quality (44.1 KHz / 16 bit) already exceeds the capability of human hearing. To a listener, how a digital recording and an analog recording differ is that digital recordings can be endlessly duplicated perfectly, and stored for centuries in inexpensive M-DISC formats with no quality loss, maintaining that ultimate quality. Analog recordings suffer from imperfections and degradation over time. A lot of the &quot;warmth&quot; that vinyl playback enthusiasts talk about is actually just the inherent imperfections in an analog storage and playback system. Flaws don't always have to be bad though! Distortion, saturation, uneven frequency response, nonlinear summing, and other &quot;destructive&quot; processes are the foundation of a lot of the awesome tones used by musicians. (Think booming bass or heavy metal guitars)</p>
<p>Edit: I originally didn't mention bit depth because we're in /r/eli5, but I have now amended my comment to be more pedantic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also how good the original recording was is a factor in quality. A lot of the first CD reissues of a vinyl record used a crappy copy of the original. Recording equipment is a lot better than it used to be in the ‘80s so it isn’t much of a factor now. </p>
<p>I would rather hear a good recording on analog than a crappy recording on digital. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember paying extra bucks to get a record by Carol Pope and Rough Trade (featuring the track &quot;High School Confidential&quot;, which is hilariously vampy) because it was &quot;direct-to-disc&quot;. </p>
<p>Instead of the record being made from hot vinyl pressed against a steel master disc, these were actually cut directly into the disc by a computer controlled needle. The result was supposed to be much better clarity, but my ears were probably already so damaged from loud music, I didn't notice. ^(I pretended to, though.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OTOH, high quality analog master copies of music and films have also allowed really high quality reproductions. I believe a lot of music from the 60s and 70s was recorded on open reel magnetic tapes, which have excellent quality if properly preserved. They lost quality going to vinyl, and if you digitized the vinyl you'd lose even more quality. But going directly off the original tapes with a high quality digital converter allows very good quality. I had a couple 'digitally remastered' SACDs back when those were a thing and the quality was fantastic, even for albums that were 30+ years old. </p>
<p>Movies are the same - a lot were recorded on actual film, and then downgraded to VHS or DVDs or whatever for distribution. But the original film negatives are really high quality and can be scanned to 4K quality or even better, despite being decades older than 4K technology existed. </p>
<p>But if something was not recorded on a super high quality analog medium, you can't get what's not there. Which is why you can get a beautiful 4K version of a movie from 1978, but you can't for a TV show from 2004.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that &quot;warmth&quot; with vinly is mostly the background noise.  There are probably FM lovers who miss the MPX noise and leave that filter off if given the chance, LOL. (I haven't seen an MPX filter on a tuner in decades and wonder if they're just built-in/on all the time, or left out and part of the noise we ignore.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Analog ‘warmth’ is generally a product of gently over saturating the recording medium by a few dB leading to a pleasant (subjectively of course) distortion that makes the sound feel a bit fuller.
The RHCP emulated this effect on the track Warm Tape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure some of the appreciation for the warmth of vinyl just comes from compression on digital media as well. An MP3, for example, gets you a smaller file size by literally throwing out something like 90% of the audio data. Some of that is the elimination of frequencies outside of human hearing range which shouldn't have an effect on what you hear, but some of it are all the variations in tone that our mind &quot;ignores&quot; in lieu of the dominant tone. </p>
<p>So when I play a note on an instrument and convert the waveform to the frequency domain (called a Fourier transform), I would get a plot that has a large spike at the dominant frequency, and a similarly shaped smaller spike at maybe half a dozen other modes (called overtones). While each one of these spikes are pretty narrow, they can be anywhere from 10s to 100s of Hz wide. MP3 compression takes each one of those spikes and eliminates all, but about 10% of the loudest frequencies. So if my dominant mode is 1000 Hz, the instrument may produce tones from 900-1100 Hz, but the MP3 is going to eliminate everything except 990-1010 Hz. It will do the same thing for all the overtones as well. </p>
<p>In theory, that should sound exactly the same to my ear as the uncompressed audio because of the way your mind perceives sound. While I've never done a side-by-side comparison myself, a lot of people talk about how MP3 compression makes the music sound flat compared to analog audio or even lossless digital audio.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But endlessly copying it is incredibly easy by comparison. The combination of being able to make copies without degrading the quality, and being able to tell whether you have a correct copy of the data make it possible to store for much longer than 25 years and still have the exact same data you started with.</p>
<p>For any important data (e.g. master recordings, you’d hope), standard backup practices will mean you have multiple copies of the data at any given time and can tell immediately if you read incorrect data, so the lifespan of one particular instance of one particular storage medium becomes irrelevant.</p></div>		</li>
