<p>both of them are surely not in their best age to continue to make money out of being a movie star anymore. with depp having that unique boyish look, but being old, and heard also becoming too old to get roles (<a href="https://time.com/4062700/hollywood-gender-gap/" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depp is still the face of the best selling fragrance in the world and still gets roles (Fantastic Beasts) even if his glory days are behind him. He's in an upcoming movie with Robert Pattinson. Anyone with half a financial brain would be able to leverage that into being rich as hell.</p>
<p>He's reportedly had trouble with his assets but that's because he spends a lot on stupid stuff.</p></div>		</li>
