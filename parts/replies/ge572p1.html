			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had tinnitus as long as I can remember. When  I was really young I used to think it was aliens trying to communicate with me because the ringing sorta sounded like the feed back you would get through long distance phone calls.  </p>
<p>Sadly they never did get the connection to go through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an addition, high frequencies go first because they are higher frequency; which is to say, more waves per second. Lower frequencies have less waves, and so you'd have to listen to low noises for longer to have a similar loss of hearing.</p>
<p>The noises go to the specific hairs that hear specific sounds because your ear canal is shaped in a way to move the waves. The less &quot;heavy&quot; waves are moved more, and so the higher frequencies hit a different place than the &quot;heavier&quot; (lower) waves, which aren't moved as much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to this, high frequencies are coded at the early part of the inner ear, so, they're being moved around by low frequency sounds as well (via the traveling wave), so they suffer the brunt of all sound, while the low frequency areas only move around when there are only low frequency sounds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't contribute much but I'm in a unique situation where I can actually tell/hear my left ear losing its ability to hear high frequency sounds. </p>
<p>My right eye is slowly going blind so my right ear is compensating for it and has retained its ability to hear high frequency sounds like dog whistles and that weird sound app teenagers keep using as their ringtone. But my left eye is just fine so my left ear is &quot;aging&quot; as it should. It's a really weird experience.</p></div>		</li>
