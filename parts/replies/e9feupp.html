			<div class="markdown"><p>The catastrophe of it was that it was predicted that radiating bodies should radiate an infinite amount of energy, since they would emit radiation at all frequencies. Something red-hot, for example, has a peak at the wavelength of red light, but classical physics predicts that it will emit some infrared radition, some microwave radiation, some ultraviolet radiation, and so on - all at lower intensities, but when you add them all up you end up with an infinite total amount of radiation being emitted.</p>
<p>That's problematic, to say the least, but the discovery of the photon meant that light could only be emitted in packets, which sort of &quot;pixellates&quot; the emission spectrum and makes the total energy non-infinite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blackbodies, such as iron, emit light as they are heated.  It starts in the red spectra (&quot;red hot&quot; iron), and eventually covers all spectra of visible light (&quot;white hot&quot; iron).</p>
<p>According to initial calculations, if light could be emitted at any energy level, iron should be &quot;white hot&quot; even at room temperature.  Obviously this isn't the case.  Planck theorized that light must be emitted in discrete units (or quanta), which laid the foundation for quantum mechanics </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other posters have done a good job explaining the UV catastrophe but to clarify, it is considered a &quot;catastrophe&quot; because it demonstrates a catastrophic error with the previous scientific theory that had to be corrected, not because it predicted a natural disaster or something like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before that there was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpuscular_theory_of_light" target="_blank">corpuscular theory</a>. Isaac Newton claimed that since light travels in straight lines it has to be made up of particles, not waves. The wave theory proponents claimed that light was made up of white waves, and the colored spectrum you get from prisms where due to corruption of the light by the glass. Newton disproved that by using a second prism and recombined the spectrum back to white light, and considered that as a proof that the particle theory was correct.</p>
<p>In <em>Opticks</em> he claimed that diffraction was due to waves that the light particles left in the aether, so even if he was wrong he was still close.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(The &quot;Ultraviolet Catastrophe&quot; actually had nothing to do with Planck's postulation of the quanta. This is a myth — one propagated by physics textbooks, but a myth nonetheless. Nobody, including Planck, thought the equipartition theorem was generally valid. The reality of what motivated Planck was less dramatic; the UV is only invoked because it fits into an idea of how science &quot;ought&quot; to work — scientist sees problem and fixes it — but it is an after-the-fact justification. See Helge Kragh, <em>Quantum Generations</em>, chapter 5.)</p></div>		</li>
