			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a difficult question to answer, as of course we cannot ask babies what they are dreaming of. We know that babies spend a huge amount of time in REM sleep, the stage most associated with dreaming, even when in the womb. But what can they be dreaming of?! It is likely that dreaming has a different function before birth or in infancy, and some speculate it has to do with the development of the nervous system and consciousness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whilst we are talking about babies. What's the deal with them keeping their parents so sleep deprived?</p>
<p>Surely from an evolutionary stance human biology would have developed around the fact that a more rested parent would make a healthier environment for the baby?</p>
<p>If sufficient rest is so important surely this is a flaw in human design.</p>
<p>(Hope I explained that right)</p></div>		</li>
