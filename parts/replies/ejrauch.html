			<div class="markdown"><p>I work for a company that makes a program with an internal password reset tool. We use it to help customers out of break/fix issues that include broken authentication between internal machine users and stuff.</p>
<p>It's a random password generator which means it will create passwords that won't work that include single quotes, double quotes and slashes. It's been this way for some seven years across many new and vastly improved iterations of the program. It would probably take minutes to fix. But it's never been touched, and every time I have to use it in front of a customer in a remote session I have to explain why I have to generate the password over and over until it's usable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tell them I’ll fix it for free if they agree to be a reference for my company haha. I legit mean that as I have a start up with one dev and one client and could use the reference.</p>
<p>I feel your pain though. Before I got into development I spent 15 years doing sales and client services.  Sucks having to be the face of such a glaring deficiency and having to find a way to both excuse and it reassure the client it doesn’t affect the companies ability to properly handle the account.</p>
