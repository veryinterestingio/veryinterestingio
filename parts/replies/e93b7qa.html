For example, there is a built-in tension between how journalism works and how science works. Quite a bit (though not all) of journalism is about, well, the news. But in science, something that is truly new or novel can be pretty rare -- rather, it's typically a slower, more incremental process. Because of this, science news stories are often like &quot;Oh Hey Look At This New Science Thing!&quot; while in reality, it's just one small new study that hasn't changed our collective knowledge all that much.</p>
<p>There is also always a tension between writing a headline that people will read, but that is also accurate and informative. A cynic might call a catchy headline clickbait. But there is a very real need to have a headline that will grab people's attention -- otherwise, no one will click on that story and then what's the point? If our job is to inform people, we also have to draw them in. Still, those catchy headlines shouldn't be sensational if the story doesn't warrant it.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to deal with these problems. First: Maybe journalists shouldn't be writing news stories about single studies. Second: If they must write on single new studies, they should put those in the broader scientific context by showing how the study fits in and what we know/don't know. Third: The journalist, editor, fact-checker, and anyone else involved in the story should all get a chance to read a headline before publication to make sure they all agree that it's accurate.</p></div>		</li>
