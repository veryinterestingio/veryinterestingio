			<div class="markdown"><p>It came because Thomas Jefferson spent a ton of time in France and loved pommes frites. </p>
<p>He served them at a White House dinner when he was President and called them &quot;potatoes served in the French manner&quot;. Which was eventually called French fried potatoes and shortened to French fries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No that's not where it comes from.</p>
<p>It comes from Thomas Jefferson. </p>
<p>In 1802 he had &quot;potatoes served in the French manner&quot; at a White House dinner, similar to the pommes frites he enjoyed in France where he spent a ton of time. </p>
<p>That's it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where I'm from pickle always meant pickled onion, not cucumber.</p>
<p>Now it's probably ambiguous because of the increased usage of pickled cucumbers as a topping on burgers.</p>
<p>The answer is probably that the one that you use most in your area or culture is referred to as pickle and the rest are referred to as pickled thing.</p></div>		</li>
