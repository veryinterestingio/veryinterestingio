			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm wondering something, though, and I'm hoping someone reading this can answer: does a proton-antiproton (or neutron-antineutron) pair absolutely never annihilate completely to produce two 938MeV (940MeV) Î³ photons? I thought sometimes they did. But as far as I can tell looking round, here and elsewhere, it's looking more like they actually never do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who did nuclear physics research throughout university: this is very much the correct answer.   The energy spectrum makes antimatter annihilation very distinctive, it would be immediately obvious it is not a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>The 511 keV gamma rays from proton-positron annihilation show up on gamma ray spectra with an extremely distinctive and pretty crisp peak.  We routinely used a Na22 Beta+ source to provide one reference line to confirm our calibration.  Although I haven't checked absorption numbers, I'd imagine that it be visible well above background radiation for quite a long distance away -- you'd probably see it in detectors at universities, research labs, etc.  That's a lot of energy to emit in one narrow band.</p>
<p>You get some beta+ emitters and pair production with a nuclear explosion but it's a much smaller amount than a pure antimatter explosion would generate.  And as you say, the fission byproducts are distinctive in their own way -- and for fusion-boosted reactions the neutrons would be detectable as well.</p></div>		</li>
