			<div class="markdown"><p>They're made with fibers that are still hot enough to be a little sticky (or are made sticky using heat or chemicals). So they bond together into a mat — the fibers adhere at the points they touch each other.</p>
<p>(There's also felt, which is non-woven, and makes use of the fact that the fibers are snarled together enough to be cohesive but not in any organized way like spinning+weaving. I don't know if this applies to filter masks at all, but felt is a non-woven &quot;fabric&quot; so I thought I'd mention it too.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are there common things in a home that we the public at large could use as filters inside our home-made cloth masks for trips to the grocery store?  I'm thinking coffee filters, HVAC fiters, etc.  </p>
<p>Thoughts on that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/homemade-mask-using-hydro-knit-shop-towel-filters-better-2020-4" target="_blank">company in LA</a> that has been testing various materials so people can make their own masks. So far they’ve found using 2 shop towels in cloth (&amp; well sealed) to be 93% effective vs. 20-60% when using just cloth. BUT not just any shop towels, the brands that worked best were by ToolBox &amp; ZEP. They’re going to be releasing their design pattern for free some time next week hopefully.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I bought a 2800 MPR Filtrete to cut up and put inside cloth masks - it's specifically rated to filter out virus in the home environment.  Not nearly as good as an N95 I'm sure but BTN. (Cut it to 8&quot; x 5&quot;, folded corners down and baste stitched 'em so the thing wouldn't fold back up in the mask.)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They claim a 97% rate on those, so (assuming it's to be believed, which it probably is), it's a better rating the then 95's.  Of course, that does require the mask to have a good seal; if you're breathing around it all bets are off.</p></div>		</li>
