			<div class="markdown"><p>So I only have use of one hand, and they are right, sticky keys are useful for people with disabilities. I personally have a big hand and partial use of one hand so don't need them like this. I can do the the finger move one handed.</p>
<p>Fun fact, there is an entire touch typing system for one hand. I can no look touch type in the 60 to 80 rpm range depending on the keyboard and amount of formatting (coding is a bit slower but using predictive code hints really helps :) )</p>
<p>Where sticky keys really comes in is people that have trouble with dexterity or can only use a couple fingers. There are also chorded keyboards where you use combinations of 5 or 6 keys to make the full alphabet. Keyboards with macro keys also can help.</p>
<p>Another fantastic tool are foot pedals! Just a programmable macro key for two with your foot. Connects by us so you can stack a few up. These are the shit for gaming. Use then for reload, sprint, push to talk for chat, or anything you want. I cannot tell you how awesome these things are no matter how many hands you have.</p>
<p>All these alternatives came later than sticky keys. Sticky is the original adaptability tool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this sounds mildly insulting to people with disabilities but as a lazy person who often doesn't want to take his one hand off a mouse I kind am interested in a system where I can type with one hand. We use computers very differently than we used typewriters back in the day but we haven't really changed the way we type</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It won't always work. Ctrl+shift+esc is just a feature of the Windows UI system, which might not work if a program hangs, while Ctrl+Alt+Delete interrupts the CPU and only the OS can see it and it must finish dealing with it before it can return to other programs.</p>
<p>This is why sometimes you must press CAD to log in. If there's an app that just looks like the password prompt, pressing CAD will interrupt it and bring you to the OS security menu, alerting you that something is wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>oh my god... ive been using computers for as long as i can remember and only now is sticky keys making sense..</p>
<p>I mean as a child i viewed it as a design flaw, a lot of games back then used shift</p>
<p>as a teen, it was a prank, setting up sticky keys and leaving it..</p>
<p>omg, i used to turn off my computer to get rid of sticky keys, it was so annoying</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually has a silly design flaw in it which I made use of once. A while ago I was given someone's laptop (Windows 7 IIRC) to look at to be able to reset the password because for some reason the one that had been set didn't work, one of the methods I found online was to use the built in tools for repairing windows which gave you a command prompt window. Now this doesn't let you reset the password because it doesn't have any &quot;User&quot; accounts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>!But what you did was you used the first Command Prompt window in the recovery/repair partition to copy the sticky keys exe to the root of C or somewhere you remember, then overwrite it in the original location with cmd.exe for command prompt making sure to rename it the same as the original sticky keys exe, then reboot to normal windows, get to the logon screen, hit Shift 5 times and hey presto you now have an Administrator Command Prompt window to let you reset the password.!&lt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course there are plenty of other methods also available on the internet, including those that boot from USB Drives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, That's not a design flaw. If you managed to use recovery tools, then you have physical access to the machine, Engineer pretty much threw their hands up at that point.</p></div>		</li>
