			<div class="markdown"><p>There is an animal with blue blood, the horseshoe crab (who is not a crab nor a horseshoe), and its blood is blue because the element that is present in his oxygen carrying molecule is copper, which reflects the cyan colour when oxidized.<br />
That in contrast with our blood, in which iron is the element, and when oxidized looks red (like rust).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't let it get to you. Lower level educators definitely don't need to be smart to get their job, and young kids are extremely impressionable. I mean, I'm pretty sure they still teach kids that there are only 5 human senses, which is demonstratively false. But there it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, you had blood drawn from your vein, yes? It was red? I kinda get assuming it just gets oxygenized really quickly in contact with air, but wouldn't it be super weird you never saw even a speck of blue blood when cutting yourself or on TV depicting a crime scene or surgery etc? </p>
<p>Like, I'm not trying to be all &quot;you're a dummy&quot;, you figured it out, I'm just wondering if it was ever sus to you and you found alternative explanations and so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like you said, I figured it became oxygenated too quickly and we werent able to see it before it turned. It just blows my mind because I'm not a dumb person. I wonder what else I don't know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One time I had a small sharp cut and I could have sworn i saw blue before the blood reached the surface. I know now that I was either seeing the vein or it was my imagination, but at the time I took it as evidence for the blue blood myth, which I still thought was true.</p></div>		</li>
