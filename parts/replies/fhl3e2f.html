<p>Proof: Put slight pressure on the top of your eye with your finger. EASY NOW. Don't press hard, just slightly. You will see visual artifacts in the <em>bottom</em> of your field of vision. And vice versa â€” if you press the bottom of your eye just above your cheekbone, you will see visual artifacts in the <em>top</em> of your field of vision.</p></div>		</li>
