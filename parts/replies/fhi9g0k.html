			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a future profession called Professional Heart Donor. You have a specific DNA trait that allows your heart to never give anyone a rejection. You donate your heart and go back home with an artificial heart that keeps running while an imature cloned heart develops inside your chest cavity (it works better than growing it in a vat). To make things easier for the doctors, your chest is never fully closed, so you have a plug through which it's possible to watch the heart's development. </p>
<p>You're rewarded with an UBI of 1000$ per week.</p></div>		</li>

Artificial hearts are sometimes &quot;destination&quot; therapy if the patient is unsuitable for transplant, but they are generally used as a &quot;bridge&quot; to transplant given that the supply of transplantable hearts does not meet the demand.</p></div>		</li>
