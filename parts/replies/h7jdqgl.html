			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to more volume of smoke, bongs are much more efficient. I read it a while ago, and I don't remember the figures for the first two methods, but joints/blunts are the least efficient (I want to say on average less than 30% of the product is properly combusted and inhaled), then pipes and bongs are pretty close to eachother, with bongs being rated higher (up to 70% efficient), and vaporizers were at the top, being typically over 95% efficient due to lack of combustion.</p>
<p>This was long enough ago that it was before concentrates like hash oil and waxes became more popular, and vaporizer in this context refers to something like a Volcano because it was also prior to the popularity of portable vapes.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Removal of some tar and other particulate matter from the smoke, making it feel less harsh.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you see &quot;particulate,&quot; think &quot;large particle;&quot; as in &quot;large particles of burned paper, tar, and other aerosolized matter from the burning bud.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you tried to mention this in your edit, but maybe didn't exactly hit on it explicitly - but volume is definitely an issue that's multifaceted. </p>
<p>Colder water will condense the smoke, cooling it and making it more smoke per inhale than other smoking methods. So volume yes. But it also has something to do with the way our lungs / bodies take in the THC etc. </p>
<p>I am not a scientist, so I'm not going to go into the whole CB1 receptor and bioavailability etc. But that's actually the truth. The more dense, or concentrated the thc is in the smoke, the easier our body accepts almost all of it without wasting any or exhaling it, etc. </p>
<p>It's the same science behind why if you were to take a dab with the same amount of THC and a bong rip of the same amount of THC, you will get way higher. Dabs, on average will triple your bodies ability to consume the THC</p></div>		</li>
