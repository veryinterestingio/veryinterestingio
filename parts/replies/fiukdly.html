			<div class="markdown"><p>Diverticulitis (as well as many other inflammatory conditions in the gut) can cause inflammation of the big sack that surrounds the gut (called the peritoneum) especially where the sack is nearest the inflamed part of bowel. Peritoneum has lots of pain receptors, hence the severe pain associated with diverticulitis, appendicitis etc. </p>
<p>That's not an entirely full explanation of the pain associated with inflammatory gut issues but it's certainly a major part of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m an intestinal surgeon (general surgeon)</p>
<p>You are correct!  (For all I know you may be a doctor also)</p>
<p>Just to add something, peritonitis is sharp pain because the abdominal wall is somatic pain receptors, which can pinpoint location of pain and produce sharp pain</p>
<p>Intestinal pain uses visceral pain fibers, which are slow acting, vague and non specific.  You can just say, my stomach hurts but can’t say it’s this part of intestine right here</p>
<p>I teach this to the med students by using appendicitis.
It starts off as peri-umbilical pain because it’s inflamed intestines at first that just give an overall sense of abdominal discomfort.</p>
<p>Once the abdominal wall gets its inflamed (peritonitis) because the appendix is up against it, then the patients feel sharp pain right where the appendix is, the right lower quadrant.</p>
<p>More than anybody asked for just thought I’d throw out some info</p></div>		</li>

<p>Diverticulitis can fuck right off. I ended up in hospital as I passed out due to a spasm on the way back from the bathroom and took a header into a door frame.</p>
<p>Three day on IV's before they let me out again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Omg that’s horrible as if the abdomen pain wasn’t enough!! I spent 6 hours in the waiting room at the hospital just crying, 12 hours total, they didn’t think it likely that it would be diverticulitis because I was so young so they tested for everything but that. Come to find out my mother has diverticulosis and never told me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of morbid, but given your comment: if the colon or intestine were to stretch (due to gas) to the point of bursting/tearing, would the pain suddenly go away?</p>
<p>Ie: the intestine tears, releases the gas, and &quot;feels better&quot; since it's no longer being stretched (albeit with a rupture)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a bit complicated. The colon, and all internal organs, have different pain receptors than the skin. This causes pain from the internal organs to be a lot less specific, and pain in any part of the GI system tends to be felt simply as <em>abdominal</em> pain, and unless you know what's causing it for some other reason, your body can't really tell colon pain from small intestine pain.</p>
<p>This means that if the colon were to burst, even though the pain coming from the colon might cease^^^1 , the second faeces leaks into your abdomen, it will irritate the ever living shit out of your abdominal lining (called the <em>peritoneum</em>). This pain will be a lot worse and a lot more dangerous, and you most likely won't be able to tell any difference in the pain except that it has increased.</p>
<p>Besides, once the colon bursts, some bleeding and subsequent lack of oxygen is almost guaranteed to occur, which will be a cause for pain in itself.</p>
<p>^^^1 I don't know for a fact that this is what happens</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! When a patient has intense abdominal pain that is suddenly relieved, we will immediately think of a perforation in the gut (which doesn't have to be big). This can be confirmed by doing a chest XRay. On it, we would see air at the bottom of the Xray, just beneath the diaphragm (the muscle wall that separates the chest from the abdome). If a perforation has occured, the relief from pain will be short-lived as leakeage from the bowel will cause a widespread infection/inflammation in the abdomen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That happened to me when I had appendicitis but they kept me &quot;under observation&quot;, most likely because it was New Year's Eve. Come New Year, all pain went away and I got hungry... so they rushed me to the OR with a burst appendix and gangrenated peritonitis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What would &quot;short-lived&quot; relief mean in this case? In my mind, 10-15 minutes seems reasonable, but I'm pulling that number from thin air. Any shorter and it doesn't seem like the inflammation would have time to &quot;work,&quot; but any longer and it seems like the infection could get quite serious before you realized it (which may be the case).</p></div>		</li>
