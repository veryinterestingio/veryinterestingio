			<div class="markdown"><p>Normally, cells have two copies of DNA, which are bound together in one set of chromosome pairs. The first stage of meiosis, Prophase I, copies all the DNA in the cell, such that you have two full sets of chromosome pairs; four copies total. Now, normally, that big cell splits in half, before going on to split again, giving you four gametes with one copy each. But if you stop that first split, the big cell will only split in half once, giving you two gametes with a full pair each (two copies). When these gametes undergo sexual reproduction, you get a daughter plant with four copies of DNA.</p>
<p>With animals, things get fucky right about then, and the offspring almost certainly dies. But plants are quite a bit more rugged, and don't particularly care how many copies of DNA they have. Cultivated strawberries, in particular, are almost always polyploid, ranging from hexaploid to decaploid. The more chromosomes they have, the bigger their fruit get.</p>
