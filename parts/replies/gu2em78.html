			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good question!</p>
<p>Essentially yes. When you're sad / depressed your body produces 'stress hormones' (obviously that is simplyfied, if you're interested into the exact biochemical goings on here you can find that pretty easily). Stress hormones are a signal to your body that something is wrong and action is required, thus putting you in pseude 'fight or flight' mode. And when you're sad your brain is processing something it percieves as very wrong with the world.</p>
<p>Now you may rightly say &quot;I wasn't jumpy or anxious when I was sad&quot; and that may be absolutely right. But to our body it actually makes very little difference where the stress comes from. To our body it's simply a 'be ready, you can't relax! Action is required' signal.</p>
<p>Thus you can have the feeling of a tight chest from being simply starteled where you can feel pretty close to the classical 'fight or flight' scenario, from panicing about work or tests or also from being sad enough where your brain signals your body something is REALLY REALLY wrong! To your body the source of the released stress hormones makes surprisingly little difference in terms of 'automatic' reaction. </p>
<p>Hope that helped. Some people see this mind-body connection as something more esotheric and more intangible but that's essentially the logic ðŸ˜Š</p>
<p>P.S. It's btw also why sometimes when you're sad letting it out crying, or raging and punching something (hopefully a punching bag not a person ðŸ˜‰) helps. In a way you're acting on that 'action' impulse instead of repressing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more a trick than a cure. Focusing on breathing slowly does 2 things really:</p>
<p>1) As I wrote it's kind of telling your lungs to stop overreacting and forces your body out of 'fight or flight' for the moment</p>
<p>2) When you focus on your breathing you are pretty focused on this simple task. Many panic attacks are not from one single source or thought but rather impulses or thoughts piling up (i.e. &quot;If i fail this then everybody will laugh and me and think I'm stupid and then they won't want to be around me anymore and I'll be alone and I'll never find any friends...&quot; ). When you focus on the act of breathing slowly you often also untangle these bunched up thoughts a bit making them seem more managable.</p>
<p>So it's great if the source of your panic is already gone and you are simply still panicing or if you kind of spiraled yourself into a panic. Less so if the source  of stress is still being applied.
And obviously if the action for you is mentally linked with a stress inducing memory or situation it's likely that another 'trick action' that achieves similar results is better.</p>
<p>I personally like closing my eyes and clapping my hands together once. It can be anything that takes you out of the spiral and does something with the 'action impulse' the fight or flight reaction creates ðŸ˜Š</p></div>		</li>
