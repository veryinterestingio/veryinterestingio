			<div class="markdown"><p>The size comparison isn't accurate historically though. Look at the development of the automatic transmission back in the early 1950's...where your standard transmission had 3 forward gears the automatics of the time only had two forward gears. This was due to the revers gear not being able to utilize a simple idler off of 1st gear (which saves physical length) and having to have an additional planetary set. Looking at production vehicles through about 2006 when 6 speed automatics began to appear, this was typically always true. When 4 speed automatics were common...5 speed manuals were common. When 5 speed automatics came about, 6 speed manuals became common. What has ceased traditional manual transmission development is the ever increasing complication of shift patterns. Sure, you could do what semi-tractors have done for the last 40 years and run some form of multi-stage range select (a.k.a a splitter) actuated by a switch in conjunction with the transmission but it all adds additional complexity to the driving process which is one of the reasons the manual transmission has widely been phased out on new production vehicles, especially in North America.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dog clutch and synchro size of a manual =/= bands and clutch packs of an automatic. Your comparisons are apples/oranges. </p>
<p>My comparison of an automatic to an automatic holds true, and holds true when comparing an automatic to a manual when solely comparing the gearsets. </p>
<p>Every automatic that uses standard gearsets is notably larger than an equivalent automatic that uses planetaries</p></div>		</li>
