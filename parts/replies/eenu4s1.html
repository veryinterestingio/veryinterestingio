			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that why in Minecraft it's the hardest block but there are no Obsidian tools? Like how gold tools (exist, but) have terrible durability because gold is very malleable.</p>
<p>Edit: hardest block after bedrock.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Same as Valyrian Steel, which likely was created by some magical means, or perhaps literally forged by dragonfire. </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;He uses glass knives. Chips them out of plate glass. It's the sharpest blade in the universe, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Didn't know that either.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah. The edge is only a single molecule wide. Doctors use them for eye surgery-they can cut your cornea and not leave a scar. There's Indians who make a living doing that, you know. Chipping out eye scalpels.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you learn something new every day. That kind of a knife would be sharp enough to go through bulletproof fabric, I guess,&quot; Hiro says.</p>
<p>Chuck Wrightson shrugs. &quot;I lost track of the number of people Raven snuffed who were wearing bulletproof fabric.&quot;</p>
<p>Hiro says, &quot;I thought he must be carrying some kind of high-tech laser knife or something.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Think again. Glass knife.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dulling happens a number of ways. The typical way is that those teeth get worn away as well as the metal behind it, so you get a flat spot instead of a triangle. Another common thing that happens is that the edge will roll over.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pressure applied from the edge is far greater on a sharp knife than a dull one. Smaller edge, more force/area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like a pencil. If you freshly sharpened your pencil it can stick you. The point wears down while writing causing it to become rounded (i.e. dull). It won't stick you at that point. The same is true of a knife. A knife is just that same point drawn out into a line. It can become rounded.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A needle can pierce through cloth because pressure is defined as force per square meter. With the same amount of force applied (10 Newtons for example), a large object will have smaller pressure </p>
<p>10 N/1 sqm = 1 N/sqm</p>
<p>A force on a small object will generate a large pressure </p>
<p>10 N/0.01 sqm = 1000 N/sqm</p>
<p>So if the edge of the blade is sharp (smaller surface area), the pressure it creates when you press down is larger than it the edge of the blade was dull (larger surface area).</p></div>		</li>
