<p>The retroreflector is a different story, but that is too indirect for people that like simple stories and I'm sure they can explain how that is fake too.  But of course they are wrong, because they can't know it is the Illuminati in the Greys spaceship controlled by the NWO.... Or so the Voices in my head tell me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This!</p>
<p>Whatever proof you present, they will argue that its fake, a conspiracy or something. Just threat them as the idiots they are and ignore them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Flat earthers will take a slightly strange optical phenomenon involving zooming in sunsets as absolute positive proof that the earth is flat, but the fact that everything in the sky rotates around a point at an angle matching your latitude (exactly as it would if we were on the surface of a rotating sphere) as just something a bit odd that they have to think about until they can come up with an explanation for how it happens on a flat earth.</p>
<p>The flat earth society bought a very expensive laser gyroscope to measure the earth's rotation, to prove it was flat and rotating about the &quot;up&quot; axis, and it instead proved (again) that the earth rotates about an axis going from pole to pole.   &quot;Wow, that's kind of a problem,&quot; Knodel says. &quot;<strong>We obviously were not willing to accept that</strong>, and so we started looking for ways to disprove it was actually registering the motion of the Earth.&quot; </p>
<p>Convinced flat earthers are entirely immune to facts because their reasoning goes</p>
<ol>
<li>The earth is flat</li>
<li>All evidence implying the earth is flat is reliable</li>
<li>All evidence implying the earth is not flat is unreliable</li>
</ol></div>		</li>

<p>Not saying that's the case, but why is that not a reasonable argument?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So this is sort of a complex question. So, at its surface, we know that governments have covered things up in the past. So from that stand point, it seems reasonable that they <em>could</em> have staged the moon landings. The real question, however, would be why would they stage them? You ask a denier, the answer would be something like we had to beat the Russians, so we faked it to win the space race. Again, seems pretty reasonable. But the problem with this explanation is that the Russians had the capability of tracking our spacecraft and knowing exactly where they are headed and where they are. In other words, they knew we went to the moon. If we had faked it, they would have called us out, and kept trying to get someone on the moon. Instead, they congratulated us for landing a person on the moon and cancelled their moon program.</p>
<p>TL;DR - Governments have covered things up in the past but usually need a reason. The problem is, our reason would be to win the space race, yet Russia acknowledged the US landing, and cancelled their moon landing program, things they wouldnâ€™t have done if they had been faked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because faking the original moon mission would have required the cooperation of thousands of people from multiple nationalities, most of whom had massive incentive to disprove the moon landings.</p>
<p>It is borderline impossible for the moon landings to have been faked and also not revealed as a fake by the thousands of people in a position to do so with empirical evidence.</p>
<p>In the decades since, there have arguably been millions of people who would have been, or are, in a position to disprove the moon landings with empirical evidence.</p>
<p>To date: no one in a position to do so has been able to provide any empirical evidence that the moon landings were faked or any evidence that it was even possible, using technology of the time, to fake the moon landings so perfectly.</p>
<p>The simplest explanation is that man really did land on the moon.</p></div>		</li>
