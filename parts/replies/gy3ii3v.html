<p>If your eyeball is the basketball, at which point is it ever deflated? </p>
<p>If the air touches your eyeball in the procedure, what's the purpose of the finger in the analogy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My optometrist took a great deal of pleasure in doing this to me. He was a joker (and a really nice guy), and I had to have a pressure test. He explained what was going to happen, then he counted down. &quot;Five.. Four.. Three.. Tw. PUFF!&quot; and I jumped, not expecting it. He then had to do the other eye, and psyched me out again. &quot;Five.. Four.. Three... Twoooo... Twooo.. TWOOOOO... ONE.. ZERO.. MINUS ONE.. PUFF!&quot;</p>
<p>Then he said &quot;I'll need to do the other eye again. I got a good reading last time, but I just have so much fun doing it, I want to do it again!&quot;. I knew he didn't get a good reading, and just wanted to make me laugh. I said &quot;You're an arsehole, you know that?&quot; and he grinned and said &quot;yeah I know&quot;.</p>
<p>He left to take another job closer to home I think, but he made visits fun.</p></div>		</li>
