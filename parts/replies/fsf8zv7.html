			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to point out that while it's a great example of relative velocity, &quot;relativity&quot; has come to mean something very different in the context of physics and shouldn't be used to describe relative velocity. That just leads to confusion when people start talking about relativistic effects, which are precisely <em>at odds</em> with the conclusions you come to with Newtonian relative motion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Galilean relativity is an acceptable framework, it just breaks down at higher velocities.  Einsteinian relativity patches Galilean relativity to be correct in those cases.</p>
<p>&quot;Relativistic effects&quot; generally does refer to SR or GR effects though.  There aren't particularly many interesting effects that come from Galilean relativity.  (It's still important though -- there are a number of concerns in computational simulation, where certain techniques are <em>not</em> Galilean invariant, which is a problem).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. I get what you’re saying, but Einstein’s relativity is saying exactly what’s going on here. From the point of view of the observer (camera on ISS), moving at the same speed as the object of interest (crew dragon), they appear to be, very nearly, at rest because they’re going the same speed.</p>
<p>It’s not the part of relativity we typically talk about, but that was the fundamental premise, I think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's the bit about all frames of reference being equally valid. If the ISS is your frame of reference then it is stationary.</p>
<p>The other bit is about the speed of light being constant in all frames of reference simultaneously, which means time itself must be advancing at different rates in different frames. Satellites in orbit around the Earth travel fast enough relative to the surface that this effect can be observed and needs to be accounted for in the clocks of said satellites.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, it is absolutely not. Einstein's theories of relativity is completely unrelated to the concept of relative velocity in Newtonian physics, which is what is going on here. The fact that you got confused is exactly why it's not a good idea to call this relativity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is part of why it takes 19 hours to reach the ISS which is &quot;only&quot; 220 miles away.
They basically want to reach zero relative speed to each other at zero distance.  So they are trying to catch up and pass the space station so that they can slow down to zero velocity right as they dock, versus accelerating to dock.  So they are chasing and getting ahead of the station so that they can slow down and dock.  It takes them about 12 revolutions of the earth to do this.  So basically they travel 200,000 miles to reach zero velocity with an object (ISS) moving at 17,000 mph that is 220 miles away.  If you find it fascinating and are a gamer, Kerbal Space Program.  It is an excellent simulator of patched conics, orbital dynamics, and how it all works.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>That said, in a world with no practical considerations and arbitrary precision, you could theoretically rendezvous in a little more time than it takes to complete one half of an orbit. Most of that time is used to give you a wide margin of error, since if you plan on being a little under and a bit behind the target, you're not going to spend much more fuel than you otherwise would to reach that orbit (in contrast to arriving higher and early).</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The whole sequence can be done in \~3 hours from launch to docking if you time the launch window just right. This was intentionally slower to test and evaluate a number of Dragon's systems prior to docking and for added safety, I believe.  </p>
<p>The ISS is also not really 220 miles away unless it is directly overhead of the launch site. Even on a 3 hour transit, you're going to orbit at least once the vehicle intercepts the ISS.</p></div>		</li>
