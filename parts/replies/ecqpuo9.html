<p>Harmony isnâ€™t constructed from a piano, a piano is constructed for harmony. </p>
<p>Dissonance and consonance comes from simple whole number relationships (scaled) between sounds (these relationships are fudged a bit from their strictly whole number relationships in modern TET scales in order to gain the ability to arbitrarily switch between keys without retuning)</p>
