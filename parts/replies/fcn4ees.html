			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that the armor a 13th century knight would have worn was mostly proof against arrows, but not 100% of the knight's body is armored, and most of the body of the horse they're likely riding is not armored in a way that would protect it from arrows.</p>
<p>Anyway, the purpose of arrows in that era wasn't necessarily to kill all the enemies. Even the shields carried by infantry would provide a strong degree of protection from arrow fire. The tactical goal of arrow fire was to break up the enemy formation. Killing a bunch of horses and causing them to fall down in the midst of a cavalry charge would be a pretty effective way of doing that even if the arrows aren't blowing through plate armor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A knight in the 13th century was definitely not arrow-proof. At that time, even the richest knight's primary protection was still mail and padding, maybe with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_plates" target="_blank">coat of plates</a> worn under his surcoat and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_helm" target="_blank">great helm</a>. </p>
<p>While that knight is much better protected than his conscripts and footmen, arrows can still pierce his armor, especially on his arms, legs, and neck. With that level of protection he's unlikely to be killed outright by arrows but a knight with an arrow through his shoulder or thigh is still probably out of the fight.</p>
<p>Another important thing to remember is that, even later when plate armor had advanced to the level of full harnesses, not every man or even most men in a given army would have been wearing plate. Your average rank and file soldier was probably still wearing mostly padded gambeson, maybe a mail hauberk (or later a breastplate) if he was a bit more well-off, and a steel helmet. </p>
<p>A volley of arrows doesn't pose much threat to an advancing unit plate-armored knights and men-at-arms. To a unit of footmen (who are still a mass of men with pointy sticks and murderous intent; a threat) arrow fire could be devastating and any threat you can remove from the battlefield without committing your own men to the meat grinder is a worthy target.</p></div>		</li>

In short, no they probably didn't pierce armor unless they hit a weak spot. However, they would shatter and the shards might be dangerous.
It's worth noting however that by the 15th century, these heavily armored knights rarely if ever carried shields. That alone should tell you that they weren't too worried about arrows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, peasants didn't wear armour - chances are the archers would be aiming at the spear or pike formations (made up of peasants) to break them up, allowing the cavalry to charge in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My gripe is that they tested high end steel armor against iron arrows. There was never any chance for penetration. Steel arrows are known to exist during the period but iron was far more common. Iron is brittle and caused the arrows' heads to shatter against the much harder steel, while much of the energy of the projectile is not carried forward into the plate as a result.
It's less about <em>can</em> arrows penetrate armor than <em>did</em> they. What's fairly clear is that, like you said, they didn't seem particularly concerned about it happening on the battlefield.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a video on YouTube where a guy tested this. Crossbows during the 15th century could pierce plate but only at 15feet, or 5meter distance. So it’s pretty scary to try and if you did try, you would probably be cut down since him and his group would be charging at you if you’re that close. It still dented the plate beyond that pretty nasty that I’m sure it would hurt. But at like 60 feet it was a tiny dent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak regarding the time period in question, but I can confirm that in today's speak, if an assailant is within about 21 ft of you (this distance can very a bit depending on the person - usually up to about 25 ft), that assailant can close that distance within about 1 to 1.25 seconds.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In the given example, while I would expect a Knight in full plate to move much slower than anyone today, their battlefield weapon would more than likely make up the difference. My point being to solidify yours. If you manage to get that shot off, maybe, just maybe, you end up killing them, but you're almost certainly going to die in kind.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In modern times, getting shot with body armor is extremely painful. I would imagine the feeling of being shot at 60 ft in full plate is pretty akin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also it’s worth stating that a lot of times, the war hammers and maces and whatnot were oftentimes plenty to kill the knight under the armor outright without piercing the armor itself. If you think about it, a relatively thin and light plate of steel isn’t going to offer much protection to your skull from a blunt and heavy piece of metal on the end of a lever-no real point trying to unnecessarily puncture the armor when you can just crack your opponent’s skull underneath it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a YouTube video of a guy in full gothic plate sparing with long swords  against an unarmored opponent to demonstrate what techniques were used in that situation. The opponent reversed his grip so he was holding the sword by the blade and executed a mordhau or murder stroke where he swung the sword overhead and brought the pommel down on the top of the armored fighters helmet like a hammer. The helmet dented and the armored guy went down with a concussion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They might very well be, but a couple straps of leather or canvas aren’t nearly enough to absorb the impact of a war hammer or a mace swung by a trained opponent.  That’s at least a few pounds of iron or steel on the end of a big stick for extra leverage and moving at a pretty decent clip. Even if it doesn’t kill you, you’re getting your bell rung like you wouldn’t believe, plus the material itself isn’t flexible like a football helmet. Once it’s caved in, it’s not going back to normal without some serious repair work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>full plate is something like 40 lbs. These people were definitely strong. </p>
<p>Common misconception though. Not all plate armor wearers were knights or part of the cavalry. Knights got squires to help them with the armor. </p>
<p>Beast-mode were the motherless serfs turned mercenary who clambered about in those stinky tin cans that had no land or title</p></div>		</li>
