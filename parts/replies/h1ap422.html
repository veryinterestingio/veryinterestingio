			<div class="markdown"><p>That camera is deceptive. That shot was taken at probably about 3-4 miles. With something the size of an ISR drone, it is likely that the pilot could barely even see what he was shooting at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the speed of the jet firing and the targets speed and heading, but probably somewhere around Mach 5 on a nose to nose engagement.</p>
<p>Depends on the missile, the launching jets speed, and the closure rate.</p>
<p>For an idea, DCS flight sim models this in a fairly accurate way. In a nose to nose fight with radar guided missiles, you'll have around 10-30 seconds to do everything right when a missile is launched at you at a distance of 15-20 miles. If the launching jet is supersonic, high altitude and you're also heading toward them, it's about 10-20 seconds max.</p>
<p>In DCS, defense against a launch consists of getting the alert (therefore knowing it's radar as IR isn't always detected) identifying the launch direction, considering surroundings, then moving to a notch position or cover, launching countermeasures and firing back to gain initiative.</p>
<p>All that in seconds. If you fail, you're dead, if you succeed the second launch begins and it's even less time.</p>
<p>Missile combat is crazy which is why if it gets to a point where jets are dogfighting, both pilots have fucked up. At that point, it's almost guaranteed that one of those jets will be shot down. Who gets shot down depends on the jet and pilot skill and endurance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference is that here, he is making sharp turns at the last second so the missiles pass by him, instead of in the movies where missiles are about the same speed as the plane itself and the pilot gets the missiles to crash into each other or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's not just turning at the last second though. Modern missiles can pull far more G's in the final fractions of a second than an aircraft or pilot. SAM's calculate the target's velocity and aim for where it will be, not where it is. The pilot has to keep changing his direction so that the SAMs react, turn to intercept, and burn off their momentum doing so.</p>
<p>Remember, a missile's rocket motor only burns for a few seconds, and then momentum carries it to the target at a great speed. The pilot hopes that he can burn enough of its momentum so that the missile can be outrun/out turned.</p>
<p>Another thing that kept this pilot alive are the SAM warnings coming in over the radio. Something like over 80% of aircraft shot down by missiles are unaware they are being targeted and therefore attempt no maneuvers or countermeasures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He is turning hard way before the
&quot;last second&quot;. Most likely he's putting a missile to his 9 or 3, so that it has to turn hard to intercept him, bleeding a lot of energy.</p></div>		</li>
