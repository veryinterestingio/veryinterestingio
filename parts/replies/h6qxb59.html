<p>Without any information whatsoever about the mechanism or type of encryption/encoding happening, you can't just throw compute power at a cypher text to decode it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But we know about the mechanism and how the encryption works. So how about just not knowing the settings?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is once you have readable text you don't know that it is the same text that was written in the machine.  A program designed for this would probably return multiple responses that seem valid, with no guarantee that one or any of them were correct.<br />
There's also the issue that the person writing the message is human and might have made one or more typos, which raises the possibility that the correct solution could be automatically rejected for having errors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Elizebeth Friedman broke the earliest Enigma machine with just pencil and paper and an unbelievable mind. It had only one cylinder. </p>
<p>Her husband William Friedman created the American code machine in the early 1930's and no foreign government ever cracked it. The two of them created cryptanalysis around 1916.</p>
<p>Both of these individuals, but especially Elizebeth, were kept out of the history of cryptology because she was always so far ahead of the world.</p>
<p>Check out the book &quot;The Woman Who Smashed Codes&quot;. A true story that starts out like a 1980's Steven Spielberg movie. I've read primarily non-fiction books my entire life, over 50 years, and this is one of the very best.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok I have to ask.</p>
<p>I've learned a bit about the enigma, used simulator, watched hours of video on how it worked and everything.
I think I can say that I (at least minimally) understand how enigma work. (I could explain it to others)</p>
<p>But, there isn't really easily available information in the Bombe machine (or at least nothing I've found) and I still can't understand how that machine worked.</p>
<p>Do you have links to your talks, or do you have others (not too hard to understand for not great English speakers) sources ?</p>
<p>I would love to finally understand how that machine work.</p></div>		</li>

<p>THAT IS CORRECT!!!!</p>
<p>It took me quite a while to figure it all out, including email correspondence with someone in Sweden that built a Bombe simulator that I don't think is online anymore.</p>
<p>My talk isn't currently available online.... However it WILL BE in the future.
I'm bogged down with family stuff ATM and don't have time to do extra stuff outside of work. :(</p>
<p>Feel free to DM me in the future to ask about status.</p></div>		</li>
