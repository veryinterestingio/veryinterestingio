			<div class="markdown"><p>It...might not be so bad honestly.  Iceland has a similar traditional winter dish that’s fermented shark (buried for ~6 months).  I’ve had it, it does taste a lot like ammonia BUT it’s also traditionally eaten by slamming a shot of Icelandic liquor immediately after so it just ends up tasting like rye bread oddly enough.</p>
<p>Tldr the answer to fermented foods is ingesting other products of fermentation at the same time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You say aged meat, but this is <em>fermented meat, bones, feathers, and organs</em>. This isn't some dry-aged prime beef. This is feathers reduced to pasty goo and bones turned half to jelly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aged meat, like Angus beef?  If people knew how nasty that gets before the outside is cut away, they might think twice about eating it.  But most people probably eat it without question.  I know I do.</p></div>		</li>
