			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Inversion layers are extremely stable - that is any lifted air will return to its original level, because as it rises, it expands (pressure) and cools, but the environment warms and the colder air sinks back to where it was. So you won't see big, puffy cumulus clouds as they require unstable or marginally stable air to grow. What you may see is fog or some stratus clouds, but generally low-lying clouds in an inversion, or a layer on top of the inversion where the temp falls dramatically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always enjoyed their content, it's very informative but broken down to a generally understandable fashion. Minute Physics is also good, but the concepts are a lot more information-dense and it can be easy to get lost sometimes.</p></div>		</li>
