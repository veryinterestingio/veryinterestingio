			<div class="markdown"><p>Hubble has an angular resolution of 1/20th of an arcsecond, so yes, this is a million times better (400 million, actually)</p>
<p>Pluto is 7.5 billion km from earth at it's furthest, so earth eye could see (7.5 billion km * tan(1.2E-10 arcsec)) = 4mm objects on pluto.  For comparison, here is a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2015-11-13/pluto-photos-new-horizon-hubble/6833614" target="_blank">Hubble pic</a> of Pluto which is 2370km in diameter</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>heh, there are a lot of imaginary assumptions.  the lens would also have to be super-refracting as to not be too thick.  i suppose we could replace vitreous fluid with a vacuum, which would take care temperature-induced eddies, but then would gravity collapse the ball?  i guess i don't really need the ball - just a truss.  my imaginary eyeball needs a 475 mile wide carpet of foveal cones that are sufficiently vascularized, and whose output is processed by multiple layers of neural processing to achieve 2deg fov and 1.2E-10 arcsec acuity.  is our earth-eyeball rotating like the earth?</p>
<p>maybe we can borrow one of elon musk's hyper tubes to build a long refractor telescope as a proof of concept  :)</p></div>		</li>
