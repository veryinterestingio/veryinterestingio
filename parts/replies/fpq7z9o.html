			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue is how close together the workers are in the factories, and how fast the assembly lines run. For instance, the 973,000 square foot Smithfield Foods pork processing plant in Tar Heel, NC employs 4,500 people and processes 32,000 pigs a day. That is a lot of quick movements among closely spaced workers.</p></div>		</li>
