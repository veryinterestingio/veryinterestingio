			<div class="markdown"><p>The heartbeat count for humans is thrown off a bit because they used the record lifespan. Jeanne Calment lived more than 50% longer than the average human, who would achieve more like 1.5 billion heartbeats. </p>
<p>Even if they used the record lifespan for every species, the human sample size is way bigger so the record is going to be a bigger outlier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even so, we live an exceptionally long time. We're about the same size as a deer (7 years) or a pig (10 years?).  A horse is double our size and lives to 40.  These are pretty typical numbers. The fact that a human easily lives to 80 is well beyond the scope of normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but it puts us much closer to the top of the rest of the cluster rather than almost off the chart. Roughly in line with the animal that had a heartbeat slightly slower than us and a life expectancy of 80. An elephant maybe?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These are all mammals. Nothing about warm-blooded birds or the cold-blooded everything elses. Many of them don't do much most of the day so metabolism shouldn't be such an issue. Anyway, it's very easy to mistake correlation with cause.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My first words were &quot;for mammals&quot;.  Also, in this instance, there is a general causation related to thermodynamics and geometry</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you think lifespan depends on completely different things for non-mammals? Which in turn don't affect mammals? Surely there is something more general to say to properly explain the question.</p></div>		</li>
