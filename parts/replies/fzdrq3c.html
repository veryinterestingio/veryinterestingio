			<div class="markdown"><p>Most plastic can't really be <em>re</em>cycled in the sense that metal can be, i.e. melted down and made back into the same sort of product. It can often only be <em>down</em>cycled, e.g. turning plastic bottles into a park bench or fleece, not back into bottles.</p>
<p>Aluminum is a great material for recycling because so much of the energy used in making a new aluminum product is in refining the aluminum from ore. A used can is made of aluminum that's already been refined, so it's a great material to make a new can from.</p>
<p>Glass, on the other hand, is a great material to <em>reuse</em>, because so much of the energy used is in shaping the glass into a bottle. If that bottle can be returned, cleaned, and refilled, it doesn't have to be remade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re missing the point. Dispute the face that plastic can indeed be recycled the vast majority of plastic put in a blue bin in western countries is just tossed in a landfill. Most of the developing world has stopped accepting plastic waste from western countries and there are very few recycling plants, much less ones that are profitable. </p>
<p>If you are living in the US or Canada plastic for all intents and purposes is not recyclable. There was just a huge advertising push by oil companies to market plastic as easily recyclable when that’s never really been the case. Oil companies, are surprisingly doing pretty terrible and haven’t been super profitable for a very long time and oil companies have been sort of desperately pushing plastics as hard as they can.</p>
<p>Stocks in oil companies like Exonn used to be super popular and secure. These days most financial institutions are pulling money of out oil companies like crazy. Might seem kinda weird but oil companies are kinda giving their dying kicks and desperately looking for anyway to stay profitable and pouring insane amounts of money into lobbying governments to keep everyone buying their shit. Even in the US the world is slowly moving away from fossil fuels and plastics and i think even Exxon Mobil knows their fighting a loosing battle</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure why you think I'm disagreeing. Plastic recycling is indeed oversold; and the making of most new plastic items usually can't use recycled plastic at all (so yes, it depends on petroleum). Aluminum recycling is the real deal; steel somewhat less so. Glass recycling is not nearly as good as reuse.</p></div>		</li>
