<p>Actually, radiation is the dominant mechanism on Earth. The reason you feel cold/warm is 25% conduction, 25% convection and 50% radiation. When you're in a house with 21Â°C air but cold walls, you feel cold because your body radiates a lot of heat towards the walls, even though the air temperature is comfortable.</p></div>		</li>

I hope one day the world will use &quot;themself,&quot; but for now it is very encouraging to read a post about my dreams that I can relate to.</p></div>		</li>
