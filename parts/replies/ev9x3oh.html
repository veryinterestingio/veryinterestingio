			<div class="markdown"><p>PhD in exoplanets here. This is the best answer. Most importantly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First I will say these gaps are absolutely NOT due to observational problems. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>These gaps aren't due to observing planets with different methods. If there were <em>not</em> intrinsic gaps, these gaps would <em>not</em> exist with our current observational methods.</p>
<p>I can't personally verify the Roche lobe overflow because that's slightly outside my area, and I've been out of the field for two years.</p>
<p>The one thing they didn't really cover is why there is a gap between the cold Jupiters and the rocky planets. At these semi-major axes, planet formation proceeds very quickly through that mass range. It takes a while to build up to a super Earth, but then once you start growing past that, planets grow to Jupiter sizes pretty quickly due to being able to capture hydrogen and helium too.</p>
<p>Edit: One thing to note about this plot is that it doesn't show error (i.e., uncertainty) bars on them. Some of the planets in the gaps are probably not really in the gaps, although a few of the planets in the clumps might actually be in the gaps. Even if there truly were no planets in these gaps, uncertainty in measuring their distances and masses would place a few planets in these gaps anyways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The gap between the cold and hot jovian planets is a weird one indeed. There seem to be a few ideas for this</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One is that if (as per the 3rd theory in my previous post is true) high eccentricity migration is the formation mechanism for HJs and all jovian planets form far out then this gap would be expected due to the speed of migration due to tidal circularization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another is based on formation in that there are different formation mechanisms for HJs and cold Jupiters. Somehow you would get rapid formation of a super earth core in situ and we already expect jovian planets where we see them. Then the fact its not a complete desert would be down to migration mechanism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This gap is not very well understood either. I have a hunch that disc instabilities might play a major role in this game though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Our ability to detect planets decreases as you go right and as you go down on that plot (and especially as you go down and right). If there were no gaps, the density of dots would smoothly fade away. However, there are gaps, and they're strong enough that we can actually see them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your answer! If I understand correctly, Earth would stand at 1-1 in this plot. Does this mean we haven't discovered a <em>single</em> planet like Earth (or Venus and Mars if I read this correctly) in terms of mass and distance from its sun? How to explain this anomaly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct we have not found a planet that is what I would call Earth like (despite the claims). I do not even think we have the capability right now as to me Earth like would mean not only the correct part of parameter space but also the correct (or similar) atmospheric composition. We will be able to do this soon with.... I always confuse which mission is doing what!... TESS and Twinkle?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now our detection methods just do not have the resolution to observe small long period planets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Twinkle does the spectroscopy, looking at what planets and mainly their atmosphere contains of by their absorption spectrum. That is interesting because free O2 would indicate life.</p>
<p>TESS( Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) searches for exoplanets by looking for brightness differences when they occlude a part of their star.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a reason why the whole bottom right half of the chart is empty. The smaller a planet, and more distant from its star, the more difficult it is to detect. The weaker the signal (dip in star brightness in the transit method, or the Doppler shift in starlight in the radial-velocity method) the more observations we need to make sure there really is something instead of just noise. And as the radius of the orbit increases, so does the orbital period, and thus the time it takes to pinpoint any periodicity in the data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind, that the distance axis on the plot is in AU, astronomical units. One AU is the distance from our Sun to Earth, and it is roughly in the middle of Sun's habitable zone. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstellar_habitable_zone#/media/File:Diagram_of_different_habitable_zone_regions_by_Chester_Harman.jpg" target="_blank">Some exo-planets are believed to occupy their respective star's habitable zone</a>, which may be different from the same zone of our Sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, fortunately most stars are much smaller and dimmer than the Sun, so their habitable zones are much closer to the star, allowing us to detect Earth sized planets there. Proxima b, for example.</p>
<p>On the other hand, M dwarfs probably aren't ideal for habitability. So we can detect planets in their habitable zone more easily, but they are less likely to actually be habitable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, this turned out to be far more interesting than I had thought. I have an astrophysics degree but this is an area that I am not a specialist in. It's amazing how wrong we were about planetary formation (and migration) when we only knew about the planets in our own Solar System. Thank you for your thorough explanation, looks like I have a lot of reading to do!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes this stuff tends to not be taught at undergraduate (or often at postgraduate) level. Likely because the field is moving so rapidly and is somewhat new (last 20-30 years although a bunch of ideas are as old as maybe the 60s). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Planetary formation is maybe one of the least impacted areas. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All things disc related are a bit of a mess including formation zones within a disc, angular momentum transport (this is an amusingly messy area), planet migration. We know so little about discs its awesome! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Migration of planets (my main area) is particularly amusing. There is a long history of people coming along and solving the tidal problem followed by very long (scientifically speaking) periods where no one looked at tidal problems because they were thought to be solved. That entire explanation of why the Moon migrates away due to tides is not general. In many cases the dominant source of tidal migration is internal waves rather than the large scale deformation. This is something only really explored in 2012 (and the theory originates from Zahn in I think it was 1977).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even things like planetary systems all being in flat discs is not really always the case. We have a big problem called the Kepler Dichotomy about this issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another is misalignment of systems of planets with their host stars spin axis. We thought because the Sun and the Solar system were nicely aligned this was the case pretty much always. Observations suggest that 40% of systems are not actually aligned at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its a REALLY fun time to be an exoplanetary scientist!!!</p></div>		</li>
