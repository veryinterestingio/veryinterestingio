			<div class="markdown"><p>So closing a program properly is the program walking itself down the stairs to the exit. Closing it with task manager is you pushing it down the stairs out the open door at the bottom. Both exit, but the second one can damage something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Unix/Linux terms, that is kill -15 vs kill -9</p>
<p>joking aside (yes, that was a joke) kill -15 is SIGTERM, which signals the process to terminate, kill -9 is SIGKILL, which kills the process without warning. SIGTERM is asking the process to exit and letting it do it gracefully, SIGKILL is throwing it out the window.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, I think the idea of &quot;damaging something&quot; is kind of overstated. If you have saved your work, it's likely nothing terrible will happen. The operating system has already set up a protected space that your program works in, so even if all of that memory gets deleted, it will likely be fine to start up next time you run. </p>
<p>Bad things will typically happen if the program is currently writing to the disk (like being in the middle of saving a file).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was a bigger issue back in the old days when nothing was sandboxed and everyone ran with admin privileges (or in cases where that concept didn't even exist like Win9x). But still, forcibly killing a program in the middle of an update or something cold at least fuck up that program to the point where you have to reinstall.</p></div>		</li>
