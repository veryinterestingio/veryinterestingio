			<div class="markdown"><p>Neonatal abstinence syndrome (withdrawal) is measured on a validated scale. Some symptoms measured include high pitched cry inconsolable for &gt;15 sec, mild-moderate-severe tremors, sweating, nasal stuffiness, and poor feeding. <a href="https://ncpoep.org/guidance-document/neonatal-abstinence-syndrome-overview/neonatal-abstinence-syndrome-nas/" target="_blank">Read this page</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Use of a weaning methadone dose is a common treatment and is also used for patients that have been intubated and sedated for long periods of time, as well. (I'm an pediatric registered nurse and see all of the above)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I knew someone that was pregnant and getting high. The doctors were working with the state to put the baby in custody. The baby wasn’t born addicted to anything and is a perfect child. Do you think it was her body or is there something else? She was using crack </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first two symptoms are not present in stimulant withdrawal.</p>
<p>And tachycardia and high PB is treated like any other case based on the symptoms. I.e. Propranolol etc.</p>
<p>That also means stimulant withdrawal in infants is barely visible. Increased appetite and fatigue (i.e. less crying because asleep) are things people prefer in their babies.</p>
<p>The real problem isn't the withdrawals the baby has to go through, but that they have already been addicted to the drugs the mother used, and thus are far more prone to relapsing.</p>
<p>Like a healthy infant will grow up to an adult that may safely try amphetamines or cocaine a few times, but the addicted baby will just grow up to be a dry addict, and any first use would actually be a relapse, and they are this far more likely to become users again.</p>
<p>Even if they are adopted out right after birth, so it's not dependant on growing up with addicted parents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Babies who are going through withdrawals have a super specific high-pitched cry that is so easy to recognize once you’ve heard it. I’ve seen a few of these babies. They also just shake, their hands have tremors or their eyes twitch. Their blood pressure and heart rates can become unstable so they have to receive methadone for withdrawals as soon as they come out of the womb. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes it’s the family’s “fault” because the mom did drugs while pregnant. Other times the baby has to have surgery straight out of the womb and then gets addicted to the medications used for anesthesia. It’s so sad. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Me and my wife have ADD. The minute she found out she was pregnant is the minute she stopped taking her prescribed adderall.</p>
<p>There are surprisingly very mixed opinions about continuing medication through pregnancy, but she decided to stop for this exact reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I definitely respect her decision and have also seen mixed opinions of ADD medication use during pregnancy. </p>
<p>That said, I actually continued use of ADD meds (decreased dose) throughout my pregnancy with the support of my OB GYN. As with all choices, there are benefits and risks to weigh and for my situation, the benefits outweighed the risks. Baby was born healthy and happy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was a great idea. My fiance's brother died at birth, doctors said it was likely because his mother wasn't aware she was pregnant and continued to use Adderall for almost half the pregnancy. </p></div>		</li>
