In addition, this can create an infection which can lead to sepsis, which can kill you if untreated. Additionally, a tooth with a dying nerve will break easier. (Bear in mind I am not a professional so I might be wrong)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was my understanding that this is actually a recent delopment with our change in diet. Cave dwelling humans didnt actually have this high of an incidence of cavities, as evolution was sufficiently &quot;caught up&quot; to their diet, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So why is it that dental work is considered cosmetic, even though an infected tooth can potentially lead to sepsis and death?  </p>
<p>To me that seems like more of a serious medical issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this type of dental work (to treat cavities and abcesses) is not considered cosmetic. however, in the uk for example dental work is much costlier. could that be your frame of reference?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I got 3 teeth removed because cavities became infections. Honestly, hurt so much I cried every day and couldn't focus at work.
Thank god my dad makes bank and I have good dental insurance.
But yeah, trust me people, DO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN!!!
I honestly think I would have killed myself if I had to deal with it for too long.
Dental insurance is a human right!</p>
<p>Also, the idea God created us and we aren't just the worst apes ever is hysterical.
Hopefully one day they will have successfully bred Wisdom teeth out of us and maybe it will lead to our teeth fitting in our mouths properly. Can't tell me our teeth are best possible design when a lot of us depend on getting old ape teeth removed, back when we had room for a third set of molars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry to hear about your teeth, definitely not ideal!</p>
<p>Fun fact related to your second point:
I don't have any wisdom teeth (like they never existed/grew in) and neither does my dad. He's Ukrainian, I think some Slavic populations just don't develop wisdom teeth. So evolution is already working on it and you can rest easy!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m a dentist. I wouldn’t pull anything off until your dental appointment, unless it’s so loose it basically comes off on it’s own. You should be able to find an appointment sooner than a month out though, ideally. Most offices will squeeze you in their schedule somewhere if you have a broken tooth</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a dentist, but have had damaged teeth. I'd see a dentist sooner rather than later. It's pretty amazing what a skilled dentist can do these days. Things that look hopeless to lay people can sometimes be repaired so perfectly, you can't even tell afterwards.</p>
<p>But in the general, of this is only possible, if there is enough healthy material left for the dentist to work with. Wait too long, and you can lose that. And then it gets painful, expensive, and ugly. Don't wait for that. Have an initial appointment now. Then it's always possible that the professional will tell you it's safe to wait</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I chipped a tooth like that once. You should get that looked at asap. Letting it go can make it much more complex and expensive to fix. Also, no dental repair lasts forever, so in 10 years when it needs work again, if the first work was complex (or required removing a lot of material) then the next fix might be the more complex and expensive one.</p></div>		</li>
