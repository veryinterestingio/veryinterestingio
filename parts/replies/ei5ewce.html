<p>Perspiration has nothing to do with making you feel better</p>

<p>It doesn't have anything to do with <em>actually</em> making you better, but it certainly makes me <em>feel</em> better. &quot;Oh yeah, look how much I'm sweating. This fever must really be killing all the germs. I bet that sweat is just full of germ corpses&quot;. It's pretty motivating. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Wrapping up to make yourself even warmer helps your body do that better. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Does it though? I recently found that wrapping yourself up when you have a fever is actually the <em>opposite</em> of what medical professionals recommend.</strong> I have to admit, the logic didn't make sense to me, for the reason you stated.</p>
<p>So one evening a few weeks ago, my father was at home watching tv when he suddenly mentioned how freezing cold he felt. He then admitted he hadn't been feeling well all evening and said he'd go to bed. But he had difficulty standing up because his body was shivering so much! With help, he got to his feet and made it upstairs. My mom suggested he take a hot shower to warm himself up, but he was so unsteady/weak, he just got right in bed. He then complained of terrible pain all over, became confused, had difficulty speaking due to the teeth chattering (and pain) and difficulty even breathing (due to panic at the realization of his rapid deterioration, we think). My mom called 911.</p>
<p>While waiting for an operator, she gave my dad an electric blanket. He said it felt nice, he was more comfortable. Minutes later, the ambulance showed up, the medics went upstairs and assessed him, during which time he vomited (into a bag they provided, fortunately). He had a high temperature, a fever, they found. They gave him a shot of something which quickly improved his condition, and then readied a gurney outside so they could take him to hospital.</p>
<p><strong>On the way downstairs, when my mom said she'd go grab his winter jacket (-5C out), the medics said &quot;<em>NO, it might cause him to overheat. It'll do him good to cool off.</em>&quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>They then informed my mom that had he taken a hot shower in that condition, as she'd mentioned she'd suggested to him earlier, it would have worsened his condition, and that the heat from the blankets and electric blankets was probably what caused him to vomit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>They actually said &quot;<em>Next time, should you ever encounter sudden chills like that, REMOVE clothing, and do NOT use blankets.</em>&quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Later, at the hospital, the attending doctor said the same thing.</strong></p>
<p>Btw, they ran some tests, gave him some antibiotics via an IV drip, and identified the likely cause of the fever (urinary infection, a side effect of a routine precautionary procedure he'd undergone the previous day). They gave him a prescription and released him hours later. No further issues.</p></div>		</li>
