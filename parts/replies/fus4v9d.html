			<div class="markdown"><p>I wore a pair of shoes last year on a drunkin night, and they were too tight. I took my shoe off at the end of the night, and my big toe was bright red on 1 foot, and discoloration under the nail. </p>
<p>Sore as hell for about 3 days or so. Nail eventually fell off and what not. Shit sucked</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>my dr told me a long time ago to cut little triangles at the sides so the nail grows in and not out into your skin(causing ingrown toenails)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That reminds me of when I smashed my toe with a dollie and it was so bad that a few days after that happened I lost my toenail.  I cried because Google/webmd had me convinced that I would live the rest of my life without a pinky toe nail lol. It grew back just fine thankfully and it looked really weird, but it's slightly thicker now. Tmi, but it was doing this wierd thing where I didn't lose the very end of it, it kinda smashed/broke, so it was growing underneath the remnant of my old toenail and then eventually I lost that old toenail too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude I just realized why we have finger nails. To protect the mass of nerve density required to allow our fingers to be so sensitive in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's more likely the other way around. Most animals have some sort of hard thing at the end of their appendages I think evolution found it useful to have built in tools. And since we already had the nail to protect the fingertip then the nerve density increased as well since that's useful also.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting, I'll have to look more into that. So strange how these informational black holes can take place right in front of our face. I don't think I've ever questioned the discrete purpose of a finger nail before</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Other way round, as u/JusticeUmmmmm suggested. Nearly all amniotes (reptiles, birds, and mammals) have claws of some kind, so presumably the claw evolved in a common ancestor of ours. Probably it had the same function as it does in most amniotes today: grip, whether for moving over hard-to-grip surfaces, for catching prey, or both. As primates, our digits are specialized for climbing and manipulating objects, which is why they're packed with nerve endings. The presence of claws in our early ancestors - which could be flattened into protective nails over evolutionary time - probably facilitated the evolution of our specialized digits.</p></div>		</li>
