			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting addition to the numbers game point is that a physically larger person will be at higher risk for cancer simply because there is a larger number of cells to potentially become cancerous. I believe this is represented in the stats for cancer rates and height.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I could tell from my doctor when I got diagnosed with a form of Hodgkin's, the causes of many types of cancer are still a mystery.</p>
<p>I was a sort of pampered kid, but not overprotected, I was the kind of kid that tasted everything he could get to his mouth, and even stick my fingers in electricity outlets D: (actually was plugging something in holding the stupid plug by the metal thingies) so my defenses should be at an ok point. Vaccinated and everything.</p>
<p>I'm not a smoker, drink very casually and never to the point of being drunk actually because I do enjoy the taste of alcohol. I do live in a very contaminated city. And as many who had their childhood growing up in the 90's I've been exposed to massive amounts of sugar.</p>
<p>It was rough to get my diagnosis because since I have memory I've been a over-heater at night, so I'd sweat regularly if I didn't sleep in a well ventilated room, the sweats might have increased in the past years because of the disease, but I never really noticed if there was a change really.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are more mysteries than answers. Sadly, like in most things in life, the more we know the more we realize we don't know. Sometimes we didn't even know how to ask the right question until we got some answers to broader questions or unexplained phenomena to specific questions. We learn a little bit more all the time but the human body and biology is more complicated than most can begin to fathom; even some of us who have been in the field a long time.</p>
<p>As far as life-style items that cause cancers we know of a few and the rest are still a mystery. Does eating using plastic ware from the 80s and 90s increase the odds? Will micro-plastics that are now omnipresent cause new types of cancers over time or will they inhibit current standard of care treatments? Most of this is unknown and as time goes on and developments occur that we think cause links the hypotheses will be tested and if true companies will try to make treatments for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to add to this that beyond biologists and chemists working on these diseases we are seeing emerging technologies come from physicists and engineers making things like nanoparticles, light/energy based treatments and so many other things. Human disease affects us all and the entire STEM community takes active roles in this and it typically starts at the academic level. It is so important that government funding get bolstered into the STEM fields again. Somehow it became a political issue and it hurts us all when academics lose funding and we all lose their knowledge and potential future treatments.</p>
<p>Gonna step off my soapbox now...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For &quot;ELI5&quot; or in general terms beginning oversimplifications, I've always been told use phrases like this to highlight something you want to stand out in the context of a larger explanation. I agree it is slightly annoying but it may have an effect for some.</p>
<p>Also, I Swyped most of this on my phone while riding shotgun on the way home last night. It was hard to go back and edit or rewrite anything.</p></div>		</li>
