			<div class="markdown"><p>I would push back on this a little, a lot of the time people don't notice they need more water until they actually feel 'bad' or 'dehydrated', it's better to stay in front of it, so every individual should experiment with drinking different amounts to find a place that feels good for them.</p></div>		</li>
