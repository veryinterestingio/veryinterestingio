			<div class="markdown"><p>Yah... I started a CIV VI game last night at 10 PM (amateur move on my part). Got India on a random map. I’m trying to learn the game and the different Victory methods, and wanted to try a Religious Victory. Soon 2 am hits... ok a few more turns, then bed! Missionaries everywhere - take my religion (which I called The Dark Arts) you heathens! </p>
<p>Then it’s 3:15. Nearly there... then it’s 5:45 AM!? I finally won. And went to bed at 6 AM. Fuck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At like 4 AM last night I was gearing up to take back the Holy Land and Manifest some Destiny, but my buddy was like “hey man you think this is a good hopping off point?” Because he just finished a war and I died inside a little. I was fully prepared to not sleep today at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im thinking of buying the game, have never played a CIV. It seems very complex and doesn't seem accessible. What are your thoughts on the game?</p></div>		</li>
