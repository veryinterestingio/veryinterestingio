			<div class="markdown"><p>Looking into the top comments validity.  I found a website that makes the same claims as the top comment, however the website is for herbal remedies, is more of a homeopathic solution, and lacks any research that I can find.  The link provided in the top comment just establishes that muscle pain is a symptom of the flu/cold.  I have searched for more on the mayoclinics site, but have not found anything yet.</p>
<p>I am having a hard time finding anything beyond the herbal remedy website that says the white blood cells act in any other capacity than immune functions.  Repair, nutrition, and transport are all functions of red blood cells, and the only thing that your body really does that i know of to regulate blood blood is constrict/dialate blood vessels.  So i have more questions than answers regarding top comments claim.</p>
<p>Im not a doctor  so im not going to argue against someone elses opinion without some studying.  I fully support my answer as I already found credible resources backing it up, so at this point I will say both answers can be correct, but its hard to validate the top comments claims.</p></div>		</li>
