			<div class="markdown"><p>Is the time delay problem you mention the fact that light passing through different parts of the lens would have much further to travel?
So I guess you'd end up with a picture which is something like a long exposure taken over many years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. If you had the computation center in the middle of the array, it would take 15 years for the outermost light collectors to have their data arrive. But then the images would pipeline. Meaning after 15 years of the installation, images would stream in. But 15 years behind the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are capable of building a 3x10¹⁷ telescope, you may well be able to construct a 3x10¹⁹ telescope. Now you have centimeter resolution. I mean we're already clearing multiple systems for material and space, and if you've got the engineering for multi-parsec optics...</p>
