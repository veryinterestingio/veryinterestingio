			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good point that buildings and bridges have tolerances for bending in wind or under different temperature conditions. The problem with continental drift is that it's consistently in the same direction and never stops.  To OP's point, it seems like we'd need a tunnel that can get bigger (or smaller) forever.</p>
<p>[Edit: Ok, I don't mean literally forever, I just mean for whatever the normal lifetime of the bridge or tunnel]</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Average tectonic movement is 4-5 cm per year.  100 years of that and you're looking at 4-5 meters.  To pick a century-old bridge at random, what has the Manhattan Bridge had to deal with over that time period that compares to that?</p>
<p>For that matter, the Alcántara Bridge, clocking in at over 1900 years.  If it straddled a plate boundary, one end would have moved a distance half as long as the bridge itself (182 m).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, generally engineering concerns with regards to structures in plate boundary areas would more be in the flavor of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_engineering" target="_blank">earthquake engineering</a>, i.e., designing structures to survive estimated maximum shaking and accelerations expected for that region for a semi-likely earthquake based on seismic hazard assessments. Even for structures built directly across faults, most are not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aseismic_creep" target="_blank">creeping</a> and instead would only experience interseismic creep as part of their <a href="http://geoscience.wisc.edu/~chuck/Classes/Mtn_and_Plates/eq_cycle.html" target="_blank">seismic cycle</a>, which means that structures would experience centimeters to meters of displacement distributed over 10s of kilometers over decades (i.e., well within tolerances for things like thermal expansion/contraction, wind, etc), at least until the earthquake. There are design strategies specifically for critical infrastructure to survive sudden extreme movements from surface rupture of an earthquake, e.g., the Alaska Oil Pipeline which was built on sliders across the Denali Fault, allowing it to <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2003/fs014-03/pipeline.html" target="_blank">survive the 2002 Denali earthquake</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, the short term environmental loading (temperature changes, wind, seismic) far outweigh and govern the design of these structures more than a slow stretch from plate movement would. Especially seismic design in these locations. Overcoming high seismic forces is basically turning a building or structure on it's side and shaking it. There's many special considerations to make sure it doesn't collapse before people can get out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>100 feet is 30.48 meters. 3/4&quot; is 0.01905 meters.</p>
<p>If that amount of length change is correct, then a structure that is 10,000 m long would change \~190 meters. That's a pretty big change. However, like you said, I assume structures like bridges would have spacing in every joint to allow for flexibility and temperature length changes over the entire structure.</p>
<p>According to an Internet search, plates move between 0.5 cm to 10 cm each year. Given 100 years at the maximum rate, the bridge could separate or contract about 1 meter. That expansion or contraction seems well within tolerance of the overall changes for a long time. A 1 meter vertical shear over 100 years would be a problem, but I expect it could be repaired.</p>
<p>I do not know how a tunnel would handle tectonic shifts. A larger problem than tectonic shift is stress from earthquakes. Are there tunnels through plate boundaries? Hmm.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You somehow lost an order of magnitude and a feet-to-metre conversion in there. With the given expansion (1.9 cm on 30.5 metres) you'll only get a 6 metre swing on a 10 km structure. Put an expansion joint every 100 metres and each of them only has to catch 6 centimetres of shift, which is well managable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would only work if the 10 km bridge was a single span, which no bridge is.</p>
<p>For a bridge across a tectonic plate, at some point there will be two adjacent columns resting on different plates.  The entire expansion will have to be accommodated in the span between those columns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Most bridges have multiple joints in them to take up some portion of the expansion/contraction. They're actually pretty easy to see when you're driving over them (They're often a steel strip across the road deck that looks like interlocking teeth from either side). The important thing is that the engineer controls where the movement happens to prevent destabilizing the rest of the structure. As you noted, the longitudinal movement is much easier to deal with than a vertical movement would be. I would think with good data and a consistent movement, a structure could be engineered to accommodate a stretching movement on plates. However it would have a very defined lifespan based on movement and not time (if the plate movement rate changes, the lifespan changes). Compressing movement of plates would be a bit harder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no (active) fault in the English channel. France and Britain lie on the same tectonic plate, and the whole of the channel and the seas around Britain are still on the continental shelf, so there is no relative movement between them. Just because there's water between them doesn't mean that a fault caused it, it can just mean that sea levels are above a certain point that leads to it being submerged.</p></div>		</li>
