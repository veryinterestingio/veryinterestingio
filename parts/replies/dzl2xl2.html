<p>Photons are also waves, and can be represented (upon absorption) as a change in one or more characteristics of the particle it hits.</p>
<p>The particle itself could gain velocity, or rotate faster, or jump to a higher energy electron state.</p>
<p>Since heat is basically just a combination of these configurations (or a result of their immediate decay) in the long run it just becomes heat.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And in the <em>very</em> long run, leading to the inevitable Heath Death of the universe.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it be correct to say they’re an abstraction to represent a quantifiable unit of energy rather than a tangible particle? It’s easy to imagine a wave as a “fluid” of energy but I have trouble nailing down a good analogy or metaphor for the particle side of the duality. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It goes past ELI5 territory, but a photon gets absorbed, changing the state of the absorbing particle – maybe an electron is in a higher energy state or something. Then the particle might spit out another photon, share energy with other connected particles, or change in some other way.</p>
<p>If you’re all fancy, you can power <strong>life itself</strong> by absorbing photons:

			<div class="markdown"><p>High enough energy photons (such as Xrays) can strip the electrons off of atoms, but lower energy photons will cause electrons to jump up into higher energy states (still bound to the atomic nucleus, however) or cause the molecule to vibrate or rotate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>light is a spectrum of photons at different wavelengths, and certain colors are more attenuated by seawater than others.  Red is almost entirely absorbed in the first cm or so of water. Blue can penetrate the deepest (which is why oceans and lakes are generally blue). Interestingly, many sea creatures are red - which, because red light is quickly absorbed in the water column, often makes them appear black, thereby helping them avoid detection/predation. </p></div>		</li>
