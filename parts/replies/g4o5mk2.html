<p>Put a few drops in, wait a few seconds, tilt your head.</p>
<p>Anything that doesn't come out will evaporate shortly.</p>
<p>Unless you have ear wax build up (been there done that).</p>
<p>If you have wax build up you can buy a kit at your drug store to deal with that, or go bother your doctor</p></div>		</li>
