If OP isn't shitting their pants from laughing at hordes of walking encyclopedias eager to share their knowledge, then I really don't know why was this question posted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would look really bad to promise things and not pay up. There are tons of reasons to actually pay defectors ‚Äî it encourages more to join, it works as propaganda, and the bang for the buck is quite high. Countries are trying to do more than just secure a single plane.</p></div>		</li>
