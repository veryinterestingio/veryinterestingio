			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, yes and no. It's the method used for the surveying that's the problem. In theory we can survey without impacting marine life.</p>
<p>That's kind of like saying electricity is the cause of global warming. Not really, we can generate electricity from solar and wind power, but in terms of sonar technology we're still in the 50s and that tech doesn't exist yet. we're working on it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some products on the market that aim to solve the issue (For example, the <a href="https://geospectrum.ca/commercial-products/sytems/cetus-vlf-sonar/" target="_blank">CETUS</a> or the AquaVib), but even the products that are available haven't been fully fleshed out and tested in an operational environment. These machines can also be very expensive, large and cumbersome, and a challenge to deploy / recover in comparison to traditional surveying methods (i.e. air guns).</p>
<p>If you specifically want to do something about it, your best bet would be to raise it as an issue with your local government representatives and try to push for more funding in this field. While there is some research funding, if we're really concerned about the well-being of marine life we need to push not only to further develop the technology, but also push surveying companies and sonar companies to use more environmentally friendly methods.</p></div>		</li>
