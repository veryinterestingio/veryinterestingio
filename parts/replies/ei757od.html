			<div class="markdown"><p>Although Stuxnet is nightmare-esque if you just consider that something like that was possible, it was a combination of many simultaneous coincidental zero-days for a very specific targeted infrastructure. Highly unrealistic representation of what you could typically expect from even state sponsored attacks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The protocols that run the internet are a bit more open source than proprietary and specially made SCADA systems and PLCs. The former face the scrutiny of millions of computer nerds day to day. The latter face the scrutiny of the maybe couple hundred people who actually deal with the specific system in question and rely far more on physical security to avoid these issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, minor pedantry, but Stuxnet wasn't anything like this.</p>
<p>It was rather highly specific in its target. I don't know about its spread, but it's more akin to a virulent but benign infection that aimed to kill very specific targets (centrifuges).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reading about Stuxnet was awesome. Imagining the scientists running around in a panic as their machines all malfunctioned at once, knowing it must have been an attack. Like something out of a sci-fi movie.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC it was designed to have a very low probability of going off each time one of the machines ran.  So basically it just looked like their centrifuges were randomly breaking for unrelated reasons over the course of several months.  If they all malfunctioned at once they would have known something was up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is part of what made it so sophisticated. It would happen sporadically and occasionally, with very low visibility as to why the centrifuges weren’t producing the right yields. Nothing broke or stopped, and not much happened all at once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, reading about stuxnet stuff, one 'idea' it used was to monitor how much 'good stuff' (enriched uranium/plutonium?) was in the system so as to 'go ham' when it would maximize the loss of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite the opposite, it sat quietly reducing efficiency for <a href="https://malicious.life/episode/episode-8-stuxnet-part-2/" target="_blank">five years</a>. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stuxnet’s creators could have caused catastrophic damage to all the centrifuges simultaneously, which might have caused the entire facility to shut down; yet they chose a kind of gradual “strangling” in order to sabotage not only the machines but also the confidence the engineers had in them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's telling about the confidence in their malware that they didn't just cause a panic, and didn't just destroy all the centrifuges.  Making everything malfunction at once must have been tempting!  But they knew (probably through prior experience) that they could sit there undetected for years.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, the fast, functional Internet we experience has very little extra capacity and once things go wrong it all slows to a crawl like in the Dyn attack, or in some countries when one undersea cable goes down the rest become saturated? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most definitely but this is also a matter of convenience.</p>
<p>Netflix (and streaming services in general) make up a ridiculous amount of traffic and the load on transcontinental cables is mitigated by them setting up content providers on all continents.   </p>
<p>If the capacity went down or demand went up, providers would have to increase such solutions.  </p>
<p>If a cable went down you'd probably find streaming temporarily banned through lines compensating for it. Whatever makes the important stuff work.</p></div>		</li>
