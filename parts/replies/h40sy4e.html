			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s an interesting question. </p>
<p>It’s not exactly the same, but I desensitized myself to tickling by sheer willpower and training myself out of reacting. </p>
<p>I was very ticklish as a child and my sister would torture me by tickling me. </p>
<p>I actually trained myself out of being ticklish little by little by resisting the tickle reaction for as long as I could, until eventually I stopped reacting completely. </p>
<p>I am now almost completely resistant to tickling. I can <em>occasionally</em> have a tickle reaction if I’m touched in the right place or the right way, but pretty much I’m desensitized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Long answer: Tickling is not a fun activity, its a panic[stress] response by your body. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=stress+phases&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk00cMZ2vPpsFlqIob5yGbYGnXcVUtA:1625435494952&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiTqqCKs8rxAhVGzIUKHemECSMQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=746#imgrc=oP42UUOmUuaG7M" target="_blank">Here</a> in this picture you can see the phases of stress...to simplify that, your body goes through 3 phases, first alarm reaction which is basically preparing for fight or flight, second resistance stage which is self explanatory, its basically enduring the stress, and lastly the exhaustion stage, where your body is tired and cannot hold on much longer...if the stress is there beyond this stage your gonna die.<br />
.<br />
Short answer: None of what you mentioned would happen, its just gonna be a torture...I heard it used to be used by the FBI for interrogation purposes...and it makes sense because when the person enters the exhaustion stage in a few hours they won't be able to tolerate it.<br />
.<br />
Do reply if I have to simplify it further ill try.</p></div>		</li>
