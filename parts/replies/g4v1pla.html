<p>Can't know for sure, but 1918 flu was an H1N1 virus, a subtype of Influenza A.</p>

<p>That's what I was thinking as well. The 1918 flu was H1N1, a very close relative of the &quot;Swine Flu&quot; of 2009; as such, studies of the 2009 version would be a fairly good predictor of the 1918 version. If the 2009 version had asymptomatic carriers (and apparently it did), the 1918 version probably did too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do we know for sure that the 1918 flu was H1N1? As far as I understand there was no way to know at the time, and the genetic material of the virus isn't stable enough for long term survival/storage.  How did we trace the virus lineage back that far once we did understand viruses better?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I actually wasn't sure either, so I googled. TL/DR: 1) turns out it's not <em>that</em> unstable, and 2) the scientists lucked out in knowing where to find a sample in much better storage than usual.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I caught it in college, I had three friends I absolutely did not practice social distancing with and none of them 'caught' it. Considering we shared drinks, ate off the same plates, and spent most days together 24/7, I suspect at least one had to have been asymptomatic.</p></div>		</li>
