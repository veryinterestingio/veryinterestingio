			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. My husband's vasectomy was going to be $32 out of pocket. A tubal ligation for me was going to be a few thousand as we had a really high out of pocket maximum. Luckily? I ended up getting a c section with my last and they did the tubal while they were in there. OP has weird insurance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When was your IUD insertion? Mine was completely covered by my insurance as contraception when I had it replaced a few years ago, only had the copay for the office visit itself. The reasoning I was given was that they were required to cover birth control in general, but could give favoritism to generics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once was told a bill, got seen, got a bill 10x higher than I was told, complained over the phone, and then got a bill half the size of my original expectation, because reasons. Every other time I've gotten a second mortgage, because my coverage never seems to apply whenever I need it. Fuck our system.</p></div>		</li>
