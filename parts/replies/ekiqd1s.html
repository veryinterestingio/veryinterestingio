			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much yeah. It's not recommended that you do that, as snot is an important part of healing (or rather, a way or protecting you from getting more sick). It's the same thing as tylenol, where technically you want a fever to kill the cold, but take tylenol anyway to help manage the pain/uncomfortableness</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about nonallergic rhinitis? I haven't read much on it, but it was explained to me that your body is reacting to basically everything as though you're allergic even if you're not? Why would oral antihistamines not work, but nasal ones do?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is me. I’ve had chronic post nasal drip for the last 4 years. It’s brutal. The constant threat clearing has damaged my voice. I’ve tried every prescription nasal spray under the sun. Only ephedrine helps orally weirdly, but it just makes me produce less thick mucus. Nothing actually stops it. I feel like I’m choking a lot. It’s awful. I’ve been to so many specialists and the last one was like “When this happened to me I just did everything I could to lessen it and after like 7 years it just stopped.” Like gee thanks guy for your medical insight. </p>
<p>Saline spray is useful. And a steroid rinse was too. I think it’s because there’s an airborne irritant in my home somewhere that’s difficult to track. But I can’t answer why. I can’t wait for someone who does know why :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've got the same, let me know if you ever find any solution!</p>
<p>3x a day nasal rinse, followed by Flonase helps me a bit, but doesn't solve the problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had vasomotor rhinitis basically my entire life. I've had allergy workups, CT scans, etc. My dad also has it, though several docs have told me it doesn't run in families. I'm a woman, so it gets even worse around my period. I've got the postnasal drip (which causes a lot of nausea) and the runny nose.</p>
<p>Everything triggers it. Changes in temperature, cold to hot or hot to cold. Changes in humidity, in either direction. Eating. Environmental irritants, etc. And nothing seems to help at all except for a few nasal sprays that have an absolutely awful, vomit-worthy taste that lingers in the back of your throat for hours. And they stop working if I use them too regularly. Sometimes my nose is just running so badly that I have to keep a tissue pretty much on it all the time. </p>
<p>It's a nightmare! And I've talked to a few folks who are like me, or like you (primarily the postnasal drip) and all our doctors seem to be like &quot;hmm, this sucks, sorry!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever had any surgical procedures done on your nose or any history of injury in that general area? Have your doctors ever mentioned the term &quot;CSF leak&quot; with you when discussing this ailment? If they have investigated this and ruled out the possibility then that's a relief. But if not, you might want to discuss this with your doctor the next time you visit them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I take many of the second generation meds and have chlorpheniramine (Walmart Equate ChlorTabs) in my arsenal as well, when things get out of hand otherwise.  Max dose is 6 a day, I rarely need more than 2.  Also, good luck Blue, from a Roll Tide fan.</p></div>		</li>
