			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the reply. Is the High Dose one the only high dose one? Are seniors getting just that a high dose vaccine only manufactured by one company?</p>
<p>Edit: It seems to me that Fluzone High Dose is the only high dose vaccine. Made in the USA and China</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although not technically high dose, Fluad is only approved for seniors (people over 65). It uses an adjuvant as opposed to a higher dose. Either one may be given to seniors, depending on the availability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s the only one I’m aware of. It was first approved in 2009 and I believe it was the first, and is still the only, high dose one. So yes I think all seniors are getting the same high dose vaccine, although (at least in the US) they aren’t required to get that one, they can get the normal one if they want for whatever reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know why I never clued in that flu vaccines have brand names. I mean it makes sense it just sounds so dystopian. Plus everyone just refers to it as <em>the</em> flu shot</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does seem a little weird when you think about it. I'm a chemist for a medical diagnostic company and it is odd to think about medicine as manufacturing a product, but that just is how it is. We need to be paid for the time we work to make everything, so it has to be branded and sold like the competing product it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It changes in contents every year in order to keep up with the dominant strains, so it makes sense to have a manufacturer offer a product line with particular characteristics consistent between years depending on price point etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I just got my flu shot, 3 weeks ago? Now I wonder what brand I got. Does CVS only stock vendor A?  Do they even know what stock they have? Will the CVS technician tell me what brand they have? Is one brand better than the other? Should I have asked for a different brand?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you ask they will certainly tell you. I'm not sure if they stock multiple brands, but the real scientific play is to just call them and ask if they can tell you the brand name. Worst case is they tell you that it was one of a handful of brands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They record not only the brand but the lot and expiration date of each vaccine in your record. Typically chain pharmacies stock a couple of different brands - the high dose for seniors, a recombinant one for ppl with egg allergies, etc. If you use the online CVS portal it will probably say the brand name if it shows your rx history.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I had mine done at CVS last Friday in Connecticut and received &quot;AFLURIA QUADRIVALENT 2020-2021&quot;</p></div>		</li>
