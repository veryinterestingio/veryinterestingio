			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert but someone who has suffered a long standing digastric/hyoidial muscle issue. These changes are a result of evolution. Our muscles tenses in our throat, our gloitis raises, the vocal folds restrict some so that our voice changes. This distress in our voices is incredibly noticable, humans are incredibly attuned to changes in tone when it comes to the voice, because it can allow others nearby to recognize our distress and potentially help alleviate. Social interaction can be the most effective way to improve your emotional state. In essence these natural, and unfortunately for me, uncontrollable changes exsist to help others know how we feel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And crucially, a lot of animals don't really cry out in pain. </p>
<p>A rabbit will suffer in complete silence if it's ill, because crying out rarely does any good. The only time they really cry is in case of sudden pain or an attack, probably to warn others in that area of a predator or so. </p>
<p>Instinctual communication is a highly evolved aspect of most species, and will depend on what serves their purpose. Social species will be far more vocal because help might be nearby.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since crying itself is a way to signal distress to other humans, my guess would be that variations to the voice are also useful in signaling the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And related question: Does it typically change with age? I noticed that I don't cry anymore. When I was 20 or 25 I'd occasionally cry when I was sad (usually when I was alone). Now I haven't cried at all in many years. Also not when alone, so that's not a factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn’t cry for years either.  I figured out that I was numb to everything. Completely not phased by much. It wasn’t that I couldn’t cry, it’s just that nothing moved me to cry, not even the saddest thing. Only since 2020 have I started crying again and it’s weird.</p></div>		</li>

<p>scientists think that, along with other physical reactions such as an increased heart rate and slower breathing, our stress hormone- and endorphin-laden tears are there to quickly stabilise your mood</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where would said stress hormone and endorphin in tears act to affect the mood? Won't tears just drain away?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scientists don't think that.  The composition of tears has been repeatedly tested, and none of those products (and none of other, similar products) have been found in them.  No cortisol, no endorphins, no oxytocin, no adrenalin, and so on.  There are changes in some of these in response to a distressing event, independent of crying, but the presence of tears themselves make no difference.  There isn't a great answer yet to why people produce emotional tears.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think anything should be in the tears, it sounds more like that tears are a side effect of this hormone explosion which also ends with hormone - and therefore mood - stabilization</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as stress hormones, I believe it's specifically cortisol. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Won't tears just drain away?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's the point. The idea is that the tears are carrying excess cortisol with them so you are literally crying away the stress.</p>
<p>I'm not really sure about the endorphins though. I know that crying releases endorphins, but I'm not sure whether tears themselves carry endorphins as that would seem counterproductive to me as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the point.  There has never been a study showing <em>any</em> hormones in human tears; they've looked, they're just not there.  Not cortisol, not anything.  The link above is nonsense, and generally why &quot;sources&quot; like this are banned in this sub.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People change as they get older. Crying, being sad is a human EMOTION that we are all keen to knowing, feeling and recognizing. Our amazing human bodies are far from perfect but we can communicate with the slightest twitch or stare. Could you tell when someone is crying is true and real? There are some really good actors out there that study how to fool people on their emotions and get paid millions to do it. A bit off top but interesting.</p></div>		</li>
