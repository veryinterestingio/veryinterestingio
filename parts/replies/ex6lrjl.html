			<div class="markdown"><p>I knew someone who had typically normal eye position - until he was under a lot of stress - then one eye pulled to one side. It gave him the biggest headache. I wondered why he wouldn't patch it then, but i think he was also self conscious so just dealing with it &quot;worked&quot; for him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who had to wear an eye patch for several hours a day in order to &quot;fix&quot; a lazy eye, even the most flexible eye patches are horribly uncomfortable. I ended up using flexible adhesive ones, basically a big bandaid, and even those were fucking horrible.</p>
<p>(more info for anyone who cares: my optometrist said my lazy eye was a true lazy eye, caused by underdeveloped musculature. He made me cover my good eye for most of my waking hours for nearly a year in order to force the lazy eye muscles to have to over compensate to develop the muscles.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amblyopia, It's a genetic aberration in my family. Father had it, I have it and niece and nephew both had it. Luckily they had a minor procedure to correct theirs. I call it Atchaforia. One eye is looking atcha, the other is looking for ya.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have alternating strabismus - i can select which eye I see out of, on the fly - but i only ever see red or blue out of those old-style 3D glasses.  I have no idea what happens with people who see both.  It takes some concentration, but i can 'know' my other eye is seeing something - but i can never identify what that thing is.  it's just a general sense of 'something is there'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have strabismus in both eyes. If I focus especifically in a particular object I can see it perfectly, but everything else I will see double (like two semitransparent copies, and where they meet I will see the solid object. Sometimes they don't even touch) and I get a headache if I do it for a long time.
When I'm not looking at anything at particular I'll see all objects with some kind of semitransparent thing around them, if that makes sense, and in my peripherial vision everything is a mess of semitransparent stuff. </p>
<p>I can't really look at the window while travelling because everything gets confusing and I start feeling nausea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, sorry, is not that a normal way humans see things? For things that not on current &quot;focus distance&quot; (defined by directions of both eyes) you see double images, and distance between doubles depends on how far the object is from &quot;focus distance&quot;. That's the basis of our stereoscopic visual perception, I think?</p>
<p>Also, not be able to see in detail something outside of a small &quot;sweet spot&quot; in the center of our field of view is pretty normal too. The 20/20 vision is only attainable in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fovea_centralis" target="_blank">fovea centralis</a>. They say that you only clearly see an area of about thumbnail's size at arm's length.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alternating strabismus is the mechanism of being able to switch between the two, i dont know what the term is for the brain overriding the eye to prevent you from consciously seeing what the non-selected eye sees.  As far as shooting - I can still hit a target, i mean.. but the lack of true 3d is likely a bigger deal than i think but since i'll never know what real depth is like i don't worry about it</p></div>		</li>
