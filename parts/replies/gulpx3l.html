			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah yes, the lovely credit score. A metric for businesses to gauge how reliable a financial IV drip you are that somehow became linked with your worth as an employee or tenant. A score that old people didn’t have to deal with until they were established, but can use to harp on younger folks not yet established. One that proves how useless you are if you budget correctly and pay everything up front and on time. What a lovely system we have.</p>
<p>Unfortunately a necessary one to play into if you want to do anything beyond living in your parent’s house.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uh. A high credit score means you’re less likely to be a money drain. It means you’re reliable when it comes to paying people back. </p>
<p>Would you loan money to someone who already owes money to another person? Or would you loan it to someone who has consistently paid back their loans.</p></div>		</li>
