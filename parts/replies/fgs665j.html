			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not clear on what you're asking in the first questions, but I can answer the last one. </p>
<p>You can get a clear image with a pinhole camera, at the cost of brightness. A pinhole camera is literally just a pin size hole in a piece of thick paper. Hold the hole in front of the strip and the torchlight will create an image with everything in focus, but it will lose significant intensity. And with torchlight there might not be enough intensity to begin with. </p>
<p>This works because the only light rays that get through the hole are the parallel ones, so they will replicate the image. Most of the light does not get through though, hence the drop in intensity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Essentially, just a tinted illumination level.  Silhouettes would be as large and out of focus as to be unrecognizable, but you could probably detect if a half of your FOV got blocked -- and which half.</p></div>		</li>
