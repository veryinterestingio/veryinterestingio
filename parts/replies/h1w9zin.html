			<div class="markdown"><p>You seem to have misunderstood the talk page you linked (once i figured out your incorrect URL), and phase transitions in general.</p>
<p>The cooling effect of the water column is irrelevant because it is possible for ice to exist at 4c, in fact it can exist at hundreds of degrees. The pressure merely needs to be high enough.</p>
<p>As you can see from the phase change chart here: <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/346750/phase-diagram-of-water" target="_blank">https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/346750/phase-diagram-of-water</a></p>
<p>The type of ice in a suffiently tall water column, at earth ocean temperatures, would be Ice VI. The ocean would need to be 4 times as deep. This ice is denser than water, so would form a floor to any deeper oceans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're not wrong about water being densest at 4C <em>under earth conditions</em>,  though. Any sufficiently thick ice on earth melts under pressure, a sufficiently deep body of water (a few dozen meters if memory serves) doesn't freeze all the way down for the same reason.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's nothing wrong with the URL I provided, is there?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FWIW, I think that the fact that water is densest at 4Â°C (under normal conditions, etc) is one of the most remarkable facts about nature.  It's why ice floats.  Most substances aren't like this.</p>
<p>What would the world be like if it were not so?  Would life have even evolved?  Amazing to think about...</p>
<p>...to add to this, this makes water 's freeze/thaw cycles an incredible erosive force.  Water seeps into cracks of rocks, freezes, and the expansion splits apart the rocks. Gives us a very dynamic earth surface, geologically speaking.</p></div>		</li>
