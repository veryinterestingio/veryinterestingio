			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very bad analogy. I will focus on a single aspect: sleep is like the hibernate mode on a computer. That is completely incorrect. </p>
<p>In hibernate mode, the computer is not actively computing anything. By contrast, the brain during sleep is extremely active. The phase of sleep associated with dreams is characterized by awake-like activity. Further, the brain during sleep is actively reorganising and encoding memories acquired during the day. This is the completely polar opposite of the hibernation analogy in computers. </p>
<p>If you want an analogy for this, I'd say sleep (depending on it's stage) could be analogous to disk defragmentation and error checking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think we're really stretching this analogy. If you consider the user as consciousness, your could say that, sure. Except in this analogy the user sees the screensaver and might remember bits of it, but is also pinned to the desk -- dream sleep is characterised with motionlessness (Thalamus is deactivated during REM sleep).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it doesn't answer the question is my guess. It's a cool analogy, but I assume OP knows the conceptual differences between the 3 states and he specifically asked for physiological ones</p></div>		</li>

<p>Although it's more like the hibernate mode, really.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not really. Hibernation mode (as in, suspend-to-disk) fully turns off the computer, whereas your body still consumes energy when you're asleep. If anything, sleeping is more akin to taking a server temporarily off-line for maintenance: updates, reorganizing files, those kinds of things. Your brain does a lot of reorganization during REM sleep.</p></div>		</li>
