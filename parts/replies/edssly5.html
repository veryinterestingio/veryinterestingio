			<div class="markdown"><p>So it would be possible to keep matter and antimatter closely together with no annihilation happening if you make sure that they have no quark type in common?</p>
<p>Not sure if any kind of matter/antimatter combination exists which satisfies that condition.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are three types and have been widely studied.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, there are Mesons. They're Quark-Antiquark pairs so it should be possible but at least afaik, they can destroy themselves as well, suggesting that maybe they aren't stable? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we want a system that lasts long enough for a human to observe, the short answer is no, because most things only last a tiny fraction of a second.
Unfortunately, the list of stable baryons (3 quark particles) is very short, it's just the proton and the neutron (a free neutron isn't stable, but lasts about 10 minutes).  These are made by combining up and down quarks. The other quarks are generally too heavy to stick around. Since electric charge has to come to a whole number, we don't have any other way to make light 3-quark particles.<br />
As others have said, there's a class of particles (mesons) which are charge balanced by containing antiquarks, but like with the baryons, there are very few ways to work with just the up and down quarks. A pion (up + anti-down) is the only particle made like this that cannot self-annihilate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well they do matter, but protons are composite (of quarks), not elementary.</p>
<p>popscience most of the mischaracterises annihilation though. They often give the impression it's particle + anti particle - &gt; photon(s) which is not generally correct. </p></div>		</li>

<p>One more negative pion than positive pions, typically.</p>
<p>Pions are the most common result of proton/antiproton and neutron/antineutron annihilation reactions as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true, but the quark quantum numbers for proton/antiproton and neutron/antineutron all cancel, so in principle, they could decay to <em>only</em> photons, although it's a very weak branch. This is not possible for proton/antineutron or neutron/antiproton, there <em>must</em> be some quarks in the final state. That's what I'm saying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, if we look at processes too rare to measure them you could have photons plus leptons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you assume only strong interactions, then yes. But a (anti)neutron will naturally decay into a (anti)proton through the weak force, and a proton/antiproton <em>can</em> fully annihilate all their quarks, so there exists some process(es) that allow all the quarks to &quot;annihilate&quot;. Granted, the cross section for that will be pretty small since the weak force is much much weaker than the strong forces involved in the annihilation, but saying there <em>must</em> be quarks in the final state is not quite correct (but there does need to be either quarks <em>or</em> leptons). </p></div>		</li>
