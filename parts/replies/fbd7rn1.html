			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. Back when I had real problems with acne, I tried quitting sugar and to some extent dairy, and it had a noticeable effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep - my dermatologist treated my acne by prescribing Retina A Micro and putting me off dairy. This fixed my acne. I don’t think my dermatologist would be one-half MD and one-half anecdotal treatment; some literature has to support it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is just so untrue. I've been hearing this for years. Just because there isn't enough research and it varies person to person, does not mean diet and getting pimples aren't directly related. If I have a piece of chocolate I will always get at least one pimple. I have clear skin and rarely eat chocolate. Every single time. Will it be the same for everybody? No. Could I replicate this 100 times for science and never touch my face and have the same cleaning of the face, and still get my required pimple? Yes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same, except it’s dairy for me. I can stop eating dairy for a month, no acne. Drink a few glasses of milk and eat a cheese pizza, bam, pimples. I actually experimented with this for about a year to see if I was “just imagining things”, and it turns out I wasn’t. I’ve heard the hormones in dairy could be the culprit, but who knows. There’s gotta be something in other foods that sets it off for certain people, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>100% yes, I can demonstrably prove that chocolate gives me acne every single time I have it. It literally takes two days to test. Scientists, hit me up.</p></div>		</li>
