			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the real answer. On a basic level, smart phones requires the same hardware as a laptop, but smartphones need this hardware in a smaller factor form. 3Gb ram module in a smart phone has to be A LOT smaller than a 3Gb ram in a laptop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also economy of scale.  Way more people buying any smart phone than any lap top.  So budget lap tops have worse performance than phones that carriers literally give away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The real answer is everyone here is gullible and complicit in paying ridiculous prices for something that doesn't cost nearly as much as advertised. You're paying a premium for no reason other than the market supports it. The market supports it only because people who buy ridiculously expensive smartphones tend to not care about anything except the status symbol of it. They're the same crowd who buys shitty Macbooks for twice the price as a better performing windows laptop.</p></div>		</li>

<p>that said, making a direct comparison between smartphones and laptops is like comparing dogs to horses</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A $500 desktop is a $800 laptop.</p>
<p>The laptop is more expensive, even though it has the exact same performance, and some of the exact same parts, but you're paying more for mobility. I bought a $600 laptop for school, and it has a 1080p display and a basic nVidia GPU for very light gaming. I could build a desktop that performs better for that price, maybe $50-100 more depending on what route I take (nVidia vs AMD, mini ATX or a full size case, etc.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think anyone disputes this. A laptop is basically a desktop with an added fee for the mobility.</p>
<p>I bring my laptop to work and back every day, definitely would not have got as much use from a desktop. It cost more for sure, but it was worth it. If I didn't need to, I wouldn't have paid the extra and would've been okay with a desktop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe I'm getting old but it's crazy to think about it. If one would choose to (you'd be crazy though), they could do most everything on a smartphone now, that could be done on a laptop.</p>
<p>There is the full office suite on phones, multiple email clients, ability to surf the internet and get the same content, photo and video editing, ability to add storage and save files and even play some decent games.</p>
<p>That said, using a smartphone for things like writing an essay with word, is probably going to be a hassle but it's possible. I would still much rather use the appropriate device. It just blows my mind that even just ten years ago, most of the things that are now possible with smartphones were still just a pipe dream.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can do everything on my smartphone that I do on my laptop. The only things I've had to do on my laptop recently were cancel a subscription that you weren't allowed to cancel even in desktop mode on your phone. And change the settings on a discord server that it wouldn't let me change on the app. But those were both optimization problems with the service, and had nothing to do with the power of my phone's computer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Media editing is still kind of impractical to do on a phone, as is any sufficiently complex task. Wouldn't want to do any CAD work or 3D modeling on a phone if I had the option to use something larger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just because you can doesn't mean you should. Trying to do my job on a smart phone would be pretty painful. </p>
<p>It's still a very useful tool that compliments my laptop. And even on occasion I've used it to check a server or even reboot something while I'm on the train home but for any heavy lifting I'm using my laptop. Even if I'm tethering from my phone.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If I've got a spark of inspiration I'm not going to wait till I get home to type it out on my mechanical keyboard. I'll whip out the phone and get the idea down before it dissolves into the wind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer. </p>
<p>The engineering on smart phones is also more constrained and therefore requires a higher price point (ie hd capacitive touch screen that is scratch and slightly impact resistant) vs a simpler panel display).</p></div>		</li>
