			<div class="markdown"><p>German here.</p>
<p>It's generally legal on the Autobahn, if not limited locally by road signs, which is the case in about 50% of the entire Autobahn grid.</p>
<p>Also it is nearly impossible to go very fast safely. As the Autobahn is used by other, much slower drivers and large trucks going about 50 mph, causing other cars to overtake at about 70 mph. </p>
<p>It's not like people overtaking a truck at 70 mph can see in the that there's someone coming in hot at 130 mph half a mile away. So they change langes and basically force you to decellerate.</p>
<p>Unless you drive on a sunday morning at 2 am where most people are at home and trucks aren't allowed to drive. Then you can go fast as fuck, but that's one tiny niché that isn't really worth paying twice the price on a car just because it can go much faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>German highway discipline is superb - I was in the back as my best friends boyfriend did 250kph from the Austrian border to middle Hessen.</p>
<p>Everyone stuck to the inside lane and only pulled out to overtake, leaving the outside lane virtually free the entire way.</p>
<p>Terrifying/exhilarating experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the custom of fast drivers (150+ mph) to flash high beam over the horizon so you know what's coming in case you are for some reason in left-most lane. But they have no issue slowing down if you can't move out of their way. Generally, I find the driving culture there relaxing (living east from Germany).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm from the UK and I took my 20 year old Ford Fiesta on a road trip to Budapest a couple of years ago. I loved the German roads as I was passing by. I always felt terrible for the other drivers when I was on the autobahn since my car can't do more than about 75mph without rattling madly. No matter how careful I was that nobody was approaching as I overtook a lorry, there would be a fancy Audi or equivalent directly behind be before I managed to get back in the right lane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It happens. We know it, everybody knows it. I won't bully you (flashing headlights or signaling left) just because you're overtaking. Sure I might be pissed because I'll lose momentum (but honestly I low-key enjoy being pissed about this &quot;issue&quot; because it means I can drive that fast lol) but whatever. At least that's how I see it. When you're checking your mirrors and if you're careful and aware of your surroundings you're doing everything right.</p>
<p>If I'm very close and someone pulls out, I might flash my headlights because it's likely he just didn't see me (or didn't check his mirror at all). So it's more of a &quot;hey man I'm driving pretty fast here, please go back to your lane let me pass, k thx bye&quot;.</p>
<p>But sure, there's a lot of assholes out there bullying everything they can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The legal minimum speed your vehicle must be able to do to drive on the Autobahn is 61 km/h ~ 38 mph. Trucks are allowed a maximum of 80 km/h, basically all of them exceed that by 10 without consecuences. But it really, REALLY sucks when one truck overtakes another at a delta-v of about 0.5 km/h, causing the traffic behind to pile up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You should have it serviced. That's not normal.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Same with the A7 &amp; A2 on the sections without limits, obviously it gets more problematic when there is moderate traffic, although even then 130-160km/h isn't exactly unusual. The issue for me tends to be that if you are driving at 160+ it does require a lot of attention and planning ahead and so is somewhat more tiring than driving more slowly...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, 180 km/h is doable outside of particular heavy traffic quite often. </p>
<p>I mean if you are not sticking behind a large truck, you'll be going about 130 km/h almost by default.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not allowed everywhere in Germany. Most highways are now at 120 or 130 kph.</p>
<p>In fact, many are at 80 or 60 kph because there's constructions everywhere. And in Germany that means you have many kilometers of blocked road for a very very long time. I'm talking months or years in many cases.</p>
<p>Also, the parts where it's unlimited, most of times you cannot go that fast anyway. Reasons: </p>
<p>Idiots that go even faster and force you to change right again.</p>
<p>You cannot see that much ahead (compared to US highways that I've driven on), also it's more curvy and often goes up and down. That makes it quite dangerous to go fast.</p>
<p>Also, in general, our streets are much narrower and the traffic is often very dense outside cities (MUCH more than in the US).</p>
<p>So yeah, driving on German 'unlimited' highways isn't exactly what people might picture it to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think anyone was saying that Germany is a speed-limitless wild west - just that it would be possible (and legal) for anyone in Europe to take their car to Germany and take it right up to the redline - thus the speedo has to show the real speed</p></div>		</li>
