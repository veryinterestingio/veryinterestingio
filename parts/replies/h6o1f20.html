			<div class="markdown"><p>It may be because of the adenine receptors combined with melatonin spikes and energy being priorities elsewhere in the body, resulting in a mellow feeling that leads one to be tired, not ADHD, if you genuinely think itâ€™s ADHD then you have some reading to do on what ADHD is and function, neurologically speaking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never liked coffee. I would always fall asleep like 30 minutes after drinking it so it never helped me with late night exams.</p>
<p>Sex did
After sex I could stay up all night. It got me so wired.</p>
<p>I still don't get why men are always portrayed as falling asleep after sex. My experience is not that at all</p></div>		</li>
