			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it's pretty heady stuff. To be specific it means that Yedidia constructed a Turing machine that:</p>
<p>1) Assuming standard mathematical set theory is <em>consistent</em>, it will run forever. </p>
<p>2) It can't be proved to run forever under standard mathematical set theory. </p>
<p>Thus, the behavior of the machine is undecidable. This  has some really fascinating and really deep consequences for the concept of computability. </p>
<p>Scott Aaronson keeps a fairly popular blog where he wrote at length about why this is such a cool result. I'll just quote one little passage:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2725" target="_blank">https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2725</a></p>
<p><em>But the [Busy Beaver] function has a second amazing property: namely, it’s a perfectly well-defined integer function, and yet once you fix the axioms of mathematics, only finitely many values of the function can ever be proved, even in principle.  To see why, consider again a Turing machine M that halts if and only if there’s a contradiction in ZF set theory.  Clearly such a machine could be built, with some finite number of states k.  But then ZF set theory can’t possibly determine the value of BB(k) (or BB(k+1), BB(k+2), etc.), unless ZF is inconsistent!  For to do so, ZF would need to prove that M ran forever, and therefore prove its own consistency, and therefore be inconsistent by Gödel’s Theorem.</em></p></div>		</li>
