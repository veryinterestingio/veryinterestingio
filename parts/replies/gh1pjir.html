			<div class="markdown"><p>Weâ€™ve actually seen it happen live over the last hundred years. Japanese fishermen throw back crabs that look like samurai faces, so those crabs have more offspring than the ones that just look like crabs and are eaten, and over time itâ€™s gotten harder to find crabs of that species that donâ€™t look like samurai.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also a species of moth, I think in the UK, that looked like tree bark and rested on said trees. As the Industrial Revolution geared up and everything was covered in soot, the moths that were darker survived and the lighter ones were eaten. And now itâ€™s starting to swing back the other way with the shift to cleaner energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good hypothetical example, but it's not actually true. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heikegani" target="_blank">Humans don't eat samurai-face crabs</a>, so they have no reason to put pressure on them. Similar patterns are found in fossil taxa.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't know how to form the pattern (unless you're talking about built camouflage like animals using shells or leaf litter).</p>
<p>It's how evolution works. Animals that produce sexually look different from their parents, mutations happen etc. Those mutations that hinder an animal mating successfully have less kids that mutation survives least.</p>
<p>Remember there's two types of pressures</p>
<p>Natural selection: increases your chances of survival, which means you're more likely to live long enough to have many kids.</p>
<p>Sexual selection: increases your chance of fuck fuck which means more kids.</p>
<p>They're not necessarily the same.</p>
<p>For example large antlers don't help survival. More resources to have, harder to run away, etc. So natural selection would benefit small or no antlers.</p>
<p>BUT those who can have large antlers are real signals of strength and nourishment. Things that would be good to breed with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And what's interesting is that this can happen by very small changes each time. The initial mutation might just be something that puts two dots on their backside, which don't really look like eyes, but make predators a <em>tiny</em> bit less likely to target them because it very slightly triggers the &quot;they can see me&quot; instinct. That gives a reproductive advantage to animals with that mutation.</p>
<p>Then another mutation might make the dots look a little bit bigger or more like eyes, and those organisms have an advantage. Repeat for many generations and this can lead to patterns that look very much like eyes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Big changes need a huge amount of coincidence to happen, so generally it will be small and gradual steps. And each step has to be more successful than the previous one.</p></div>		</li>
