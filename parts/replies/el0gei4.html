<p>But they are not the ones making policy, as you suggest. Congress has historically played a very important role in determining drug policy in the U.S., and we ultimately think that our research and that of other researchers should be brought to the attention of Congressional lawmakers. That can help to animate discussion about building drug policies that are the most effective in terms of outcome and in terms of cost to taxpayers. </p>
<p>But we are not experts in that realm, and it takes time, effort and savvy to find the right policy openings to have those much-needed conversations. The experts are those groups who have been dedicated to getting good evidence into the hands of lawmakers for years. For domestic drug issues, that includes the <a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/" target="_blank">Drug Policy Alliance</a> and <a href="https://ssdp.org/" target="_blank">Students for Sensible Drug Policy</a>, and in international arenas that means groups like <a href="https://idpc.net/profile/count-the-costs" target="_blank">IDPC</a>, and the <a href="http://www.globalcommissionondrugs.org/" target="_blank">Global Commission on Drug Policy</a>, among others. Our job as scientists is to do the best science we can, and put it into the hands of those who can best chaperone it into drug policy reform. That’s been our approach so far, and we’re in it for the long haul!</p></div>		</li>
