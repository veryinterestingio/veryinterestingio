			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a subscriber/contributor to Australia's flu tracker project (<a href="https://flutracking.net" target="_blank">flutracking.net</a>).  Their chart shows that the incidence of flu symptoms in Australia and New Zealand is way lower than at this point in any of the last five years. About 0.2% versus 2.4% average.</p>
<p>Basically, lockdown is probably saving extra lives in addition to the ones that could have been lost to COVID-19.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When the covid knockdown started we basically stopped seeing anyone come in for minor respiratory issues.  We went from roughly a dozen admissions for childhood cold to basically zero. Of course, our hospital is disgustingly conservative when it comes to admitting kids with cold but some actually did warrant admission. We weren't seeing those either</p>
<p>From the adult side, they saw a significant drop in people coming in for chest pain and loss of consciousness. About 90-95% of chest pain rule outs end up being nothing heart related. But they weren't seeing the real cases either. </p>
<p>So basically, COVID scared people into not bringing themselves/kids in for the most minor and insignificant issues, but also the big ones as well</p></div>		</li>
