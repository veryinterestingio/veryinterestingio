			<div class="markdown"><p>(ECE) The Geologic Time Scale is curated very carefully using a very painstaking protocol that involves special working groups and voting on proposals at different levels of The International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) and the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS).</p>
<p>I am a member of the <a href="http://quaternary.stratigraphy.org/working-groups/anthropocene/" target="_blank">ICS working group on the Anthropocene</a>, which should be making its formal proposal to add the Anthropocene as the most recent epoch of geologic time. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, most of the 38 members of the group support an Anthropocene epoch starting in 1950. In my view, and that of many others outside and even some inside the group, that is not a scientifically accurate way to represent the start of human transformation of Earth. Our recent <a href="https://theconversation.com/surveying-archaeologists-across-the-globe-reveals-deeper-and-more-widespread-roots-of-the-human-age-the-anthropocene-122008" target="_blank">Conversation piece</a> also discusses this issue.</p>
<p>And we also remarked on this in Nature in 2016. Hereâ€™s a <a href="https://theconversation.com/scientists-still-dont-understand-the-anthropocene-and-theyre-going-about-it-the-wrong-way-70017" target="_blank">Conversation piece about this</a>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I know they're obsessed with radiogenic nuclides from surface detonations, but why won't they get on board with the increase of C-13 from the burning of coal that started in the 1800s??   It should tickle all their fun parts :P</p>

<p>sincerely, undergrad geologist  :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The buzz-wood term Anthropocene is a trendy idea but we already have the Holocene which essentially the same thing as it coincides with the widespread populating of the earth by humans in the current warm climate period.  As this AMA postulates, human transformation started around 10,000 yrs ago.  No need for another name.</p></div>		</li>
