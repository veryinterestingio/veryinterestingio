			<div class="markdown"><p>I've scanned for a few answers and not really seen one which tackles whether the loss of motivation to do brain stimulating activities can lead to the cognitive decline though. Like if someone is depressed for 10+ years let's say and a symptom of their depression is very little time outdoors or physical activity, could that not in man cases lead to actual neuro degeneration? Perhaps I'm misunderstanding your post though in which case my apologies!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you sure?</p>
<p>I mean I've seen enough random headlines and smaller summaries regarding physical changes to the brain in relation to depression.</p>
<p>One random example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A sample of 24 women ranging in age from 23 to 86 years with a history of recurrent major depression, but no medical comorbidity, and 24 case-matched controls underwent MRI scanning. </p>
<p>Subjects with a history of depression (post-depressed) had smaller hippocampal volumes bilaterally than controls. Post-depressives also had smaller amygdala core nuclei volumes, and these volumes correlated with hippocampal volumes. In addition, post-depressives scored lower in verbal memory, a neuropsychological measure of hippocampal function, suggesting that the volume loss was related to an aspect of cognitive functioning. </p>
<p>This suggests that repeated stress during recurrent depressive episodes may result in cumulative hippocampal injury as reflected in volume loss.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Depression duration but not age predicts hippocampal volume loss in medically healthy women with recurrent major depression. | PMID: 10366636</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And another:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For 38 female outpatients, the total time each had been in a depressive episode was divided into days during which the patient was receiving antidepressant medication and days during which no antidepressant treatment was received. Hippocampal gray matter volumes were determined by high resolution magnetic resonance imaging and unbiased stereological measurement.</p>
<p>Longer durations during which depressive episodes went untreated with antidepressant medication were associated with reductions in hippocampal volume. There was no significant relationship between hippocampal volume loss and time depressed while taking antidepressant medication or with lifetime exposure to antidepressants.</p>
