			<div class="markdown"><p>No offense intended, but don't you worry that the recipient is only just feeling obliged to be close and friends with you because of you donating your organ..I've just been in situations where I felt like I could tell whether someone was being friends due to percieved duty or truly friends because of shared interests or moral similarities..Ya know? Not trying to burst your bubble,just wanted to see if you figured a way to truly tell in situations like yours.. Thanks and good on you no matter what!☺️</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like I would be able to tell. He lives apx 300 miles away so maybe “close friend” was a misnomer. We enjoy getting together when the opportunity arises and we frequently check in to see how the other is doing. However, I think we’ll always share a kinship. We do have a number of shared interests and morals, but I genuinely care about him and feel connected to him. As far as the way to tell, I guess we never really know the innermost workings of anyone else’s mind, but the connection is real to me and that’s sufficient. Thank you! </p></div>		</li>
