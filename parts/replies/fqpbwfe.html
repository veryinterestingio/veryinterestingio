			<div class="markdown"><p>Are there any other innate responses to already infected cells besides NK cells? I was under the assumption that innate immune cells are critical in attracting adaptive immune cells to a place of infection. I don’t have great deal of experience with innate immune function.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an NK immunologist, so I'm probably pretty biased when I say that NK cells are the primary innate immune defense against viruses, but in general that is how immunology thinks of them. The other cell type that comes to mind are the plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC for short), which are nicely reviewed here  <a href="https://www.cell.com/immunity/pdf/S1074-7613(18)30575-2.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.cell.com/immunity/pdf/S1074-7613(18)30575-2.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.cell.com/immunity/pdf/S1074-7613(18)30575-2.pdf</a></a>. Essentially, they dump a bunch of type-I interferon when they sense a virus infection kicking off. Type-I interferon does play a major role in recruiting NK cells and other adaptive immune cells like you said, but it also has some direct action against the virus itself. I like to think of type-I interferon as an analogy to a firefighting &quot;back burning&quot; strategy - a burst of type-I interferon in an area will shut down and/or kill the cells in that area (through PKR activation -  <a href="https://mmbr.asm.org/content/70/4/1032" target="_blank"><a href="https://mmbr.asm.org/content/70/4/1032" target="_blank">https://mmbr.asm.org/content/70/4/1032</a></a>), which makes it much harder for the virus to spread since all the neighboring cells it was about to infect are now either dead or not producing (much) protein anymore.</p>
<p>It's probably also worth mentioning that NK cells themselves act a lot more like adaptive cells than was initially appreciated, and when they encounter a virus infection, they can not only recruit classic adaptive cells, but also can recruit a bunch of innate cells (especially macrophages) to help them clean it up. So in that way, lots of different innate cells are directly involved in viral clearance, even if it wasn't them that initially detected the virus.</p>
<p>Also note that our understanding of innate immunity is constantly and rapidly evolving, so a bunch of this might be wrong already or will soon be - it's part of what makes it such a fun field to be in!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Should be called NBK (natural born killer) cells if you ask me but I suppose I'll have to discover something first if I want to name it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is your view on ILCs (Innate lymphoid cells)? They were the up-and-coming type in the field when I did my MSc. Seemed to create large amounts of attracting cytokines with very very few absolute cell numbers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to read more about the innate response, you can look up Interferon and Interferon Stimulated Genes.</p>
<p>All (or most) cells in the body detect and respond to pathogens (viruses, fungus, bacteria) based on generic patterns that are common to these pathogens. Think RNA/DNA, components of the bacterial and fungal cell walls or metabolites they produce. </p>
<p>Detection of these pathogens activates a signaling cascade which results in the production of interferons and other cytokines. These help facilitate the adaptive response but also lead to the production of proteins which help immediately combat the infection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was think more along the lines of already infected cells. For example infected cells are made to down regulate Mhc class I expression during some viral infections and this change is detected by NK cells. So I guess more along those lines, unless you think it would work during a ‘budding’ stage of the viral production cycle.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just an aside, but perhaps a helpful example of contrast: celiac rock star Dr. Alessio Fasano's research indicates that non-celiac gluten sensitivity is a misapplication of the innate immune response, whereas celiac disease is an adaptive immune response that produces antibodies to gluten that can be counted in a lab for the purpose of celiac diagnosis.   </p>
<p>There are no definitive tests for non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), but the symptoms and the range of patients' experience of severity are almost identical.   </p>
<p>It's believed there is some epithelial (lining of intestine) damage with NCGS, but not nearly as much as with celiac disease, which causes a huge increase in levels of zonulin that leads to villous blunting (damage to the hair-like villi in the intestinal lining.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. I mean responses in terms of our innate immune system. I was looking for non-lymphocyte responses. I wasn’t referring to anything inane or inherent if that what you were thinking.</p></div>		</li>
