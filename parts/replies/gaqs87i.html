			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think it’s quite the same with plastic because you’re not really folding in a lot of air bubbles. It might have something to do with warping the structure of the plastic.
Things have colour because the molecular structure can absorb some light wavelengths and reflect other wavelengths. The different wavelengths of the reflected light gives you colour. If you warp the structure of plastic then it doesn’t trap light in the same way. The reason why plastics go white instead of other colours is because you get white if your structure bounces all light away and if you’re bending and warping a plastic so crudely, you’re not going to get a structure that can differentiate one wavelength from another.</p>
<p>A (very loose) analogy of this is like those baby toys where you put shapes through holes on top of a box.
Blue is like throwing a bunch of block shapes at the holes and finding that triangles can get in through the triangle hole but can’t get out again. Square shapes bounce off the top of the box and that’s blue</p>
<p>White is like taking the whole lid off so that all the blocks can go in and out again. </p>
<p>Bending plastic is like kicking the box. You’re not going to kick a perfect triangle into the lid and turn plastic blue by bending it. You’re probably going to knock the lid off and get white.
This is a very very loose analogy. Pls verify with an expert if you want a proper answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the plastic, but most are clear or off white in their unpigmented forms. So when you bend it and it goes white, you're usually causing damage very near the surface that reflects on light before it can get to the pigment in the bulk material. (Or if the material is stretched, you get more surface area for the same amount of pigment, and the color gets less saturated)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also why milk is white. The fat and oils still don't mix, but with the help of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casein" target="_blank">casein</a> and calcium phosphate, the oil forms tiny little &quot;bubbles&quot; of oil in the water.</p></div>		</li>
