Hundreds of miles of this. Not flat like Iraq. Ground war is not possible. Or rather, not winnable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I'm aware. Do I seem like someone that doesn't know what they're talking about?</p>
<p>That is exactly why a war with Iran would likely be almost exclusively aerial. That would easily be enough to cripple the country economically and win the war, however it might not be enough to topple the regime and achieve all the US' objectives.</p>
<p>It's also exactly why I said if it were going to happen it would be <em>after</em> an extensive air campaign, probably months or years. Crossing Shatt-al-Arab would be the first hurdle, then taking Ahvaz, and <em>then</em> traversing the Zagros mountains. This would certainly be doable and a ground war is absolutely not unwinnable at all, that is a silly thing to suggest and totally incorrect. However, it would be extremely difficult and could mean high US casualties. Hence why it probably wouldn't be attempted, as public sentiment towards a costly war would outweigh desire to see the regime toppled. Most objectives would be achieved in the air so it wouldn't likely be worth it.</p>
<p>It's also entirely possible that Iranian troops surrender long before US forces close in on Tehran. Estimates for the Iraqi war predicted high casualties in the tens of thousands, however Iraqi troops ended up surrendering much earlier than thought and so it was only around a thousand in the end. Entirely possible you'd see the same in Iran after months of heavy bombing and blockades.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im gonna add a bit of context for people passing through on why Saudi Arabia is such a valuable US ally in the region, since I often see people on reddit misunderstand why they are. It is not their control of massive supplies of oil, but the fact that they are a stable regime (not necessarily friendly on human rights, BUT very little chance of power struggles or frequent changes in governance), and the fact that they have a consistent attitude towards America. This makes it our most powerful zone of influence in the Middle East, much more so than Israel because Israel attracts hate of other nations in the region.</p></div>		</li>
