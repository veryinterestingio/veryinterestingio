			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s standard practice derived from the fact trucks were originally 2 wheel drive only and those wheels were in the back directly under the load you were expected to be able to carry with it. Cars have mainly switched to front drive because the weight of a car is the motor so it’s better to have the drive wheels under that. So an all wheel drive car usually runs front only until it detects slipping then rear wheels engage whereas a truck operates as rear drive until the 4 wheel drive option is chosen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A FWD layout is beneficial because it is cheaper and easier to produce. There are less components to use compared to a front engine / RWD setup and the efficiency is better due to less energy loss in the drivetrain. Having a large weight imbalance between the front and rear axle is not usually beneficial. The extra weight might help in northern climates during icy conditions, but other then that, it's not really an advantage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do they seriously walk the chain off and on the sprocket? The two chain-driven cases I had both used dog clutches to engage the front drive. The gear-drive case I currently have also uses a dog clutch. I can't imagine that any transfer case uses a single-width chain that would even be capable of walking off a sprocket without breaking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha Dude this is an explain like I'm five sub lol. The actual mechanic of disengaging the 4wheel drive can be explained in greater detail elsewhere in aore technical sub, but yes the chain doesn't literally walk off the gear. That would be madness when it comes to alignment between the 2 sprockets mixed with moving parts. It's actually more of placing a gear inside of the already spinning chain on a gear and engaging the power of the driveline </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trucks often use solid axles, especially in the rear, because they are stronger, simpler in operation and maintenance, and cheaper than an equivalent independent suspension setup.  Solid rear axles are generally stronger than solid front axles because they don't need to steer, so if you're going to send all the power to one axle it makes more sense to choose the rear (non-steer) axle.  It's also cheaper to build powered non-steering axles, so if you're going to make 2WD and 4WD versions of the same vehicle, it makes sense to always power the rear axle and add a powered front axle only on the 4WD version.  However, this all sacrifices ride quality, so for light trucks and modern SUVs that are being used more and more as passenger vehicles and less for cargo hauling or off-road travel, solid axles are being abandoned and AWD is becoming more common than 4WD.</p>
<p>Front axles on many 4WD vehicles, especially older ones, have U-joints in them instead of CV joints, which makes power delivery jerky.  Rear axles don't need U-joints since they don't steer.  U-joints don't travel at a constant velocity when they are turned, which is hard on the driveline if you're in a high-traction situation.  This is why you shouldn't use part-time 4WD on dry pavement.</p>
<p>The rear driveline on most 4WD vehicles is longer, which allows for better (smaller) angles in the driveshaft.  This is especially important for driveshafts without CV joints (two U-joints make one CV joint, but only if they are operating at the same angle).</p></div>		</li>
