			<div class="markdown"><p>Is the left-to-right orientation of letters and words a minor detail? Because sometimes when I wake up and look at my phone or some other text, it's all gibberish until I'm just a little bit more awake.</p>
<p>I have grogginess induced dyslexia. It's pretty hilarious honestly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's crazy. Most days I wake up super alert. It's awesome when I have to get up early, but it sucks because I wake up once or twice every night and it's hard to get back to sleep.</p>
<p>Also on some days that I do have to get up early, my superpower disappears and I'm super groggy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wake up alert if I've gotten a great deal of sleep the night before. Which is to say, considerably more than anyone <strong>ever</strong> lets me get (including myself). What with having a job, a three year old, and a video game habit that I will give up when I die. </p>
<p>Note: I still get enough sleep, am not depressed, and don't get tired during the day, so my current routine is sustainable, if only slightly uncomfortable most mornings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can teach yourself to stay slow and sleepy. Try to catch yourself before your brain clicks into gear and concentrate only on your breath in and out. Say slowly to yourself 'breath in, breath out' with each breath (or something equally mindless)  and you'll fall back to sleep easier. </p>
<p>I used to have the same problem, but since I've practised repeating the mantra, I fall asleep much easier and am only awake for the time it takes to pee (I have a fitbit, so I can see how long I'm awake for). Happy sleeps to you friend!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re probably like most people, and you use the back part of your brain to read. When you wake up groggy because you interrupted your REM sleep, you won’t be able to read yet because the back of your brain is less active in that phase. </p>
<p>Dreams also occur during REM sleep, which is why most people can’t read in their dreams:
