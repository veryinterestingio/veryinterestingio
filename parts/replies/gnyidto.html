<p>That's what sparked <a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/news/cal-fire-faulty-pge-tree-clearance-caused-3-northern-california-wildfires/" target="_blank">several of the California fires</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. In the California summer fires, high demand due to high temperatures caused the lines to heat up and droop/sag more than normal.</p>
<p>In that case, rather than the weather bringing vegetation down on to the lines, the weather brought the lines down onto the vegetation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is only sorta correct, the core problem was privatization and de-regulation, maintenance costs money and California wasnt forcing the electric companies to actually do maintenance, so you wound up with a lot of power lines that where already in trouble.   </p>
<p>And a lot of trees that simply weren't being trimmed back to a safe distance.   </p>
<p>The high temp causing sagging was the final straw, but if the companies had done basic maintenance that effect was planned for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything you said makes sense for more northern climates.  In this particular case, Texas didn't actually get that much ice/snow.  Here in DFW, we got maybe 3-4&quot; and that was when the temps were 0-10F, so it was very light/fluffy.  It wasn't mechanical issues with vegetation on the power lines but the temp itself that caused the problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True but OP was extremely general and didn't specify an area. </p>
<p>I would assume that places like LA and Mineappolis conversely aren't as well prepared for days of +100 degree weather and while things may not freeze up there would definitely be load drop or cycling if everyone has their ACs running full blast to get them back at 70</p>
<p>Additionally in warmer places winterizing your grid in a place that rarely gets to freezing probably doesn't matter as much as it does in places like the Mid Atlantic as the temperatures here more frequently fluctuate. </p>
<p>Hence partially why the event is ongoing in Texas it sounds like it isn't just the power companies that are struggling with the cold temps but also water which would lead me to believe they don't have the same regulations on insulation or depth of pipes you would have in colder climates.</p>
<p>Ultimately this all comes down to probability and risk factor. Is it worth it to add let's say another 5-10$ per foot of cable in order to stand up to something that probably won't happen? Is it worth it to the customers to have to pay that money back in the rate case and is it worth the time and manpower to retrofit or upgrade multimillion dollar equipment that could be 30 years old at this point and still have twenty more years of serviceable life?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lived in Texas all of my life and all over the state. Utility companies don't even prep. for common events, like blistering summers. Tons of businesses close during the summer because of consistent black-outs. Utility companies collude to monopolize their respective regions, so there's no incentive to spend more than if black-outs cost less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trees are definitely a major factor, especially in urban areas. </p>
<p>In 2019 where I live got an early snowstorm, but many trees still had their leaves and the snow was wet. Which meant lots of trees and tree limbs came down on power lines causing fires and outages. Some rural areas also lost power for several days because of downed lines. It's not usually much of an issue on the main lines though, those are kept pretty clear. </p>
<p>The local utility also cross trains some workers to go out and do transmission line ice removal. They basically use long fiberglass poles with a hook on the end and drag them along the lines to remove ice.</p></div>		</li>
