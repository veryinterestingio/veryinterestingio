			<div class="markdown"><p>Further to this, I received a card in a cheap amazon product saying if I posted a 5star review and emailed them a screenshot, they'd give me an amazon voucher. Emailed amazon about it, photos of the card and everything. Got a boilerplate email back from them and they did nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Technically not a &quot;fake review&quot; if actual customers write them after buying the product. I've seen vouchers as well as additional products (one was for a second USB thumb drive). Only bought the first one cause it had good reviews (and no particular bad ones), saw why as soon as I opened the box and they were giving a second one for positive reviews...  </p>
<p>So I did the only right thing to do and wrote a 1 star review to explain the company was buying positive reviews for additional products.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I don't agree with that tactic, it isn't as bad as the ones I've reported. I mean 5 star reviews by &quot;customers&quot; going by simple names like Bob, or Sam and obviously written by someone who's first language was not English, with scant details and fewer words than I've already written in this comment. </p>
<p>I report products that have 100s of those reviews and it never seems to make any difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention that they allow companies to completely change a product page time and time again.  So that the ratings bear no relationship to what the product is now.  The early ratings could be for a cardigan but now they're for a door stop. Which is completely misleading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PSA: don't buy the new 4k if you like special features, they won't come with any. They are going to release new ones in the spring or summer that will have all of the special features, including new ones, I believe. They are all also remastered to have matching color and exposure palette across all Hobbit and Lord of the rings films. This part isn't necessarily good or bad thing, just FYI.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm.
Wanted to make some extra cash using Upwork. First &quot;job&quot; was writing a &quot;believable review&quot; for a product I'd never seen, heard of, or used, with no opportunity to try. Reported the listing to site, and product to Amazon. They didn't care.</p></div>		</li>
