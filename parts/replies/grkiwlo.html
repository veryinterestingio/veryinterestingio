<p>One night in Damascus I kept myself from sleeping, fascinated by the thought you could dig through over 5000Jears of human history under my bed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alberta was covered in glaciers. Even if everyone has it wrong and people were here before, all that evidence would likely been wiped out by the glaciers scouring the earth as they retreated.</p>
<p>However, there could be older sites along the British Columbia coast as a popular theory for the peopling of North America is the coastal migration route which makes a lot more sense than the old land bridge theory. But prior to 5000 years ago the sea levels along the pacific coast were very dynamic due to sea level rise (glaciers melting) and isostatic rebound (land masses raised because there was less weight on them as glaciers retreated/melted). So any older coastal migration sites might be underwater right now or on old shorelines in the mountains. But there you are stopping at bedrock.</p>
<p>Hope that makes sense.</p></div>		</li>
