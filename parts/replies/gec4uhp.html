<p>With inflation, it is imperative to instead invest your wealth, or else it will eventually bleed away its value to inflation.</p>
<p>Inflation is a tool to try and keep people from hoarding their money under a mattress so that businesses have better access to investors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is why some governments target a certain rate of inflation, but inflation in general just comes from monetary supply outpacing long range aggregate supply, whether it is caused by fiscal or monetary policy or independent factors to those.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Inflation is a tool government's use to get the economy going. It's desired.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Inflation gives more incentive to spend today. If $1 today can get me a litre of milk, but only half a litre in a years time, I would prefer to spend that money today.</p>
</li>
<li>The more people spend money, the more value it creates. If I buy milk today, the shop owner that sold me the milk can use that $1 to buy cheese, and the cheese shop owner can then use that $1 to buy something else. The $1 turned into $3 worth of value to the economy (something that is desired)</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just don't see where the fact that inflation makes people broke on the short term is factored in here.
Is the desired effect that we all be just slightly broker than things cost, so that we cant afford to save, and money keeps moving??</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If spending 100% of your disposable income and saving 100% were two opposite ends of the spectrum, inflation sort of nudges an individual more towards the spending side.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, everybody is better off when we all, on aggregate, spend more (due to the creation of value effect mentioned in my other comment).</p>
<p>Conversely, say we have <strong><em>deflation</em></strong>, then people can buy more with the same amount of money at some point in the future.</p>
<p>In this environment, naturally, people prefer to save. Companies losing sales are desperate to sell you something, so they lower prices (i.e. causing deflation). This effect compounds on itself over time—and was largely to blame for the great depression.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a deflationary environment they're less incentive to spend. Which means less aggregate demand. Which means fewer jobs. The economy contracts, demand may fall further, and this could create a feedback loop. All of which means wages and tax revenue declines.</p>
<p>Credit is perhaps the most important and unstated factor in this thread. Inflation can create incentive to borrow.
Think about a mortgage or corporate bond. If your wage or revenue increases with inflation but your payment stays flat, you pay a smaller percent of your income to the debt. (interest rates adjust, yes but...) </p>
<p>If you have Inflation change to deflation, this creates an incentive to save. Borrowers get fucked because servicing existing debt gets relatively more expensive. </p>
<p>Borrowing leads to investments in technology or large assets, which increases efficiency, and productivity, which creates wealth. People need to be hired to facilitate this. All of this should generate taxes. </p>
<p>This is all very general. Economics gets complicated quickly and specifics do matter. But the core reasoning makes sense. It's also important to have a fiscal and monetary policy that change with conditions and work together to achieve the desired outcome. Inflation isn't a large factor in the cycle of poverty imo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Annual pay raises (Cost of Living Adjustments) offset inflation and some state minimum wages are even tied to inflation so that the increase at the same rate as inflation does automatically.</p>
<p>There is definitely no attempt to prevent savings, as consumer savings play a big role in the economy as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone keeps saying that inflation encourages spending money, because if you save it it loses value over time.</p>
<p>Um, there's a thing called interest, which is above the inflation rate for any sizable savings or retirement account. Inflation is factored into savings or investment, such that it's actually profitable to save. </p>
<p>Saving is already hard for most people. People spend almost all their money because they need and want things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, interest rates and inflation are linked (really they're part of the same equation). In actual fact, interest rates are the tool, and inflation is the goal.</p>
<p>You've keyed into quite a key point. </p>
<p>I like think of inflation as a gentle nudge towards spending. Basically, this works because there is a lag (and sometimes a discrepancy) between what people think will happen and what actually happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha I know right? People are being quite the r/pickybeggars here.</p>
<p>Its very hard to just magically explain complex things and be simple enough for a 5-year old to understand.
Like the famous example of how a wormhole works. That’s not just one guy who tried to explain it and boom, but multiple people tried to until someone got a really good explanation that circulated.</p>
<p>It is not common to have people be experts in certain fields of knowledge, its even rarer for them to also be gifted with explanation and teaching well. Then factor in some ideas are severely much more complex than others. So yeah, I can forgive if answers come out as ELI15 rather ELi5. If anything I prefer it like that as it normally provides more information anyways, I’m a grown man- not a fucken baby.</p></div>		</li>
