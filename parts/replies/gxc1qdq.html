			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: among the Aymaran people in the Andes, when they talk about the <em>future</em>, they gesture <em>behind</em> themselves, not ahead. And when talking about the <em>past</em>, they point <em>in front of</em> themselves.</p>
<p>Reason being, just as the past is known/experienced with certainty, so too is the vista ahead of you that you're looking at in that moment. The future is what's behind you because it's just as uncertain.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spaceship fights. They are always, always, <em>always</em> oriented the same way. Whether it's Jean-Luc Picard or Justy Ueki Tylor, the bottoms of everyone's ships are oriented the same in the completely arbitrary void of space. It's not only possible, but I should think <em>probable</em> that while one person is (to them) right-side up, their enemies in their other ship would be goof-tacularly upside-down in relation to them, like they came flying in from Space Australia.<br />
They never are.</p>
<p>I think the mind passively recoils from it, when making up such situations in a space story.  Might also be why we handwave psuedo-gravity in with no explanation. <em>Up</em> and <em>down</em> are so fundamental as to be completely unspoken almost all the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, to be fair, in space shooter video games you can usually orient your ship any way you like, so it's indeed possible to come at another ship from any direction, and have your up be their down and vice-versa. But even in video games, players usually orient their ships to the solar system ecliptic, because it makes navigation easier (even though space is 3D, planets orbit their star in more or less 2D orbits relative to each other). So at least initially, they are likely to have the same up and down as others, and only break out of that alignment during a fight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Layman view:</p>
<p>I'd agree but then gyroscopes and all that stuff comes into it. It's like when some airplane pilots can't see anything in really bad foggy conditions or night, they still have the right axis alignment due to those scopes. Before them, there'd been disasters from the tilt being all wrong and them not even realising because of how much we use our eyes for perception. They could've been upside down without even realising! That being said, there'd be way less reason for spaceships to bother too much being on the right alignment all the time unless it had something to do with navigation or relative exit from a earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We should have words that mean &quot;your left, my left, your right, my right&quot;. People forget the importance of the &quot;your&quot; or &quot;my&quot; and I guess assume the person they are talking to can read their mind.</p>
<p>It also annoys me when people say left of right in terms of turning things. &quot;Lefty loosy righty tightly&quot; or whatever the phrase is for tightening screws. I still have know idea what it means! Am I turning the top bit left or the bottom bit left?</p>
<p>I eventually figured out and now remember it by &quot;clockwise=closed, anti=open&quot;</p>
<p>Edit: thanks to everyone offering solutions to my problem that I already solved. To summarise for others, here is what I have learned. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Only use Cardinal directions. &quot;Turn the screw east to tighten it&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assume everyone knows specific other terminology, like boat &quot;port and starboard&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assume everyone knows how stages work. &quot;Just put the box stage left&quot; &quot;...you have a stage in your house?&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;If you have trouble remembering something, have you tried not having trouble remembering it? That works for me!&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Guugu Yimithirr in Queensland, Australia! Studies have shown that they have an uncanny ability to always know which way the cardinal directions are. The prevailing theory is that of Linguistic Determinism, that the language you speak somehow determines parts of your personality, your memory, how you perceive/categorize things, and even how well you are able to navigate the natural world.
There's some other groups that have been used as case studies for linguistic determinism but I can't remember off the top of my head. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting, I tend to keep direction of which way is South but I notice not enough other people do for it to be useful!</p>
<p>I think I picked the habit up when I was in America people kept giving us directions on terms of the compass and it confused me how people just always seemed to know which direction was which off the top of their head!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah just think of the bolt as a little steering wheel. You turn the wheel by moving the top part left or right. Left is to loosen and right to tighten. It's super easy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just like a steering wheel, if you turn the wheel to the right, it means the top of the wheel to the right, which coincidentally turns the car to the right.</p>
