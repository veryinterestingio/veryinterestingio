			<div class="markdown"><p>That is actually not true, it’s because most antivirus programs function by hooking into the kernel and also have anti tamper and anti debug protection built into their binaries in order to prevent both the user and malware from shutting them off.</p>
<p>When two separate programs attempt to hook the same application they run into issues because they actively deny each other from touching their processes.</p>
<p>In some cases this merely causes a delay, whatever application or tool you were trying to run is delayed until the applications have finished this race condition. </p>
<p>In others they crash entirely, but in all cases you’re decreasing performance.</p></div>		</li>
