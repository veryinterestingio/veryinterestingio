However, the risk of a pandemic associated with influenza is non-theoretical.</p>
<p>While there have been in advances and our ability to deal with severe consequences of influenza infection, flu associated hospitalization and deaths remain a public health issue. For example, CDC estimates that the flu has resulted in between 140,000 and 960,000 hospitalizations each year since 2010.</p></div>		</li>
