Normally, this is considered a point of pride as it is taken as evidence they have noble samurai blood (having prominent nipples was considered the height of manliness and <em>bushido</em> during the Edo period, and many samurai without the condition would actually paint and/or pinch their nipples to achieve the effect, supposedly to intimidate their enemies).
