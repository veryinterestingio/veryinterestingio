<p>Unfortunately the red skin looked like blackface on b&amp;w tv so they changed their mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read somewhere (I think it was in Shatner’s book Star Trek: Memories) that Roddenberry’s original goal was for Spock to look “Satanic”. So pointy ears, slanted eyebrows, devil beard, and red skin. IIRC, nobody liked that look so they toned it down and just kept the ears and eyebrows. In addition to the issue with the red skin paint causing inadvertent racial issues when viewed in black and white, nobody felt comfortable relating to the character when he looked like he came from Hell...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were a few TV producers in the 50s that actually foresaw the coming of color TV long before it was a thing. While the first two seasons of The Adventures Of Superman were filmed in black and white, from season 3 onward, they were filmed in color. Likewise, The Lone Ranger switched to color in 1957. At the time, color TV was just coming into being, but the powers that be were looking far ahead to when they would be the norm.  NBC pushed for colorized westerns like Bonanza, to help their RCA parent company sell more color TVs. How did the shows look? Not much different than the Black and White ones on a B&amp;W TV. The following decade, though, Kids that had color TVs got excited when they saw Superman or the Lone Ranger in color.</p></div>		</li>
