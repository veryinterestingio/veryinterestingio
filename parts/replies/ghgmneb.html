			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, apparently there was a huge number of people who survived the Spanish Flu but suffered really weird chronic conditions afterwards, including the narcolepsy thing. I suppose that with two world wars and a depression in-between it's not surprising how the Spanish Flu got shuffled off the historic awareness plane, but its impact was really big and, turns out, incredibly relevant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we knew this since the Spanish flu, how come the Swine flu vaccine resulted in narcolepsy cases? At least i know that outcome is worrying many people in Sweden unfortunately.</p>
<p>Is there any clear publication or so that shows that this Covid vaccine won't have the same result as the Swine flu one?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll add an interesting factoid that's used in some viral infections to see whether the person had it or was immunized for it, if immunization history is unknown. HepB. There's a surface part and a inside core part. If you were immunized then you only have antibodies against the surface part, but if you had HepB then you have antibodies against both surface and core, since the virus was alive and replicating, allowing the body's immune defense to identify the core.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I'd like one too, because it's incorrect.  Maybe more numerous as in higher titer when boostered? </p>
<p>Generally, true infection results in an array of antibodies (produced by B-cells) and T-cell responses (both CD4, which help B-cells produce specific antibodies , and CD8, which directly target infected cells and kill them) against a wide range of antigens. Depending on the type of vaccine, you may only see a B-cell (antibody response) or a T-cell/B-cell response to a single antigen.</p>
<p>The two US approved Covid vaccines will produce T-cell/B-cell responses against a single antigen - the S protein of the virus.  An actual infection will produce a range of B-cell and T-cell (CD4 and CD8) responses to not only the S protein, but others that may be present as part of the viral replication. </p>
<p>A killed vaccine will only produce a B-cell response, since the virus is not actively replicating in cells and then unable to drive a CD8 T-cell response unless you include specific adjuvants that can help drive that arm of the response. </p>
<p>The above answer is a bit of truth, a bit of half-truth.  Single antigen responses are generally safer than modified live/killed virus preps, but in any case, for better or for worse, a natural infection can produce a much wider/robust immune response.</p>
<p>Lots of edits as I expanded my thoughts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PharmD and BS Chemistry here. Just wanted to say I support the validity of this justification based on the accurate immunopathology. Natural infections can indeed produce a much wider/robust immune response.</p>
<p>We also recommend vaccination of all individuals who are offered the opportunity, and meet the medical criteria to receive either the pfizer/biontech or moderna vaccine regimen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if that is the case and we are presuming a 3 month immunity duration for previously infected. Will we need booster shots every quarter for the vaccine?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, well put. With two mRNA vaccines we are in a new age of vaccines that can promote both B cell (antibody) and T cell (“cellular”) immunity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard it has to do with dosing.  When you're vaccinated, you get a high dose of produced protein antigen that your body responds to, which results in more antibodies being made.</p>
<p>In contrast, when you're infected, the viral load can vary.  Especially if you're exposed to a smaller viral load (resulting in milder symptoms), the immune response may be smaller.  Even with a higher viral load, the virus can somehow suppress your immune response and thus result in fewer antibodies. That's why some folks get really sick and die.  You just don't know how your body will respond to different viral loads.</p>
<p>This is why they recommend getting vaccinated even if you've ever had COVID and had only mild symptoms or were asymptomatic.  The amount of viral antigen from the vaccine will induce a much more robust immune response (i.e. more antibodies) and you'd have better protection from re-infection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, some viruses actively target the immune system. For example, measles can infect white blood cells and kill them, including cells that make antibodies. The resultant immunosuppression lasts a couple of years. The vaccine therefore protects against measles-induced immunosuppression.</p></div>		</li>
