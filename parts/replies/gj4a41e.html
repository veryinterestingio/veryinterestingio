			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is a common confusion and it's tied to differences in how scientists communicate to themselves and how that gets communicated to the public. When researchers do clinical trials they calculate an &quot;efficacy&quot; rate which is how well the intervention worked under controlled and ideal circumstances. That can differ from the intervention's &quot;effectiveness&quot; which is how well it works when implemented in the real-world. As communicators I think it's essential that we're specific with what we mean by 94% efficacy and how that might differ in real world settings. </p>
<p>As you mention, the current trials measure how many people become symptomatic but that may mean that some unknown % of the ppl vaccinated were infected and asymptomatic. It's possible that they could continue to spread the disease. It's great news that the current vaccines have such high efficacy rates - many scientists would have been happy with anything over 60%, but even a very high efficacy doesn't mean perfect protection. Especially with rampant community spread. </p>
<p>It's also important for communicators to differentiate between places where there's an absence of evidence e.g. &quot;Does the vaccine slow the spread of COVID-19?&quot; vs. definitive answers. It's not that vaccinated ppl can definitely still transmit the disease, it's that scientists haven't yet collected that data so we're not yet sure. It is probably helpful, but since we're not yet sure it's better to continue with the current precautions. </p>
