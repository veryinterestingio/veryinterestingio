			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15703531" target="_blank">A study from 2005</a> and <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0b58/efe51968a16aa3124a3dce84053a1c966784.pdf" target="_blank">a similar study from 1999</a> have proven there is a correlation between size of a baby (specifically length) and their adult height. I used weight in my comment because people tend to use that to gauge baby size more often than height/length.</p>
<p>Obviously there are outlying factors (addressed in the studies and in other comments), but my basic point is that by having larger babies more frequently, we're not only increasing average adult human height but also influencing overall evolution of humans to be able to continually have larger babies, and in turn taller adults.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right that there is a correlation between term birth length and adult height (I was wrong!). To clarify my position: being born pre-term does not make a person shorter as an adult. The baby catches up early on. <a href="https://adc.bmj.com/content/102/6/503" target="_blank">This article</a>, as an example, is a longitudinal cohort study showing no difference in final height between term and pre-term infants.</p>
<p>We cannot infer causality from the correlation between baby length and adult height; what if humans are getting taller, and consequently babies are longer on average independently of gestational medicine?</p></div>		</li>
