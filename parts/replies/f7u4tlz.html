			<div class="markdown"><p>This concept is hugely important in emergency medicine where Epinephrine is given in different dosages for different things with different effects. You don't want to treat a heart attack with epinephrine in the same dosage and concentration as you would for someone who is in anaphylactic shock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Their example isn't prefect here because we're looking for different tissue beds with relatively similar doses.  Low to moderate dose continuous epinephrine is at 7 micro-grams per minute (0.1mcg/kg/min assuming a 70kg adult) is the starting dose of epi for cardiac insufficiency. 0.3mg for anaphylaxis. </p>
<p>The classic example of variable alpha/beta effects of pressors is dopamine.  Strong beta1-adrenergic, alpha-adrenergic, and dopaminergic effects are based on dosing rate.  Beta1  2-10 mcg/kg/min and Alpha effects &gt;10 mcg/kg/min. While this a lot of pharm  for a reddit thread, functionally what this means is that you are giving a different drug depending on the dose. Epi has a similar change.  Doctors, particularly inexperienced ICU staff and residents don't always appreciate the nuance this brings and don't understand why they've crumped the cardiac output on a sick patient even though they kept adding more pressor. Generally I teach my trainees to know your therapeutic index for each drug and add a different mechanism if they aren't getting the response they want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Low dose during a heart attack since you want vasodilation, not constriction. I've personally never heard of administering Epi for a heart attack. </p>
<p>That's why we as paramedics default to giving nitroglycerin (vasodilation), aspirin (help prevent clotting), morphine (pain/promote vasodilation) asap in the field. </p>
<p>Off topic, but heart attacks aren't always conditions you want to promote vasodilation. Inferior MI's treated with nitro and other vasodilators can cause serious BP complications in the field, and turn an otherwise stable patient unstable. It's just as important to identify what/where your treating as well as how.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, Binding affinity is also why Carbon Monoxide is hugely toxic. The hemoglobin protein that carries oxygen is one of the most fascinating proteins because the binding affinity for oxygen is just strong enough to pick it up in high concentrations in the lungs then release it in low concentrations in the tissues. However the binding affinity for carbon monoxide is much higher than oxygen because of the polar nature of the molecule and the binding pocket. Once carbon monoxide is picked up it can't be displaced by oxygen, effectively destroying the protein. It's why people can still die from CO poisoning even after being removed from the environment if they already absorbed too much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this.</p>
<p>To add on, you may be interested in this article: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1693664/#!po=69.0299" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1693664/#!po=69.0299</a></p>
<p>See figure 10. See also this paragraph:</p>
<p>Levonordefrin (NeoCobefrin) is the vasopressor combined with 2% mepivacaine solutions in the United States. It closely resembles norepinephrine rather than epinephrine and lacks activity at Beta2 receptors. Epinephrine increases heart rate and systolic pressure but lowers diastolic pressure. In contrast, systemic administration of norepinephrine increases systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures, and this triggers a reflex slowing of heart rate.18 (This is illustrated and explained in Figure 10.) Levonordefrin has been suggested as an alternative to epinephrine-containing local anesthetics when treating patients with cardiovascular heart disease because it does not increase heart rate. However, advocates fail to consider its undesirable influence on blood pressure. The 1 : 20,000 levonordefrin concentration found in mepivacaine is considered equipotent to standard 1 : 100,000 epinephrine concentrations in terms of alpha receptor activity (vasoconstriction). After infiltration, they have equivalent efficacy for constricting submucosal vessels, and their influences on local hemorrhage and anesthetic absorption are similar.</p></div>		</li>
