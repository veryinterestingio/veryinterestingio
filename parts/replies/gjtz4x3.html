			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>Edit</strong>: please see response from /u/Camp-Unusual to this comment for more nuance.</p>
<hr />
<p>Not really. Think of a bee more like a robot. It can't think for itself, but is programmed to react to things in its environment.</p>
<p>Lots of moisture in the air? Maybe find some shelter, and let the others know.</p>
<p>This is not an active thought. This bee then simply was the first to detect a moisture level above its shelter threshold first, and might do a dance or release pheromones to signal its buddies, so that they will detect it faster.</p>
<p>Same for stinging; circumstances indicate that this thing is a problem that can be resolved by stinging it; ergo, the bee will stab it. It may also relesse pheromones or do a little dance to tell its comrades that it has made this decision, to which the others will react.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't everything react, by those criteria? I still think bees both act and react, in the same way a robot would act/react. We can distinguish bees from humans with awareness, but the fundamental physics is the same-- humans are just as robotic and responding to chemical markers, it's just we that we have this sense of self as if we're freely making choices. These choices can't be free, given what we know about the causal nature of aforementioned chemical markers and neurons, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a <strong>bee</strong> should be able to fly. It's wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The <strong>bee</strong>, of course, flies anyway, because <strong>bees</strong> don't care what humans think is impossible</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great point! The bee as a single cell in the body and the hive as a human is certainly a more valid comparison. Heck, I don’t think most people take the time to stop and appreciate the reality that a human is really a multitude of different cell types working together in unison</p></div>		</li>
