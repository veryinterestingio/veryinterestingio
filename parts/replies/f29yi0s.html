			<div class="markdown"><p>I meant the shape of the opening, not related to the internal optics. It obviously affects the image (as per my example) but you can still see everything that you want to see. Go up a few f-stops and everything will be nice and sharp.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does it not affect the image if it does affect the image like what you showed?</p>
<p>It affects some parts of the image.</p>
<p>Also, in optical terms there's a difference between the shape of a lens (like an anamorphic Cinema lens) and the shape of a diaphragm or filter in front of or behind a lens (like the Christmas tree example you linked to). Both have different effects on the image you get.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It only affects the bokeh. Ramp it up to f16 or whatever and everything will be nice and sharp. Don't compare this to anamorphic lenses, those are a completely, absolutely different thing. They change (compress) the image, it's not as simple as just slapping a piece of paper on the lens.</p></div>		</li>
