Definitely better than having a fucked up uterus that's trying to kill you (from age 15 until that thing came out, her periods were basically a solid week shooting a firehose of blood out of her crotch).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meanwhile women in my family have had hysterectomies <em>because</em> things shifted around, leading to pelvic organ prolapse. According to Harvard Health, half of women over 50 experience this, though most don’t require surgery. (This is related to childbirth and pelvic floor weakening after menopause.)</p>
<p>I can’t wait to get old and have my organs fall out of my vagina!</p></div>		</li>
