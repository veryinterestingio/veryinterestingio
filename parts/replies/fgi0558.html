			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes this.  It’s super easy to get this confused. My guess is they called the retail version atomic clocks since they were linked to one via RF. </p>
<p>Also, not just cesium, other elements too. My workspace has one with rubidium and one with cesium. I wonder which other elements are used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m pretty sure the clocks have to be set up near a window with no major obstructions so they can receive the synchronization signals.</p>
<p>Also, I seem to recall that they only sync up once a day, during the night.  They use a conventional system to approximate for the day, and they aren’t inaccurate enough to lose any time over the course of just one day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC the most accurate clocks a consumer can buy use GPS. Something like +- 10ns?</p></div>		</li>
