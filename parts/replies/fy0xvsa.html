			<div class="markdown"><p>Space doesn’t exist except as an almost mathematical relationship between particles. It gets bigger but doesn’t have more “stuff” inside it. The amount of anything that exists is the same, just a different mathematical relation between existing elements. </p>
<p>We have this mental image of things getting bigger implying there is more “stuff” inside but that’s because our common sense is primitive and designed to work in our very limited everyday life where if you get a bigger belly it means you put stuff in it or whatever lol. </p>
<p>That kind of common sense doesn’t work in anything related to physics since really the end of the 19th century</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not true, the space itself is expanding. That's why light from extremely distant stars will never reach us, because the space in between the star and us is also expanding.</p>
<p>Think of it like a road. We're at a gas station and there's a hot dog van a mile away to the North. Our friend (his name is Light, his parents were hippies) leaves the hot dog van in his car and drives South towards us with some tasty dawgs. As he leaves the hot dog van drives off North. He will reach us in the time it takes to drive 1 mile with those tasty long sandwiches.</p>
<p>That's the &quot;space isn't expanding, stuff is just getting further away&quot; example.</p>
<p>Now what if the road was made of rubber and was stretching out North to South? As he drives South the road is expanding. Despite all his claims to the ladies that &quot;nothing is faster than Light, baby!&quot; the road itself <em>can</em> stretch faster than the time it takes him to reach us, meaning he never actually gets to us with our meaty treats. The road between him and us just keeps getting longer and longer. Depending how far away from the hotdog van he had travelled, he <em>might</em> be able to make it back, because the road stretches in a way that makes further objects move away faster than close ones. He has no problem making it between the lines on the road for example because they are very close to him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only meaningful definition of 'distance' in space is the time it takes light travelling at the speed of light to go from one point to a different point. Is it possible that the expansion of space is actually time slowing down or the speed of light constant increasing universally? The answer to that involves the question: is the distance between the atoms in my body also expanding?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine being in space and cupping your hands. What’s inside your hands? Nothing. </p>
<p>Now move your hands apart, is there more “nothing” in between them? Did “space” grow or just the distance between your hands?</p>
<p>“Space” exists as a concept between two particles. Its in reality a vacuum of nothingness.</p>
<p>Not a physicist here, correct me if this is wrong, but this is my understanding.</p>
<p>Edit: I appreciate all the cool info! This analogy doesn’t hold up because of the growth/stretching of the fabric of space itself. You guys are all smart and awesome ! =]</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>

<p>Not quite. Spacetime really is something that can be stretched or compressed, on it's own, without needing any particles in it. This is what Einstein discovered. Space <em>itself</em> (just empty space) can be literally &quot;moved&quot; by massive objects, and that is what we know as gravity. </p>
<p>This is where the hand-moving-apart analogy doesn't work, because you're moving your hands apart. In reality your hands wouldn't move at all, but rather the space <em>between</em> them would expand. &quot;More space&quot; just appears on it's own, and we don't really have an explanation for how/why that occurs (hence we label it as Dark Energy). Maybe it's a property of spacetime itself. This is of the greatest unsolved mysteries of physics. </p>
<p>That's why the balloon analogy is a bit better because it doesn't require anything on the surface of the balloon to actually move. The balloon <em>itself</em> expands, and the side-effect of that is that things on the surface move apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We start with a big bang, but how we end depends on the &quot;shape&quot; of the universe.  Possible universe shapes are flat, spherical, or open.  And our possible endings are a Big Freeze, a Big Crunch, or a Big Rip.  We aren't certain of the shape of our universe, but the most popular guess is a flat universe ending in a big freeze.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not expanding into anything. The rubber the balloon is made of is expanding. </p>
<p>Think of it this way: you have a piece of rubber that is infinitely long, and on that rubber is a marking every inch. This is the universe, it contains everything that exists. Now, if you stretch that rubber, the distance between the marks will get larger. The rubber (universe) has expanded, but it hasn't gotten larger, it's still infinitely long and contains everything. </p>
<p>Expansion of the universe is the distance between everything in it getting larger, not the universe itself getting bigger and expanding exactly like a balloon. It's hard to put into a perfect analogy, but the tl;dr is that the universe doesn't need to expand <em>into</em> anything at all.</p></div>		</li>

To stop, you'd have to achieve a perfect balance between the driver of the expansion (dark energy) and the counter effects of gravity. That's an unstable state.

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's kind of like trying to imagine stuff before the big bang.   It's just not a meaningful construct when there is no time, just as there is no nothing when there is no something.   The construction of nothing depends on something, so when you remove space and existence entirely they both lose their meaning. </p>
<p>It's this irritating deal where none of your experience works for actually conceptualizing it.  </p>
<p>Personally I just stick a not in front of any of it, so instead of the awkward impossibility of say, &quot;before there was time&quot; I just have time and not-time.   If redshift tells us that space is expanding, my mind intuitively wants to believe it's expanding past or through some sort of other space.  So I just label it not-space. </p>
<p>Actually saying this outloud makes it sound kind of silly, and it doesn't really solve the logical impossibility that a statement like &quot;space expands through not-space&quot; presents, since through is still inseparable from any concept of space, (just as &quot;before there was time there was not-time&quot; is still dumb, since before is meaningless when applied outside of time), so ya feels kind of stupid trying to explain it. </p>
<p>It does provide my brain a useful reminder/out when trying to think about this sort of thing though, and makes the acceptance of concepts outside of space and time a little easier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean according to some multiverse theories there may be a bunch of 4D &quot;universe balloons&quot; (we live on the 3D surface of the 4D balloon) floating around in some kind of unfathomable 4D space. But the simplest explanation would be that there isn't anything outside the balloon because the balloon doesn't actually exist, only the <em>surface</em> of the balloon (the universe) exists, it's just curved in the same way it would be if there was an actual balloon. The confusing part is that you have to believe that something can be curved in 4 dimensions without actually existing in 4 dimensions.</p></div>		</li>
