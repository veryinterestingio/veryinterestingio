			<div class="markdown"><p>That's mostly what this is.</p>
<p>When you write software, you ALWAYS have a mental image of the average computer you are going to be running this on. If you're doing too much, the user will hate the sluggish experience. Do too little and you will be overtaken by the competitor who added some nice feature you didn't.</p>
<p>However, that &quot;average computer&quot; is a moving target because computers improve. So you, as a programmer, shift alongside and add more features and capabilities. Inevitably that means older computers struggle with your new software, but very likely they would be replaced soon anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a programmer, and a lot of it isn't new features - it's laziness. Nobody wants to optimise, because it's boring and &quot;most computers don't need it&quot;. It's really stupid.</p>
<p>Edit: I guess economics. I do agree with the replies. But still - even programs created by huge businesses are needlessly huge! Take a look at the original SuperMarioBrothers - it had to fit into 40KB. Now, we have on screen keyboards for hundreds of megabytes!</p>
<p>Edit 2: Ok, yes, sometimes there isn't enough time. I suppose, but when it IS viable to optimise, it's almost never done.  That's my issue.  When it's not possible I get it.</p>
<p>Edit 2.5: Better example stolen from u/durpdurpdurp's reply: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Call of duty warzone is a great example of this, there's no good reason to make users download 200GB updates other than they know it's not a deal breaker for most users and so it's not worth their time to find a better patch setup. I released a VR game that, the entire game is contained in 300MB because I probably over-optimized when I should have just tried to release the game. 200GB is a problem imo, but if I was more relaxed, I don't think a 1GB game would have been an issue, and so I should have spent less time on compression and extra scripts to modularly modify textures and sounds at runtime lmao. Overkill for sure for what I was doing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I haven't used either game so I have no idea about the quality of either, the base point still stands. <strong>200gb</strong> for a <strong>game</strong>.</p>
<p>And notice that I said <strong>a lot</strong> of it is laziness.</p>
<p>Edit 3: Add some details, clarity, etc.</p>
<p>Also: I'm sorry, but I won't be able to respond to all replies. 43 messages in inbox is way too much for me to handle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm on the data side of things. The number of programmers that think they understand how to design and use optimized data systems is significantly higher than the number that actually do.</p>
<p>The worst (best) example I've personally come across is an entire group of programmers lead by several high paid systems architects/software engineer types asking me to take a look at their performance problems because 4 1/2 hours is too long for this particular conversion task.</p>
<p>I worked with one other data person and after a day got it down to 19 seconds. We honestly thought we screwed up so threw it out and redesigned it again and were then down to 12 seconds.</p>
<p>We handed back the new designs (that were built around set based processing rather than record based processing) and were then told that &quot;performance isn't a key metric for us&quot; as they threw out the solution. They made some tweaks in their design and got it down to 2 1/2 hours and called it golden.</p>
<p>We think they threw it out because they didn't understand set based thinking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, back to assembly coding for all of us :P (I jest, I know compilers have gone past any real justification for assembly now, but it did teach good habits when it came to optimisation)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a software engineer and I think you're wrong. It's not laziness, it's economics. Most companies don't want to spend time on optimization, unless absolutely necessary. Because those things rarely have an impact on revenue, unless your software is absolutely dog slow. There is a lot more focus on stability, security, maintainability, going cross platform, and of course jamming in more features to appease the stakeholders.</p>
<p>I love hunting for areas where I can boost performance, and all of my personal projects are created to be as fast as possible. But at work I'm happy if I even get to schedule one day per year to work on performance.</p>
<p>There are still places where performance is mission critical though, but they don't always overlap with consumer software.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite story about this is the last company I worked for. Users (internal tool) complained about poor performance. No one on the dev team can verify.</p>
<p>The dev teams computers had significantly better specs than those in operations. Those poor bastards had 8gb of RAM, with excel, two swing apps (lol) and chrome open.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol I'm doing the exact opposite right now. I spend more hours a day these days on a laptop working on some scripts than I am at home on my real machine. I have to design my scripts to be able to work with the hardware I'm mostly using in a reasonable time then get to see how fast it can really go on my desktop.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It’s not really really getting slower, it’s mostly the fact that new software is developed for never faster computers, so they will run slower on older computers, and as apps get updates over time, they will run slower and slower</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't know. I'm in IT and I've rebuilt a lot of computers over the years. Even reinstalling the same software that was on a very slow machine sometimes the results are pretty dramatic. </p>
<p>Registry rot is a thing on Windows computers. In fact I've had people comment on how fast a &quot;new&quot; computer was when it was literally the same computer they had that was running like crap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah when i used to use windows i had to fresh install it at least every two years if not every year. Then it would take me a full week of installing new software and configuring my system before it was back to being comfortable, that was on windows 7 tho after windows 10 i couldn't even get it to a point where i was comfortable with it just too much extra bullshit.</p>
<p>Linux i can have fully up and running configured just how i like in a few hours ezpz plus i could make a script to install absolutely everything automatically via the terminal and even configure it all automatically but i havent done that because its nowhere near winblows levels of time wasted.</p>
<p>I dont notice any degradation with my linux system either, i leave it up and running for weeks at a time and sometimes i dont even update it for a month and it just patiently waits for me with no noticeable side effects. Windows would have to be rebooted daily just to clear the memory leaks and background bloat but then it would force you to install updates so as soon as you actually needed to use the computer for a quick five minutes it would force you to update first and an hour later you dont even remember the five minute task you wanted to do. With linux i can update while im doing the five minute task then if it needs to restart i can wit until im ready to restart no matter how long that takes, i can even forget to restart until something breaks then i remember and reboot it and everything just works again sometimes even better than before because updates. </p>
<p>Not to mention actually being told what the update is so i can decide whether or not its worth running the update right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apple likes to say that they support their devices for a long time, but they are almost more guilty of this issue because they don't make software with the &quot;average computer&quot; in mind. They deliberately create their software for the latest generation of hardware, while letting 3 year old devices get a taste of the newest features.</p></div>		</li>
