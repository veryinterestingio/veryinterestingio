			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude, liver doesn't produce insulin! Only the pancreas does.</p>
<p>That said, most of the comment is correct. The liver processess toxins so they can be removed with urine oe bile.</p>
<p>Also why it contains nutritional values: it's a major protein maker. Some clotting factors, enzymes, in fact, blood albumins which I believe make up the majority of blood proteins, come from the liver!</p>
<p>Also it stores glycogen. Also an energetic substance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Beyond the insulin thing (that's the pancreas) this is pretty spot on. It's worth explaining that glycogen is stored glucose - that is the primary energy source for all of your cells. Some of our glycogen is spread around the body inside of our muscles, but our secondary storage, the &quot;Fort Knox&quot; of glycogen I'd you will, is in the liver. This means a lot of stored energy lives in the liver waiting to be broken down when needed. </p></div>		</li>
