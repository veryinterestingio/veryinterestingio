<p>I wonder if recent exposure to other coronaviruses (common cold?) might confer some protection?  I mean that the immune system basically has to determine for itself how to fight a new infection, and whatever adaptation it comes up with (in some subset of people) might be accidentally somewhat effective against covid-19.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are theories on inoculum size being a factor as well as route of introduction. For example, inhaled deeply into the lungs (say via mouth) versus the virus only being seeded within the nasal mucosa: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41385-020-00359-2" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41385-020-00359-2</a></p>
<p>Animal models show increased severity with aerosols vs intranasal introduction and generally require lower doses to show symptoms:

<p>I don't think there is really any strong evidence of significant cross-protection from circulating seasonal coronavirus infections. This was an early pandemic hypothesis, but unless I missed a key study, I haven't seen anything overly convincing?</p>
<p>One of the better theories might be related to HLA types and other subtle genetic factors: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2818-3" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2818-3</a> <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2020283" target="_blank">https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2020283</a></p>

<p>That would be yet another reason to use decongestant nasal sprays when having a cold.</p></div>		</li>
