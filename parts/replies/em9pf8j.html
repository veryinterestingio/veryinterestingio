			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting question.</p>
<p>Moving electrons do indeed have momentum proportional to their velocity. However, electrons in an electrical circuit do not move as fast as you might think.</p>
<p>For a DC circuit, when you close a switch to turn on a lamp the lamp turns on very quickly. This is not because electrons have quickly flowed from the switch to the lamp though. Instead, it's more like a bicycle chain where all of the electrons move together.</p>
<p>For an AC circuit this is perhaps more obvious as the electrons don't flow at all but instead oscillate back and forth.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is that momentum must always be conserved. So, in order for a wire to jump (or gain momentum) an equal amount of momentum must be given to something in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>For electrons this would mean that electrons would have to be ejected. Cathode ray tubes (electron guns) exist and probably generate a measurable thrust.</p>
<p>Maybe not the answer you were looking for but I hope it's interesting all the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Q1: Wouldnt the thrust of the electrons be nullified by the enormoud difference in mass of electrons and protons (and neutrons)?</p>
<p>Q2: or is the difference in mass so big that the electrons move in a &quot;seperate plane of existance&quot; where the electrons can NOT influence the protons and neutrons's velocity?</p>
<p>Q3: also does all this electron velocity stuff relate to sharp metal objects losing charge faster than round metal objects?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1: I'm talking about a situation where electrons are being ejected like a propellant</p>
<p>2: Electrons certainly do interact with protons. I certainly wouldn't describe them as being in a separate plane of existence.</p>
<p>3: No, I'm not sure about that but I suspect it's to do with surface-area to volume ratio.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure! Electrons absolutely have mass and, in the case of DC current, do flow through wires much like water through pipes.</p>
<p>However, they drift very slowly. Check out a quick calculation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drift_velocity#Numerical_example" target="_blank">here</a>. When working out the momentum of the electrons in that example, it comes out to a paltry 1.81x10^(-6) kgm/s. When you consider that the wire itself has a comparatively large mass, I don't think any motion would be visible. However, this does sound like something worth looking more into! Maybe under ideal conditions (vacuum, very sensitive equipment) it may be possible to detect!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>+1 for this answer.  Remember protons mass more than a thousand times more than electrons.  Add to that the fact that conductors like copper and gold have around 100 protons and neutrons, the electrons in a metal are less than 1/100,000th of the mass of the metal.  So they do move, and they do have momentum, but it is tiny.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is absolutely a phenomenon which is similar to the water hammer in electricity. Only it happens with a different medium. Water flowing through a pipe will want to keep flowing because of their momentum. When the flow is suddenly constricted, pressure builds up on the blockage, causing the pipe to burst around it.</p>
<p>Electrons behave the same way. Once they start to move, they want to keep flowing indefinitely. When you disconnect a very long wire where a lot of electrons are flowing through, you would most likely see a spark appear between the disconnected points. The momentum of the electrons (their magnetic fields) create a high pressure area (voltage) on the points of disconnection. If the voltage is high enough, the air starts to ionize and create a sort of electron bridge (spark), which reallows the electrons flow through the wire until all of the momentum (magnetic field) is gone.</p>
<p>You should check out power station switches to see this phenomenon on a large scale</p></div>		</li>
