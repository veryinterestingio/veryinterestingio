			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, that's why military people who have to stand still for hours and hours on end use a trick of ever so slightly rocking back and forth using their legs/feet. You can try it for like a minute and the difference is night and day. However it does take a fair bit of practice to do that inconspicuously enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isnt the body a closed system with an active pump to push blood through?  If someone has a circulation problem I could understand that scenario...like need for compression socks on planes.</p>
<p>Would think more likely its the constant stress on the same points. When walking or even steping in place, the weight of the body gets distributed against other parts providing some relief. The points holding the weight change. Standing still provides no relief.</p>
<p>Planks could be another example. Time how long you could do planks without moving. Then time how long you can do planks alternating between sideplanks.  Being more level, blood pooling should be less of a concern and highlight the strain when a point is held for any diration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The blood pooling at the bottom of your legs increases pressure there, so less blood from the heart goes down to the feet on each pump.</p>
<p>Also blood vessels are elastic, so while it's a closed system its not as simple as incompressible fluid in rigid pipes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bloodstream is a closed system, but the pressure needed at your feet to push blood back up to your heart would be really high. It needs help, from muscles and venous structure in your legs.</p>
<p>But yes, constant pressure and stress from standing still is also part of it.</p></div>		</li>
