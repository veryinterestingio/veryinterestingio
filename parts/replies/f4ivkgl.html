			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here for deep scattering layer &amp; you guys are already on top of it (of course)</p>
<p>Is the thinking still that lanternfish (or maybe it was hatchetfish?) are insanely large amount of biomass? I remember hearing that but perhaps I'm mistaken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are so numerous that in the early days of deep sea mapping with sonar, scientists were puzzled because the ocean floor would rise and fall with the day-night cycle. This &quot;phantom bottom&quot; wasn't the ocean floor but the swimbladders of billions of lanternfish, so dense in number that early sonar thought their biomass was simply solid rock.</p>
