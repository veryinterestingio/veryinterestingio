			<div class="markdown"><p>That is one of main Operating system's jobs to control resources used by programs. So it actually knows where and how much resources said program uses(RAM for storing data, processor queue for commands and so on). And killing it is basically just flushes all these spaces out. So releasing said resources for use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but slow hard drives can also be a big factor, right?</p>
<p>The program wants to save to the hard drive, and some hard drives (especially older ones) can take like 5 seconds to get ready.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the program is saving some information on it's state to the hard drive, this can definitely be a cause. So like if the application remembers what files you had open between sessions, or if you're playing a game and it automatically saves as you quit, this is definitely happening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I close Microsoft edge and then try to run a program like ccleaner a message pops up saying Microsoft edge is still open, must be closed to continue. Do you know why this happens. I always have to use task manager then to actually close edge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>MS likes to design their own apps (Office, Edge, Internet exploder, etc)  to leave themselves in memory in a dormant state so that opening them appears lightning fast compared to competing apps from other companies. They're not really faster, they just never really shutdown unless forced to. Like a guest that won't leave when the party's clearly over. </p>
<p>In other words, the bug you're talking about is a Microsoft Feature (tm).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s probably some sort of background task related to Edge that anything related to Edge depends on. Simply closing it doesn’t shut down all the background tasks. It’s like hitting the x on skype. Just the window closes. Not the program.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Specifically, explorer.exe and internet explorer share rendering code. All file browser windows are just web browsers with a different GUI around them.</p>
<p>I don't know how true this is for Edge since it's a new engine, but in the past you could definitely crash explorer.exe by killing IE at an inopportune time.</p></div>		</li>
