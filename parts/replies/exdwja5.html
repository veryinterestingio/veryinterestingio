			<div class="markdown"><p>Peptides are not formed as cheese ages. Proteins in the cheese are composed of peptides (amino acids). These proteins degrade into their constituent parts over time. One of these amino acids is known as glutamate. Glutamate is responsible for “umami” flavor much in the same way that sodium is responsible for salty flavor, or hydrogen ions are responsible for sour flavor. As the cheese ages more proteins degrade which results in higher concentration of glutamate, which produces that sharp flavor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct, they are already fomed, and glutathione is the peptide that brakes down into glutamate. So glutamate is formed with time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer. To add a little more - the protein breakdown (proteolysis) is caused by two things: </p>
<p>The starter culture (bacteria strains - essentially like yoghurt) eat up lactose and secrete enzymes that allow them to break down and eat some proteins.</p>
<p>Rennet - contains an enzyme which coagulates the milk by breaking down some of the casein. Some rennet gets leftover in the final product, which continues to proteolyse and intensify the flavor and make the texture more crumbly.</p>
