</blockquote>
<p>What percentage of Americans actually have a 401k that will fund an independant lifestyle 30-50 years from now? I read that most live paycheque to paycheque, which suggests having children as a retirement plan isn't a foreign concept at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this may be true to the working class but the real  filipino poor folk don‚Äôt have that kind of mental capacity. My father, who was a humanitarian, told me that it was mainly a result of boredom and thus could equate to lack of proper education. Sex on the streets is free whether its consented or not and there are many undocumented cases of sexual abuse among the poor. They still believe that men should provide and women should just be women who cook, take care of the children and for fucking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's sex education, availability of contraceptives, and depression.</p>
<p>The people we're speaking about likely live under conservative governments, so they have poor sex education. E.g. &quot;Condoms are weird.&quot;</p>
<p>They likely don't have healthcare and therefore no guaranteed access to birth control. Also, conservative governments will try to shut down Planned Parenthood locations, partly because they offer contraceptives at affordable rates.</p>
<p>You're depressed because you're poor, so you don't think about long term consequences and you engage in self-destructive behaviors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also about education more broadly.  If you educate girls well so they have choices and the potential of a good career it's been found that the birth rate falls.  They no longer have the sole option of being having babies. They can have better control of their lives and those of any kids they have have better lives and less poverty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you‚Äôve got an excellent point. Some people still doesn‚Äôt even know how to wear a condom properly. Some people would even joke sometimes, saying that those who live away from cities/urbanization don‚Äôt really have hobbies or past times because some of them don‚Äôt even have electricity (so no tv, electronics) thus they just spend it procreating. lol. It makes a lot of sense tho because these are really the people who give birth almost every year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sex education isn‚Äôt just knowing ‚Äúsex causes kids.‚Äù It‚Äôs also about knowing what your contraceptive options are, how to acquire them, their relative effectiveness, how to properly use them, etc. </p>
<p>Thinking that, for instance, pulling out has an equal level of effectiveness to wearing condom is likely to end in you having some kids. Not knowing how to properly put on a condom makes it more likely to fail, and you more likely to wind up having kids. Not knowing that options like an IUD even exist, how they work or how to get one means you are more likely to rely on methods that require constant vigilance, resulting in you slipping up and having kids.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs on top of any superstitious methods that don‚Äôt work at all, or false beliefs about what acts will and won‚Äôt get someone pregnant that are likely to result in unwanted children.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs easy to take a lot of this knowledge for granted when you already know it all, but many people without access to education don‚Äôt know it and don‚Äôt even know what to look for to learn it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue isn't so much that they don't understand how babies are made, but the human drive to have sex is so strong that it tends to overpower common-sense thoughts like, &quot;we shouldn't have sex unprotected because we might have another baby, and we're struggling as it is.&quot; It happens across all socioeconomic groups; it's just that non-impoverished people have better access to health care and education. </p>
<p>In areas where sex ed is lacking there are also a lot of myths that perpetuate about sex and contraception. At one point I worked with some formerly incarcerated women, most of whom were raised in poverty, who firmly believed that things like Norplant and Depo-Provera (very effective forms of long-term contraception) were government experiments designed to sterilize poor people of color. One thing I learned working with disadvantaged populations was that impoverished people have a lot more contact with government agencies than I ever will. I go to the DMV once every few years; I file my taxes annually and I get a letter from Social Security once a year telling me to check my SS account. That's the extent of my interface with the government. Impoverished people constantly interface with the government on city, state and federal levels: Social Security (regular SS and SSDI disability), income support/food stamp agencies, Medicaid, the justice system, sometimes the state child welfare agency, public housing agencies, etc. etc. What they see in their constant interfacing with government agencies does not give them a lot of faith in what the government says, and so messages from the government around &quot;you should do this&quot; - especially if it counters messages they've heard from their religion, or their culture, are viewed very suspiciously. The government also does not always make it easy for people to get reliable birth control through free clinics or Medicaid. For people working a minimum-wage job with no paid leave, who may not have their own transportation, having to go to four medical appointments to get an IUD, or having to go to a monthly appointment just to get birth control pills, is a burden, and people may not follow through if it means loss of a job, or leaving kids alone without childcare.</p>
<p>A great book about poverty in America is Random Family by Adrian Nicole LeBlanc. She followed a Puerto Rican family from the Bronx for over ten years, and one of the central figures in the book had five children by four different fathers, one of whom was incarcerated for manslaughter. It's easy to think we know what's going on in a situation like that from the outside, but from the inside, it becomes clear motivations are complex. Before I read the book I assumed that any time an impoverished teenager had a baby it was by accident, and that's not the case. There are all kinds of reasons why people in poverty make the choices they make.</p></div>		</li>
