			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>On rereading I missed two other elements.</p>
<p>There's something called amplifier hiss, and it was more common as you get farther back in time, where flaws in the circuitry itself leads to that cloudy sound has a kind of constant background. It can be an inherent flaw in particular elements or it can be your response to picking up other electromagnetic interference right down to and including cosmic background radiation. Basically all wires act as a antenna and the more you turn up the gain the more likely you are to amplify whatever that antenna is picking up from the world around you. And unfortunately for the day and age what was around most tubes was other tubes, tape motors, and other sorts of inductors. Even on a modern amplifier in your home if you play nothing but turn the volume way up you're going to get hiss out of the speakers.</p>
<p>There's also wow and flutter. Most tape decks have a motor a belt and a flywheel that control the speed of what's called the capstain. That's that little post that turns pretty fast. A rubber roller holds the tape to that post, so the rotation speed of that post is really the transport speed of the tape. The take up real tries to run slightly faster which keeps the tape pressed firmly against all the read and write heads in the tape deck. The take up reel is also controlled by a motor connected to it by a rubber band. When those rubber bands slip or age or have imperfections you can get a rhythmic distortion that is proportional to the length of the individual rubber bands.</p>
<p>Audio technology and old-fashioned videotape technology has a fascinating set of dependencies on grossly mechanical systems.</p>
<p>It's actually quite fascinating.</p>
<p>But thanks again for the gold, and I hope this addenda explains even more of the example link you provided.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I’m just guessing you’ll be able to go off on the subject.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also a difference between old timey tube amplifiers and more modern solid state electronics. Tube amps had unity damping. Solid state electronics for film recording are highly damped.  Tube amps created higher order signal  content (overtones) which added to the high frequency content.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also some speculation that people started changing their voice to match the voices they heard on recordings because they thought that's what the recording were supposed to sound like. So it's like you get double the effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah this is what i've had in mind. the tenor in the quartet from my edit (in the OP) has a very, <em>very</em> similar timbre to other tenors I hear in recordings from that era. And yet, practically nobody IRL sounds like that in-person... and I work in an opera house. I hear singers all the time, lol. I truly have no idea what some of these 50s artists really sounded like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy shit. That's very interesting. I've liked his music for such a long time, and had never heard this. Aside from production quality, I wonder if it was a marketing scheme to speed it up, considering the legend was that he sold his soul to the devil in exchange for guitar playing ability.</p>
<p>Wonder if they played into that by speeding it up, and making him seem like an even faster player.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The echoes that precede the vocals at the end of &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; are not an example of magnetic print through, although that is a real thing. It's a specific technique employed by Jimmy Page that he called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_echo" target="_blank">&quot;reverse echo.&quot;</a> </p>
<p>Basically, he turned the tape reel over so the vocal would play backwards, added reverb, and recorded it to a new track. When this new track was reversed (back to normal), the reverb came <em>before</em> the vocal, as opposed to after it.</p>
<p>EDIT: Apparently there are <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/led-zeppelin-why-you-hear-robert-plants-vocals-echoing-on-whole-lotta-love.html/" target="_blank">conflicting opinions</a> about whether it was intentional.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In ww2, US army officers could, instead of or in addition to sending a letter home, could speak into a microphone for a couple minutes and it would be recorded onto a 7” record.  The record would be mailed back to the US and the family could put it in the record player and listen to the “voice mail” from overseas.  </p>
<p>Here is my grandfather, complete with that old time sound:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s amazing. Just curious though, what’s going on in the second half? Like it was double recorded or something. </p>
<p>Also your grandfather’s voice on the recording reminds me of Steve Buscemi.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding regarding the second half… I believe the records were intended to be reused and the recipient was supposed to return the record after listening so that it could be re-laquered and re-cut with a new recording.  I suspect that this imperfect process could lead to some of what is heard on the second side.</p></div>		</li>
