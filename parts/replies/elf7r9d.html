			<div class="markdown"><p>Fat enough creams surely do. For some at least.. but it would just feel dirty tbh. </p>
<p>Doesn't feel awesome when sweating through it though. Little pearls building on top. Ugh</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I observed that in last year's summer when I put some sun milk on and went hiking. I sweat a lot. And after a while I could see small blisters develop on my skin. Sweat drops encapsulated in a fat bubble from the sun milk. They looked like very small chicken pox. I was worried at first that they were actual skin blisters but they luckily aren't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If your skin is dry, then...yes, not showering is a great way to avoid the loss of oils in your skin, as well as the &quot;drying&quot; process after hot water (pours are open) causes lots of drying as well.</p></div>		</li>
