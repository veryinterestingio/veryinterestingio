			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on that, seatbelt are considered not necessary for the passenger. The reasoning is that the bus usually drives slower than normal cars and the big mass of the bus helps absorbing the energy in a crash. That said crashes are still dangerous and some buses have seatbelts for the passenger. I'm thinking of tourist busses that travel far and fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Idk. Probably better than untangling a child that has been half-ejected through a window after the bus rolled on its side. </p>
<p>Hard to say though. I've never worked a school bus crash. But all of the seatbelt related fatalities I have worked involved the victim being tossed out of either the front or side windows. All of which would've only been some scratches and maybe a concussion or broken bone if they just wore the damn seat belt. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to take bus trips to go skiing. On one return trip, the highway was covered entirely in packed snow. Driver went over 60 mph for the entire trip, and I seemed to be the only person concerned that bad things would happen if he had to slam on the brakes for any reason. </p>
<p>Edit: by &quot;packed snow&quot; I mean snow that's been packed down by thousands of tires, and is basically an inch of solid ice. Not snow slightly compressed by a person walking on it. Any New England native knows what I'm referring to. It's pretty much as slick as solid ice, and your brakes won't do shit if you have to stop suddenly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every school bus I ever rode on had a governor that didn’t allow the bus to go faster than 50mph. I had several bus drivers confirm this for me, because I was kind of a lonely kid and made friends with my school bus drivers. Not that being ejected from a bus window at 50mph is great, but still.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. My bus got hit by a speeding driver running a red light in high school. Hit the front left of the bus. Our driver was a tank of a guy, he was fine. I was resting my head against the window, left side, and just got a minor headache. Though I did have to wait pertnear 2 hours to get home. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's another interesting aspect of bus design that somewhat mitigates the need for seatbelts. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=EJegZB7KOVY" target="_blank">This crash test video</a> shows what happens when a bus impacts a solid object and stops immediately (which is the worst thing that can happen to a bus but very rare). The body of the bus is designed to slide forward a couple of feet, greatly reducing the deceleration experienced by the riders (and the driver as well).</p></div>		</li>
