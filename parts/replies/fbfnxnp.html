			<div class="markdown"><p>Cardboard is porous, kind of like a sponge.</p>
<p>The adhesive of packaging tape is <em>designed</em> for the purpose but in the most basic way it is squeezed into the pores like little tentacles... It is more of a mechanical bond than a chemical bond, sort of.</p>
<p>You can kind of tell because it's not as <em>sticky</em> as say, duct tape. Packaging tape is more of a pressure adhesive, you have to push the glue down into the pores of cardboard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but he didn't even really explain it.  He just kind of repeated the question as a statement of fact. I don't feel i'm any closer to knowing the answer to what it is about packaging tape that makes it bond so well to fibrous surfaces like cardboard.  &quot;Because it's designed to do that&quot; isn't a very good answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I might compare it to velcro.  The plastic hook side of the velcro sticks really well to the fluffy loop side and other things that have the same fluffy loop texture, but it doesn't stick to things with other textures.  Even matching the wrong hooks with the wrong loops might not stick as well because they aren't the right size.  Packing tape's &quot;hooks&quot; are designed to stick really well to cardboard fiber's &quot;loops&quot;, but it's all happening on a scale that's so tiny you can't even see it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of adding olive oil to water vs ipa to water. The oil doesn't want to be there and sticks to itself, not mingling with the water. The IPA is cool with being in the water and mixes readily. Think of the adhesive as water, HDPE or another plastic as the oil, and cardboard as IPA. This is kinda how the concept of contact angles work which are really important for adhesion. </p>
<p>Next, think of a sponge and a rubber spatula. The sponge has a lot of porosity that can soak up water and it stays there until you wring it out. The spatula has no pores and holds no water. The tape adhesive flows into the cardboard like water in a sponge. It has no where to flow on a spatula, so it just falls off. This is due to surface roughness and the porosity of the substrate. </p>
<p>If you're actually interested at more than I'd tell a five year old Al Pocius covers it in Adhesion and Adhesives Technology.</p></div>		</li>
