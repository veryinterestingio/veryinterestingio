			<div class="markdown"><p>so, the way I understand it, that would be considered an evolutionary advantage right? long ago, when the wolves/cats/whatever's first started drinking that water, the ones that couldn't handle the bacteria died, meanwhile the ones that could handle it survived and passed on those &quot;abilities&quot; to their children. before a while the whole species would be able to fight off those bacteria. does that all sound right? I've been trying to convince a buddy that evolution works and how.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. This isn't actually an example of evolution tbh. The resistance here isn't an evolved trait. The immune system is cool in that it does adaptation in much smaller time scales.</p>
<p>However the development of that whole system that <em>lets</em> animals learn immunity absolutely did evolve, and continues to. </p>
<p>If you want a good example of evolution, look at the flu. The reason we have to get flu shots every year is because the virus evolves every year, to avoid detection by our immune systems. Chicken pox, by comparison, stays dormant in cells for a long time after infection. This means it only needs to infect us once, and so it doesn't have the same 'evolutionary pressure' as the flu. So we don't see a new chicken pox virus every year as a result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>flu virus is not a proper example of evolution.</p>
<p>flu virus is unique in that it has various blocks of DNAs that recombine every time they multiply in our cells. that recombination is very unique in flu group of viruses. this recombination produces different markers that our immunity has difficulty in producing immunity</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very good question, and to clarify, the 'inheriting' of immunity to some disease is through the placenta.  I don't know all the details, but blood and nutrients are exchanged.  Then when the mother is nursing the offspring, some immunity is passed in the milk.  It's not genetically passed, if that makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>&quot;yes, but&quot;</p>
<p>There are disadvantages as well. While an animal may have developed a robust immune system to fight certain pathogens, it would likely be more advantageous <em>overall</em> if they were never exposed to it in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>dude, there's no immunity from bacterias like dysentery vibrios.</p>
<p>animals susceptible to it will get sick whether they have generations worth of immunity from drinking dirty water or not. humans too can drink dirty water without getting sick (people in third world countries don't usually have access to boiled water or treated water). the problem is drinking dirty water increases incidents of water borne diseases and parasites. which is a problem for developing and modern society</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have a tendency to move around and change our environment a lot, so perhaps. If we'd been drinking the exact same muddy water, and our parents had as well, then hypothetically yes. There's always a chance of infection, though - especially in the elderly, very young, and those with otherwise weakened immune systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no.</p>
<p>water borne diseases like dysentery have always been harmful to humans even before we started drinking clean boiled water. we cannot develop immunity against such diseases because humans die within weeks of getting dysentery.</p></div>		</li>
