			<div class="markdown"><p>From a pure probabilistic standpoint, assuming all incoming objects have random trajectories that intersect with Earth, there's also a significantly higher probability that those objects <em>won't</em> come in perpendicularly or even within a few degrees tolerance range of perpendicular to you compared to the range of other potential trajectories.</p>
<p>So not only are perpindicular to near perpendicular trajectory meteors going to be more difficult to see and observe, they're going to be fewer in quantity than the others, making them appear even less frequent than they are.</p>
<p>With that said, you may not be able to view incoming meteor trajectories as completely random due to known structures in the solar system and their gravitational interactions that could possibly skew this distribution as well. I know, for example, there is a certain amount of debate as to if Jupiter's structure and mass helps decrease (or increase) collision potentials with Earth, as well as Earth's moon. These are still debated topics AFIK in astrophysics. Take into account that these structures are moving relative to one another and your distribution may change skewness over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify, most meteors seen during a meteor shower will be coming in on parallel paths.</p>
<p>They are caused when the Earth, travelling at 30km/s, passes through a cloud of debris (from a comet, for example), which is travelling in its own orbit at a similar speed, but on a different path.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The trajectories of incoming objects are not random though. </p>
<p>A random trajectory would be one which had no connection to any physical property of the object or its origins. The trajectories of meteors and other space dross our planet encounters however, are a consequence of actual events, rather than totally random ones. I suppose what I am getting at, is that the trajectories of these objects are no more random than the orbits of the planets, or the motion of our solar system around the galaxy we are in, or the motion of that galaxy relative to every other cosmic signpost, or the motion of the cluster of galaxies we are in relative to other clusters and so on and so forth. </p>
<p>We may lack the computational methodology and power necessary to accurately predict a precise origin point for every piece of space debris we encounter, but that doesn't make them random, it just means we haven't worked out how to make sense of them yet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>or even within a few degrees tolerance range of perpendicular</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mathematically, the probability of impact on a certain surface depends on the area of the section of such surface. Therefore, there is a 50% chance for impact on a circle of r^(2)=1/2 around the perpendicular point. Such circle projects on a sphere unto a cosine of sqrt(2)/2, which simplifies to a nice 45°. It follows that there is a 50% of probability of impact both below and above a 45° angle of incidence.</p></div>		</li>
