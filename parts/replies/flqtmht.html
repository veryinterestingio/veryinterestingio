<p>Try sustained cardio while keeping your breathing as slow and deep as possible without being uncomfortable. </p>
<p>Rage cardio can give you headaches and wear you out quickly because of shallow breathing, so be careful!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Underrated. We humans are utterly fascinating in being able to influence our stress response.. with our mind.
Just for personal emphasis, breathing out kicks in your parasympathetic response which is our bodies regulator (or counter) to the initial stress response.
So, shift your mental framing of the situation and breath out deeply. Recommended when you can't up and go for a 10k run.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find it very hard to come down from that type of anger. The other day I was that mad at someone (happens to me more now that I’m in my 40s and I don’t get it!!) anyway I remember thinking that I needed to do something to get un-mad fast because it was a very uncomfortable feeling and I know it’s not healthy, it’s not a pleasant feeling and I don’t deserve to feel that way (I’m a hard worker, a nice person and the incident in question was WAY out of line, the fault of the other person....truly). But all I could bring myself to do was to hug my baby girl (she is 3) and just let her bring me down out of it. I can’t imagine having the wherewithal to start exercising when I’m trembling with anger and feeling like a rubber noodle, hyperventilating and feeling like a headache is coming. Sigh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's one reason why a lot of people run. You can just go. No counting reps or weights, no equipment, no plan, no need to figure it out, just pour yourself into it and move.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a terrible explanation.  Your cardiovascular system is essentially a closed system - regardless of why your heart is beating faster or blood pressure is increased, your blood is always moving through the same system.  It’s not as if during exercise your blood “goes somewhere else” because there is nowhere else to go.  </p>
<p>The reason exercise is good, but heart rate elevation by other means can be bad comes down to duration.  Exercise lasts for minutes to a few hours, and then you rest.  Other things that tax your cardiovascular system tend to be more chronic: obesity, life stress, etc can last weeks, months, years. So, acute stress (exercise) can be beneficial; chronic stress is bad.  Robert Sapolsky at Stanford wrote some really good books about this.  I saw him give a talk once where he addressed this very issue.  His line that has stuck with me for almost 20 years is “there’s a reason roller coasters don’t last 3 weeks.”</p>
<p>Edited to add why duration matters: Cardiovascular stress, regardless of where it comes from, does damage to your whole body. Immune responses, inflammation, and tissue damage are the big causes, but there are others. Again, in small doses, these small insults won't have a huge effect.  But when they happen chronically you start to have some real problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, thank you. The most important aspect is the duration. Your body can adapt to acute stress in a healthy way, but chronic stress eventually leads to pathology.</p>
<p>Also, the way that the heart adapts to exercise vs chronic high blood pressure is quite different. Both cause your heart muscle to hypertrophy, but without getting into a cardio lecture, exercise leads to adaptations that (for the most part) result in a lower risk of heart disease, and chronic hypertension leads to adaptations that increase your risk.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not a word I use often, but wouldn't that mean chronic stress eventually leads to understanding some type of disease.</p></div>		</li>

There's no harm from the open air, plus if you are dressed like you're working out and running it's very easy to avoid people, and if for some reason they try to talk to you tell them to fuck off and stop interrupting your routine.</p></div>		</li>
