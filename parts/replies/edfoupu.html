			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Computer&quot; oh man I didn't know that, this is the first time I've wanted one of these.  When I was a kid watching a Star Trek movie, I wondered out loud if we'd ever be able to speak commands to a computer.  An adult told me,&quot;It would take a hundreds of years, sorry bud.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, they added it a while after launch. By then, I was used to using &quot;Alexa&quot;, so I never bothered to change it.  That said, I got a Fire Cube, and because it does different things, I have it set to &quot;Computer&quot; so I can talk to it, instead of the rest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be more precise it has no ability to process anything other than the call words. It’s not processing  everything and is such a small chip it couldn’t process it if it wanted to. It can only store like 2 seconds of audio at a time which is just enough to hear the word then offload the first part of your sentence to the device as it loads up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. This is why you can't program it to wake up to custom words. It's literally hard wired in. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not hard-wired, but it requires an offline machine learning model (probably a pre-trained neural net) to be accessible by the wake processor. You could probably update it a lot like a firmware update for other devices, but it would require Amazon to train a model for that specific wake word, so you can't just use arbitrary words.</p></div>		</li>
