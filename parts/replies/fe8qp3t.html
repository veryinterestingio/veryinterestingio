			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, that Warcraft movie was surprisingly good. I usually hate every movie/tv show that is based on video games, but that one was actually much better than I expected</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hated the fact they changed the plot so much from the games. In my mind it kinda undermines the possibility of having sequels. And I'd really love a lich king sequel (which, I admit, isn't a hugely unique opinion).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They should have  made arthas movie instead of warcraft 1.</p>
<p>While it has important info ..starting with movie about arthas would give them insanely good base to make prequels:) .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll say it again: I REALLY wanted to see a Warcraft 3 movie. Or even just an Arthas movie, if they needed a narrower scope. There's just far more interesting stories to pull from than Warcraft 1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this perhaps more telling of the industry then? Like have we already discovered that is easier to get money from gamers for <em>games</em> than it is to get hteir money for a movie, so the industry simply goes where the heat is?</p>
<p>Personally as a gamer I find it hard to justify cinema trips. <em>Wait... you want me to pay to</em> <em>leave my house... share a room with people... watch a story unfold without being able to control the protagonist, skip a boring bit of dialog or even pause the game... and all the while in a chair that doesn't even have RGB... and it's over in TWO HOURS?... oh and there's like 20 mins of unskippable ads... ummmmm... I think I'll stick with playing Minecraft ty</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I'd be happy if they could at least write a movie as good as their cinematics.  The movie was hot trash.  Well, maybe not that bad, but certainly not as good as it could have been... Which coincidentally is the same review I have for Star Wars.</p></div>		</li>
