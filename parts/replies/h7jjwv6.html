<p>You can also try putting ice cold water in the bong.</p>

<p>Some pipes also have an extra long top-segment specifically made for you to place ice in.  The water in the pipe can be room temperature, but having actual ice cubes as a &quot;final stage&quot; essentially will cool the smoke down noticeably.  As the ice melts you have to empty the pipe after a few refills though.  But that's a small price to pay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something I tried once is using an Ice bong (i.e. a Bong with a long wide neck and a narrow part at the bottom that you can stack ice in) but then in addition to the ice in the Bong, I also discovered that you can buy ice cubes that are cylindrical  in shape and have holes down their length (fuck if I know why ice cube bags are sold with them in that shape), but you can use those ice cubes as a mouth piece for bong. Just hold down the ice with pressure on the actual mouth piece so the pressure melts the ice to form a nice tight seal, and take a hit through it. Because the channel is so narrow (much narrower than the whole bong) the  ice contact area/volume smoke is very high and gets you some really cold smoke. Smoothest frigging hit I've ever had.   </p>
<p>(A second effect, though I have no idea how strong, would be that you are actually using a literal type of air conditioning on the smoke: an air cycle machine. You compress the smoke through the narrow channel, this heats it up but the ice immediately bleeds away that heat, and then when you take in the smoke it expands again, and this expansion causes it to cool even further than the temperature it exits the ice at.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is the hole about the right size to fit a normal drinking straw through?</p></div>		</li>
