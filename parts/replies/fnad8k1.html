			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya i use this feature. I'm on my moms cell bill still but pay my percentage to her every month. I can use something like Zalle which would transfer money instantly between my bank account and her bank account that are at the same bank. But I can't set up automatic payments this way. I didn't want to forget to pay every month as I knew my mom wouldnt say anything and just eat the cost of my part of the bill. So I set up auto pay to her and she now gets a mailed check from the bank every month. </p>
<p>Its the dumbest thing but it works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even supposedly instant transfers like Zelle use batch processing on the backend. When you make a Zelle transfer, your bank takes money out of your account and puts it into an account owned by them, and your mom's bank takes money out of an account that they own and sends it to your mom's account. Then those banks use ACH to settle the transaction between them 2-3 days later. So it looks instant to the user, but it's just a mask on the same old process.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is how all banking works (in the US).  It's 40+ year old mainframe back ends with VBA scripts all the way down.  It's terrifying.  If you knew how banks actually worked, day to day, you'd never give them a cent.  Thank god for FDIC.  Save all your paperwork!</p></div>		</li>
