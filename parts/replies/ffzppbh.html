			<div class="markdown"><p>Because automated systems can fail (or can have &quot;bugs&quot; in the software), and because humans typically ignore the &quot;check engine&quot; light, and there's a chance they would do so even in airplanes.</p>
<p>So, while they unload the passengers and luggage at the end of the flight, trained mechanics perform safety checks on the airplane, and then the (next flight) pilots get on first and perform &quot;startup checklists&quot; for half an hour or more as the passengers get loaded in the plane.  </p>
<p>Each button has its own (check engine) warning lights, and if there's a problem they can stop the flight.  You don't want this &quot;safety check / pre-flight check / startup sequence&quot; to be automated, because the point of it is safety, and you don't want to automate safety checks.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Exactly this there is no just turn it on and go. Every single function must be checked and double checked. </p>
<p>If your windshield washer pump blows on the highway you pull over. If the anti-icing system on a plane goes, you might be screwed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Precisely why I've said the idea of flying cars is idiotic and will never happen (until hardcore automation takes control anyway). Look at how bad people are about vehicle maintenance. When was the last time the average person checked their tire air pressure or changed their oil? In a car on the road, if it fails, you pull over (or rumble to a stop). If a plane fails, you fall out of the sky and likely die... and also might hurt people on the ground. So, in addition to the average person already being a shitty driver on an essentially 2D plane, imagine how bad things would be if the third dimension of verticality came into play. And how bad maintenance habits would exacerbate the situation further.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I actually imagine most people won't do a damn thing if that happens. Unless it prevents me from seeing, I wouldn't do anything. Wouldn't even get it replaced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But like, that contingency / backup plan is still on the checklist isnt it?  Why couldn't that be part of the 'one button start'?  Have it yell at you that &quot;the de-icing thing is fucking broken, fix it&quot; and stop/refuse to continue if so.</p></div>		</li>

<p>WHEW that would be an insane liability in commercial and military settings. From the military standpoint, I can assure that pilots dont ignore the &quot;check engine light&quot;. I have personally grounded a jet because I could not get certain errors to go away before launch.</p>
<p>While these fault indications and codes might not be nearly as broad as a check engine light, they do exist for just about every component and are only ignored if it's safe to fly. Ideally the pilots know when this is the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the issue with a check engine light - there's no way for the driver to know whether it's a dirty sensor they could wipe off or if the whole engine is about to melt. But you really don't want to go to the shop every time there's a false positive, where they'll charge you $50 to get a reading and reset a setting.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The check engine light will actually tell you exactly what sensor error occurred.</p>
<p>People are just lazy and dumb.</p>
<p>Every owners manual for a car I've ever seen gives you a chart to decode them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely the best answer on here.</p>
<p>Smaller jets (like Biz jets and even more so the VLJ OR very Light Jets aimed at owner/operators) are more and more getting easier &quot;push button start&quot; than say an original Lear Jet or Citation. The smaller the airplane, the &quot;easier&quot; it is due to less systems in total.</p>
<p>In my work plane (Pilatus PC-12) I can have it started in about 30 seconds, ready to fly in about 2 minutes. What's the difference? Well getting the engine running isn't a big deal. Flip on the main power, open the fuel valves, flip the fuel pump on, throttle to idle, then start. Watch the gauges for oil pressure, temps, etc. If all looks good you are technically able to get airborne. However, powering up the Avionics takes time while it boots, searches for GPS, and self tests. Then you have to load a flight plan if you are operating IFR. Not a technical requirement, but we operate as Part 135 which requires us to always file and fly IFR. Usually this takes a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>Now, if I fly my personal airplane (Piper Arrow) I can go first switch to ready to fly in about 15 seconds. Master on, Beacon On, Mixture Rich, Prop Forward, Throttle Full, Fuel Pump on until Flow indication then Off. Mixture to Cut Off, Throttle closed then open 1/4 inch. Turn mags to start, once started mags to Both, Mixture to rich, throttle to set idle at 800-1000RPM. Check oil pressure and fuel pressure. If all is OK, lean mixture as required for density and ground operations. Avionics bus on, tune and set radios, XPDR/ADS-B, and GPS. Go put airplane shaped holes in the sky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try this in a Mooney, especially hot start. For my instrument check ride, wasn't nervous about tge checkride at all, just getting the thing started. Got lucky, fired up on the first try, examiner looks at me and says &quot;nice going, I know these things are hard to start&quot;, definitely set the checkride off on the right foot. I passed üòÅ. A couple hundred hours in the plane and I've still managed to kill the battery cranking and need an external unit to start.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My Mooney experience is limited to a late 70's M20J that has the same engine as my Arrow. My IO-550 experience is in a Bonanza and hot fuel on that one was mixture lean, throttle cracked, and 80% of the time it had enough residual fuel to cough so you could just bring the mixture up and be fine. The other 20% required the &quot;prime&quot; like I described.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I fly a Pilatus PC-12 air ambulance. I am just the pilot, I have two or three flight nurses in the back that do all the medical stuff, the closest I usually get to the patient is sometimes helping getting them in and out of the plane.</p>
<p>Pros:
Best office with the best view.
Get to see a lot of the country. Fly into tiny towns and large cities.
You meet some really awesome people.
Decent pay. I am not rich, but the bills are paid and there is still some money left over.
The airplane is a blast to fly.</p>
<p>Cons:
Weird, crazy hours. Might fly all night, sleep during the day, then switch to flying a day, then back to nights. There are mandatory time off, but it doesn't make it easy.
A LOT of just waiting around. While the nurses go with the patient to the hospital, I stay at the airport. If you're lucky there is a pilot lounge and transportation to get food. Quite often it is a unattended airport at some small town, so you sit in the plane and wait. I always bring a couple of books to read.
If you have a family, the hours can be tough. Definitely easier to do if you are single and without kids.</p>
<p>There are plenty of flying jobs that aren't working for an airline. Just search GA (General Aviation) pilot jobs. Air Ambulance, Corporate, Charter, Crop Dusting, Aircraft Delivery, Aircraft Testing, Flight Instruction, Aerial surveying, etc. All have Pros and Cons.</p>
<p>Best of luck to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never flown a F-16. I believe they require a Ground Power Unit/Air Start Unit in order to get the engine started. There is a hydrazine fueled EPU (Emergency Power Unit), but as far as I am aware it is not used to start up the aircraft. There are probably some decent checklists available online.</p></div>		</li>
