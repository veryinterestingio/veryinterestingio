			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent response. American women apparently used to 'faint' also, just collapse unconscious, whenever they were stressed out or shocked by some uncomfortable event. I haven't even heard of them doing it for 40 years or more, never seen it happen except in old movies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, thanks for that! Quite a rabbit hole I fell down reading about that. Amazing the cultural implications of this in different areas. I'm from deep rural Kentucky and grew up in the nazarene and Pentecostal churches and you can witness the same kind of induced hysteria during a sermon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it should be noted that the dancing was actually encouraged at some point in the beginning of the outbreak as a possible cure. Which of course made it worse. Despite this, the idea that dancing it out might help could have easily spread. If you start dancing and never stop dancing, maybe it's a sign that you need to keep dancing? God does work in mysterious ways after all...</p>
<p>EDIT: I just found out about a movement disorder that occurs <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydenham%27s_chorea" target="_blank">6-8 months after a Streptococcus infection...</a> This disorder is known as Sydenham's chorea, minor chorea (chorea stemming from the Greek word for 'to dance', khoreia), or St Vitus' dance. <a href="https://i.makeagif.com/media/4-18-2016/HCRt2K.gif" target="_blank">Here is a .gif of a child presenting symptoms.</a></p>
<p>It also checks some other boxes. Most of those afflicted eventually spontaneously recover and it more commonly affects girls than boys, which it would appear, most of those afflicted with the dancing plague were women. The only real iffy bit is that this typically only affects those under the age of 16 and when it occurs in adults, those adults had had it as a child. Probably not the culprit, but still very interesting and super spoopy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The disease is actually named after the dancing plague. But I haven't seen any serious parallels drawn between the two. Most accounts seem to chalk it entirely up to a cultural phenomenon, akin to possessed individuals speaking in tongues. However there is a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Die_Wallfahrt_der_Fallsuechtigen_nach_Meulebeeck.jpg" target="_blank">1642 engraving</a>, along with the <a href="http://blog.europeana.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/dance2.jpg" target="_blank">1564 drawing(one)</a> --- <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Pieter_Brueghel%2C_the_Elder._%C2%ABThe_Dancing_Mania._Pilgrimage_of_the_Epileptics_to_the_Church_at_Molenbeek%C2%BB._1564.jpg" target="_blank">(two)</a> it was based upon, which shows a handful of women being supported under both arms who would appear contorted in very much the same manner that those afflicted by the real disease appear to be. And by all accounts at least some of the dancing plague victims are described as moving in much the same way. </p>
<p>I would not be at all surprised if this was in part initiated and/or sustained by some instances of an adulthood reemergence of the disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, that's crazy. I had no idea movement disorders like that could be caused by a Strep infection! Having experienced severe akathisia before (another type of movement disorder), I can honestly understand how it might make someone dance (or at least move about purposelessly) until they died.</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BrdigeTrlol" target="_blank">BrdigeTrlol</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! It would appear that it's actually the result of an autoimmune disease that surfaces as the result of a group A streptococcus infection. Basically, there are some similarities between this group of bacteria and the surface proteins of certain subsets of dopaminergic neurons (those presenting, in particular, dopamine D2 receptors as well as D1 receptors) which results in the production of antibodies which destroy the aforementioned cells present in the basal ganglia. As you may know, dopaminergic neurons play a vital role in motor controls and their destruction (or, to be precise, the consequent imbalance in receptor signaling; the ratio of anti-D2R to anti-D1R autoantibodies is strongly associated with symptoms) leaves the afflicted with a movement disorder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how likely is it that mass shootings are the new &quot;dancing plague&quot; in the U.S., in a way? Triggered by bottled up social and economic tensions, &quot;contagious&quot; to a specific demographic (young white males), etc., it feels like it's become a socially &quot;acceptable&quot; (re: highly visible) way of expressing a breaking point in someone's personal life or psyche</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why a number of people (myself included) want mass shootings to stop being covered so thoroughly on the news.  Not because we want to sweep it under the rug, but because we want to stop communicating, &quot;this is a thing you can do when you're feeling disenfranchised and feel you have no way out, and everyone will know your name.&quot;</p>
<p>I was young in the 90's, but I remember hearing a lot about pipe bombs.  Those have only become easier to make, but they remain uncommon.   I have to wonder if that's in part because of the coverage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why I was so impressed with the response to the New Zealand shooting in focusing on the victims and their families rather than the name of the shooter. I hope the press continue to do this to reduce the infamy of mass shooters so they don't inspire copycats in quite that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also think that this is why mass shootings are unique to the U.S. when it's really not that hard to get a firearm anywhere in the world, especially if you don't care what happens afterwards. People in other countries do acid attacks or mass stabbings because that's the narrative in their culture.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hold your horses there. You are trending awfully close to suggesting that there is a certain &quot;culture of violence&quot; in the U.S. that encourages dramatic displays of violence. People really don't want to hear that ubiquitous violent media may have the effect of triggering violence in some ill people.</p></div>		</li>
