			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually wrong. I just took a microbiology course and it explains that the botulism spore when it enters and becomes the bacteria in the vegetative state it cannot compete with the microorganisms currently living inside you. Babies have yet to be colonized and develop an internal flora so the bacteria that causes botulism can flourish as it has no competition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The right answer is multifactorial.</p>
<p>Higher stomach pH in infants contributes to early germination.</p>
<p>Lack of commensal bacteria in infants means C. botulinum can flourish. However, this organism does not colonize the GI tract. Adults can often pass the spores in stools before they germinate and produce toxins.</p>
<p>Infants have poor GI motility compared to adults so the spores have time to germinate and produce toxins before being passed in stool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is mostly right - HOWEVER it is not because our stomach acid prevents it from growing. Babies have normal stomach acid just like us. What they DONT have is a gut microbiome (gut flora which are symbiotic bacteria) which is mature yet. Adults have a functional microbiome which is active and outcompetes the spores and does not allow the spores to germinate and fully grow into a complete botulinum bacterium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes... syndrome similar to infant botulism (adult intestinal toxemia botulism) has been rarely observed in immunocompromised adults, those using antimicrobials, or those with some anatomical or functional bowel abnormality (2). The symptoms are similar to those of foodborne botulism (10).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing that's interesting is pediatricians don't seem to know a more precise age where it is safe, but all agree that 1 year is safe by a reasonable margin.  They can't test babies to see if they get sick from honey as it would be hella unethical and unnecessary.</p>
<p>This came up as an interesting question when our twins were young.  There is a Jewish tradition to eat apples with honey on Rosh Hashana, which was when they were 10 or 11 months.  A pretty tasty tradition. :) We wanted them to participate, so we asked the pediatrician.  He said it might be OK, but we don't know for sure, so he wouldn't risk it.  We agreed and did apples and agave syrup for them their first year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As u/vladcat pointed out, it's not actually a stomach acid issue, it's a gut microbe issue, but other than that you're correct.  The difficulty is that each baby develops differently at a different rate and things like gut microbes are <em>very</em> dependent on what the parents feed the baby.  The range in the 'safe' amount of time is probably pretty large as a result, so it's safer to just assign a large safety margin.</p>
<p>I was apparently eating honey at a <em>very</em> young age, much younger than what's considered &quot;safe&quot; now, but I grew up eating everything, as well as spending almost all of my time outside getting dirty.  Both of those lead to really diverse gut flora and a strong immune system as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it's not &quot;if baby stomach acid is strong enough&quot;, it's &quot;do babies have have enough stomach acid,&quot; which is a more complicated thing to test, and varies wildly. Probably not worth it when &quot;don't give your baby honey until they are one&quot; will suffice.</p></div>		</li>
