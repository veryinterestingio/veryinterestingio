			<div class="markdown"><p>Mustard oil is EXTREMELY volatile if you cook with it. I use it to make Mostarda but you need to mind not to add too much of it (few drops at a time) or to do that in a well ventilated area. When you add it to a warm dish it evaporates a lot and you will get like a wall of spice that hits you at once. I guess it is exactly because of its content of isotiocyanate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US 99% of “wasabi” is a combination of horseradish, hot mustard and green dye. So it’s not wasabi cut with horseradish it’s just horseradish. </p>
<p>Even in Japan most wasabi (&gt;90%) sold is imitation. Real wasabi is like $160 a kilogram wholesale. Not only is it costly but it loses flavor very quickly. After you grate the wasabi stem you got like 15 minutes before the flavor starts to deteriorate.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>90% of the Wasabi is definitely not the fresh grated stuff. But it's common enough here (Japan) that actual Wasabi is an ingredient many of the pastes. If you look at <a href="http://kurabeta.jp/wasabi/" target="_blank">this page here</a> you will see a breakdown and reviews of a bunch of different pastes. Anything that has 本わさび written is 100% real Wasabi. If you Ctrl+F down to ハウス 料亭 生わさび you will see that the Wasabi used in it is 100% real Wasabi and not cut with horseradish. And a tub is the super expensive price of 225 yen or $2.25 about.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's safe to say, that unless you had it in a expensive restaurant in Japan, you haven't eaten real wasabi. It's hard to get outside Japan and pretty expensive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Most good sushi restaurants in big cities will have it, but you have to ask for it and be prepared to pay extra for it.  I'd say that I'm able to get it at a new random sushi restaurant about 25% of the time and 100% of the time at my regular places. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The Naked Fish in Lake Tahoe, for example, usually has it despite being out of the character you'd expect to. </p></div>		</li>
