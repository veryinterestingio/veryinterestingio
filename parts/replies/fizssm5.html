			<div class="markdown"><p>I went to Cal Poly Pomona for my bachelors in finance. They have computer labs everywhere but they have particular lab that’s only Bloomberg terminals. There’s like 15 computers in there and from what I heard their cost is like 10k a year because it’s a school. Your description is perfect it literally looks like a system that hasn’t been updated in 30 years. </p>
<p>It’s super important though I guess. There was a free program where you basically work at your own pace and it teaches you the functions of the terminal. It takes about 8 hours to do. It could be updated and much more user friendly but it hasn’t been. Once you’re done you get a stupid certificate and it feels like a joke. I was told to put it on my resume and I was like really? It’s 1 day of instruction that could probably be done in like 3 hours with an instructor. I put it on my resume and everywhere I interviewed they asked me about it and put it down as a huge plus. Idk</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The extreme emphasis placed on easily acquired skills has always driven me crazy about the hiring process. Usually it’s in the form of, “you’re almost perfect for this job, we absolutely love everything about your resume and your 12 years of experience in x, y, z but unfortunately we need someone who knows <em>insert skill that could be easily learned in a matter of days or hours.</em>”</p></div>		</li>

<p>We just got done hiring a new applications developer and struggled so hard to explain this to HR.  They wanted a hard and fast list of very well-defined programming languages and technologies to cross-check resumes against, but we were being super flexible, because we know that if you have a few years of programming and development experience in <em>any</em> technology, most of those skills are transferrable and new languages/IDEs/paradigms are very easy to pick up.  At the end of the day, they made us read and sift through all the resumes, which is what we wanted anyway :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work on a trading floor at one of the biggest banks in the world. There’s probably 200 people on my floor and everyone has a terminal. It may seem old and ugly, but it is single handedly the most powerful tool for anyone working in the industry. </p>
<p>It compiles all news from any source around the world. For instance, you can load the ticker for Apple, AAPL, and get a stream of news articles about the company. I’ve also noticed you get the news first. I’ve seen a Wall Street journal article hit the newsfeed on a Bloomberg terminal and then gone and checked the wsj website and it’s not there yet. </p>
<p>It allows you to do complex analysis of any kind of investment, stocks, bonds, options, you name it. It also allows you to view all historical financials of a company. If you want to go pull financial info on Apple from the year 2000 you can navigate to it in seconds.</p>
<p>It also allows you to get up to date pricing on securities in markets around the world and execute trades with people anywhere, anytime. It’s messaging system let’s you contact anyone with a terminal whenever you want. You just have to type their name in and you’re instantly instant messaging with them. </p>
<p>Im going to stop here because the truth is it is such a powerful and important tool that I can list hundreds of functions and uses it has and I’d just be getting started. There really is no end to what it can do. Yes it’s ugly, but it works well and in my opinion the financial system would collapse if all Bloomberg terminals were to disappear.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What does this mean specifically?  You can type in your own formula's against data sets?  SQL style queries?  Or what, exactly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an IT guy as well this intrigues me. I’m guessing with trading like this and massive amounts of money, things like latency are huge factors in your work because people want the most up to date info the fastest and to submit their trades the fastest. How do you guys handle that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work for a Bloomberg Terminal competitor that was acquired by Thomson and our product was merged into Thomson One.  I left the company shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>Bloomberg may look the same as it did on the 80s, but its competitors look like every web page in 2002.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try getting traders to spend 5 minutes focusing on a new UI and how to use it. Then deal with the fallout for making them use something that cost them a few extra seconds (and lots of $$$) getting a trade through because they had to stumble through a different UI. That’s why it hasn’t been changed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heh, I remember when the Bloomberg terminal was an actual, physical terminal that cost an arm and a leg and ran a completely proprietary system and network, from before the pre-internet days and through the first few years of the commercial Internet.</p>
<p>I actually interviewed for a job with them when I was living in Brazil. They made me an offer but I didn't accept for personal reasons. Anyway, that's how I got to talk to some of the devs and admins of the system, and I was told that &quot;The Bloomberg&quot; would never run TCP/IP, would never be on the internet, and would never be a program running on a generic PC. The idea was that they thought that their proprietary system gave them a competitive advantage. That mindset didn't last long though, once bank after bank started demanding changes.</p></div>		</li>
