			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha! Well, I imagine you'd get a bunch of dopamine but the cortisol (stress chemical) that makes you aware of being hungry would keep coming back when it realises you're not actually putting anything in your stomach.</p>
<p>It'd be a rocky ride mentally I'm sure ha!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm paraphrasing from a psychology book, based on many studies of neurochemistry. Dopamine fires before you eat and then depletes over a short time, along with the cortisol from being hungry. Happy to read any sources you can provide to the contrary.</p>
<p>Edit: re-reading this, it sounds like I'm being shitty!
I'm not - genuinely interested to read anything you know of.</p></div>		</li>
