			<div class="markdown"><p>Those bands of brain waves are really just a breakdown of the frequency components of the overall eeg signal and don't have any kind of biological basis. The idea that a mechanical vibration would somehow correspond to minute changes in large scale brain activity is unfounded.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that looks cool. I have no doubt that system help people sleep . I have a problem with your connection between those eeg bands and the same vibration frequency as the reason they fall asleep. Doesn't seem like the two articles there make any hypotheses about linking the two</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ford even recognized this and built a baby vibrating car seat that mimics road vibration. This is why babies fall asleep during a drive</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Is the cause of babies falling a sleep in a car, the fact that Ford recognizes something?</p>
<p>I know that's not what you mean, but what <em>do</em> you mean?</p></div>		</li>
