			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s supposedly a “feature” of Phillips bits- the driver / fastener combo won’t let you over-torque the fastener that way. </p>
<p>Personally I hate Phillips and hope to live to see it replaced by, well, practically anything else. Torx or hex would be fine by me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was to keep auto workers from over tightening and then breaking screws.</p>
<p>It's also cheap to make and easy to use so it will always have a place in stuff like construction where you just need to stick a bunch of fasteners into something and they only need to be tight enough.</p>
<p>I personally hate flat head screws. They were cool in 1870 when there wasn't technology for anything else, now the only use for a flat head screw driver should be as a pry bar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Flathead can fuck off and die. Phillips is great for relay and terminal block wiring. Can eat shit otherwise, honestly but I can't think of a single use for flathead that it's superior at.</p></div>		</li>
