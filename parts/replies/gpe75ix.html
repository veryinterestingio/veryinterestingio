			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you mean case fatality rate (deaths per recognized infection) and not mortality rate (overall number of deaths). But still, we don't know the actual infection fatality rate (deaths per infection, including not recognized/tested ones), and therefore cannot really tell whether the virus itself has changed. At the very least, changes in diagnosing cases (for example, in the beginning mostly very sick people were tested) are so large that they drown out any potential changes of the underlying disease. What you propose is of course still possible, but probably not the main factor in the drastic differences in case fatality rates in different regions and at different times.</p></div>		</li>
