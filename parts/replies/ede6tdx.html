			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually the opposite. Sildenafil (Viagara) is metabolized by CYP3A4, which is the same enzyme that is inhibited by bergamottin, one of the chemicals in grapefruit juice. If you inhibit the drug's metabolic pathway you wind up with more of the drug in your system, which can lead to a greater effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're thinking of Terfenadine. CYP3A4, which bergamottin inhibits, is only responsible for about 5% of Fexofenadine metabolism.</p>
<p>Terfenadine is a prodrug of Fexofenadine, and is metabolized to Fexofenadine extremely rapidly by CYP3A4. However, Terfenadine causes QT prolongation, which is a type of heart arrhythmia. So if CYP3A4 is inhibited, Terfenadine accumulates, and people have heart attacks.</p>
<p>Eventually people realized it made more sense to just give people Fexofenadine, so Terfenadine (aka Seldane) was pulled from the market.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but there are two types of Earl Grey tea: one with pure bergamote oils, and other with processed essence without bergamotin. The second one (usually the cheaper tea) supposes no problem. The first one, depends on the amount. A cup of tea shouldn't be a lot, but if you drink heavily you should take it in consideration. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really high end Earl Greys might still use real bergamot oil. But I think most use a synthetic or natural analogue. Fun fact: Earl Grey is the first blended tea and was used to sell inferior tea to unsuspecting Brits as it was flavoured with Italian oranges. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Medications work like keys on the cells of your body. </p>
<p>But, since your body doesn't always want things opened, it breaks the keys.</p>
<p>Grapefruit has something in it that slows down the key-breakers, so the medication can open more locks than you really want to.</p></div>		</li>
