			<div class="markdown"><p>Vira are probably too erratic to count upon for sustenance, meaning that only vira themselves would be capable of existing in a state that would allow this, but since they aren‚Äôt alive/capable of autonomous replication they wouldn‚Äôt be viable for reproducing via another virus either.</p>
<p>It doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt exist, but it‚Äôs very unlikely.</p>
<p>There are plenty of life forms that can break down (and probably utilise) vira, but ultimately that would not be a primary source or sustenance.</p></div>		</li>

So I'd say it is odds-on that virus particles make up at least part of the diet of filter feeding animals. While viruses are very small, there are a lot of them in seawater.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By erratic, do you mean that they would not be a reliable food source?  </p>
<p>If so, I could see that being the case on dry land, but as written in Wikipedia &quot;up to 9x10^8 virions per millilitre have been found in microbial mats at the surface&quot; (of the ocean). Presumably something could just float at the surface of the ocean and just suck up viral particles for food?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Viruses would only provide sustenance via their inherent structure., they have no means to produce their own nutrients.  They are also very small and only appear in large numbers if they are in a host already.  At that point feeding off the same host would be a much better tactic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is quite a bit of research going into phage therapy. Good place to start:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phage_therapy" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phage_therapy</a>
There are numerous hurdles to overcome though. The details are quite technical in a biochemical/molecularbiological way. Basically it's hard to find/produce phages that only target specific bacteria.
Also we don't really know a lot about them yet. How much to use? Can a treatment lead to bacteria becoming resistant?</p>
<p>But to answer. Yes it's possible and yes there is research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Phage therapy was somewhat popular in the former Soviet Union, and particularly in Georgia.  As u/Lord-Fridge says though, more work is needed to understand how they could be useful on a more widespread basis.  A number of biotech companies are looking at phage therapy for livestock infections, in order to reduce antibiotic usage in farming.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hey, if you‚Äôre a bit more interested, I‚Äôll highly suggest the book ‚Äúthe perfect predator‚Äù It details a guy getting infected by literal superbacteria and how he got treated by phages. The book offers some very interesting answers to the questions you stated, and even though it‚Äôs a very small sample size, there is a lot to learn from this case. </p>
<p>not to mention that the book is gripping as hell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It‚Äôs certainly possible with bacteria. We can edit the bacterial genome by removing part of it and replacing it with genes that will code for something else (which is how we use bacteria to synthesise insulin, for example). I can‚Äôt point to any specific examples of research right now, it‚Äôs been a while since I looked so my memory is hazy, but it‚Äôs not outside the realm of possibility to ‚Äútrain‚Äù, as it were, bacteria to attack disease-causing pathogens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A primary way coding information is passed into bacteria is with plasmids, essentially, they're free-floating rings of coding info which bacteria can often be induced to take on artificially. This is another way bacteria can take on coding information without splicing anything into or out of their primary genome, which I though would be useful to mention as an adjunct to the info you provided.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another common hyperparasitic fungus is the gourmet &quot;Lobster&quot; mushroom. It is the result of a number of <em>Russula</em> mushrooms being parsitized by <em>Hypomyces lactifluorum</em>. Quite tasty, though tricky to wild gather as you can't absolutely guarantee the host organism is a non-toxic species.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lobster mushrooms are <em>really</em> great on the right host. </p>
<p>Another type of fungal parasite that is not a microbe, but it's incredibly cool and still works in this thread's context, is mycoheterotrophic plants. They produce little to no chlorophyll and subsist by parasitising fungi. </p>
<p>Most folks in America have seen ghost pipes, but don't know how incredibly cool they are!</p>
