			<div class="markdown"><p>Sera from other species only get used when the benefits outweight the risks. So if you're going to die from a snakebite, the late complications from serum sickness are worth it.
Allergy is an issue, but not like you would think. People who work with horses shouldn't get horse anti-venom because they can already be allergic, which is weird because it's not like they're exposed to horse serum by itself before hand.
The foreign antibodies don't trigger allergy the first time around. Instead, the human immune system makes antibodies to the foreign antibodies. Because there are two chains in each antibody, and multiple potential antigen sites, big clumps of interconnected proteins precipitate in small vessels and cooler areas for the body a few weeks after injection. It's a potential disaster, damaging kidneys and small vessels and other organs.
Serum sickness is avoided as much as possible by purifying serum and using as little as possible, but it used to a much bigger problem.</p></div>		</li>
