			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn’t cooling more of a problem in space ships/stations anyway? Like they use infrared radiators or something to vent waste heat otherwise it’d get too hot.</p>
<p>I could also be making that up tho.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep cooling is a large problem in space. Especially if you are using solar panels for electricity because, by their nature, capture the suns energy. </p>
<p>Likewise heating can be an issue in the dark if their aren’t enough heat producers. This can lead to battery failures and the like from excessive cold. Many long term exploration craft used plutonium RTGs both for electricity and for heating. </p>
<p>All depends on where you are and what you are doing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just throwing this out there, wouldn’t using solar panels decrease the amount of thermal energy transferred to a space craft since some of the energy of the light is converted to electricity?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Thats why pretty much the first thing the shuttle would do when it reached space would be to open the cargo door to vent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I actually worked on Virgin Galactics space suits and the two big things we had to worry about were flammability and insulation. Our first prototypes were basically just a fleeced base layer, but VG came back and demanded we make it “cooler” ... so now they’re metallic onesies with questionable pocket placement and everyone seems really excited about it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to use air and water as an example of this. </p>
<p>Imagine sitting in 100 degree air, compared to 100 degree water (40C).   The water feels much hotter because of higher thermal conductivity (and thermal capacity). </p>
<p>Same thing on the cold side. Cold water feels much more intensely cold than air of the same temperature. </p>
<p>Space is basically the same thing, but in the opposite direction. It’s less than air, so the cold really doesn’t hit as hard, despite being much much colder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to think of it as: in space, you're basically in a giant hydroflask. If anything, the insulation in your suit is to protect you from getting burnt up by energy from the sun, which your strategically white suit still isn't able to perfectly reflect.</p></div>		</li>
