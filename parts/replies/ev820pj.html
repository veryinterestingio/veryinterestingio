			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a different effect, right? An arc is when the electric field reaches the electric breakdown field strength of the medium, and the medium becomes conductive. A stream of electrons from the source isn't really the same.</p>
<p>I vaguely recall reading something about vacuum electric breakdown in an old textbook, so I think it can happen, but I forget the details. I wonder if a field with enough energy density can spontaneously create particles for conduction to occur?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, if you reach the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwinger_limit" target="_blank">Schwinger limit</a> you get electron/positron pairs from the vacuum. We are still quite a bit away from that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a basic x-ray tube. Cathode with molybdenum filaments inside a focusing cup. An electron cloud is formed at said filament with the cloud size being determined by the selected miliamperage.  The anode side is normally a tungsten target (molybdenum in some applications). The formed electron cloud is accelerated across the tube in a vacuum, which is a function of applied Kilovoltage. When the electrons collide with the target x-rays are emitted. The deceleration of the electron is called Bremsstrahlung or breaking radiation referring to this effect.</p></div>		</li>
