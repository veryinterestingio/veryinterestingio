			<div class="markdown"><p>I snore on average 2 minutes per night, according to an app, so I don;t think that's it. And I never sleep on my back. BUT, I do suffer from bruxism (clenching and chattering my teeth during sleep), so that might be my answer?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only is that type of sleep normal, it's arguably <em>more</em> normal than sleeping completely uninterrupted through the night. Thanks to the invention of the electric light, we can kind of extend the day (and, thus condense the night) however much we want: if you need 8 hours of sleep, you turn out the light at 10 pm and wake at 6 am.</p>
<p>Back in olden times, though, if it got dark at 6 pm, you tended to go to bed around 6 pm. You might wake after a few hours, stir for a while (go pee, get a drink, have sex, whatever) then go back to sleep for awhile, wake again, and so on until the sun came up.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Wehr" target="_blank">one study in the 90's</a>, volunteers were put in an environment that's dark for 14 hours per day and permitted to sleep as much as they wanted. After the first couple of days adjustment (read: catching up on sleep), subjects slept for an average of 8 hours per night across two blocks. The typical pattern was they laid awake for a couple hours, slept for about 3-5 hours, woke for another couple hours, then slept the remaining 3-5 hours.</p></div>		</li>
