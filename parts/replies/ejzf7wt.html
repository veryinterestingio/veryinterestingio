			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed all animals show behavioral issues! I think one of the most notable as of late was the story of the Penguin, Grape-kun. Paraphased from wiki.</p>
<p>After a decade-long relationship, Midori later left him for a younger penguin, which led Grape-kun to become isolated from the other penguins.</p>
<p>Grape-kun was the one who fell in love with a anime cut-out. He stares at the cut-out so much they had to remove the cut-out so he would eat.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, I had a cat that kept licking the same part of his body and made it bleed. We put a cone on his head and that stopped him and the hair started to grow back so we were pretty excited. Took the cone off and he went right back to licking. </p>
<p>Anyway, not sure if that counts as neurotic, but he was in general a crazy cat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a cat who, for about 2 years when I had different room-mates in a different house, licked his fur off his ribs. </p>
<p>When I moved into a different house and got non-smoking room-mates he cleared up within a few months, and 2 years later he doesn't have the issue anymore. </p>
<p>When it comes to excessive licking I've learned diet, anxiety, allergy in that order of deduction (allergy always the most expensive change.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Acral lick dermatitis aka lick granuloma - it’s largely a psychological condition related to stress and anxiety (from boredom, separation etc) but can be caused by allergies (environmental and or food). It’s found in both dogs and cats (more often dogs). Regardless of the cause, once it’s an open sorr, the behavior gets reinforced because the excessive licking release endorphins reinforcing the compulsion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Buddy of mine had a beagle that did the same thing.  He would lick his balls until they bled.  They had to put a cone on his head, which he wore permanently (his entire life).  He also had to give him Prozac daily which mellowed him out.  Not sure of the full details, but was definitely debilitating, but he lived a full life and was a cool dog otherwise.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If the gorilla was compulsively and frequently tearing off scabbed flesh, I would assume the gorilla is anxious or bored, possibly due to the zoo environment.</p>

<p>Birds can pluck themselves when they're anxious or bored, so i wouldn't be at all surprised if the gorilla was experiencing some himself</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And elephants sway back and forth :( </p>
<p>I was at the zoo and watched the elephant, it looked like it was having fun but later I learned it's a neurotic behavior. I know zoos do good things but we really have to learn to give them more room and better habitats and, ofc, things to keep them occupied. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or disband the whole concept. We have excellent media and much cheaper access to travel now. There's no need need to keep all the animals caged up just so people can have one or two fond childhood memories at an exhibit.</p>
<p>This isn't coming from an animal rights activist. Just a guy who considers zoos to be a very expensive for what they're worth nowadays, plus the animals are miserable. </p></div>		</li>
