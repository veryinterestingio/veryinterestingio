			<div class="markdown"><p>Glad I could help! I get this as an allergy symptom too. Although what I said above about decongestants and antihistamines is the best long-term treatment, warm ear drops can be a helpful short-term fix. Ear drops are designed to break down solid wax with oils and allow it to flow out of the ear without irritating or over-drying the ear canal, and although excessive wax isn't really the problem with allergic ear itch they can also feel very soothing to the irritated skin (especially if you warm them up first, but test the temperature first to make sure it's not too hot, both to avoid damaging sensitive skin and because putting something too hot or too cold into your ear can cause dizziness). Olive oil with a dropper also works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this info! I had what I believe was an ear infection (burning and itching sensation in my left ear) couple of months ago from used earbuds. The infection went away after couple of weeks and I was using earache drops, as well as some earwax removal aid. However, a sensation of fullness in my ear hasn’t gone away and I still have it after several months. There is no pain (unless I try to unplug it with a q-tip and I know I shouldn’t use them), but it gets really annoying sometimes and I feel out of balance if it gets really congested. I noticed that it helps when I direct warm water directly into my ear when taking a shower. Can you please suggest any decongestants because I don’t know what to use anymore? I even tried St. Johns Wort as alternative but to no avail..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would recommend seeing a doctor soon if you can, because you might need antibiotics if the infection hasn't cleared after this long. In the meantime:</p>
<p>Pseudoephedrine is the most effective oral decongestant, although it can make you feel a little loopy. You should check to make sure it won't interact negatively with any other medications you take. Pseudoephedrine will be sold behind the pharmacy counter in the US. Lots of OTC allergy and cold medicines have phenylephrine as a decongestant ingredient instead so they can be stocked on the shelves, but it's not nearly as effective (possibly not effective at all, the research is mixed).</p>
<p>A nasal spray decongestant can also work (something like Afrin), although for it to be effective for this issue you have to make sure you inhale it deeply so it gets deep into the sinuses, and you shouldn't use spray decongestants for more than a few days (using them for longer than that can cause you to develop rebound congestion once you stop using it, making you dependent on it, and can dry out the sinuses). </p>
<p>The sensation of fullness comes from the inner ear, so anything you do to your ear canal is unlikely to help. The warm water in the shower might be helping with the inflammation as heat transfers through the ear drum into the inner ear, but frequently getting water in your ear isn't great long term because water remaining in the ear can lead to swimmer's ear, and the water hitting your ear drum can irritate it. Instead I would recommend holding a warm compress on the outside of the affected ear.</p></div>		</li>
