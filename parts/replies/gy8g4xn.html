			<div class="markdown"><p>The sentence “I can’t” works just fine. So do “He isn’t”, “She isn’t”, “They aren’t”. </p>
<p>I wonder if it’s because in speech, “it’s” is ambiguous with “its”. This seems to be the case also with “They’re”, which sounds weird. Maybe it’s because it’s ambiguous with “their” and “there”.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's such a wild contraction!</p>
<p>&quot;I ain't gonna do it&quot;
&quot;You ain't gonna do it&quot;
&quot;They ain't gonna do it&quot;
&quot;That ain't my dog&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rule is that we don't end a sentence with a contracted verb or auxiliary verb. Contracting &quot;not&quot; is fine. (Though, there is also good reason to believe that n’t has evolved away from a contraction into a full suffix, which would make it not subject to the contraction rule.)</p></div>		</li>
