			<div class="markdown"><p>3 things are absorbed by your stomach lining:</p>
<p>Alcohol
Caffeine
Aspirin</p>
<p>This is why they hit you so fast and should be closely monitored. Also why aspirin is recommended in a heart attack - your stomach will begin processing it faster than most medical personnel can get to the patient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point. I'd also recommend an Irish coffee in case of a heart attack too then. Even if you don't make it, you'll at least die happy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know other people commented on the aspirin. I've been a paramedic for 10 years. Aspirin should be chewed in the suspicion of a cardiac event as chewed aspirin gets absorbed in the mouth and takes effect within 7 minutes. Daily aspirin on the other hand should be swallowed only.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've quit with both Chantix and cold turkey. The chantix is effective, but really wild mood swings. (I was dating a girl at the time and we were both quitting and both taking Chantix and it was not pretty. We fought constantly when before we are both super laid back).</p>
<p>Cold turkey is the way to go. I've read, and experienced, that cravings last 2-3 minutes. So when you feel a craving, actively distract yourself for a couple minutes (I personally like brain games and puzzles on my phone).</p>
<p>The first few days suck, but its definitely possible. PM me if you wanna chat or just want support. You got this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>a huge help was vaping to get off smoking. start with a high nicotine then ramp down little by little. i think i went from 16mg to 12, 8, 6, 3, 1, then mixed 0 and 1 until one day i forgot to take my ecig and i didnt think about it all day</p>
<p>very easy cessation. and the benefits are very quick. no smoke smell, no tar</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're probably sick of people talking to you about quitting, so I'll keep it short. Took me a long time to quit, and it wears you down until you're terrified you can't stop and it's going to kill you... I read Alan Carr's 'Easyway to Stop Smoking'. A quick, effective and fun way to stop, in my experience</p></div>		</li>
