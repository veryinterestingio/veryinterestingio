			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya know, out of curiosity I bought a 20 pack of piss tests. I was pissing red lines in less than a week. For what it's worth, I'm a daily habitual user and I'm relatively thin. Took my girlfriend a little over a week. </p>
<p>I did a lot of research on that and how it all works. Of course there's always going to be exceptions but really most people will be clean in under 2 weeks with only a small percentage going over that. Of course, the outliers were self reported and it's definitely possible that they didn't exactly stop smoking like they'd claimed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is bad advice for anyone needing to pass a drug test. I work in a medical organization as an addictions counselor, and when I started, I was shocked at how long it took a lot of people to clear a test. Young, thin, athletic, moderate smokers were taking 5 weeks or more to not show any traces of THC. Most commonly they needed to pass UAs to start having their DUI diversion start counting, so they were heavily invested in passing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not advice. </p>
<p>I mean, how do you absolutely for sure know they weren't still using? </p>
<p>Urine analysis are just dip tests as well. It was the same shit.</p></div>		</li>
