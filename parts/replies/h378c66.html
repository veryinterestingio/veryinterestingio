			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm? what do you mean its not physical? Push magnets towards each other and they push each other away in exactly the same way your hands do when you push them together - the only difference is the range at which you start to notice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fields are physical, in both classical and quantum field theory. For one, fields can have momentum and energy. QFT flips classical field theory on its head and considers particles such as light or electrons to merely be &quot;excitations&quot; in that field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what OP means is they aren’t directly observed, kind of like a force. You have to take a field’s reality on faith. Despite induction from other phenomena there’s no guarantee that our description actually matches the genuine article of reality and by that virtue it could always be replaced, it’s not essential.</p>
<p>That said, saying something is physical in common english also means “of or relating to natural science, physics”. </p>
<p>The empasse at the heart of this thread is just a case of polysemy. OP means, not real even though it pertains to physics. Everyone else says, this pertains to physics of course its physical.</p>
<p>Ultimately to go deeper on scientific realism for fields would be a philosophical discussion meta to science itself</p></div>		</li>
