			<div class="markdown"><p>To clear a few things up:</p>
<p>Resistors are not used since that would cause the fan to consume the same amount of power regardless of speed (not efficient design). Instead capacitors are used to cause a voltage drop without consuming (real) power. Since capacitors in parallel adds capacitance, adding additional capacitance will slow the motor down. This is how ceiling fans work.</p>
<p>Other fans may have multiple windings (or multiple taps). This is how many fans in furnaces work (prior to EC motors), switching between speeds is energizing different coils in the motor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The higher the resistor (resistance) , the lower the current. Voltage stays the same. So power is reduced and fans moves slower at higher resistance. It is not using capacitors to control speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>pretty much. for AC, inductance = capacitance and capacitance = resistance, and some other thing I don't entirely remember. Resistors work as normal but are inefficient af so we use capacitors which don't require nearly so much cooling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electrical engineer here. Read through the entire thread and nobody understood the question except u/Holgrin. People are rambling about startup currents and not explaining why the switch design has the speed going low-med-high-off instead of high-med-low-off. Upvote for addressing the actual question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve been looking for an answer that applies to something other than a fan, such as an electric stovetop where the highest setting is first on the dial. Does this apply there as well, where it’s not a question of physical inertia?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always pondered it's so you <strong>know</strong> it's on <strong>or</strong> off.  If the switch is sloppy, worn out, or just labeled poorly, many devices you can't fully tell if it's at a low setting vs off (especially while coming down from an on state)</p>
<p>If a stovetop is on a cook setting, and you mean to turn it off, but accidently land on the lowest setting, it would take minutes to realize &quot;oh this is still warm, it should be cool by now&quot;, as opposed to &quot;wtf I turned that off and it's glowing red now!&quot;</p>
<p>I've had ceiling fans where they would spin a long time after turning off, and the difference between medium and low was not much, so it was always easist to pull the chain until high speed started, then know off was definitely 3 more pulls</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An electric stovetop probably uses a thermostat to control power flow. Usually a thin strip of metal that drastically changes shape as it heats up via current running through it. More tension on the thermostat element will keep the switch and heat going for longer. </p>
<p>Either way, that's all the design of the thermostat. I ripped apart a toaster oven recently to make a PCB reflow oven. It had a thermostat that worked this way, but it starts from low temps to high temps as you add more tension by twisting the knob.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea the physical inertia is far less of an issue with electric motors than for combustion engines anyway, since electrical rotation and torque is much more instantaneous than for engines anyway.</p>
<p>When you have a control knob or switch, you are opening or closing a circuit, so anytime where there are multiple settings (1-10, high-low) this principle is probably the same one at work.</p>
<p>Volume knobs are a notable exception. Now I haven't built volume control circuits, but I've learned some about them, and this is an educated &quot;guess&quot; as to basically what happens with speakers and volume control: turning a speaker &quot;on&quot; at full volume is jarring and uncomfortable for us, so we separate the &quot;ON&quot; mechanism from the variable volume control. This can be either through &quot;pushing&quot; the volume knob like a button for &quot;on/off&quot; and then turning it to vary the amount of power to the speakers, or even by how the volume might have a much &quot;harder&quot; first turn when you turn it on, acting as a separate &quot;on/off&quot; control from the raising and lowering the volume. The variable control is about adding/subtracting components in the circuit (like resistors or as someone else pointed out, capacitors) and the overall &quot;on/off&quot; is separated out. This takes deliberate design though, so things like fans or electric stoves may be designed with the more simple process still.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for that answer! Volume was another question I had, but I honestly wasn’t sure if it would be controlled by the same mechanism as fan speed, or stovetop heat. I don’t know much about this at all, so I appreciate the education!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Volume on non-digital devices is usually just a logmarithic voltage divider applied to the pre-amplified low voltage source signal. It's just a dual wipe (for stereo) potentiometer, not much more. </p>
<p>And you can still get amp popping with the volume completely muted. Was just working on an old 80's car radio that would pop no matter the volume as you tuned the key on. Safe startup on modern stuff usually doesn't consider the input signal volume or voltage, just gently applies power to whatever is actually amplifying the signal.</p></div>		</li>
