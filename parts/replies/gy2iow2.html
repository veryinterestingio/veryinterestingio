			<div class="markdown"><p>The things he listed are second degree advantages, the ability to function paralysed would not be selected for from an evolutionary standpoint.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Evolution happens in degrees. For example digestion. The first tube worms had a simple gut that ran from the mouth at the front to the anus at the back. As evolution went on sensory organs near the front were selected for. The simple nervous system of the worms selected for those with more neurons at the front (ganglion) near those sensing organs. This eventually became a brain.  </p>
<p>Often parts of our evolution only conferred an advantage eons ago, but there is no selective pressure against so they remain. These are called vestigial organs and structures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the best examples that I know of is the Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve that's in most vertebrates. It begins in brain, goes down and under the aortic arch of the heart, just to go back up to the trachea. In giraffes it's a 15 ft/4.6 meter detour (according to Wikipedia)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add; you’re generally able to identify whether an animal is a hunter or prey by the position of their eyes. </p>
<p>A hunter will have two eyes facing directly forward. This allows for binocular or stereoscopic vision, which allows an animal to see and judge depth, something having two eyes is important for. For example, put your finger close to your face, look to the distance ahead of you finger and you’ll see “two” fingers. Then instead of looking ahead, look directly at your finger; your eyes will focus to the closer object (your finger) and you’ll just see one.</p>
<p>On the other hand, animals with eyes on the sides of their head suggests a prey animal, whereby the key advantage is having wider peripheral and side vision; so much so that they can nearly see 360; a significant advantage for animals that are grazing or feeding. Although since they effectively look at objects with only one eye at a time, their ability for stereoscopic vision and depth perception is reduced relative to the predatory eye configuration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is true, however the total area of stereoscopic vision for a deer/rodent is less than that of a human or tiger. It does exist, but to less of an extent, and they are less capable of the focus able to be achieved by animals with front facing eyes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is something so terrifying to me about evolution  that has created the best predators by only allowing the best hunters to breed, while simultaneously creating prey that only allowing the ones that escape getting killed to breed.</p>
<p>I know I’m not wording it correct because it’s not evolution that causes this but rather survival causes the evolution. It just most of humans don’t experience something so brutal and the nature of it seems so antithetical to our beliefs. The best killers make better killers and the best conflict avoiders make the best conflict avoiders. </p>
<p>Like I have always felt like the best defense is a good offense but somewhere along evolution, one species become so good at killing that the other species just had to be better at avoiding them. And it just bums me out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me ease your mind. In the hunter prey relationship the prey dominate. Through evolution healthy prey are faster, stronger and able to escape most predators. If the predators killed too many prey they wouldn’t have any food. Predators only survive by catching the young, old and ill prey.  By the way there are way more prey than predators by the numbers.</p></div>		</li>
