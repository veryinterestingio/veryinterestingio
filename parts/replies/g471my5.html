<p>The RS-68 used on the Delta IV rocket takes this approach.</p>

<p>That is also why the Delta IV, despite using the same hydrolox propellant mix as the RS-25 on the Space Shuttle, has a much more luminous, yellow exhaust plume - what you see there is not the &quot;actual&quot; engine exhaust, but mainly the ablated nozzle material (which has a lot of carbon in it, thus the yellow glow) being carried away by it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is an alternative much simpler approach: ablative cooling. Just make the nozzle from something that's OK to slowly burn away, usually something based on graphite. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nozzles are made of the composite material: the structure is woven from the tungsten fibres enveloped into copper. Copper boils and ablates away. As you understand, copper has a high heat of evaporation. I do not know, though, whether this design was used in the engine in question.</p></div>		</li>
