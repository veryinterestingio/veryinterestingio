			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, some old headphones could do both - you could plug the headphones into your computer microphone jack and record your high school band playing so that you could burn it onto a CD-R (not RW, we’re not made of money guys) and pass it out to your friends at school who all totally listened to it and said it was really good the next time you asked them about it and you guys were going to be the next big thing but for some reason your parents never believed in you and wouldn’t pay money for your recording studio time and for some reason they insisted that you go to college even though you’re totally not going to need it and they’ll see when you’re rich and familiar and you got all the chicks and then 15 years later your wife finds your CD when you’re moving house and asks you what this crap was and you don’t tell her because you’re too ashamed to admit it was you all along recorded through the microphone of these cheap $15 skull candy headphones that you bought at a gas station in Nebraska cause your parents were listening to Christian music and you just wanted to listen to some devil music like Linkin Park and you were so pissed off that no one understands you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That’s kind of what I was saying, but in an ELI5 manner.</p>
<p>I could have also gotten into frequency and amplitude, electromagnets, etc., but...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaker and mic work in inverse ways. The underlying physical principle is the same though. The principle is &quot;if a magnet is moved next to a wire, a current flows in the wire and if an alternating (changing) current flows through a wire that is near a magnet, the wire experiences force and moves&quot;
In a mic your sound vibrations make the magnet vibrate too. As stated above this causes a current which fluctuates in sync with how the magnet moves(vibrates). This data is converted to digital bits and stored or transmitted. At the receiving end, a speaker is essentially a strong magnet with a electric coil near it. When the digital info is received by it, it causes a fluctuating current which is in sync with the digital bits. A changing current near a magnet causes the wire to experience force and it vibrates too. The coil is coupled to a thin film or diaphragm which vibrates along with the coil it. This causes the vibrations to get transmitted to air which amplifies them.
This is the only way we know of converting electrical energy to kinetic or mechanical energy - with magnets as the mediators. This is how electricity is produced in thermal, hydro, geothermal, wind and nuclear power plants. They use the kinetic energy of water/steam to turn a coil suspended between a strong magnet resulting in a current flowing through the coil. This is also how induction cooktops work.
