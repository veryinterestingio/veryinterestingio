			<div class="markdown"><p>We never “prove” the first four postulates are true, by definition they’re things we postulate (assume) so we can build a logical structure on top of them. The fifth postulate just happens to lead to useful results whether or not we use it while the other four are more necessary for the geometry we build to make sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this a bit, Euclidean geometry is about geometry done on a flat (uncurved) plane. On such a plane, parallel lines never meet.</p>
<p>However, we can also picture curved surfaces like a sphere, for example. On a sphere, parallel lines can meet.</p>
<p>Think of the planet's Equator. A circle going around the middle of the globe. There are lines of longitude going north/south through the Equator, all at right angles to the Equator. These lines are parallel. However, they still meet at the poles. So, the surface of the Earth is non-Euclidean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right that the surface of a sphere is non-euclidean. But it is not as simple as not having parallel lines that does not cross. There are non-euclidean two dimensional geometries where you can draw two parallel lines that does not meet. In fact you can draw a line that intersects one of these two parallel lines but not the other which then makes it parallel with one but not the other. But what you think of as a normal flat surface is Euclidean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right - a sphere is just one example of a non-Euclidean surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't prove a postulate because a proof starts with your postulates.  There isn't anything you can prove them with </p>
<p>In fact whether you accept a postulate/axiom to be true is a free choice.  Just as you can construct non-Euclidean geometries without the 5th postulate, you could also do the same thing with any of the other postulates as well.  Fano's Geometry is an example of a geometry which doesn't use any of Euclid's postulates.</p></div>		</li>
