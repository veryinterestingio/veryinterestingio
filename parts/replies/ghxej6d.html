<p>Evolution adds things which are definitely useful, and removes things which are harmful.</p>
<p>Anything else is left the hell alone, resulting in things like unused tendons in your forearm, nipples on men, body hair, etc.</p>
<p>Also, anything that happens post-reproductive-age evolution really doesn't give a shit about (there's a small factor of you being around to nurture the young, but that quickly drops off, which is why your body starts to deteriorate at about the age that your children would no longer need you to survive on their own).</p>
<p>Unless it's detrimental to your survival, it sticks around almost forever.</p>
<p>But as soon as something is advantageous to your survival, it gets copied far and wide like any other great idea.</p>
<p>Hence, it's far more common for one organ to become two, but extremely rare for it to revert back to being just one larger organ.</p>
<p>Problem is that without that initial mutation providing a double/mirror organ, you stay stuck with one of them.  </p>
<p>The liver, however, is one of the few organs capable of almost complete regeneration.  That's how/why that survived and doesn't really &quot;need&quot; a double (if one mutated it likely wouldn't be that advantageous over the single, already-capable-of-regeneration one, so it likely wouldn't actually propagate or enhance your survival that much).</p>
<p>Almost everything that you have two of, you can survive to reproduction with only one of.  The things you only have one of are so critical that you can't afford to have two because one going wrong would kill you anyway (i.e. why we don't have two hearts, but we do have two sides to the same heart - you couldn't just slap another heart into the process, it wouldn't plumb in correctly without causing EVEN MORE problems, but if one side of your heart gave up, the other side would likely work well enough for long enough for you to have a shot at reproduction) or they have other mechanisms that mean they can be severely impacted and yet still work (e.g. liver).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theres also the chance that even if an extremely beneficial mutation were to arise, it may have to arise several times before it takes just due to random chance, i.e. if the animal was eaten prior to reproduction, born during severe drought, wiped out in a flood, juvenile cancer, or splatted on the side of the highway before they could reproduce.  Just because a mutation may provide a long term advantage doesn't mean you will survive to reproductive age automatically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also evolution can lead to weird things where a species can develop something thats harmful. For instance, let's say Gene X is responsible for Trait or Organ Y, which is beneficial. But Gene X could also be responsible for Trait or Organ Z, which is harmful. If Y is more beneficial than Z is harmful, then creature with gene X would more likely to survive than creatures without gene X.</p></div>		</li>
