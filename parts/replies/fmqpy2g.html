Instead, they’re rationally designed, using knowledge of the virus’s biology to specifically damage, remove, or substitute targeted genes.  That can be much faster than blindly passaging for hundreds of generations, and you can have a more stable, better-understood vaccine (of course it would still need to go through the full gamut of testing, just to be sure). </p>
<p>For SARS, several live attenuated vaccines were made (for example, <a href="https://jvi.asm.org/content/92/17/e00710-18" target="_blank">Combination Attenuation Offers Strategy for Live Attenuated Coronavirus Vaccines</a>), though of course none progressed through trials since the virus was eliminated before that was necessary. It’s likely that SARS-CoV-2 attenuated vaccines are being made following similar formulas.  </p>
<p>Another reason you wouldn’t use a wild, live SARS-CoV-2 virus as a vaccine (even if injected intramuscularly was safe, which is probably isn’t) is that it would mean you’re carrying around millions of doses of dangerous infectious virus with you. The manufacturing plants would have to be BSL3, workers would be at risk preparing it (what if a vial breaks?), the vials of vaccines would have to be shipped under guard, the doctor’s office would be off-limits ... terrorists would have a field day ... completely impractical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting! How many different ways of making a vaccine are likely to get trials for this virus? Is it even reasonable to expect one of them to have modest efficacy in a compressed timescale? (The 18 months sort of compressed one). </p>
<p>For a pathogen that you eventually loose immunity to would repeated challenges typically illicit less severe symptoms or are mutations often big enough that it is a clean slate again? (i.e. immunity without contact to virus last 3-4 years, if its still circulating would your body being challenged result in new modified immune response as soon as the virus mutates or your memory is weakening?).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a vaccine to work, it has to train the immune system to recognise the foreign entity (the virus, in this case). Viruses are basically nucleic acid (RNA or DNA), encased in a shell of lipid and protein. The lipid is usually unremarkable and generic, but the proteins are specific. Some viruses will have just one type of protein on the surface, others might have many.<br />
The most promising short term vaccine will be an approximation of one of these surface proteins.</p>
<p>For SARS-CoV-2, the main protein that has been identified is one which is similar in shape to a normal hormone called Angiotensin II. Ordinarily, Angiotensin II binds to the receptors on these cells (primarily seen in the lungs and kidneys, but also the testes and GI tract), the receptor then changes shape, transporting the Angiotensin to the inside of the cells <em>(Edit: this is incorrect. The shape change doesn't transport angiotensin, it just activates the intracellular part of the receptor)</em>, where it has its effect as part of blood pressure regulation.<br />
The protein on SARS-CoV-2 is the same shape as angiotensin II (or close enough), and so the virus is transported into the cell the same way <em>(Edit: again, not true, as the receptor isn't ordinarily a transport protein. It's likely that the virus just hitches a ride on the protein while it Optimus-Primes its way to the active state, and the virus ends up on the inside)</em>, infecting the cell.</p>
<p>So what is needed is to definitively determine the shape of the viral protein (in the world of proteins, shape is usually the most important feature). Specifically, the part of the protein that sticks out of the virus.<br />
Then we need to make another protein that will have that same shape, so the immune system learns to recognise it. Making the exact same protein entirely is not usually viable, because the way that proteins fold means that there are numerous ways to do it. Cells are good at being consistent in that way, chemists are not. Additionally, the fact that the protein is part of the virus might mean it's a different shape to the protein just floating around. Instead, we make fragments of the protein, and hope to find a combination that works the way we want it to.<br />
You have to make sure that those fragments are stable enough to transport and inject, and won't immediately break apart in the bloodstream.<br />
The protein needs to look like the virus, but not so much like regular angiotensin II that the immune system ignores it. <em>(Edit: or worse, the immune system does make antibodies to it, that then also recognise angiotensin II)</em> Ideally, it would also not interact with the ACE-2 receptor, or if it did, not in a way that stops the receptor from working properly (which would cause blood pressure problems).</p>
<p>As you can see, there's a lot to it, so you might need to try hundreds of compounds before you find one that ticks all the boxes.</p>
<p>Other possibilities would be to engineer the virus in such a way that it's genetic instructions were faulty in some way - preferably in a way that prevents new viruses from being assembled properly when they infect a human host. You'd hopefully end up with a viral particle that had no RNA, or fragmented, non-infective RNA inside it.<br />
To manufacture such a virus though, it would need to be able to replicate normally in an animal (or animal tissue culture), but not in people. This would allow you to infect animals, then repeatedly harvest their blood and purify out the altered virus, to use as the vaccine. Entirely possible, but tricky, with a lot of trial and error. If the purification process is imperfect (which it usually is), there's also a risk of unforseen side effects, inducing allergies, anaphylaxis, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>In response to your second question - yes, repeated challenges should give you less severe symptoms. Influenza has dozens of different variations, which can combine in multiple ways (H1N1, H5N3, whatever), each of which needs its own antibodies, which is why there is a new vaccine every year.<br />
Over time, without repeated exposure to the pathogen, the immune system will dial down how sensitive it is to that thing, so it can use its resources on more relevant tasks. It rarely/never forgets completely, but it's like an old text that's kept in the archive stacks in the 4th sublevel basement of a restricted access library. The immunity can be woken up again, but takes some time (weeks to months), during which you might succumb to the illness.
This is why we need booster shots for some things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked in a BSL3 for a couple years doing research, and I currently work in bioprocess development for manufacturing. You got me wondering if there even is BSL3 manufacturing for some reason. The only thing I could find is a good production pilot plant that’s BSL3 but it’s for process validation. Cool little rabbit hole I went down though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait I thought many of the original SARS efforts were abandoned because they seemed to cause vaccine induced enhancement?  Although I’ve also read that by the time they got better at that nobody cared.</p>
<p>Are you worried about enhancement in the development of a vaccine for cov-2?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that this did happen in some promising attempts, but not in others. So they worked it out before they lost funding as the disease died out. (Something that some say shouldn't have happened, as it would have given us a leg up in new, similar viruses, like this one.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, OP your understanding is wrong. </p>
<p>We know with certainty it gets into muscles and commonly causes muscle breakdown. Also it can infiltrate the heart, liver, spinal fluid, bladder and yes - definitely blood.</p>
<p>Muscle we know confidently based off typical virology and that these patients commonly present with an elevated CK when they’re sick. But also there’s some valuable data from an early study done on monkeys. </p>
