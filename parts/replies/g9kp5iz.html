<p>Follow-up question: why is U-235 fissile whereas U-238 is not?</p>
<p>This has always seemed counterintuitive to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When the neutron is absorbed by uranium-235, it becomes an excited compound nucleus of uranium-236. The energetics work out that even if uranium-235 captures a neutron with zero kinetic energy, creating the compound nucleus with the minimum possible excitation energy, it's already above the fission barrier in uranium-236. So uranium-235 can undergo (n,f) with neutrons of arbitrarily low energy. There's no energy threshold.</p>
<p>For uranium-238, this is not the case. The excited compound nucleus of uranium-239 can still lie below the fission barrier, meaning that it won't fission. So ^(238)U(n,f) has an energy threshold, and neutrons below that energy can't cause it to fission.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>U238 that captures a neutron becomes u239 which decays into neptunium, then into plutonium 239, which itself is fissile.
This process occurs in most (all?) nuclear reactors. The fuel is only enriched to 5 or 6 percent u235 (for electrical power reactors. Nuclear subs and ships it's much higher). Most of the uranium in the fuel is u238. During the fuel cycle, plutonium (and fission products) is created out of the u238 in the fuel. So much so that by the end of the fuel cycle (12 to 24 months) most of the heat/power generated is from the fission of the plutonium, and decay of the fission products.
So called breeder reactors are designed to create more fuel than they started with, via this process. One of the ways plutonium is created for weapons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun piece of info here I can add, there are two words: fissile and fissionable. U-238 is fissionable (can be cleaved) but not fissile. Fissile means it can have a self-sustained chain reaction. It is more fissionable with &quot;fast&quot;, high-energy neutrons, than the &quot;thermal&quot;, low-energy neutrons we have in water-cooled reactors.</p>
<p>U-238 also has a strong <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_temperature_coefficient_of_reactivity" target="_blank">doppler effect</a>, which means that the higher the temperature is, the more easily will U-238 absorb neutrons to produce Pu-239. And higher temperature usually means more power from fission, so it is sort of a self-retarding effect (a negative feedback). This is one of the inherent safeguards used in nuclear reactor design.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Fissile means that there’s no energy threshold for (n,f). It’s a consequence of that, along with the average number of neutrons emitted, and cross section values, that no fuel containing zero fissile material can reach criticality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_cross_section" target="_blank">this</a>. It has its origins in classical scattering theory, where it has a somewhat straightforward geometric interpretation. The formalism and terminology is applied to quantum scattering theory too, but it mostly loses its geometric interpretation.</p></div>		</li>
