<p>The same is true for a high temperature climate with low humidity.  You feel cooler because you can regulate heat more efficiently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Friendly reminder that because moisture evaporates more efficiently in dry heat, it is so imperative that you stay hydrated! You may not even realize how much water you've lost because you don't get noticeably sweaty and sticky like you do where it's humid.</p>
<p>I can't tell you how many people would come and say &quot;Oh I'm from the south, I know how to deal with heat!&quot; and then get sick from dehydration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lower temps raise humidity RH. When its cold, higher RH makes you feel much colder and when it's warm it makes you feel much hotter. </p>
<p>Once it drops below freezing for awhile it lowers the RH again and makes the cold more tolerable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This goes against my intuitive sense of evaporative cooling -- can you explain more or link some supporting evidence? High RH should inhibit sweat evaporation and therefore result in feeling warmer, not cooler, no?  </p>
<p>... I know that, with the same amount of water vapor in the air, the RH will be higher at lower temperature, but ! when it's cold out, that air is brought inside and heated, resulting in a very low RH.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to this there is the 3rd kind of heat transfer Radiation:</p>
<p>ELI5 Version: You know how on a 70 degree day you are warmer standing in the sun then the shade. The air around you is the same temperature in both cases but the sun's surface can heat you at a distance. It turns out that all objects do the same thing just not as strongly. So even though the air inside your house is the same temperature in the winter the walls are much colder and they cool you from a distance.</p>
<p>Adult Version: There are 3 types of heat transfer Convection, Conduction, and Radiation. Most people think radiation comes only from isotopes or nuclear devices but in reality every object radiate heat too. &quot;Think of a heat lamp&quot; so in the winter your walls are cold and you can actually feel the radiative heat transfer cooling your skin. </p>
<p>Also fun heat transfer fact, heat always flows from hot to cold so the walls aren't making you colder you are warming up the walls!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This this. All else equal in the room, even with identical temperature and relative humidity, the temperature of the walls themselves make them either a radiator or a sink. If the walls are hotter, they radiate more infrared. Just as the sun's infrared causes you to feel warmer in sunshine, anything with a temperature radiates infrared radiation and will feel &quot;warm&quot;  if it's warmer than you are, and cool otherwise.</p>
<p>When the radiating body (wall) is warmer than the incident body (human), the wall is a heat source, and net flux is towards the person - and you feel warmer acting as the heat sink. The opposite is true - if you are warmer than the walls, you radiate net energy to them in infrared, and they act as the sink - meaning you're losing heat by radiating.</p>
<p>This is why you notice it most in the winter,  in rooms with windows, especially old, low-R windows. The air temp can be several degrees higher than the summer temperature yet you still feel that chill going by the window. This instant feeling isn't usually the air temp changing (though it could be drafty, too) since air takes time to convect around the room. It's the heat you're radiating not being returned to you.</p>
<p>This principle has also been used to create <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/35/21162" target="_blank">&quot;cool walls&quot;</a> or leveraged into so-called &quot;radiant cooling&quot; or even <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2020/Q4/this-white-paint-could-reduce-the-need-for-air-conditioning-by-keeping-surfaces-cooler-than-surroundings.html" target="_blank">&quot;cool paints&quot;</a> where changing wall temperatures or emissivities affects human perception of hot and cold even though it doesn't much affect the air temperature in the room (or even for outside uses.)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To confirm, 70 on your thermostat only really correlated to 70 in the house on a cloudy day when it’s 70 outside.  When it’s colder it’s a continual battle to bring the temp up and when it’s hotter/sunny it’s a continual battle to bring it down.  Your exterior walls/ceiling are sinking/sourcing heat which is making you feel cooler/hotter than the air immediately surrounding the thermostat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just humidity, but radiative heat exchange plays a role, too. If you've got a cold surface in the room, such as a window, you're going to lose heat to that cold surface through radiation, regardless of the ambient air temperature and humidity.</p></div>		</li>
