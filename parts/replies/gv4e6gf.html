			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s been extensively studied for measles, since maternally provided antibodies can interfere with infant vaccination. IIRC there’s a large drop in circulating maternal antibodies between 6 and 9 months (regardless of breastfeeding status). I believe the reason that vaccine is given at 12 months is because many infants still have enough at 9 months to reduce efficacy of the vaccine. The reason I know this is because I’ve read more recently that countries with higher measles rates are reconsidering the timing, since infants can be vulnerable in the intermediate period. Obviously we can’t have the same quality of data for covid, but I would expect broadly similar patterns for different antibodies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question: I've read before that antibodies for whatever the mother has been exposed to recently can frequently be found in high concentrations in breast milk. Do these antibodies train the baby's immune system to create more for itself, or does it just flood their system temporarily with enough antibodies to fight off exposure in the near future?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Placental antibodies circulate in the baby for weeks to months, milk antibodies just coat the mucosal membranes. These both are called passive immunity, they don't really influence the development of the immune system, there may be some debate for something like allergies though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do these studies show any differentiation on age of babies re: types of breastmilk (colostrum v breastmilk) or type of gut (open v closed)? Or, would you not see that mattering.</p>
