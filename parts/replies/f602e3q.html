<p>How does that work?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive been on cruise ships, planes, obviously cars, and played many VR games and I never get motion sickness with any of them, so I can’t speak from my own experience. I don’t know much about VR sickness, but my assumption would be that it’s the opposite reaction. Visual stimulus is being received but not kinaesthetic stimulus. So you’re seeing movement but not experiencing it, again, your brain is confused and wondering why it’s missing something that should be so obvious. I would guess that developing your VR legs would just be the gradual conditioning of your brain to the process of VR simulation. Slowly your brain realizes that nothing bad is happening to you so the negative reaction lessens over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>VR legs also apply to stuff like reading in a car/train or whatever, at least according to some people in r/VirtualReality or r/ValveIndex.</p></div>		</li>
