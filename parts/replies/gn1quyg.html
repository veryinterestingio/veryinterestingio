			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is mostly correct, except I presume the eggs themselves are being protected by this.  The scenario would be backyard chicken gets avian influenza -&gt; infects or contaminates owner -&gt; owner goes to work carrying avian influenza virus -&gt; owner infects eggs -&gt; virus replicates in eggs -&gt; vaccine for unrelated disease now carries wild, non-attenuated, infectious avian influenza virus. </p>
<p>This is obviously a wildly unlikely chain of events, and even so there are multiple processes in place that would also stop this, but telling your workers they can’t have chickens is a simple thing to do and reduces the risk from minuscule to less than minuscule. </p>
<p>I don’t think this is a law or government regulation (if it is, hopefully someone will post a link), but it seems like a reasonable rule for a company to impose. Similarly, I know that at least in some places scientists researching avian influenza are not allowed to have pet birds or backyard chickens, though again I think this  is a company rule, not a government regulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why. I worked in biopharm production of an injectible medicine created from hamster ovarian cell lines. The ppl who worked in upstream werent allowed to own poultry or certain livestock to prevent the workers from acting as an accidental vector for zoonosis into the cell lines, thus infecting the product. Even tho it was run through a viral filter and the people in those labs were under iso7 gowning they didn't want to take the risk.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm kinda shocked it's not a more stringent standard.  ISO 7 is like, clean-ish, isn't it?  I guess for airborne contamination anything with positive pressure is pretty good</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're thinking small... it's not just AI you have to worry about, but salmonella, cocci, and the whole host of other transferrable diseases.  Owner doesn't have to be infected, just get some on themselves, their clothes or their vehicle and then transport from one location to another.  You can take measures like vehicle sanitization, showering in/out of facilities and such but the easiest transmission reduction is simple avoidance.   Poultry vets are generally required to wait 72 hours between farm visits when there's an elevated concern to avoid potential transference, even with all the other precautions.  Can't do that with avians at home, which is why they generally can't have them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reverse of your description is also a big part of the reason.
Worker testing highly pathenogenic flu strains in the lab has an exposure -&gt; Goes home and exposes pet bird -&gt; pet bird escapes -&gt; spreads known zoonotic disease to other birds -&gt; avian flu epidemic.</p>
<p>It's a smaller chance scenario, but often the reason even pet bird owners are excluded from this work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, none of the vaccines for protection against COVID-19   require chicken eggs for production. Influenza vaccines use chicken eggs since they typically use a whole-virus vaccine, and those whole viruses need to be grown/produced in some sort of cells (eg chicken eggs that have been fertilized). Growing the virus takes significant time and effort. The mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 do not contain whole viruses and do not need to be grown in any type of cell; instead they are manufactured which allows for faster production. Some COVID-19 vaccines such as the AstraZeneca use a different type of vaccine platform called a viral vector, so these types do need to be grown in cells, but human cell lines are used, not chicken eggs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The RNA versions do not, afaik, or at the very least there is a non-egg version available. Removing the need for eggs is one of the goals of the research efforts that have been pursuing RNA vaccines over the last couple decades.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The virus grows in a specific spot in the egg, in a fluid known as &quot;allantoic fluid&quot;. A needle or pipette can be used to suck up this fluid for collection. There are also many further steps to purify as well as inactive the virus such that it won't be able to cause disease. Yet despite the purification steps, there is still a small amount of egg protein (called ovalbumin) that may be present in the vaccine.</p></div>		</li>
