			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's safe to say they answer is <strong>yes</strong>. We know that tissue repair <a href="https://www.trifectanutrition.com/blog/how-many-calories-should-i-eat-to-gain-weight" target="_blank">requires significant calories</a> and that restricting calories <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3528375/" target="_blank">has pretty detrimental effects</a> in wound recovery. </p>
<p>I think it's very safe to say that running a consistent caloric deficit (with or without micronutrient deficits) will impair neurological development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, what are the most important factors for the optimal function of neurological processes?</p>

<p>I'm going to go with insulin sensitivity here. Even you have both micros and macros, it means very little if your brain can't use them properly because your pancreas and liver are fighting all the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's a given that we can draw hard parallels between wound healing and other large-scale tissue growth processes and neuronal function, which is much more about connectivity optimization. Maybe there are good parallels, but it's worth noting that it's about <em>pruning,</em> tooâ€”it's not just &quot;making new stuff.&quot;</p>
<p>Especially in light of studies showing cognitive benefits to controlled fasting situations, it's actually plausible to even gravitate towards the opposite hypothesis: that a moderate caloric deficit could <em>improve</em> development.</p>
<p>E.g.: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3670843/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3670843/</a></p>
<p>But regardless, definitely warrants direct investigation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I do not think we know enough about memory formation etc. to say a consistent calorie deficit in someone that still has body fat to take calories from, will affect neurons. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Our bodies also prioritize our brains - extrapolating from wound recovery is crap science.</p></div>		</li>
