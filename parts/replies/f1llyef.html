			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  Temperature is a measurement of the average kinetic energy of particles.  The number of particles will change how hot or cold something <em>feels</em>, but it will not change its actual temperature.  (This is due to the difference in heat conductance and heat capacity, similar to why you can walk on burning coals but walking on metal the same temperature would burn your feet.)  The average kinetic energy of the particles is 3/2 <em> k </em> T where k is a constant and T is temperature.  In other words, in order to be at a lower temperature, those particles need to be moving slower.</p>
<p>High altitudes are actually colder.  You could measure this with thermal expansion.  A bimetallic strip curls because the metal on one side expands more than the other when it gets warmer.  If you climb a mountain, you'll find that strip will be less curled (or curled the other direction) at the top of the mountain compared to at the bottom.  The difference in the expansion will be based only on temperature, and as objects always adjust to the temperature of their surrounds, we will have to conclude that it is colder at the higher altitude than the lower altitude.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the top comment doesn't make sense considering when in an airplane the monitors usually provide temperature readouts of the outside, which are always much lower then at ground-level, adding to that the visible frost on windows. Saying temperatures are the same and that it just 'feels' colder than doesn't make sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sucks that the top rated comment is completely wrong. </p>
<p>I'm not sure what your background knowledge is here, but I encourage you to edit your comment. As numerous replies have pointed out, temperature is a measure of average kinetic energy of the molecules. Your statement implies that temperature is kinetic energy multiplied by molecular density and this is incorrect. </p>
<p>The reason the temperature is lower as you go higher in altitude (actually lower--each individual molecule has lower kinetic energy) is that the pressure drops. When pressure drops, the actual molecules move more slowly because in order to lower the pressure, the volume of space occupied expands. This expansion of space removes momentum from the particles inside the affected volume (picture throwing a ball at a wall that is moving away from you. The ball will rebound with lower velocity)</p>
<p>Please consider editing your comment to help people find the correct answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would more available space reduce the momentum? The molecules should just be traveling further but not slower. The moving wall example would explain a Doppler shift effect but that shouldn't apply for having more room.</p>
<p>If you carry a balloon of air from high altitude to lower altitude, the temperature should increase, and vice versa. I believe that's the point I was making.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just picture a bouncy ball in a small box bouncing extremely fast. Then start to move all the walls outwards. Each time the ball hits the wall, it will lose some of its momentum since the speed it bounces back into the space will be 2 x the motion of the wall slower. The ball is doing work on the moving wall, and therefore losing energy with each bounce. </p>
<p>Here are some other things to maybe jog you into realizing you're wrong.</p>
<ul>
<li>After the tropopause, the atmosphere actually increases in temperature with height. This is inexplicable from your explanation. </li>
<li>The outer atmosphere of the sun is millions of degrees Kelvin. It is also approximately zero pressure. This is understandable only under the idea that the molecules are very few, but moving extremely quickly. You could freeze to death in a gas that is millions of degrees kelvin.</li>
</ul>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Here's the wiki article for adiabatic expansion, which explains what is going on here in more technical terms. I'm not sure what your background is, so this may be less than helpful if you haven't really looked into thermodynamics before.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your answer is also wrong.  The atmosphere is heated from below by the earth.  The further from the earth you go, the colder it gets - until you reach the middle and outer atmospheres, where a lot more is going on than just heating from the earth.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. People saying that the air &quot;loses heat&quot; as it rises are wrong as that would violate conservation of energy. A good example of this is a fire piston. You can force a relatively small amount of air, about the volume of a pen, into a tight space without much effort and the increase in pressure and thus temperature is enough to ignite a tinder. It's just energy density.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about Boyle's Law? The energy is still there, just dispersed as the air drops in pressure.   </p>
<p>Come to think of it: That's exactly what's happening in the fire piston, but in reverse.</p></div>		</li>
