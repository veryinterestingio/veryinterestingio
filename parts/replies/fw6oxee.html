			<div class="markdown"><p>You might need to reword this a little.  You seem to be implying that the speed of sound is going to change based on the size of the loudspeaker driver, which is of course not the case.  </p>
<p>The driver is vibrating at different speeds for high or low frequencies, but your wording makes it seem like resulting wave is propagating through the air at different speeds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm talking about displacement of air and fluid dynamics. The soundwave's speed of propagation is constant regardless of the frequency of the signal. </p>
<p>Think about what would happen if you turned down the volume. Doesn't affect the speed of sound, but does affect the amount of air that's displaced.  Larger speakers will displace more air. </p>
<p>It is possible my metaphor is flawed, I know shit about acoustic design but I do know some hydraulics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your explanation is spot on.</p>
<p>When playing a brass instrument we describe low notes as needing a large volume of air moving slowly, and a high note as a small volume of air moving fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The period of each wave is longer the lower the frequency. Speed is still the same and thus you get a longer wave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The speed of the air has nothing to do with the speed of the pressure wave. Electrons in a copper wire never move with the speed of light, but the electric field does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think most people mean speed of the pressure wave when they said speed of air in this convo. Giving them the benefit of the doubt since it's reddit and mostly used by non physicist and non engineers.</p>
<p>EDIT: I stand corrected lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the question is about the same speaker, different frequencies. Your answer is about two different sized speakers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What does speaker size have to do with frequency of sound?</p>
<p>The question is asking why different effects happen for different sounds from the same speaker, correct?</p></div>		</li>
