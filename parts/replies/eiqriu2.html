			<div class="markdown"><p>The “hormones” are actually a mix of cytokines (immune system messenger chemicals) that suppress certain immune cells, as well as various compounds that sequester necessary nutrients that immune cells need. Moreover, the placenta (blood-fetus barrier) has a special protein covering  its surface called “Fas Ligand,” which literally causes immune cells to self-district upon contact. There are also various immune cell types, such as Placental Natural Killer cells, that only arise in the case of pregnancy and serve to patrol and maintain the placenta. These are just a few of the many ways that immune responses against a fetus are prevented. </p>

I have ask my superiors but they seem to not want to get into it. I just want to do a little digging in the right direction if it has been considered before.</p></div>		</li>
