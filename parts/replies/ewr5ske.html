			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s also why they will try to get you up and walking as soon as possible.  Post C-section I was in horrible pain one day and the nurses got me up and walking to help “move the gas” after that they recommended getting up and walking a lap around at least once an hour.  I was shocked how much it helped with the pain and recovery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The healing process can cause adhesions, which is scar tissue. You can imagine how a scar on your skin makes it less elastic and could be painful with movement; well, the same thing can happen in your insides, with worse consequences if you're really unlucky or mild consequences most of the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The note in my (pediatric) surgery file states my Small Intestine was placed back “in a hopefully orderly fashion.” Considering all the other mess going on in my abdomen at the time it was probably the best option, but not exactly the kind of surgery note I wanted to find many years later!</p></div>		</li>
