			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you think modern chemistry dates back way further than it actually does. Chemical reactions that are practically applied today were not commonly used in the time period before the discovery of the atom. The reactions that were used back in the day were all found experimentally and the quantities of the reagents were recorded, but no real systematic theory regarding the fundamentals of the reaction were pursued.</p>
<p>Aside: Before the coining of the term Chemistry, the general field of the manipulation of matter was referred to as Alchemy. Alchemy has roots in ancient Asia, India and Egypt, and it concerned itself with the whole “creating this thing from this other thing through what is akin to magic and spiritual belief”</p></div>		</li>
