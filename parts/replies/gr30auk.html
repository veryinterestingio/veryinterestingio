			<div class="markdown"><p>Well and critically the reason the J&amp;J shot only “requires” one shot is because that’s how it was tested. </p>
<p>If they had tested it with two shots we would be talking about how the J&amp;J vaccine also “requires” two shots. </p>
<p>If Pfizer had tested with one shot and shown ~70%-80% efficacy we would be talking about how it only “requires” one shot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yes, but the mRNA vax might not be helpful either. If the variants have enough mutations, we may need something more like a seasonal coronavirus vaccine. Sometimes you may need a booster because, after some time without re-exposure to antigen, your memory cells decide it isn't worthwhile to stick around anymore. In that case, a booster of the same vaccine is helpful, but you couldn't get a J&amp;J booster. There are definitely researchers looking into boosting with other vaccine types, though! ie, you get an mRNA vaccine now and an adenovirus booster in 10-20 years, or vice versa.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does J&amp;J choose the adenovirus? Would they have to choose one that they're fairly sure no one has already been exposed to, given how immunogenic it is? How might this affect their strategy for producing a seasonal vaccine?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So a possible reason for an efficacy difference between J&amp;J and mRNA is because J&amp;J might not create as much memory development in B &amp; T Cells, so it might take longer for the body to remember and create the proper antibody response?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spot on for memory development. Without a booster, J&amp;J creates fewer/weaker memory cells (memory is kind of a spectrum of super long living to only kind of long living). Another big feature of re-challenge (booster or exposure) is increased affinity maturation of antibodies. Basically the more more you get exposed, the better the antibodies are at binding to and preventing COVID infection, hence why we like boosters.</p>
<p>Memory isn't really about how <em>long</em> it takes to respond so much as the <em>magnitude</em> of response. More memory cells means more cells that rapidly expand and fight infection when you encounter it. It's kind of like showing up with a smaller army rather than a slower army.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And what's this about a &quot;T Cell Net&quot;? It makes it sound like with it, J&amp;J can elicit more robust B &amp; T cell response to variants?</p>
<p>Edit: clarity</p>
<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/johnson-and-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-arguably-the-best-2021-2?op=1" target="_blank">https://www.businessinsider.com/johnson-and-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-arguably-the-best-2021-2?op=1</a></p>
<p>Mathai Mammen, J&amp;J's research and development head, told Insider that the company's shot has been &quot;co-optimized&quot; for both antibody and T-cell responses to the virus, while both Pfizer's and Moderna's have not.</p>
<p>&quot;That makes our vaccine potentially really good versus a virus that is changing on us,&quot; he said. &quot;We're worried about the mRNA vaccines not having that T-cell net and actually taking a much bigger hit by the South African variant.&quot;</p>
<p>Mutations seen in the B.1.351 variant have concerned vaccine developers to the point that Moderna and Pfizer are now developing new booster shots of their vaccine, tailored to neutralize that concerning variant.</p>
<p>Moderna and Pfizer are confident that their shots will still provide protection, at least partially, against these concerning variants. J&amp;J's shot, in contrast, brings certainty that it is.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Moderna and Pfizer use mRNA delivered in lipid nanoparticles. The nanoparticles get eaten by immune cells</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can I get the source of reference? I can't find the source. I thought the nanoparticles that these two vaccines use are non cell type specific. The nanoparticles just bind to non specific cells and the mRNA uses the machinery inside the cells to produce viral proteins which create an immune response. I combed through the (free) resources available and I can't find source(s) pointing the nanoparticles are targeted to a specific cell type.</p>
<p>Also SUPER immunogenic is a bit ambiguous. You mean &quot;capable to induce a ROBUST immune response&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a good review from Nature on mRNA technology. I think figure 1 addresses your question a bit.</p>
<p>Immunogenic means &quot;capable of eliciting an immune response,&quot; so yes, I mean &quot;capable of inducing a robust immune response.&quot; Sorry for the jargon.</p></div>		</li>
