			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the slight problem that the lighter, more efficient open-cycle designs that worked best for aircraft also tended to spew radioactive exhaust everywhere.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Pluto" target="_blank">The designers didn't always consider that a downside, though.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! This is actually a project I am working on at the moment for my internship this summer. My intern group decided to use a direct cycle over indirect for the increased efficiency and not needing an intermediate heat exchanger that would introduce more energy loss. We are aware that this cycle spews more radioactive material out the back, but even if this cant actually be used due to the radiation, we've got to start somewhere in terms of making an engine that is actually powered by nuclear energy. </p>
<p>If you happen to know <em>anything</em> about gamma radiation shielding, I'd love to hear it because that is where we are currently stuck in terms of making it feasible in an aircraft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Super interesting.  I only know of Oak Ridge because of Windrock (for biking not the other hillbilly stuff) and I’ve seen those a hundred times on my drive but didn’t know what they were for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have any references for this. No way they suspended a reactor in the air. I found 14 reactor tests done at oakridge, but non mentioned suspended reactor.</p>
<p>NVM found it. In 1952, ORNL proposed to address ANP shielding problems by hanging full-scale reactor and shield models high in the air. </p>
<p>Will read into this more. Kinda cool</p></div>		</li>
