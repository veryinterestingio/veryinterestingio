			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just some arbitrary evolution speed... the fact that we walk upright on two legs means that the leg joint can't attach too far away from the central axis or the skeleton becomes unstable. Remember it's the inner diameter that matters, not the outer width. So while there might be some tweaks to skeleton design still possible, there is an absolute limit to that inner diameter. Also I heard that humans give birth pretty early, that's why human babies are so helpless compared to other mammal babies, party to compensate. So it's likely that future evolutionary changes will be along that line- earlier births or maybe something else- rather than further skeleton change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well,  woman born through c-section are more likely to require a c-section when they have their own babies years later. Some theorists out there say in future it may not be possible to give birth in traditional way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know about all this. The painful part of childbirth is the muscles contracting to open the cervix. There is no pain in pushing or bearing down. Only an instinctual urge and perhaps a burning as skin stretches. I would argue that the pain of live birthing is similar across animals, just that animals are instinctually quiet so as not to draw predators attention.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you given birth? I did. 14 weeks ago and with an epidural. The delivery part of labor hurts even with meds. I could literally feel my baby's head in the pelvis region trying to get under the bone and through. Once the head was out, then everything was relatively painless; the placenta just felt like a heavy weight and a relief to push out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. This correlates with the reason why human mammals don’t walk or become independent until much later in life than other mammals. If human brains and bodies  were to develop any more in utero than the nine months, childbirth would be impossible.  This is why humans are so reliant on their mother. They aren’t developed enough at birth or for some time after to walk or talk.  I believe that this is also a characteristic specific to human development in order to support and facilitate bonding between mom and child because let’s admit it if humans gave birth to babies that could walk and talk within minutes we’d have a whole new set of problems on our hands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt it’s just the length of gestation the makes human babies so vulnerable and incapable, it’s probably also a function of how they develop after birth (greater eventual dexterity and mental flexibility at the cost of a slow and very general developmental process).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to chime in on the altriciality aspect of the Obstetric Dilemma: the evidence is stronger that metabolic demands necessitate birth timing rather than size / pelvic constraints, otherwise twins would be born later than singletons and women would be biomechanically less efficient at walking, neither of which are true. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3458333/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3458333/</a></p></div>		</li>
