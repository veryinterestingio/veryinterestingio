			<div class="markdown"><p>A number of plants evolved poisons as a defense mechanism, as you already know. The ones with stronger poisons will be selected for; they'll survive longer and other organisms won't be able to eat them/will avoid them. Those chemicals can only work if they can interact with cells to bring about their effects; hence their psychoactive properties.</p>
<p>It isn't just cannabis that has done this. <em>Datura</em> evolved scopolamine for the same reason. <em>Psilocybe</em> evolved psilocybin. <em>Capsicum</em> evolved capsaicin. <em>Nicotiana</em> evolved nicotine. <em>Theobroma</em> evolved theobromine. All of them will be selected for because, in some organism, these are very toxic.</p>
<p>I would go and look at what kind of predators <em>Cannabis</em> has. What eats that stuff? And what may have eaten in in the past and no longer does. Not just animals and insects but also microorganisms. Also, what organisms are especially susceptible to cannabinoid poisoning?</p>
<p>As for whether it's a happy accident or not? I'd say it both never is, and always is. Because all life on the Earth shares a common lineage, and all cells have a similar molecular machinery built of similar chemicals, it makes sense that evolved poisons would make use of the chemicals on hand. Couple this with the requirement that they must be psychoactive to be effective means it's never a happy accident; those plants evolved that shit to be deadly.</p>
<p>However, in pharmacology there is a very old saying: &quot;the dose defines the poison&quot;, which encapsulates the concept of the therapeutic window (where the drugs have positive effects but few to no negative effects) and the notion that any drug, ultimately, will be poisonous. In this way, the existence of organisms that express chemicals which have a therapeutic window is very much a happy accident.</p>
<p>One final note, and this is some serious business real talk: the concept that &quot;plants are using us&quot; requires the existence of some collective consciousness that could will such a thing. To date, no proof of the existence of such a thing exists, and to assume otherwise is pseudoscience. There is <strong>always</strong> an alternative, superior explanation to the collective conscious argument when discussing unconscious organisms.</p></div>		</li>
