			<div class="markdown"><p>The octopus retina structure in the eye is different to ours, comprised of long thin receptor cells arranged in vertical and horizontal blocks - I am not an expert in vision or eye anatomy, but apparently this is a similar arrangement to other molluscs. Because the light receptors are all of the same type, it is doubtful that most cephalopods can see color. (To see color, humans have three different light receptor types sensitive to different wavelengths of light). In the octopus, the right-angle arrangement of the cell blocks allows octopuses to see the polarization of light, which is something people do not see.</p>
<p>However, there are (at least) two theories about how octopuses might obtain information about color. First, each wavelength of light is in focus at a slightly different arrangement of the eye. Possibly the octopus can change the sphericity of its pupil and tell by where focus is best what colors are present. Second, the visual pigment molecule is also present in octopus skin. Their color change organs (chromatophores) can expand and contract, conceivably acting as color filters and allowing octopuses information about colors of light on the skin. To my knowledge both these mechanisms are still speculative - the physics and anatomy exist but we don't yet know if octopuses have access to and use the color information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fantastic explanation, thank you! As a ophthalmic scientist focused on the human retina it would be really interesting to image the octopus retina. Sounds like a great project for some electrophysiologists to work out how their perception of colours works</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not strictly speaking true! Humans can - faintly - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haidinger%27s_brush" target="_blank">perceive the polarization of light</a>, but it's certainly not within the primary capabilities of our eyes. It's more of an incidental thing and you have to kind of train yourself to see it. In normal circumstances, the brain filters it out, but you definitely can see it if you know what you're looking for.</p>
<p>Personally, I find the easiest way to see this elusive phenomenon is with a cell phone or tablet display. Go to <a href="http://whitedisplay.com/" target="_blank">whitedisplay.com</a>, and set your device to show full white page on full brightness. Then bring the display fairly close to your eyes, and start rotating the display on its plane. You should eventually see a faint little <em>thing</em> rotating with the display, in the center of your field of view, but unchanging in apparent size if you move the display further or closer. When the screen is in the upright or horizontal position, the little yellow thing is probably at a 45 degree angle.</p>
<p><del>Interestingly, when I do this experiment without my glasses, the Haidinger's brush rotates <em>with</em> the display, but if I look through my glasses, the &quot;image&quot; rotates <em>counter</em> to the rotation of the display.</del> On further testing I couldn't replicate this.</p></div>		</li>
