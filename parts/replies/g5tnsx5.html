			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree. Renal issues are a big deal. My place (like so many others) is hung up on “sepsis alerts.” Initially we were flooding them in the ed but that’s changed now. Lots of PEs in people who otherwise shouldn’t get them, so most admits are getting some sort of AC, not sure which is best (I’d seen info that TEGs didn’t change in severe covid on heparins).
I’m er, but I try to follow all of my covid admits, some stay in the unit for weeks, just sitting and waiting for them to wean.
Like I said elsewhere, we are getting better at managing it, not sure the meds are doing anything. Just better supportive care.</p></div>		</li>
