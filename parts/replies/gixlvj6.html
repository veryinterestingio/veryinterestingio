			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, a lot of the issues people have with quantum mechanics are because it is not taught well. People get mind boggled by &quot;an electron existing everywhere in space!&quot; And way too much class time is spent on that. When that is true of any wave, for example a wave on the ocean exist across the whole ocean. Not a mind blowing idea. Wave function collapse on the other hand is the unique portion. </p>
<p>A lot of discussion goes into the mathematics edge cases of &quot;well what if we had a perfectly known momentum&quot; etc that can never happen in practice. </p>
<p>Similarly for discussions of electrons as points particles. Statements like &quot;the wave function collapses to a point once measured&quot;. No, no it doesn't. It collapses to a narrow wave packet upon measurement. Collapsing it to an actual point would take an impossible perfectly precise measurement and give the electron an infinite momentum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a wave on the ocean, mathematically it is described as technically everywhere, but bigger in some locations. We can talk about the &quot;location&quot; of the wave on the ocean, even if we can't give one exact single point that is the point that the wave is located at. So far this is very similar to a wavefunction for an electron. </p>
<p>Now lets say we split the wave, hit the front of a boat and splits in half or something like that. Now it is still one wave, but we would describe it as having two peaks, one going right and one going left.   </p>
<p>We can do the same thing in QM with an electron beam. Shoot a single electron and split the wave function in half, one half going right and the other half going left.  </p>
<p>Now we have a sensor of some sort that measures the energy of the part of the wave that hits it. A wall with a pressure sensor behind it or something like that. And one of the half wave pieces hits it. It will measure half the energy of the original wave, and a wave will splash off of it with that same energy (half of the original one). If we have another sensor on the other side measuring the other half of the wave it will report the same thing.</p>
<p>For our electron, we get a very different result. When the half of the wave function hits the sensor, half the time nothing happens. The other half of the time, it detects the full energy of the original electron. The resulting wave that splashes off the sensor has consists of the full energy of the original electron wave, and it is now described as starting off as a splash from that sensor. Furthermore, the other half of the electron wave (that went the other way) is just... gone. This is wavefunction collapse. Once the wave is detected by the sensor, it forms a new wave from that location and the old wave, including parts that are far away (like the other half of the wave that was sent the other direction) cease to exist. </p>
<p>Probability distributions for a particle do this same wavefunction collapse.   Think a bowling ball, when first thrown it has a probability of ending up hitting the pins many different ways (you can map this as a probability wave), but once you hit the first pin, the probability distribution for which pin you hit next no longer cares about the probability of you hitting a different initial pin and what would be the next pins after that. once you know the first pin hit the whole probability wave changes to reflect that new information. </p>
<p>Probability distributions classically don't show interference patterns. If you bring the two halves of a wave on the ocean back together you get an  interfere pattern. Bring the two halves of a probability distribution back together and they just add together. Electron wave functions show interference patterns,  so those wave functions are not simply a probability distribution for a particle. </p>
<p>QM particles act like waves in terms of interference, but act like probability distribution in terms of wavefunction collapse. Which is the really weird part as those are two contradictory things in classical physics. </p>
<p>Side note: if you have 2 sensors, one for each half of the electrons wave function, the half of the time that nothing happens one sensor, corresponds 100% of the time with the other sensor detecting the electron. This is where quantum entanglement comes from if you get multiple particles involved in the wavefunction.</p></div>		</li>
