			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds stupid now but I would have my buddy (big muscley guy) punch me in the back of shoulder hard as he could.<br />
After 1 or 2 it always felt better when he got the right spot,if not right then than within a few hours.<br />
Still happens now sometimes,but I just hurt for days as buddy lives about 30m away.<br />
He would still come do it,I just don’t want to give him the hassle.<br />
Wife can throw a shoe like a pro,unfortunately only punches as hard as a sick kitten.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He’s my longest and bestest friend,if I were gay I would marry him in a heartbeat.<br />
He’s been my brofriend for 26+ years,he was there when my kids were born and I was there to drive his family home from transplant center 14hrs away in a blizzard.<br />
My favorite was when I could be there to support him when he was getting his balls cut off due to an unfortunate flesh eating infection.<br />
I told him I was there for the story but how do you say “Possibly losing your balls is scary as fuck and you’re too much of a testosterone fueled mans man to admit it”.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fortunately for you, humans have invented a whole slew of tools that allow us to apply more force to an object than we otherwise could.</p>
<p>Just off the top of my head, you could have her try whacking you with a heavy rubber mallet, maybe wrap the head of the mallet with a small towel or something if that is a bit too harsh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>She’s 4’10” so no mass or leverage to even put behind a tool lol.<br />
She’s had major back surgery so won’t walk on my back either.<br />
When she throws a shoe however she has a way of curving it through spacetime so it actually lands with the mass and velocity of 1000 laden swallows.<br />
I guess I could stand by the wall and have her throw shoes but her eyesight is about as good as a little league parents secondary referree skills and I don’t want a concussion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One day 4 months ago my neck started hurting when doing lateral raises with dumbells. Has not stopped since. Went to the doctor and the x-rays turned out normal. He gave me some muscle relaxants, but so far there has been no improvement :/ I just wish I could go to the gym again</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the exact same thing. Took 3 months, but was finally approved for an mri. Turns out it was 2 bulged discs, probably from the weightlifting. Oddly enough a chiropractor fixed it with some adjustments. I never would have gone to one but I was desperate and now I'm glad I did. No pain for almost a year now.</p></div>		</li>
