			<div class="markdown"><p>The ability to very quickly analyze new rocks (like lava) to understand what is going on in the volcanic system as an eruption progresses. They did this for the 2018 Kilauea event and could tell when a newer batch of magma was coming through! This used to take much longer and has dramatically sped up recently. Also drones are very cool and we can get information from a much safer distance.</p></div>		</li>
