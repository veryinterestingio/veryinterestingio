			<div class="markdown"><p>Did C&amp;C predate the original Age of Empires?  They referred to their story modes that were sets of missions following historical figures as campaigns, compared to the main story mode which was really just skirmish.</p>
<p>Also did the original C&amp;C have a normal skirmish mode?  I had it for PS1 and I remember a few unlockable missions I played like that but they weren't sandboxy, just not story related.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I mean, they weren't campaign games, so other games had to distinguish themselves, especially when they had a death match mode as well.</p></div>		</li>
