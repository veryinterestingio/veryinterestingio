			<div class="markdown"><p>Does Benedictin count as a historical atrocity? There has been no causal link proven between it and birth defects, it continued to be available in Canada (as Diclegis) and was re-approved in the US a few years back (also as Diclegis). (As well as continued to be used in the “DIY combo” of unisom/ B6 supplements even when it wasn’t a single pill.)
Thalidomide I get but it doesn’t seem like Benedictin really falls in the “atrocity” category based on the info I’ve seen.</p></div>		</li>
