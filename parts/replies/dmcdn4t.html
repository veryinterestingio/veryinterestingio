			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe you want to look into the storm surge. The section labeled <a href="https://serc.carleton.edu/research_education/katrina/understanding.html" target="_blank">The Storm Surge and Flooding of New Orleans</a> is an example of what mitchanium mentioned. </p>
<p>Reading that section says not all that height is air pressure alone, some of it is water pushed by wind and the result of water pushed into enclosed spaces, but the <a href="https://serc.carleton.edu/research_education/katrina/understanding.html" target="_blank">model</a> shows something like 10-12 feet of water on the southern shore of the lake. Whether it was just air pressure of a combination of that and wind, that is still a wall of water created by nothing more than the movement of air. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the change in height from air pressure is super duper easy to calculate. You just take standard pressure at sea level in inches of water column, and then subtract the change in inches of water column at the lowest ground pressure from the storm. Katrina hit 920 mb, or 369.7 in h20, and standard sea level pressure is 407.3 in h20. This works out to 37.6 inches of water, just from the low pressure. </p></div>		</li>

It felt like an action/thriller movie. I hope I don't sound crass by saying that.
The backdrop of a city below sea level, the aggradation of the river, its leeves the last bastion (which failed), the data explaining how at one point it was a hurricane five fueled by the warm water and the storm tides of massive height.</p>
<p>Nature always humbles me with its landscape altering events that in the larger scale of things are part of its cyclical processes.</p>
<p>It gets me thinking about how India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Niger are facing flooding now as well but do not have the resources that the US has.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aeronautical engineer here - the mechanism behind fluid levels changing depending on pressure is based upon the hydrostatic equation.</p>
<p>Imagine you have a tube in the shape of a U with water in the bottom. When air pressure is equal on both sides, the water level will be equal on both sides. If air pressure is greater on one side than the other, it will push down the fluid on the side with greater pressure.</p>
<p>Now imagine if one side is free to open atmosphere, and one side has a vacuum. What you now have is a  <a href="https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MercuryBarometer.svg#mw-jump-to-license" target="_blank">Barometer.</a>  A U shape still works, but this design is effectively the same. </p>
<p>Assuming we made a decent vacuum, the only gas on the vacuum side is vapor pressure at a low enough pressure we assume it to be zero.</p>
<p>So in situations where the ambient pressure decreases, more fluid is pulled towards away from the vacuum - i.e. The apparent vacuum grows larger, the column of fluid hung from the vacuum shrinks and the fluid in the new lower pressure environment raises slightly.</p>
<p>A barometer is useful for measuring absolute pressure, but the effect of barometric effect of atmospheric pressure changing the height of a fluid can be observed without requiring the side with a vacuum.</p>
<p>The lowest observed pressure in hurricane katrina was 920 mb, roughly 9% below standard day sea level pressure.</p>
<p>I'm on mobile and need sleep, but I'm determined to do an example problem and show my work tomorrow if you want me to.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What I think is super interesting (And that i've never heard of) is the lake levels rising due to the low air pressure alone.  How did we figure this out?  That seems to be...difficult to figure out after the fact.</p>
<p>I'd also be interesting in what <em>you</em> think is the most interesting stats in Katrina is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bad news is starting to get out, unfortunately. The local environmental justice org TEJAS and Sierra Club have an early rundown:
<a href="http://content.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2017/08/least-10-houston-area-chemical-facilities-and-oil-and-gas-refineries-have" target="_blank">http://content.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2017/08/least-10-houston-area-chemical-facilities-and-oil-and-gas-refineries-have</a></p>
<p>Corpus Christi has experienced several chemical leaks, some on purpose. Flaring off large amounts of gases is part of shutting down refinery operations, but it's not pretty. The Valero refinery had a flare so large that nearby residents called the fire department.
<a href="https://patch.com/us/across-america/huge-flaring-corpus-christi-refinery-sparked-power-outage" target="_blank">https://patch.com/us/across-america/huge-flaring-corpus-christi-refinery-sparked-power-outage</a></p>
<p>And Koch Industries (Flint Hills Resources) refinery in Corpus Christi was flaring benzene last Friday, as it shut down:
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060059445" target="_blank">https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060059445</a></p>
<p>Farther north, the greater Houston region is having several serious problems at various petrochemical facilities, where flooding was/is much worse. Companies have disclosed 2 million lbs of chemical releases to TX government:
<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/29/hurricane-harvey-chemical-danger-242142" target="_blank">http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/29/hurricane-harvey-chemical-danger-242142</a></p>
<p>The Arkima industrial chemical facility in Crosby TX is in danger of a serious fire or explosion. The manufacturing process involves keeping certain chemicals at very low temperatures, just below freezing, but the plant has been without power for days and at the moment is still inundated with water:
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/arkema-warns-it-cant-prevent-potential-chemical-explosion-in-texas-1504124326" target="_blank">https://www.wsj.com/articles/arkema-warns-it-cant-prevent-potential-chemical-explosion-in-texas-1504124326</a></p>
<p>Exxon and Valero both reported releases of carcinogens, specifically benzene and toluene. Lightning struck a Dow Chemical plant and set off a benzene leak. And Flint Hills flared benzene, see above.</p>
<p>Days ago, people in the Houston area reported acrid smells in the air. Keeping in mind that not all dangerous gases have a scent, but what is described here isn't a good thing:
<a href="https://newrepublic.com/minutes/144487/unbearable-petrochemical-smells-reportedly-drifting-houston" target="_blank">https://newrepublic.com/minutes/144487/unbearable-petrochemical-smells-reportedly-drifting-houston</a></p>
<p>The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality shut off all air quality monitors before Harvey hit, and Houston Press says it best:
&quot;...TCEQ has shut down all of its air quality monitors in the Houston area to avoid water and wind damage related to the storm. In other words, plants and refineries are being left on the honor system. They can report whatever is emitted, but if they don't do so, there are not any state air quality monitors running to catch them.&quot;
<a href="http://www.houstonpress.com/news/houston-ship-channel-communities-deal-with-weird-smell-during-harvey-9741373" target="_blank">http://www.houstonpress.com/news/houston-ship-channel-communities-deal-with-weird-smell-during-harvey-9741373</a></p>
<p>Regarding the other person's comment here about chemicals releases being permitted by the EPA:
Even when EPA gives a permit, pollution is still pollution. Flaring can be very dangerous, and this crisis is demonstrating how much (extra) pollution is created when refineries shut down in a &quot;controlled&quot; situation:
<a href="https://qz.com/1066097/hurricane-harvey-oil-refineries-are-polluting-latino-and-low-income-neighborhoods/" target="_blank">https://qz.com/1066097/hurricane-harvey-oil-refineries-are-polluting-latino-and-low-income-neighborhoods/</a></p>
<p>As Quartz notes, and community advocates on the ground have stressed, all of this pollution, on top of the rain, floods and storm, tends to hit low income refinery communities the hardest. Many of those communities are majority people of color. And while the storm doesn't discriminate, some aspects of the petrochemical and real estate economies clearly do. </p>
<p>The Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst has a helpful annual ranking of air, water &amp; climate pollution, down to the individual facilities and community demographics:

			<div class="markdown"><p>While chemical leaks are definitely worrisome, maybe I can provide one tidbit for a little bit piece of mind:</p>
<p>Chemical plants send organic compounds (off-spec, side products, start-up, ...) to flares all the time. Any flammable compounds are completely incinerated and rendered inert under regular operating conditions. I know there was a very intensely reported issue with HF found in refinery flare gas in the US, but you will like the alternatives even less.</p>
<p>Source: process engineer  </p>
<p>Edit: that plant with the power failure is what I am worried about. It produces peroxides, which are notoriously powerful oxidizing agents. Hence the general warning about explosions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just wanted to make a quick note about the air quality monitors. The TCEQ monitors don't operate to catch specific facilities. They're used to track ambient conditions. The facilities have a lot of stack testing data to know what is coming out of their plants. They are also required to keep logs of such data in the event of shutdown/startups, upsets (emergency venting), or maintenance. In no way are these facilities on some kind of honor system. There is data to backup their emissions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Quick question about the flooding happening in Texas right now. How does it happen? </p>
<p>We've seen several photos of large interstates completely submerged in water but there is still plenty of land for that water to move to. (The rest of Texas) what exactly is causing the water to rise so high in a certain area? </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw either an article or another post on Reddit somewhere that over the last 20 or so years, Houston has been improving its water drainage system by creating storm drains under any new road construction. The system helps divert water away from homes and instead floods the streets (since it is safer there). Those incredible pictures from Houston interstates are at least partly a result of that flood control system. It is also a reason why they did not issue an evacuation order, because people would be sitting in traffic while the water rose, resulting in unnecessary deaths.</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mananercal" target="_blank">Mananercal</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>So they made the system so that it floods the streets and prevents people from being evactuated. I'm sure there is a more in depth answer as to why this is still better than trying to get all of the water away in other channels (especially since undergound drains can fill up and clog and flood everything anyway, and the amount of rain and flooding is completely unexpected), but that sounds like it may not have worked as well as intended.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly it's mainly the lay of the land thay dictates where the water will go.</p>
<p>By that i mean that if land contours or people  prevent flooding to that area then that inevitably means flooding somehwere else.</p>
<p>The reality though is that most areas are only protected to a certain degree (and economically justified {cost benefit analysis} projects) and most are reactively responded to as opposed to proactively responded to.</p>
<p>Now don't roast your local government or council for lack of action because the world really has been impacted by global warming.  Eg for any business case or flood scheme that i propose in the UK i have to factor in  20% additional damage due to climate change.....and trust me storm intensities have got worse here. </p>
