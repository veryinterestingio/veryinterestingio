<p>Take gambling. Casinos have it, but also bingo or lottery or even videogame mystery boxes. Moving one to the other likely has more to do with the exploitation of that reward system than the other superfluous aspects of those habits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A big part of loot boxes and gambling (which are essentially the same) is the random reward.</p>
<p>If you got paid out 90% of your money back  every time you hit the slot machine button, no one would do it.</p>
<p>If you got the thing you wanted every time you bought a lootbox, you'd just be shopping.</p>
<p>The random reward increases likelihood of addiction because it holds back the dopamine and then gives you a big hit every once in a while.</p></div>		</li>
