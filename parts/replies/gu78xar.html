<p>During ice ages, large sheets of ice cover the polar latitudes. In practical terms, this means that large chunks of Canada, Russia and Scandinavia become uninhabitable, because they're buried under glaciers. Given the size and relative population density the first two might be okay but Europe would not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the downside is the same downside we are currently experiencing, in that a rapid change is bad. If it was a natural slow change, there's nothing wrong with it, but a fast change would most likely cause extinctions (the idea of an artificial ice age comes to mind).</p>
<p>This starts getting into the territory of philosophy and perspective though. Humans have caused the extinction of many ice age species that may not have occurred without our mass hunting. On top of that, we have caused a lot of environmental damage that has lead to extinctions. An ice age would be great for us, but the Earth is indifferent. In terms of overall planetary health, I genuinely believe whatever curbs our population is the best. If the climate continues on it's current projectory, barring a Venus situation, then life will learn how to thrive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right. I was forgetting about that. I don't think it changes the land bridge thing though.  Land bridges were usually permanent for thousands of years during the glacial. And when they disappeared they generally disappeared over centuries. I mean I am sure the end was abrupt. There was a storm when the waves finally went over.  Like doggerland existed for thousands of years. (or milions depending how you look at it) Berringia existed for tens of thousands of years, either as full land bridge or  as intermittent connection.</p>
<p>Generally after  land bridge that surfaces would be undistinguishable from land in a hundred years.</p></div>		</li>
