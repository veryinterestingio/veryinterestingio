<p>But you need to give them a push, don't you? Like when you make an oxygen-hydrogen torch</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay this is cool, I didnâ€™t know this. How does a platinum plate add the activation energy to cause combustion? Is it generating a voltage due to the H2 and O2 that can cause ignition?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I would describe this exactly opposite: the hydrogen is split into positive ions and electrons on the surface of the catalyst. The catalyst surface is also a conductor and carries the electrons away. </p>
<p>The positive ions (protons basically) defuse through a PEM membrane that only allows positively charged particles through. On the other side, the H+ ions combine with oxygen, and complete the circuit

<p>No, the combustion of hydrogen, like many chemical reactions, is spontaneous.</p>
<p>My physical chemistry professor used the combustion of hydrogen to demonstrate the point that &quot;spontaneous&quot; doesn't mean &quot;fast&quot;: at room temperature, the spontaneous reaction has a half-life of 10^26 years, but with a spark, the non-spontaneous reaction has a half-life of 10^-6 seconds.</p>
<p>So... You don't need to give it a push unless you want it to react before the heat death of the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't really think the other comments addressed this well, so here's another stab at the explanation:</p>
<p>There's an electric field created by the chemical potential difference between the two sides of the plate. This is the &quot;Nernst potential&quot;, which functionally is trying to pry electrons away from the hydrogen, providing your &quot;push&quot;. </p>
<p>A portion of this available voltage is used to overcome the activation barriers of the reaction, which is one of the reasons why the operating voltage of the fuel cell is lower than the theoretical Nernst potential.</p>
<p>You can reduce the amount of voltage lost to overcoming this activation barrier by introducing catalysts to the reaction sites, and/or by increasing the reaction temperature</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If memory serves me well, from college chemistry the H2 and O would combine in the forward reaction without any added energy or catalyst bit it would take 100s of years for the atoms to align correctly in a random fashion. The catalyst (PEM in this case) just holds the Atoms in a precise orientation as to promote the reaction.  The reaction requires the oxygen to share an electron with the hydrogen ie reduce the hydrogen and oxydizize the oxygen in a classic redox reaction. The shared electron is not just passed to the the hydrogen but instead forced to flow around an external circuit (thus doing work) on its way to the hydrogen.</p></div>		</li>
