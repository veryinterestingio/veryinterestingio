			<div class="markdown"><p>Just...wow. </p>
<p>Incidentally, I just watched a show called &quot;fatal attractions&quot; which describes how chimps attack people, and was surpised to learn they're physically stronger than just about any human, despite apparent size differences, and that they dismember people and animals so easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep they not only have denser muscle mass than us, their muscle fibres are longer, which gives them far more power.</p>
<p>As a trade off they donâ€™t have the fine motor control and level of fast-twitch muscles we have. A chimp could never do something like threading a needle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They have about 120% human muscle mass per pound. They're stronger than us but smaller. That actually means that exceptionally in shape humans like the rock or the guy who played the mountain could overpower a chimp without too much difficulty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No not really, in this specific case chimps and monkeys have the  hardware and the ability to speak like humans but haven't developed the brain power and connections for it. It's due to energy cost, the brain eats half the energy in your body and emits by far the most heat to prove it. But it's also an evolutionary thing, birds are able to do it because they need it for mating but chips don't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I know was that the first model on how vision works in the first layers of the brain was understand through experiments on those monkeys in the 80s, they showed objects and saw the activation of different neuron layers and finally a small subset connecting to outside the visual cortex, so the went and did horizontal, vertical, diagonal lines, circles and figured out the first convolutional neural network this way, but they didn't have the hardware to simulate it to the point of making a product out of it, around 2005 they restarted the effort with newer hardware.</p>
<p>I spent a few minutes on Google and came up with:
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4401582/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4401582/</a></p>
<p>Which doesn't refer exactly to what I remember, this is focused on color vision and was done later but it also states the similarities of the eyes, retinas, neurons and visual systems between rhesus macaques and humans.</p>
<p>I'll try looking on YouTube I remember the CV holding the presentation had an black and white film of it.</p></div>		</li>
