			<div class="markdown"><p>A major research in my lab is the link between inflammation and cancer. They are tightly linked. Inflammation is a hallmark of cancer. Chronic inflammation predisposed the inflamed tissue for cancer. It can also be the other way around. Cancer develops because of mutations and there is inflammation in the site of cancer. We find inflammation because immune cells are recruited to tumor sites and they are corrupted by the cancer cells to support their growth.</p></div>		</li>
