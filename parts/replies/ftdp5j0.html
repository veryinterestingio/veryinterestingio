			<div class="markdown"><p>Sound travels faster in water than in air. Light works the same way, it moves faster through some materials than other.</p>
<p>For example, the speed of light through water is lower than c (speed of light in vacuum). When you have a nuclear reactor immersed in liquid coolant, the charged particles released by the reactor are moving faster than the speed of light through water, which causes cherenkov radiation.</p>
<p>Check out the Wikipedia page on cherenkov radiation, it includes some neat pictures that I'm too lazy to link. Cherenkov radiation looks like a bluey-green glow coming from nowhere in particular.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Light has <a href="https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/GroupAndPhaseVelocity/" target="_blank">more than one speed</a> in matter, the phase velocity is just one of them. And it's the phase velocity that's relevant to the Cherenkov effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The phase velocity is how fast the peaks of a pure sine wave are travelling. What we commonly call &quot;the speed of light&quot;, or c,  is the phase velocity of light in a vacuum.</p>
<p>The phase speed can vary in a medium, like glass or air, because light, a wave in the electromagnetic field, interacts with the medium. The medium will in turn act back on the electromagnetic field, and this alters the wave and causes it to behave differently.</p>
<p>How differently depends on the electric and magnetic properties of the medium. A medium like glass slows the speed of the phase velocity by an amount that's frequency-dependent, which is why white light going through a prism diverges into a rainbow. Different speeds mean different refractive indexes, means different refraction angles.</p>
<p>There are actually circumstances, like in a plasma, where the phase velocity of light can actually be higher than the speed of light in vacuum!  It would seem like this isn't allowed, but it's actually fine; the hard limit in physics is about moving information from place-to-place; that has to be light speed or slower. You can't transmit information on a pure sine wave, you have to modulate it somehow, most crudely by switching it on and off.</p>
<p>The effect of those information-carrying modulations is always slower than c; we call the speed that the modulations go at the &quot;group velocity&quot;.</p>
<p>As a crude sort of analogy, imagine shining a spot from a laser pointer onto the moon. If you flick the pointer, you could make the spot move incredibly fast from one edge of the moon to the other. Perhaps even a sufficiently fast flick could make the spot go faster than c across the surface. But the pointer itself is always moving slower than c, and the laser light travelling to the moon and back is going at c. The thing that seems to be going faster than c is a non-physical phantom.</p></div>		</li>
