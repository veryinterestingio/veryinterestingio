			<div class="markdown"><p>Working as a scheduler in the administrative office of a factory has taught me a lot about just how dishonest and manipulative business execs are. It's been eye opening to see how they attempt to control the culture and relations in the plant toward their favor.</p>
<p>So we end up with this weird shame ingrained in a lot of older workers so sharing your wages or salary feels like taking your pants down.</p>
<p>It's grimier up here than on the shop floor with all the oil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My father used to work for a local ISP. Got in on the ground floor as tier 1 tech support, 15 years later he was the senior sysadmin for the whole company.</p>
<p>Apparently he was really, really good at his job. At one point, his boss called him in and said they'd done some research and realized he was being paid well below industry standard, so they were giving him a 40% raise. He hadn't even asked for it. They were terrified that he might decide to go elsewhere.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, stories like yours are far more common. I'm glad you were able to find something better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My employer recently did an audit of their payrates, found what the standard range was for specific job titles, and bumped up the pay of anyone who was below the low end.  Got a nice raise out of that one, since just about everyone who codes for the niche database I worked on was undervalued everywhere.</p>
<p>There are ethical employers out there, but they aren't exactly common.</p></div>		</li>
