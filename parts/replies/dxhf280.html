Ontario is: 6 months of no payments/interest after finishing school, no payments or provincial interest for up to 10 x 6 month periods during the repayment, customized &quot;fair repayment&quot; plans if you're unable to pay the full monthly payment, then anything owing after 15 years is gone.</p></div>		</li>
