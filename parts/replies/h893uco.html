			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm more familiar with Japanese, but basically it's guessing there too. Sometimes you can make a pretty good guess - a lot of kanji are built up from parts (radicals), and those parts can denote similar readings (referred to as <a href="https://thekanjicode.com/list-of-phonetic-components/" target="_blank">phonetic components</a>). </p>
<p>For example, 白 means white, but as a component is read as &quot;haku&quot;, and so lots of kanji that incorporate that radical are also read as &quot;haku&quot; in compounds - 泊, 伯, 拍, 舶, etc. But there are a lot of exceptions, so it's not a one-to-one system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah cause kanji is essentially chinese. 白 means white in chinese too. There are some words that are only used in Japanese or have a different meaning but the majority of kanji have the exact same meaning in chinese and japanese.</p>
<p>obv they are pronounced totally different and the grammar is also different. but its a good bet that a chinese person can read a random kanji character and understand it</p></div>		</li>
