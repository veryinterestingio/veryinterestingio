			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very important to understand, and is a common misunderstanding, but the COVID mRNA vaccine never interacts with our DNA. The protine and mRNA never even enters the cell nucleus where DNA is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But don't the instructions for fighting protein eventually make it into the DNA? How else would new cells have the instructions for creating it?</p>
<p>Edit: as I said in another reply, this is not mean to be argumentative. I am just trying to understand how the body knows how to keep making the immune response over time and figured this was the best place to ask</p></div>		</li>

<p>The two weeks is because that is the time it takes for the body to react and understand the how to fight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it is probably also true that EVERY vaccine you have ever taken is not fully effective until about two weeks after administering it.  Your immune system needs time to develop B and T cells in response to the antigens it sees.</p>
<p>The reason that we are so fixated on the time to full immunity with the COVID vaccines is that we're all waiting to rush out back into the middle of an ongoing, growing pandemic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Step one is to develop <em>a</em> immune response, step two is to develop <em>enough</em> of an immune response, step three is to <em>store/codify</em> that immune response.</p>
<p>And then depending on virus-specific details, sometimes you need a booster or repeat shot to make sure the codified details / stored details are actually kept beyond a few weeks or months.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. The only real exception would be when they include immunoglobulins(antibodies) as a part of the vaccine to provide some Immediate protection. I believe this is true if the post exposure rabies vaccine for example. Most vaccines don’t include this though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are currently three categories of COVID vaccines:</p>
<ul>
<li>mRNA vaccines, which work by having your own cells produce things according to a (mRNA) recipe that look like virus bits, which your own immune system then attacks (and records how to attack).</li>
<li>Adenovirus based vaccines; where they get an Adenovirus (which is basically harmless) to dress up like a COVID virus. It looks like a COVID so it gets the full immune system response, but it can't do anything because it only knows how to be COVID skin-deep.</li>
<li>Deactivated virus vaccines. These are the <em>actual</em> viruses, with some specific bits of it deactivated. Not too sure on the details what they deactivate, but these are the easiest to manufacture, but also not the most effective.</li>
</ul>
<p>We currently have Pfizer and Moderna delivering mRNA vaccines. J&amp;J, Astra-Zeneca and Sputnik are Adenovirus-mediated vaccines, and Bharat and Sinopharm are deactivated COVID virus vaccines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>im now picturing something like it came out of cells at work where the adenovirus is just some poor cell in a godzilla costume getting chased around by the immune system</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I understand the Adenovirus vaccines correctly, they deliver a bit of DNA that transcribes to the spike protein mRNA sequence. The advantage is they can be stored for longer at more reasonable temperatures</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What leads to the latter being less effective? Wouldn’t the immune system attacking the actual virus be very effective in developing a future immune response?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They all have similar efficacy at reducing risk of hospitalization and death. Given mRNA is reduced efficacy against infection, maybe infection shouldn't be the benchmark anymore, but prevention of hospitalization and death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason would be we are providing the body a good indicator to identify the virus. We dont really know yet though because the inactivated vaccines are not in wide scale use. Their main disadvantage is the time taken to develop them.</p>
<p>Once the inactivated are introduced we will get data to compare their effectiveness. Its suspected they may be better for the reason you gave.</p>
<p>The big question will be mutations though. So far the vaccines in use have remained effective despite mutations, but that may change. If that happens mRNA will be very quick to roll out a new version.</p>
<p>At the moment its looking like a Chinese inactivated vaccine (developed from the original virus) is less effective against the current variants. Improving it will mean starting again and this version is only just ready. Its still worth it though - we need a mix of vaccines and as many produced as we can to cover the global population.</p></div>		</li>
