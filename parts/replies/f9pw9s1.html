			<div class="markdown"><p>Parker already has found some very exciting, unexpected waves dubbed “switchbacks” that we have reported on. Funny thing is that they disappear just outside the distance of closest approach. So these are very different waves from those far out at Voyager. Yet we certainly expect more insight by going further in. The next step closer occurs in January 2020, so let’s see. -Arik Posner</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the large scale switchbacks, there are some surprising smaller scale waves observed in the FIELDS data (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1818-7" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1818-7" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1818-7</a></a>).  These include plasma wave modes such as Langmuir waves and Bernstein waves.  The signatures of these waves are electric field enhancements near the plasma frequency and the electron gyrofrequency, respectively.  The waves themselves are generated by electron beams and other non-equilibrium features in the plasma.  Overall, our impression is that the solar wind close to the Sun is more structured, more dynamic, and just more interesting than the wind we see close to the Earth. -Marc Pulupa</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the paper you linked, there's mention of a transition to kinetic range turbulence as the solar wind expands to fill the heliosphere. Has the cause of that turbulence been identified as a specific type of gyrokinetic instability, i.e. Electron Temperature Gradient, Micro-tearing, Kinetic-Ballooning, etc.?</p></div>		</li>
