			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not business vs government.  It is both!  Addressing climate change cannot be done without the determined action of corporations to decarbonize their products and services. Individuals can and should also decarbonize their daily life by ensuring the energy deficiency of homes and offices, switching to renewable energy, using more shared and smart efficient transport, and ensuring their savings are not on risky high carbon assets.  Above all, individuals can send a powerful political signal to governments through judicious voting</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! I appreciate the answer. To clarify, I didn’t mean it was either businesses or governments, I’m wondering what solutions you see coming from each, and how they’re different. </p>
<p>Climate change is a global problem, but governments tend to work regionally even when the results of their actions transcend borders. In contrast, businesses truly can be global. I see that as an opportunity but it’s also difficult to regulate. How does that impact the solutions you see for each?</p></div>		</li>
