			<div class="markdown"><p>Cratons can break up if the lithosphere thins below them (this has been happening to the north China craton for the better part of the past 500 million years) which is a similar mechanism to rifting. You may also want to look up Wilson cycles as cratons can be broken up when super continents break apart :) </p></div>		</li>

<p>the Laurentian Craton that makes up a large part of the North American continent</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You mention the Laurentian Craton as the &quot;core&quot; of the North American continent, so I googled it and found a picture which shows it to be most of the Eastern half of North America. I was surprised by this as growing up in the Upper Midwest I learned about the Canadian Shield as some of the oldest rock on the continent. Is the Shield a subset of the Laurentian Craton that contains older rock? What is the distinction between the two features?</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The Canadian Shield, also called the Laurentian Plateau, or Bouclier canadien (French), is a large area of exposed Precambrian igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks (geological shield) that forms the ancient geological core of the North American continent (the North American Craton or Laurentia).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically if I'm understanding right, the Canadian Shield is an exposed part of the craton's core.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can also get smaller as they subduct under another plate. For example, the Explorer, Juan de Fuca, and Gorda Plates are the remaining broken fragments of the Faralon Plate. All are growing smaller as they subduct under the North American Plate off British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and Northern California.</p></div>		</li>
