			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, most places utilize a mixing valve. So the water tank is usually stored at like 160 degrees and that water is mixed with cold water to achieve a safe temperature for people.</p>
<p>They do this to prevent bacteria growth in the tank. You’ll also get more available hot water because you’re mixing with a small amount of cold water</p>
<p>Edit: someone pointed out that it’s supposed to be 140 degrees. Ours is set at 140. I’m not sure why I put 160.</p>
<p>Edit 2: The numbers are Fahrenheit￼ not Celsius. The water is not boiling it’s about 60 Celsius</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's the benefit for the higher temp in your case? Were there infrequently bacteria problems in the tank or other issues with it like not enough hot water for guests? Keeping at a higher temp and mixing more cold water makes me think it's less energy efficient than storing the water at a cooler temp initially.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's a universal constant, I'm starting to discover.  Ask anyone in a position of authority for something or about something that they have no idea about, and the answer is an automatic <strong>no</strong> because it's safer than saying yes and being wrong.</p>
<p>I actually have to deal with this on two fronts, as I work in two different fields: Emergency Medical Services and IT.</p>
<p>In one case it's protected health information, and doctors and nurses who <em>should</em> know <em>exactly</em> when and to whom they can release what and what the exceptions are telling me they can't give me information that I need &quot;because of HIPAA.&quot;  I can explain at length exactly what parts of HIPAA apply and what parts don't and what specific exemption what I need falls under, and still about 90% will double down and say no because they don't actually know what it is their job to know.  </p>
<p>Funny, though, once I ask to speak with their HIPAA compliance manager--pretty much every organization in healthcare has to have a designated &quot;buck stops here&quot; person responsible for compliance--most of them suddenly can comply with the request after they put me on hold for five minutes.</p>
<p>And IT?  Don't even get me started about IT.  People who don't know fuck all about cybersecurity deny basic functional requests citing imagined &quot;vulnerabilities,&quot; a proposal to rewrite a server-side script to take advantage of new hardware, software, and OS capabilities gets shot down for similarly stupid reasons that boil down to the fact that the person being asked doesn't understand any of the technologies thoroughly, much less how they're intended to work together, and purchasing requests for very specific hardware requirements for very specialized applications get denied because &quot;we've got this off-the-shelf machine on contract, why can't you use that?&quot;  And like your situation, when the servers are quietly updated to the new code and everything starts running faster, nobody actually catches the change or realizes anything is set up any differently, but the same people who shot down the proposal take credit for the performance improvement that they have no clue where it came from or why things are working better.</p>
<p>Ignorance or incompetence paired with a superiority complex, indeed!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since I actually design and build those storage tanks, I can tell you that they are all designed per ASME section IV HLW (aka potable water storage) which max out per the code at 160. The tanks are usually glass lined, or sometimes concrete or epoxy lined. The glass lining is the most common type, you will find this lining for example in every domestic water heater in your garage. Both domestic and industrial storage tanks have magnesium rods in it to inhibit potential corrosion (different materials exist depending on the water in your area, if is has eggs smell,...).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Interesting, i did not know that.   i don't think i have ever been offered any kind of choice when buying a replacement hot water heater, although well water quality varies considerably from one area around here to the next.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You do but it’s still the same concept. The hot water or steam coils inside a massive tank that heats the domestic hot water (potable, drinkable, whatever you want to call it.)</p>
<p>The hot water tank has a temperature gauge that is wired to a solenoid from the boiler. When it drops below temp the solenoid opens allowing hot water/steam to go through the coil inside the hot water tank and heat the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not always! It mostly depends on age of the system and area. In mine it would be <em>extremely</em> rare to find an indirect tank or heat exchanger setup. Almost all hotels (and hell, hospitals) use multiple commercial tank-style water heaters (250k+ BTUs) piped parallel. Even doing a boiler w/ storage tanks is fairly uncommon tho it does seem to be gaining popularity with the new generations of boilers. (The ones that basically package 4+ tankless units in a box so that you have a ton of redundancy built in)</p></div>		</li>
