			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm far from knowledgeable on this subject, but as far as I know that's exactly what they do. They dive down get themselves attacked so the squid holds on to them and then they quickly resurface. The decompression kills the squid due to a higher inner pressure. Apparently these whales often have scars all over themselves form these attacks. Also some of the &quot;Giant squid vs sailing ship&quot; stories may come from wales taking squid to the surface and these in turn disoriented and in pain hold on to the next best thing.
Same thing happens to humans in space. Unlike in films your head doesn't explode but your eyes will push out a little and your ears will pop (hard :D) because we're build for pressures of around 1013 hPa.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Several giant squid corpses have been found by fishermen in my state of South Australia over the years. As I understand, there are two species: a shorter fatter one and a longer bodied one. I heard that they've never been observed in their natural habitat of the deep ocean. Elusive creatures apparently.</p></div>		</li>
