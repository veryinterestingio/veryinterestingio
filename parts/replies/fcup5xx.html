<p>I agree, the bacteria in the bladder have adapted to that environment. Interestingly we are able to find the same strain of bacteria (or as close as we can measure it) in the bladders and vaginas of women at a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29674608/" target="_blank">single point in time</a>. That means that yes, bladder bacteria can reside in more than one niche (for example the bladder and the vagina). But we don't yet know much about how healthy bacteria live in the bladder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you peed on an open wound, would that bacteria infect it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is not something I worry to much about. Primarily because the levels of bacteria in urine are normally so low that your immune system will be able to kill them off no problem. But that doesn't mean it isn't possible, I don't know of a study that has looked at peeing on wounds. </p>

<p>I think what you are saying here is, &quot;why should we care if bacteria are in the bladder if it doesn't cause a problem?&quot; And that is a great question. The answer is that we think that these bacteria do have effects but we haven't studied them before because urine was considered sterile. For example, no one thought that overactive bladder had a bacterial etiology, yet we see that the diversity of the bladder microbiome directly correlates with symptoms and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26423260/" target="_blank">even response to medication</a>. Also, about 20% of women who have UTI symptoms are negative by standard culture. Probably because standard culture was missing the uropathogen causing the problem. If we don't change how we look at the disorders, we will never change how we treat patients. </p>

<p>Another great question. Did you know that patients undergoing surgery have around a 15-30% risk of developing a post-operative UTI? Because urine was considered sterile, any post-operative UTI was blamed on the doctor. The assumption was that the doctor did something wrong which resulted in an infection. That is why most patients are given an antibiotic following any surgery or instrumentation. But we found that if you look at <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30267143/" target="_blank">patients on the day of surgery</a>, the organism that causes a post-operative infection is usually present. Meaning that we are screening our patients incorrectly on the day of surgery, and it is not normally the surgeon's fault. </p>
<p>So what is the main point? </p>
<p>Yes, for over 70 years, the sterility dogma has worked. And most patients (50-80%) end up being treated successfully. But what about that other group of patients, the patients where it doesn't work? I think we can do better for them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I wonder if for a lot of older people with overactive bladders, it's just their overall decreased immune system changing their bladder flora?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, most bacteria found in urine does survive outside that environment as well.</p>
<p>Urine is not that toxic as to create unique bacteria as for example deep sea lava pools or other extreme environments are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a difference between surviving and thriving though. They need to outcompete the immune system to be a threat, right? If they grow half as fast outside of urine, they are unlikely to be an issue. Or maybe it’s regular bacteria that just find their way into the bladder and are able to cope, in which case it’s more of an issue. </p>
<p>But if doctors are doing surgery on kidneys and treating it as sterile with no ill effects, it sounds pretty effectively sterile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like multiple people commented that surgeons working on kidneys will test they’re work by spilling some urine out into the body. They don’t seem worried about infection. </p>
<p>I have no idea if it’s true, but I’ve seen it twice and that’s enough for me to think it’s possible. It also seems reasonable if the bacteria count is super low or the bacteria are not harmful. And since we just found out urine isn’t sterile, it sounds reasonable that we would’ve known it wasn’t ages ago if peeing on things caused problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another great question. And honestly, we don't know. We think the bacteria are living on the surface of the bladder (known as the uroepithelium) not in the urine itself, but to measure the microbiome we collect urine. That means what we are measuring are the bacteria that are sloughed off the uroepithelium every time you urinate. So if you drink more, and urinate more, there is will be less for us to measure in your urine. But we don't know if that means there is less bacteria on the uroepithelium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun aside: </p>
<p>The medical folks I talk to use the word &quot;sterile&quot; to refer to something which is 100% lacking in bacteria. Not a single cell should be present. So it's a bit of a binary term as they use it. So they would likely say that, no, there's no such thing as &quot;more&quot; or &quot;less&quot; sterile. It either is or it isn't. Given that it isn't, water wouldn't change that.</p>
<p>Of course, when you press them on it, what they seem to really mean is &quot;an amount of bacteria which is of consequence&quot;. </p>
<p>I know that doesn't answer your question, but figured you might find the context interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, as some bacteria might become of consequence depending on the environment, sterile should be just that (100% lacking in bacteria).</p>
<p>So what you say is true. There is no more or less sterile. There is sterile and there isn't.</p></div>		</li>
