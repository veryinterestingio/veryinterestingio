			<div class="markdown"><p>That is correct for the RhD antibody only, however there are at least 15 other red cell antibodies that can create the same problem and some of these, such as anti-K, can be very active in the first pregnancy. Anti Rh-D and anti Rh-c are the big two that account for most of the cases but there are others we check for in the transfusion lab.   </p>
<p>There is also a condition, albeit a lot rarer, where the mum produces antibodies to the baby's platelets instead of red cells. This is called NAIT (neonate autoimmune thrombocytopenia) and can occur during any pregnancy and can be very severe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how does the mother's and baby's blood mix on subsequent pregnancies? From what I understand they shouldn't come in contact with each other, but then this whole rH- thing wouldn't be a problem. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory the placenta provides very good protection between mother and baby and their blood should not mix.</p>
<p>However if mum has any sort of accident or fall during pregnancy that can affect the delicate connections within the placenta there is risk of a transfer of blood between the two.</p>
<p>Sometimes you get pregnant women who require extra prophylactic anti-D injections during their pregnancy if they have any sort of incident or accident that could cause a bleed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anti-M is a red cell antibody. This is an antibody that is within your blood that can attack any red cells which are &quot;M&quot; positive.</p>
<p>There are over 400 of these type of red cell antibodies. Most of these are very rare. In the transfusion lab we only test for 15 of the most common of them. Anti-M is one of these 15 we test for.</p>
<p>Having anti-M in your blood will not affect you at all unless you have a baby who is &quot;M&quot; positive or have to have a blood transfusion. Any blood you have would have to be &quot;M&quot; negative. If you are accidently given blood which is &quot;M&quot; positive you could have a reaction to the blood. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thankfully, we now have RhoGAM. A medication that stops the mothers body from attacking the Rh Positive baby. I think back in the day, before people got pregnant they did a blood test to see if they were different Rh from one another and if they were, were told that they couldn't have kids. </p></div>		</li>
