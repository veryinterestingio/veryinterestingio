			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not convinced clotting due to low flow would contribute to death. </p>
<p>Someone shot through the heart (for the purposes of this let's exclude &quot;bb-gun&quot; i.e.: small injuries to the heart) would, I agree, experience a more or less immediate cessation of blood flow the timings on the order of a few seconds at a maximum. They would also die (or at least  lose consciousness for the last time) after a very short time on the order of a few seconds. </p>
<p>However, after cardiac arrest it's still beneficial to administer CPR even if the person has had no pulse for 30 seconds to a few minutes. And even during clotting tests with blood outside the body it can still take around 20-30 seconds at a minimum for blood to clot. I'm no expert on clotting, but I would guess from these two things that although the blood may clot later, given that the person is very very dead (or irrevocably heading on a path that shortly ends with death) within a few seconds clotting would be the least of their worries.</p>
<p>I'd also second /u/kill___jester's point that the blood wouldn't soak the lungs, although i think cardiac tamponade is unlikely given a) I think you need to be alive for it to count, strictly speaking, and b) I'm assuming the bullet needs to puncture the pericardium as a prerequisite to puncturing the heart.</p>
<p>And another thing that I've just thought of: IANAD but am an emergency first aider. I'm pretty sure syncope is necessarily a <em>temporary</em> and <em>transient</em> (brief) loss of consciousness (as in, they wake up again fairly quickly. More than a few minutes is when I'd start to really worry if I were the first aider). Again, IANAD, but I don't think it's likely that a person who's been literally shot through the heart will regain consciousness any time soon. Pretty sure if they don't wake up it's called a coma, although again, I don't think that applies here given that they're not just unconscious, they're dead.</p>
<p>You've used a lot of words that make it sound like your answer is informed on the face of it, but actually it doesn't really hit the mark on any of it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As opposed to the thorax getting filled with blood from without? Someone putting a blood hose in you and filling you up like some sort of horrific human shaped <del>water</del> blood balloon?</p></div>		</li>

Point being the blood will just  build up in the mediastinum not soak the lungs as if they're some kind of sponge, the original commenter Is definitely ill-informed</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were a few points which I thought of after I had already written this answer. Pleura being there to protect the lungs. Unfortunately, the laziness got the best of me.</p>
<p>I agree with you here and  /u/kill___jester. Cardiac Tamponade is a more likely to happen than your lungs getting soaked up by the blood. I didn't think of this point when I wrote the answer, so thank you both for pointing it out! If the bullet has been shot to the heart, and since OP already assumed that the person shot will die eventually because of the wound, I guess it is safe to say that the Pericardium was definitely the first layer to have been breached by the bullet. Which increases the chances of getting a tamponade.</p>
<p>And you are absolutely right, when syncope hits you and if the blood flow/pressure is not restored for some time, the person becomes prone to Stroke. You can still recover from strokes, however, in this case, where the person is bound to die, the stroke will extend into coma/vegetative state or not, if the person dies before that.</p>
<p>As of the coagulation thing, it is a complication of death. Any form of death leads to coagulation. It won't contribute to the death of the person in this case, but if the blood runs still for a few minutes due to extremely low BP (the person will die before that happens), then you might see that.</p>
<p>I am a medical student, still trying to work my way through. Thank you for pointing out these things, this was a nice discussion and I got to learn a few things too :D</p></div>		</li>
