<p>The label on the arrow said “butthole-esque.” I have been laughing about it ever since.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A crazy alternative explanation for the popularity of open concept: <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/5dmbm3/open-concept-plans-popular-hgtv-men-love-sledgehammers" target="_blank">men watching HGTV</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I spoke with HGTV executives. And the reason that they are so big on open concept is because it gets the male viewers. Like, guys like to watch sledgehammers and, like, taking out walls...  Dudes will only watch HGTV if there's sledgehammers. ...  </p>
<p>And so we all live in a house without walls because it looks good on TV.</p>
