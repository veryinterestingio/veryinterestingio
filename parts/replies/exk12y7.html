			<div class="markdown"><p>I spent the majority of my first year after graduation pile monitoring which is basically measuring how far down those big steal beams are pounded. Had to wear double hearing protection even when waiting in the truck which meant we couldn't use radios to communicate. Got in an argument with the operator one day when the poundy machine was stopped, turned around to walk away with my hearing protection out and fucker started the machine up with me just a few feet away. It hurt. Hearing hasn't been the same since.</p></div>		</li>

I’m walking across the plywood and these men start screaming at me to get off the wood. I get off and go over to them. They proceed to show me 85 foot deep holes under this plywood. No flagging, no cones. No nothing.  I could be at the bottom of a building foundation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Last time I was drilling augur cast piles I had to shove a survey guy because he about stepped into a 60' deep hole full of grout. It was only an 18&quot; hole but it would have broken his hip at a minimum. </p>
<p>Piledriving work is extremely dangerous but it always seems like guys around us just aren't paying attention to what is going on. Just like you stepping on that plywood without knowing what was under it. Always ask before you walk anywhere that piling is being done. Cones, tape, paint, and just about anything else you can use to demarcate dangers ends up covered in grout or dirt or just in the way of running machinery so it isn't really feasible to mark them off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get your opinion and experience. However, it’s a MAJOR osha violation. With no clear signage or flagging on a big site, I had no clue what was happening. I was on my way to the foreman’s office to let them know I was on site and what I was doing. I understand during the drilling it may be fine. But after the hole is covered, it should be coned and taped for safety so people know where the danger is. Just like power lines over construction entrances... they may be 20 ft in the air but there are still signs addressing the possible hazard.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Tell that to the OSHA man when somebody falls down a hole.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Such a unique book. On one hand, you're getting an insane, detailed history lesson on architecture. A rush to construct the most extravagant gathering of all time. The beauty of the &quot;white city&quot;. And then it's juxtaposed with H.H. Holmes using his charm to mislead everybody and going around murdering people. It's a rare book where you get two stories at once and both are just so incredibly interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Perfect example of how for all the efforts that people are trying to build something, there is always someone trying to take it down.</p>
<p>It’s so saddening to not be able to visit any of the structures there. In Philadelphia Where another worlds fair was held, there are remnants of the fixtures and structures created, but most of it it is very underutilized and not really appreciated.</p>
<p>I also loved to hear about the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferris_Wheel" target="_blank">Ferris Wheel</a>and the sleepless nights prior to the opening. Even with today’s technology, such a structure would be stressful on a proper launch and testing.</p></div>		</li>
