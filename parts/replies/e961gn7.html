			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. - and while the Republicans loved and still love Reagan, he would not survive in the GOP of the past ten years.  He was a reasonable and respectful man.  Everyone liked him for that even if you didn’t agree with him 100%.  Don’t know where everything fell apart though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see your point, but our government changes so slowly that our country is being left in the dust.  Look how far we are behind smaller European countries that are more adaptable.  We didn't desegregate the country until 100 years after slavery.  The state of health care and the war on drugs are policies that should have been fixed decades ago when we identified the problems.  It's not that we don't change because we are cautious.  We don't change because change isn't profitable for special interests.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate this the most. Every president immediately gets rid of what the president before did.  Rather than do the sensible thing and build upon the previous parties plan and improve it.  But if they do that they're a traitor to thier party... </p>
<p>Trump for the longest time was only on about repealing the ACA...  And my first thought was &quot;why not take the best parts of that plan,  and add what you think would make it better to create a better plan?  You get the credit,  and the previous president does the hard work of getting it passed in the firstplace and making the groundwork and foundation?  It's win/win,  why does noone think of this??? </p></div>		</li>

<p>No they don't - that's pretty much just Trump. Historically, while the President certainly has his own agenda, he has generally tried to work with existing initiatives and programs. </p>
<p>Look at NAFTA - that was actually signed by Bush, but Clinton came in and got it ratified by Congress.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An extra note or two - Senators are divided into three (arbitrary?) groups, called classes, and 1/3 is up for election every two years. Governors and other State officials are also important elections. Governors have 4 year terms in every state except New Hampshire and Vermont, which are two year terms. 36 states have Midterm Governor elections this year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are arbitrary, yes. They were decided by drawing of lots, the only rule being that a state's two senators must be in different classes. 2018 is a Class 1 election, 2020 Class 2, and 2022 will be Class 3 (and back to Class 1 in 2024). Class 3 is the one class with 34 senators; the other two each have 33 (at least until we add a 51st state, when its senators will be put into Classes 1 and 2)</p></div>		</li>
