<p>You think that’s crazy... tomatoes and potatoes are also native to the Americas and were introduced to Europe in the 1500s and 1600s. Imagine European cuisine without those foods. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And maize (aka ‘corn’, named for size and shape of the kernels... mentions of ‘corn’ in Old World literature prior to the ‘discovery’ of the Americas refers to unspecific grains or even to things like rough salt {eg. corned beef - the corn refers to the large grains of salt used as part of the preserving process].</p>
<p>Also most types of squash (including pumpkins), papaya, avocados, sweet potatoes (but not yams, those are entirely different), and a host of other minor plant produce.  Not a lot of domestic animals though, turkeys and Muscovy ducks primarily.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And people called me stupid for saying tomatoes are not Italian.</p>
<p>Some natives of America literally believed it (tomato) to be a poison fruit but I've forgotten why.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a difference between spicy and spiced. Cumin would make something spiced but not spicy. Indian cuisine has always been spiced, but certain dishes being so spicy is a &quot;new&quot; thing.</p>
<p>I'd also like to point out the spiciness of Indian food is overblown and a misconception. When you get Indian food in the west, it's things that would more normally be eaten at a special occasion. The staple foods and typical weekday meal is usually not spicy. Lentils, rice, coconut, beans, tomatoes, milk etc. with some spices and flavorings like cardamom and tamarind and ginger. Lamb vindaloo isn't something they eat all the time in India, and even then it's a regional thing. Remember that India is a hodgepodge of dozens and dozens of distinct cultures and cuisines. For example, the cuisine in Bengal, which will already be diverse, is a world apart from the cuisine found on the Malabar coast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the spiciness thing depends on the part of India you’re talking about. In Karnataka and TN most food is spicier than the average American would tolerate, whether Sambar for morning Idli or Dosa or most common subjis / currys. </p>
<p>Both heavily spiced and very spicy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most Western &quot;Indian&quot; food isn't even really Indian. It's Indian inspired dishes recreated for a Western palate, particularly British palate because asfaik that's where basically all commonly eaten Indian dishes in the West originate from. Indian immigrants who wanted to sell their food to the locals. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Has anyone here ever had real actual black pepper? Like the kind that makes your eyes water from only the tiniest amount??</p>
<p>The only time I've ever had <em>good</em> black pepper was when I bought a giant bulk container of black peppercorns at Food 4 Less. Lasted me more than a year, and they were mouth-wateringly spicy until the last grind.</p>
<p>Since then, I've never encountered black pepper that even resembles what it should be. There's a reason some BP lovers add a shit ton of BP to their foods- and that's because most preground black pepper that people encounter is stale and flavorless.</p>
<p>Protip: don't buy prefilled peppermills because the peppercorns inside those things is always stale! Companies like to get rid of older batches of peppercorns by sticking them inside pepper mills because people get the illusion that they're grinding fresh peppercorns onto their food. Bulk containers of peppercorns will always have better tasting peppercorns than prefilled peppercorn grinders.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find it interesting, from a culinary point of view. These peppers brought from the new world ended up exploding and becoming defining features of old world cuisine in India.</p>
<p>Ginger and Black Pepper were enjoyed previous to this for their &quot;spiciness&quot;. I have read that because of the new level of intensity, and just the sheer difference in how that spice is perceived, it really took off in popularity.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Of course all of this is based around the the fact that they grew very well, as /u/aragorn18 mentioned above, otherwise they would not have had nearly the culinary impact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I find amazing, these flavors came to India from the new world via European explorers. This flavour became a cultural staple in 2 very separate regions, and they developed flavors around it in such varied ways.</p>
<p>The cheeseburger came about in a time where travelling, advertising, and general consumerism is so much more prevalent than it was when the Portuguese introduced peppers to India.</p>
<p>I just think seeing the web of culinary history and how it became what it is today is truly just fascinating. Even today those chilis are a staple in even more regions than are mentioned in this thread, and they were introduced even later in history.</p></div>		</li>
