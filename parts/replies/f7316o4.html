<p>You can reconnect a severed nerve with microsurgery. You can also cut another (less important) nerve and &quot;plug it in&quot; to a damaged nerve, boosting or restoring function.</p>
<p>The techniques in peripheral nerve surgery are in a renaissance right now. Injury to the peripheral nerves no longer means permenant paralysis!</p>

<p>Do you foresee a near future where robotic microsurgery is as common and predictable as ortho?  </p>
<p>What is the exciting or scary stuff that you know
about the tech?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I just had a surgery restoring my phrenic nerve. They took a nerve from my leg and attached it to a core muscle nerve and then attached the other nerve end to the damaged phrenic nerve to restore diaphragm usage. It’s pretty neat!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a covering surrounding nerves called the perineurium which acts as a guide for the nerve axon to regrow along. Surgically they reattach the two cut or damaged ends using a suture thinner than a human hair under a microscope. The axon regrows along this &quot;nerve highway&quot; at about 1 mm a day</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, apparently slept on my arm too long once and killed my Ulner nerve (the funny bone nerve). Lost feeling in half my hand and most of my arm.</p>
<p>Doctor told me 1mm a day and estimated a year and I'd be back to normal.</p>
<p>Almost exactly a year later, feeling rushes back while I'm in the shower (pins and needles, pain). When the pain subsides I realize I could feel everything again! It was amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're mostly reattaching muscles at that point since that can also be a challenge. Muscles connect to bones primarily at the joints, and they're stretched pretty tightly. Reattaching is pretty complicated and takes a lot of healing. But neuronal axons can reattach to the muscle fibers themselves to reform neuromuscular junctions.</p></div>		</li>
