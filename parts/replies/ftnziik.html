			<div class="markdown"><p>What you're hearing is the down beat. The 1 of the music. If you listen to only the drum in the background, you'll hear that he hits the snare on the next note of the song after the 1 beat.</p>
<p>&quot;lean on  meee........        when youre not strooooong&quot;</p>
<p>...................1 .......2(snare)..3....4(snare)........ 1</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The down beat is easier to hear, but we emphasis the 2 and the 4 with claps and snare out of convention. When in doubt, just listen to the snare drum and clap when you hear a snare. The point of the snare drum is often to emphasize the 2 and the 4, and as it happens a human clap sounds the most similar to the snare drum. That is why we as audience usually want to clap along on with 2 and 4.</p>
<p>I have an even better example of this concept.</p>
<p>Listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J2QdDbelmY" target="_blank">Seven Nation Army</a> by the White Stripes. This song has as easy of a drum beat as it gets because as the story goes, the woman on drums is not a very skilled drummer.</p>
<p>When the song starts she's playing &quot;4 on the floor.&quot; She hits the bass drum (right foot), high hat(left foot) and a tom(right hand) all at the same time on every single beat. At 0:30 she changes it to a stand drum rhythm. She hits the bass on 1, the snare on 2, bass on 3, and snare on 4. If you watch the high hats she's still stepping on that pedal every single beat, but she's alternating base and snare. This is the standard beat of most Pop, rock, jazz, blues, and so many other genres of music. Base on 1, snare on 2. Clap along with the snare, not the base drum.</p></div>		</li>
