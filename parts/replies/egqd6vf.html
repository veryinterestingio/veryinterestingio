			<div class="markdown"><p>My BIL somehow survived a ruptured aorta after a motercycle crash. We were a bit shocked to discover how slim those odd really were, mortality from aortic rupture is up to 90%. 65–75% of patients die before they arrive at hospital and up to 90% die before they reach the operating room <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_rupture#Prognosis" target="_blank">[1]</a>. He had a really good medical team that recognised the symptoms, and that night he had a stent inserted to stop the bleeding.</p>
<p>Edit: Wow this comment got a lot of upvotes! Here's <a href="https://imgur.com/a/vhWqyUv" target="_blank">the stent</a> that saved his life, I forget where the tear was, but I think it was somewhere on the right coronary given the title of the screenshot / cellphone pic. It was made of fine mesh gold, so we now tell him that he has a &quot;heart of gold&quot;. Well, arteries of gold at the least.</p>
<p>Shout out to the medical team at <a href="https://www.lifehealthcare.co.za/hospitals/gauteng/benoni/life-the-glynnwood/" target="_blank">Glynwood hospital</a>!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My father survived an aortic dissection twice. The first time he was in a come for almost 2 months and it has a 90%, fatality rate. The second time it was 5cm long and he had surgery to fix it. 14 hour surgery and a coma for a month. He still has nightmares from the coma dreams. He dreamt my niece died, he went to hell and several other fucked up dreams the first time. The surgery was 2 years ago and he still won't talk about the dreams, he just says they were worse.
I still remember walking into the room with my mom when he first woke up and him yelling &quot;Lynn (my mom) where's Alex?!&quot; He thought I was my mother and that I was still a baby, I was about 16. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This will be buried but wow this is so similar to what happened to my Mom that it’s not even funny. In 2017 she’s leaving for work at 5am and takes the same route everyday (work is less than 1 mile from our house). She always makes a left hand turn at the light adjacent to our house. This morning though she was t boned  in the drivers side in her truck from a minivan that ran a red light doing around 55mph. The scene looked horrific (could literally see cop lights as soon as my front door opened at 6am) and we were told she was bleeding heavily from the liver and they were doing emergency surgery to stop the bleeding. Both vehicles were destroyed, especially the van. Anyway she nearly bled out at the scene, somehow got to the pavement and collapsed and complained of stomach pains and the EMTs saved her life bc she was in severe shock and they had to intubate her there. She needed a total of 2 1/2 blood transfusions, she had a grade iv liver laceration, spleen so bruised they considered taking it out, the artery to the right kidney was totally severed, and she looked mangled when we finally saw her, tons of huge scrapes and cuts and swelling. Couldn’t close her stomach for over 5 days due to swelling. She was in a coma/vent for over 2 weeks and ended up with a slew of other issues but no broken bones magically. She STILL will tell us if the vivid nightmares while under. Dreamed that she was abducted and taken to a warehouse and trafficked. Just horrific stuff that was in the realm of her being taken against her will and many others. When she woke up she was delirious and asking for her dead father, and she thought my dad got a job at Pizza Hut as a delivery driver bc of the name tag in ICU etc. Anyway, months later we speak one of the the surgeons on the team that saved her life and he was just astounded, listed off pages of her injuries and explain when he sees injustices this extensive, it is on an autopsy report. She shouldn’t be here, shouldn’t be walking, talking etc. He explained her injuries carried a 92% mortality rate. Her liver looked like an elephant had stepped on it. Of the 8% of people that survive, half of those have pretty severe brain damage. She is 4%. Bless the Paramedics and surgeons and nurses and everyone else. Sometimes it cannot be explained.  Hopefully your father made a good recovery!! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s the first time I’ve heard of someone having a bad experience while in a coma. I thought it was all ‘light at the end of the tunnel’ kind of optimistic stuff people experience while in a coma, which kind of gave me hope for the after life. This story basically ruined that...</p>
<p>Sorry you guys had to go through that, he sounds like a lucky guy to have survived though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same with AAA(aortic aneurysm)- When I worked on the pulm floor at Mayo Clinic, if we ever saw a diagnosis of AAA come through- instant code and instant call to surgical floors to prep for immediate surgery. I only saw it 4 times- all 4 times we had them in surgery within an hour. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Important to point out that the emergency situation is when a AAA (abdominal aortic aneurysm) is <em>ruptured</em>. Many people have AAAs chronically and they are treated conservatively with followup scans to make sure it isn't growing too quickly or too big. If they are, non-emergent surgery can be performed by a vascular surgeon to fix it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We had these all the time in the hospital I worked in. Most were small and surgery was urgent but could be delayed a couple hours. One guy though had a HUGE one and they flew him to a different hospital. Everyone was like, &quot;DON'T TOUCH HIM DON'T FEED HIM DON'T BREATHE ON HIM&quot;
I don't remember exactly how big the aneurysm was but it was large enough to have a CROWD of doctors looking at his file on the computer with their jaws on the floor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Within an hour&quot; doesn't sound fast enough for something that you can bleed out from in seconds to minutes, or are you referring to the non-ruptured variant?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe a silly question, but wouldn't/couldn't someone live for a minute or more of their heart basically explodes? Until the brain runs out of oxygen, and they bleed to death?</p>
<p>Am I missing something in the declaration of &quot;instantly&quot; in this case?</p>
<p>Edit: wow, I learned a ton about how the brain works and what &quot;consciousness&quot; is with respect to bring considered alive, or the viability of life.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My cat died very suddenly from cardiomyopathy, her heart just stopped.  She was running around playing, jumped into a cardboard box and gave out a little yelp.  My husband saw it happen, I was a couple of feet away in another room.  I got to her in a matter of seconds, but when I got there and picked her up she was limp.  She was no longer conscious, there was absolutely nothing there and her heart had only been stopped for a few seconds.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a medical professional by any means, but by my understanding of it, once there's no more blood flow to the brain, it only takes seconds for you to go unconscious. I'm assuming that pretty much all the blood in your head will <em>very</em> quickly flow downwards and then it's lights out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>After I had my baby I was unknowingly hemorrhaging. I felt okay when I was laying in the hospital bed, but when I got up to go pee blood started pouring out. I was conscious long  enough to tell my mom I wasn't feeling well, but then I was on the floor unconsious. </p>
<p>My brain turned off in seconds. Luckily, a nurse was in the room, pressed the emergency button on the wall and a dozen nurses/doctors came in to save me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was night skiing once and slipped on refreeze and went off the trail. Refreeze is snow that melts at noon and freezes again once the sun sets. It goes from fluffy powder to sheer ice. I went to turn around a bend, by the ski I was putting weight on was on ice, so rather than cutting into the snow and turning, I went straight off the trail. My ski pole got stuck in a tree and whipped my arm back (brachial plexus injury) and I went further down the hill and fell back and hit my head on a stump or rock. Helmets weren’t common back then. </p>
<p>I remember the ski patrol guy who took me down on a sled was dressed up like a penguin in a top hat and wool coat and the EMT looked like Steve Austin. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Hurt like a bitch, and I didn't go with the paramedics cause I didn't want an ambulance fee and hospital bills to deal with. For the next month or two I'd get these weird chest spasms, heart fluttering, shortness of breath and lightheadedness every day. Never found out what that was about.</p>
<p>I'm lucky to have just walked away from that. Having to pay for a new signal sucked though. I had someone very close to me suffer severe brain damage when she was in a accident and was given almost no possibility of recovery so we moved her to hospice. OP's recovery sounds miraculous and hopefully we can utilize stem cell treatments in the future for more patients.</p></div>		</li>
