<p>Exactly this. Exercise does the same thing to the body as it does to the heart. Running a few laps a day will help you. Running laps for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week will probably kill you honestly. It's the same for the heart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of. Often there’s heavy doping at play as well. One cyclist (Marco Pantani) had been <del>training in low oxygen like a madman</del> doping heavily and been using growth hormones they found out after his death at only 34 (died of apparent Cocaine poisoning though there were most likely other factors at play). His blood was found to be noticeably more viscous due to the massively increased amount of red blood cells and his heart rate, when at rest, dropped so low that he had to wear a heart monitor and often had to get up in the middle of the night and hop on the cycling machine to raise his heart rate so he wouldn’t just die in his sleep. It’s crazy. His resting Heart rate apparently was around 30. </p>
<p>Edit: added some infos from others who commented below. Changed it to doping as I was told it was that, not low oxygen training. Remembered that one wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but you need to put &quot;often&quot; in quotation marks. There are studies about the long time influences of being a professional athlete. As far as I remember, the life expectancy is rather longer than shorter, but pretty much on par with the average. You are right that some heart diseases occur slightly more often but a lot occur way less often. But it's hard to control whether the increased chance for some isn't even the result of doping.</p>
<p>There is an underlying confirmation bias here. There are ten thousands of atlethes that if they were to die young by a heart attack, you would hear about it. And in a group that huge, this will happen. But an athlete celebrating his 87th birthday barely makes the news, him dying at 38 does. So we tend to thing that athletes die younger, not because they do, but because we are disproportionately exposed to those who do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not because fear and surprise causes other things like release stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. Good in certain amounts for certain reasons. Bad if used all the time for no &quot;good&quot; reason. Your idea of cardiovascular health is not a good enough reason for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weirdly it doesn't. Exercise has a bunch of other effects besides just raising your blood pressure transiently.</p>
<p>Of note, it helps reduce inflammation and keep your blood vessels healthy, which long-term will lower resting blood pressure. It also helps reduce the risk of things such as stroke, heart attack and dementia which high blood pressure increases your risk of getting, and largely does so via other effects unrelated to pressure as such.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was beginning to get higher blood pressure. After a few months of daily cardio I dropped it back to perfect levels. </p>
<p>First, I lost about 20 pounds from the extra exercise. That helps blood pressure a great deal. </p>
<p>Also, things I noticed by monitoring my heart rate is that my heart naturally just has to work less than it did before.  At rest my heart beats 10 times less per minute than before. When I run I have to push myself harder to get my heart rate into the same high cardio range.</p></div>		</li>
