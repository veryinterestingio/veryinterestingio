			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  Your average quadruped doing a &quot;dead man's float&quot;...just the default floating position, has it's nose above water because the head comes straight off the spine.  Humans floating in that position are face down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't really understand this, even drowning humans in videos are upright and just panicking preventing themselves from staying above the water line, it's not like they are upside down or stuck on their back (that would actually be best, it's easy in still water to stay above water with almost no effort on your back). Dogs walk on four legs and stay that way in water, and humans are bipedal and keep the same position as far as I can tell even if they are drowning.</p></div>		</li>
