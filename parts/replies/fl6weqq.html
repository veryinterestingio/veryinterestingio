			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's another fun one: hold your fingers straight up, now relax all the muscles in your fingers, they naturally fall into a hook. You'll notice the hook shape is easy, but straightening your fingers again is when you feel the muscles at work.</p>
<p>Now look up what a gibbon's hands look like. Big ol' hooks for hanging from branches.</p>
<p>Here's another one. Your fingerprints and your fingernails work together to help you grip. The texture of your fingerprints helps you hold things, even when wet (if you've ever noticed your fingers pruning up after a swim, this is part of that system, it increases grip while your hands are wet). Your fingernail is a backing board that spreads out more of your finger print. To see this in action grip a glass and look at your fingerprint through the glass and note how more of your print comes into contact with the glass as you apply pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something similar and also cool, your fingers pruning up is a part of the sensory nervous system. So basically is someone is unable to give a sensory exam because they are in a coma or intubated you can test it this way</p></div>		</li>

<p>This isn't true apparently.  I was looking into it a few months ago.   There is no increase in grip or friction after a study done in 2014 failed to reproduce the results from previous studies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, I never realised the nail did that. Thinking about it, it makes sense, but I always kind of assumed fingernails were just a trait we hadn't evolved away yet, like the appendix but slightly more useful for opening cans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also helps us throw. Chimpanzee hands are just slightly different, and they can't throw for shit. They like to throw, but they cant do it as accurately as humans. With just a bit of practice we can hit small targets very often.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Off the top of my head I feel like that's an arm thing more than hand. Like I feel like people's accuracy wouldn't be impacted <em>that</em> much by slinging objects out of a cup instead of gripping it in our hands. I found an <a href="https://tragicocomedia.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/humans-vs-chimps-throwing.jpg" target="_blank">infographic</a> on this that looks pretty neat!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got it from a science video about our fingers. Our ability to grip things securely gives us accuracy. Any knife thrower, which I am, could tell you that it's mostly in the wrist. If you put too much arm into the throw it goes wide. When throwing a baseball your arm gives the power, but it's you hand and fingers that are doing the aiming.</p></div>		</li>
