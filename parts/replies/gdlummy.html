			<div class="markdown"><p>You certainly won’t be able to lose weight without breathing. Your poop only contains waste product from the food you eat. In order to lose weight you have to burn fat (or muscle as a last result) which produces co2 as a byproduct and is expelled in your respiration. You can only lose weight through perspiration (water weight) or respiration (carbon weight).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Moreover, consider like, the &quot;mother of all pisses&quot; where you empty yourself of a liter of fluid. That's a kilogram (2.2 pounds). I can't see anyone drying themselves more than this at once</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>technically that would make you lose weight if done regularly, not because you're exhaling more, but because breathing more forces your lungs and heart to work harder to process air faster, using more energy, forcing your metabolism to speed up for the duration of the exercise. its the same reason any cardio helps you lose weight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Breathing rapidly would be hyperventilating. So while it would cause you to expel more of the CO2 in your blood, it wouldn’t cause you to burn more calories/fat in order to produce said CO2, unless you were performing aerobic exercise at the time. </p>
<p>This would result in hypocarbia, a lack of CO2 in the blood, which results in increased blood pH and funky things like tingling fingers and face numbness.</p></div>		</li>
