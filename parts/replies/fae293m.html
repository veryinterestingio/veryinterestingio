			<div class="markdown"><p>Ductility is more of a measure of how much a material can be deformed without fracturing or failing. Softness vs hardness is more about the materials resistance to deformation in a loose sense. They can correlate to each other (soft materials are often more ductile) but they are very different characteristics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I recall, being ductile is the ability for it to be stretched without breaking. Being soft just means you can cut it easily.</p>
<p>More often than not, ductile materials are soft.</p></div>		</li>
