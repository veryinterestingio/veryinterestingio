			<div class="markdown"><p>Sonata more commonly refers to the melodic development of a movement, not the instrumentation.  Usually it has an introduction, first melody, development, second melody, development, some kind of dramatic recapitulation of the two, and a coda.  Compare it to, say, a fugue with a single melody that is developed, or a theme and variations which is doesn't develop the melody so much as recast it various ways, or a rondo which repeats the theme between developments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>“Sonata” is used in two different ways. By itself, it generally means a work for solo instrument with or without piano accompaniment. What you're describing is “sonata form” (or “sonata-allegro form”).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Opera: symphony that also adds characters telling a story. All the dialogue is sung. </p>
<p>Ballet: symphony that adds choreographed dancing but no singing. </p>
<p>New to the 20th century:</p>
<p>Musical: stage play that includes structured songs and choreography in key scenes. Also includes actors simply saying lines with no music. </p>
<p>Operetta: a musical with no spoken dialogue.  (I.e. all lines are part of a song)</p>
<p>The distinction between an operetta and an opera mostly comes down to how the songs are written. Long story short, if the songs are &quot;classical&quot; it's an opera; if they are &quot;jazz&quot; it's an operetta. </p>
<p>Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat is an operetta. The music as a whole plays more like tracks on progressive concept album than a symphony, and there is zero spoken dialogue. Everything is sung. </p>
<p>An often missed distinction:</p>
<p>Symphony: a piece of music</p>
<p>Orchestra: the group of musicians who play the music.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A symphony is something more specific than this. Classically, a symphony is a long-format work in four movements for full orchestra. Most typically, the first movement is moderate or fast, the second is slow, the third is a scherzo, and the finale is fast. These aren't strict rules; the tempos and characters of each movement may vary, and as time went by it became more common to see “extra” movements, unusual structures, or even vocalists.</p>
<p>Although the symphony isn't a strict form (at least in later periods), a given piece either is or is not called a symphony by the composer. For instance, Rimsky-Korsakov's <em>Scheherazade</em> is basically in the form of a symphony, but it's not a symphony because Rimsky-Korsakov didn't call it one.</p>
<p>Operas and ballets are not symphonies. It is rare for a symphony to have vocalists (though there are famous exceptions, such as Beethoven's 9th and several of Mahler's) and I have never heard of a symphony incorporating dance or other non-musical elements. If there is such a symphony, it's surely an atypical work from the modern era.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First of all my definitions are the <em>contemporary</em> definitions.  There were classical operettas that were generally simply shorter and simpler than full Operas.</p>
<p>It's a distinction that is kinda hard to break down eli5.  It helps to listen to it.  The music of the two sound completely different both in music and how the singers sing.</p>
<p>Opera: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuBeBjqKSGQ" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuBeBjqKSGQ</a> This is classical music.</p>
<p>Operetta: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBd-91a_KQE" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBd-91a_KQE</a>  This is contemporary jazz, in the broadest definition of &quot;jazz&quot;.  In modern parlance we would say this is &quot;disco&quot; or &quot;pop&quot;.</p>
<p>That opera is about 240 years old, while that operetta is about 50 years old, and you can very clearly hear the differences in the music style and singing style (nevermind the costumes).  In both instances though there is zero spoken dialogue.  It's just song after song.</p>
<p>For a contemporary Opera example, here is a song that was published in the late 1990's: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oJswm9zfpg" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oJswm9zfpg</a> Even though it is technically contemporary music, it clearly isn't jazz or pop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>'Operetta' is just the diminuative form of the word 'opera'.  It usually means that it is short or light in character.</p>
<p>Johann Strauss Jr (the waltz guy) wrote a bunch of operettas.  They're mainly comic works that include a lot of his dance music.  Offenbach wrote some operettas that include his famous can-can dances.  Sometimes they refer to the musicals of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan as operettas.</p>
<p>But there isn't a strict line between opera &amp; operetta, it's mainly what the composer and/or staging theater called it.</p></div>		</li>
