			<div class="markdown"><p>I have an example for you - North Eagle Butte South Dakota</p>
<p>On the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation, there'd been a town of homesteaders along the railroad called Eagle Butte while the Tribal Agency was at Cheyenne River Agency III. Due to the building of the Oahe Dam, Cheyenne River Agency III was to be flooded, so the Army  Corps of Engineers and BIA build a new town next to Eagle Butte from the ground up.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Eagle+Butte,+SD+57625/@45.002073,-101.2358607,1981m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x532a852a38fee39b:0x4dc95bca1b5d8c76!8m2!3d44.9886537!4d-101.2224805" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/maps/place/Eagle+Butte,+SD+57625/@45.002073,-101.2358607,1981m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x532a852a38fee39b:0x4dc95bca1b5d8c76!8m2!3d44.9886537!4d-101.2224805</a></p>
<p>This shows how &quot;Eagle Butte&quot; was laid out in a grid while &quot;North Eagle Butte has more subdivisional curved streets</p>
<p>Edit - They had separate water and sewage until the water mains were connected in the late 70s (20+ years since the establishment of North Eagle Butte)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Happens quite a bit here in Australia. A developer will develop an area that's a half hour or so away from any other major hub which require their own amenities. They will zone different areas of the development accordingly for retail, industry, parkland and residential. </p>
<p>Even these don't spring to life from day one though. It takes some time for enough population growth to attract businesses to the area, particularly retail and food service but it's all planned out with the developers sometimes even building the initial retail space and either selling or leasing it (e.g. they might build a small to medium size strip mall to accommodate an independent supermarket or convenience store and cafes/ take away and news agents etc). </p>
<p>One of the better developments near me planned for warehousing and workshops etc on to of all this from day one which has help with their population growth.</p></div>		</li>
