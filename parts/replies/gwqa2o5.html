			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who keeps rats they don't do anything ritualised but they are so known to grieve too.
And although not like concretely proven or anything, it's commonly believed from observation that rats deal with it faster and better if they get to see the body, the idea being that they understand that they're dead instead of just disappearing one day, although keep in mind it is mostly anoctdotal. </p>
<p>Anoctdotally when one of our rats were getting close to the end, we got babies so the group doesn't get too low. Then when that rat passed away his healthy brother who he was very close to and did everything with, stopped eating and doing things and very quickly fell ill and died within two weeks of his brother. Following that the babies who were very outgoing before this, became quite shy and clung very close to the one remaining adult. This lasted weeks before they started opening up again. </p>
<p>They're all very happy and outgoing again now, and the other adult is still kicking and going strong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These examples indicate mourning. Which is interesting, and certainly should provoke us to think about the mental life of animals.</p>
<p>But the question is about awareness of forthcoming death while living. And that's something else entirely. As far as we know it is uniquely human, and as the top ranked answer says... there's likely no way we'll ever know if we're alone in this regard.</p>
<p>This awareness, btw, is the core motivating principle behind existential philosophy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>lol, thank you. i think everyone has heard that animals will hold ceremonies or burials so they all chime in thinking they know the answer. but that isnt the right answer to this question. like you mentioned, i do not think we have any kind of proof of them having premonitions or any kind of thoughts about their impending time of death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hippo and water buffalo have been seen mourning too.</p>
<p>What's interesting about elephants is that they will also mourn human deaths. And commemorate their death on the anniversary of it by going back to the original place to pay respects. They also cry. This stands to reason because they can live to be 80 and have extended families. Of course, we don't know if they understand death. But they seem to understand that animals they care about aren't going to be around anymore when they die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It stands to reason that they could. They cover large areas of land and travel for food and water and whatnot. This means they have an idea of seasonality and they're famous for their memory. Stick an event in a season or around other events they're already planning to do and yeah, they basically keep a calendar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>a calendar no but an internal time clock yes. every wonder why you start waking up at the same time as you do for work, but on the weekends? when your body isnt woken up by an external stimulus its going to do its second best guess which is stick to the routine it knows. so assuming you got enough sleep and you wake up at 6am for 5 days out of the week, your body is going to instinctively try waking up at 6am on the weekends too.</p>
<p>same reason animals get fiesty and excited around dinner time. cats and dogs rely on routine A LOT. if you have pets with any intelligence they will know when dinner and breakfast time is. and elephants are proven to be highly intelligent. their internal clocks are probably pretty great. I mean even without a calender there should be a lot of things going on around you that could help you hone in on </p>
<p>&quot;when&quot; it is. it snowed last year...its snowing now..we must be kind of around the same time. </p>
<p>&quot;its getting to that time of year again when the days get really really hot....must be summer time again&quot; etc.</p></div>		</li>
