			<div class="markdown"><p>So, does that mean the Nile was once a river with a straight flow into the ocean? The sediment deposited in a bank, and the bank &quot;grows&quot; inwards into the river so far as making two streams with completely different directions?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am uncertain exactly how the Nile &quot;started&quot;. Don't think knows that for certain. But yes most likely it was much more a single flow or much fewer flows early on. </p>
<p>No the sediment banks in a delta does not grow inward, instead it grows outward into the ocean. So it constantly builds up sand banks right at the edge where the river water meets the ocean water. When pressure builds up behind this bank, small breaks usually appear in it. This lets a little bit of water through one path. Over time the pressure builds up again and it might break off a little stream out another path.</p>
<p>This is a pretty beautiful example of a delta formed off an otherwise straight coastline: <a href="https://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/79000/79044/hortonriverdelta_ali_2012213_lrg.jpg" target="_blank"><a href="https://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/79000/79044/hortonriverdelta\_ali\_2012213\_lrg.jpg" target="_blank">https://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/79000/79044/hortonriverdelta\_ali\_2012213\_lrg.jpg</a></a></p>
<p>The Nile delta also has this somewhat shape, though it can be a bit harder to distinguish from just normal landmasses on a map due to its enormous size.</p>

<p>The process that forms the deltas also work inland where there might be some change in the rivers course. The Nile is known to have changed its course many times, because parts of it got filled up with sediment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a complicated issue, largely because the Mediterranean as it is now has only been in existence since about 5 million years ago (I think, might be more recent).  That is, the Med basin was not in connection with the Atlantic like it is now, so there were saline lakes in the basin instead (fed by the Nile and other rivers), and water levels were a lot lower, so the Nile had to flow further out before dumping its sediment load. </p>
<p>The delta as it is now probably only started to form the way it is after the basin connected to the Atlantic and the water level in the Mediterranean jumped up a lot (maybe the &quot;Great Flood&quot;?).  </p>
<p>Lots of discussion about how big the Nile was back then and lots of other things, so it isn't really easy to say &quot;sure, the river started straight and then&quot; (whatever explanation is offered).  Rivers don't start fully made and in this case, even the sea/ocean changed a lot (was a sea open toward the east, the Tethys Sea, that got closed by plate tectonics (Africa/Middle East smashing into Eurasia), leaving a saline basin that much later got flooded from the west).  There was drainage in the Nile basin all that time (sediments date back to at least 30 million years ago, maybe earlier), but it probably did not originally start anywhere near as far south as it does today, or end where it ends today, either.  Most of the delta where it is now dates from the filling of the Mediterranean Sea in that (supposed) catastrophic flood event.</p>
<p>I hope that helps you understand the situation a little better.  There isn't a true &quot;good&quot; answer.  things don't stay the same long enough for there to be a simple answer.  It is complicated.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In theory, but it would have been so far back in prehistory that it's not something we could ever hope to prove.</p></div>		</li>
