			<div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly the P or B or other plosive sounds, not necessarily the sound of breathing. Those sounds force air into the microphone so your recording gets taken over by this popping sound rather than actually focusing on the sound you intend to record.  </p>
<p>You would probably hear those sounds in every day life too if we lived in a world where everyone spoke directly into your ear. That's pretty much how we use microphones, talking right into it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw an awesome documentary called &quot;I Know That Voice,&quot; about the voice acting profession.  In in, John DiMaggio mentions holding a pen or pencil up in front of your mouth to help split up that puff of air, too.  No idea why that's the one fact I remember from that movie, but there it is.</p></div>		</li>
