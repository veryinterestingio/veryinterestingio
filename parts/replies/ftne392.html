			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned about boundary layer when I flew in the Air Force. We would lick and stick gummy bears to the windscreen of our plane on the outside and keep an eye on them. Whoever’s bear stayed on the longest didn’t have to buy drinks that night. They would frequently stay on for hours despite flying Mach 0.8.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun little eli5 tidbit for the others out there. Mach 0.8 means 0.8 times the speed of sound AT THAT ALTITUDE. So as you go higher in altitude, at the same ground speed (speed you're travelling over the ground), your mach number actually increases!</p>
<p>This is due to a russian nesting doll of a few effects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Speed of sound in air decrease as air <del>density</del> <strong><em>temperature</em></strong> decrease</li>
<li>Air <del>density</del> <strong><em>temperature generally</em></strong> decrease as altitude increase</li>
</ol>
<p>Hence, if you're going 1000km/h(621mph) at ground level you're at Mach 0.82 as the speed of sound is 1225kmph(761.1mph)</p>
<p>But at an altitude of 30000ft (9144m) with the same ground speed of 1000km/h you'll be going at Mach 0.92!</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks u/AirborneRodent, u/RelevantMetaUsername and u/Coomb for correcting me on the density vs temperature thing, I might have misremembered, guess its TIL(again) too hahaha :P and thanks u/plopperdinger for the units correction ;)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Knots,</p>
<p>Ground speed (duh)</p>
<p>True airspeed (since the air is moving relative to the ground)</p>
<p>Indicated airspeed (since density changes at different altitudes, indicated airspeed normalizes for that  and gives essentially a virtual airspeed, as air gets less dense the indicated airspeed becomes lower than true airspeed)</p>
<p>Calibrated airspeed (which accounts for calibrating your equipment relative to indicated airspeed but serves a similar purpose)</p>
<p>Equivalent airspeed (which is calibrated airspeed with some compressivility factor applied, idk, I usually just work in true and indicated)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nitpick: the effects of lower air density on the speed of sound are exactly canceled out by the effects of the corresponding lower air pressure. The only variable that actually ends up affecting the speed of sound in atmosphere is <em>temperature</em>.</p>
<p>Because of this, as you fly higher and higher your Mach number will actually start to go down again for a bit as you pass the stratosphere, which is warmer than the layers below and above it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, actually, my sister did a science fair project on this way back in grade school. She modified the blades of several fans in all different ways to try to limit dust buildup. If I remember right, the most effective modification was using a drill to make shallow dimples all over the top of the blade, sorta like a golf ball. (Which is why golf balls are dimpled—they used to be smooth in the early days of the sport, until golfers realized the older, more beat up balls flew further and straighter than new ones).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In case anyone hasn’t heard the golf ball explanation in some detail. They fly further/straighter due to the dimples forcing the air to create a more turbulent boundary area around the ball rather than a laminar flow. It decreases the area of the wake and drag forces on the ball as it travels through the air.</p></div>		</li>
