			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. </p>
<p>The MEUs (Marine Expeditionary Units) have a lot of hitting power with F35s and Cobras and all the troops deploying by UH1's and LAVs/AMTRACKs; but it takes them a while to sail to where the target is. </p>
<p>The 82nd is tasked with a Brigade air deployable to anywhere in the world in 24-48 hours. The SF have (in addition to other duties) teams forward located to Italy etc. as the emergency response units for the various geographic commanders, e.g. CENTCOM and AFRICOM.</p></div>		</li>
