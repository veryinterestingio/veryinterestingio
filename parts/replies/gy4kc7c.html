<p>In other words, a proto-planet needs to build up a pretty substantial mass of just solids before it can grow even faster using gas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quick question, are we pretty much 100% these days that the gas giants grew from solid cores? I'm not really up to date on the research. When I was younger it was suspected but not certain if I recall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We think the majority of giant planets in solar systems form through core accretion: start with a solid core of rock and ice, then add gas. This is somewhat verified by the Juno spacecraft around Jupiter, which did constrain the overdensity at the planet's core.</p>
<p>That said, gas instability is also a viable mechanism, where just through self-gravity the gas cloud collapses into a giant planet. We have seen this especially in nearby star-forming regions, where we can spot newly-formed, lonely giant planets floating in the nebula, formed essentially like mini-suns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would those that form through gas instability still end up with  some form of solid/liquid core created by the pressures and temperatures involved? Or are we thinking it's more like a hydrogen/helium plasma as in stars?</p></div>		</li>

<p>As far as I am aware we have no concrete evidence of the gravitational instability mechanism forming a planet. The observations of spiral density waves due to the protoplanet do not tell us if there is a core already formed or not.</p>
<p>The mechanisms of planet growth from disc instabilities is restricted to the most massive planets at the farthest edges of the protoplanetary disc (where core formation pathways are too slow). There is indirect evidence that this has occurred in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HR_8799" target="_blank">HR 8799</a> which is a four planet system around a young star.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is far more likely to happen if you can build your planetary core out of both rock and ice beyond the frost line rather than just rock inside the frost line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am glad you said more likely! In-situ formation of hot jupiters has not been ruled out. A couple of interesting cases are <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01512" target="_blank">TAP 26</a> where we observe a hot Jupter around a T-Tauri star (one with a disc) and <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/nature18305" target="_blank">V830 Tau</a> which is another hot Jupiter around a 2 Myr old T Tauri star. For anyone that is interested further <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-astro-081817-051853" target="_blank">Beccy Dawson has a great review</a> of hot Jupiter origins. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also note that subsequent migration can then alter planetary positions later. We see a lot of exoplanet systems where Jupiter-sized planets spiraled inwards after formation to end up with an orbit closer than Mercury is to the Sun; we think our own Solar System was spared from this fate only thanks to a resonance between Jupiter and Saturn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To expand a touch on this. Migration can also occur before the disc dissipates through the disc migration mechanism (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_migration#:~:text=Type%20II%20migration,-A%20planet%20massive&amp;text=When%20the%20mass%20of%20a,gas%20from%20around%20the%20orbit." target="_blank">type 2 migration</a>). Also, although we observe a lot of hot Jupiter systems it is expected &lt;1% of systems contain a hot Jupiter. Although there are questions as to if this is as a result of them not being common or as a result of how many are removed from the system (eaten by their star).</p></div>		</li>
