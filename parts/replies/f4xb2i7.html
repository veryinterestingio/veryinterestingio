			<div class="markdown"><p>This is just an ELI5 explanation of how SSRIs work. We still have very little understanding of the mechanism of depression. We know that NSAIDs reduce inflammation, and we know that they are also effective for treating pain from osteoporosis. That doesn't mean that we can conclude that osteoporosis is caused by increased inflammation. Inflammation is just a symptom of osteoporosis, and by targeting that symptom we can make the patient feel better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If a five year old asked me “Why do I feel empty when I’m sad?”, that is what I’d say in response. It’s a good way of getting somebody to visualise that when you’re depressed, something chemical is happening inside your brain and it explains in a very visual way why you feel empty and unable to fight it. That is my interpretation of the question. I use a similar story to describe problems associated with ecstasy use to my friends who hit it a little too hard from time to time, and it works wonderfully to help people I know understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with it is that the description simply isn't true. its an nice story, but thats about it. we don't know what role serotonin plays. we only know that it plays an role.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think people come to ELI5 for a basic explanation of the known science for a given topic, they genuinely want to know the mechanism. Not really a literal &quot;How would you explain this to a 5 year old&quot; sort of thing. If that were the case every answer would involve candy and dogs and the sub would be completely ignored. </p>
<p>In this case there really isn't any satisfying scientific answer, we basically have no clue how this works, so I get your response. But I also agree that it explains nothing useful to answer the question, its like telling a child that babies are born when two people love each other very much.</p></div>		</li>
