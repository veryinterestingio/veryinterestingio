			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a type of rice where the bran is dark (aka &quot;black&quot;) so it's a special type of brown rice. It's a more rare variety of rice and often used for special occasion dishes:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_rice" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black\_rice" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black\_rice</a></a> </p>
<p>There are multiple strains of rice and some of them have bran that is a different color than brown. Besides black rice, there are varieties of rice that are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_rice" target="_blank">red</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oryza_glaberrima" target="_blank">gold</a>. Check out the varieties section in the red rice link to see specific regional varieties of red rice.</p>
<p>In all cases, it's the bran layer that really has the color.</p>
<p>Mexican rice is usually flavored (cooked in chicken stock or tomato sauce and spices added) and this restaurant may have decided to use Asian black rice as a dramatic flair to their rice dish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting read!  On the Wikipedia article it mentions that African rice was independently domesticated from China, so rice has been domesticated twice.  I've never had African rice before (That I am aware of). I want to try it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another detail: “wild rice” isn’t rice, at least not in the typical sense. It isn’t a “variety of Asian rice” but a different plant entirely. It seems like it would be a brother or sister to Asian rice, but it is only a distant cousin.</p></div>		</li>
