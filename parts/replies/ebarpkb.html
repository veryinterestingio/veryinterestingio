			<div class="markdown"><p>Many of the brain's core functions--balance, peripheral vision, proprioperception, heat regulation, &amp;c--are only fully engaged during physical activity. Just walking down a flight of stairs requires a lot of mental processing.  </p>
<p>When you're sedentary, big elements of your brain's capacity are idling, even if you're consciously engaged in reading / writing / watching the screen.  </p>
<p>It's pure conjecture to say this has any bearing on mood. But it's interesting to think about. It could also be why low-intensity exertion, like yoga &amp; walking, seems to yield similar mental benefits as higher intensity sports like running and cycling.  </p>
<p>EDIT: <em>proprioperception</em>, obvs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you make an interesting point. Of course getting active isn't a cure all for people suffering from depression but I do wonder if someone &quot;didn't have time&quot; to get caught in the cycle of depression by being stimulated in a variety of ways if it would be as prominent a problem.</p>
<p>So many people (myself included) get caught in this cycle of going to work all day, coming home and trying to feel like yourself for 2 or 3 hours before you crash, just to wake up and go back to work. By the time you hit the weekend (if you're lucky enough to get those) you might feel like you &quot;deserve&quot; a weekend off from the hustle and bustle and you just become a hermit.</p>
<p>Many people are devoid of sunlight as well. Spending all your time under and looking at artificial light and not being active is unhealthy in so many ways, not least of all, mentally. I am aware that people are encouraged to be more open and involved in the mental health discussion and that we see more numbers for this reason.</p>
<p>edit: I mean we see the numbers rising because we talk about it now, and that being a farmer or something, working the land does not exempt you from mental health issues. We are more aware now and without data it's hard to know the difference electric light and office jobs made</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What was their measure of physical activity? What did they consider to be 'vigorous' exercise?</p>
<p>I'm very curious as this matters a lot.  If they considered 20 minutes of a brisk walk or lifting weights 3 times a week, to be 'physically active' then that would be fairly easy to achieve.  On the other hand, if they only considered fairly high-intensity cardio (e.g. running) to be 'vigorous exercise' then that changes things.</p>
<p>It doesn't say in the abstract and this is a topic I've been quite interested in, especially as it relates to mental health and well-being.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since it is a meta-analysis the criterions might be quite variable from one study to another. Basically, they included people with enough physical activity to no be considered physically inactive (so at least walking a bit everyday is probably included) but this also potentially include any people with high physical activity. The common criterion is that they all participate to 'sedentary activities' (computer work for ex) and they did a correlation with that. So you could perfectly obtain someone being 'depressed' doing office work all the week and gym four times a week (which more than the norm i believe...) and someone being 'depressed' doing office work for the same time but no gym. Both in the same group.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So the correlation is sedentary activities with depression, and not physical exercise. There is nothing to conclude that physical exercises does actually anything to depression, at least in this analysis. It could be due to multiple factors (isolation from other social activities for ex)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if there is a measure for the mental challenge of an exercise rather than only a physical one? As in, running fast is more exertion on the body, whereas running on a trail would add more mental stimulation as well as physical. Is there a difference between completing a complex physical exercise (climbing a wall route, or doing a dance routine) and completing a simple one (completing 30 minutes on an elliptical machine).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A unit to describe exercise is the MET (metabolic equivalent task) where an activity to is compared in energy expenditure against 1 MET, defined as the energy required to sit awake in a semireclined state doing nothing. Low intensity exercise is 1-3 METs, Moderate exercise is defined as 3-6 METs, and Vigourous exercise is anything over 6 METs. So typically a quick jog would be around 6 METs and be considered vigourous. Many athletes max out above 15 METs during maximal exercise. Also as a unit of energy, there is a ratio of joules to Mets, but is somewhat dependant on that individuals metabolism at rest</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is the proper interpretation, &quot;studies are 95% confident that you are 16% to 35% more likely to be depressed if you are sedentary&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, basically. </p>
<p>For another example, if they had used a Confidence Interval of 99% for this same data the range would be a bit wider. So then they could say something like &quot;There's a 95% chance that the real number is between 1.16 and 1.35. There's a 99% chance that the real number is between 1.06 and 1.45.&quot; Of course the second set of numbers here is made up, but you get the point. </p></div>		</li>
