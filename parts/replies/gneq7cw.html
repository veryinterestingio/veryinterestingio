<p>The thing about nature is that it's a &quot;close enough is good enough game&quot;</p>
<p>A new viral variant only occurs when a mutation leads to a workable, stable, and observably different behavior.</p></div>		</li>

They just keep it moving whatever happens and so a lot of mutations die off bc they dont work but there are also some that do work and they can reproduce on and on.</p></div>		</li>
