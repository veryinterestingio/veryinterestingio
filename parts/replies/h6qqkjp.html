			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but less so. Weed doesn’t cause dry mouth as severely or for as long as meth does. Weed also isn’t generally associated with a reduced capacity for keeping up with self-care and hygiene routines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably the opposite. Whenever I'm high I'm like hyper aware of my hygiene. My teeth start feeling dirty and suddenly I need to floss and brush then. I notice my posture is sloppy so I start to stretch and sit and breath right.  I can feel my nails growing in real time so I start cutting them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never been a fan of uppers but I dabbled with Adderall when I was in college. There's some innate urge to forgoe any and all self care when you're on strong stimulants. </p>
<p>Take TWO MINUTES to brush your teeth? Absolutely fucking not. Spend 6 hours reading a Wikipedia rabbit hole on the different genus of big cats? Hell yeah. </p>
<p>True story too. Literally spent all night reading about the different species of lions, tigers, panthers etc and how they were related. </p>
<p>I couldn't imagine what it'd be like on meth, I'd tweak out on 20mg of Adderall and start twitching and shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just FYI for anyone who takes adderall, it also causes these symptoms nearly identical to methamphetamine. After being prescribed adderall for a few years and not caring for my teeth properly, my dentist pulled me aside and asked if I was doing meth. Luckily, it’s fixable if you catch it early enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the reasons meth causes tooth decay is teeth grinding, which is very common with amphetamines of all kinds, including those used in the treatment of ADHD. It might be worth investing in a night guard to protect your chompers, in addition to general oral hygiene, drinking plenty of water, and avoiding fluids with high acid content or soda.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're getting dry-mouth you should try get some mouthwash that stimulates saliva production. The stuff I use is from a brand called Biotene, but I am not sure if it's available where you live.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, meant to reply to you but misclicked. I use Biotene rinse and Therabreath mints. There are others. Water alone will not fix the saliva problems. If you have teeth grinding, you may want to ask about a mouth guard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda sounds like dryness from the alcohol in the mouthwash, or you’re allergic/irritated from it. You shouldn’t be using mouthwash daily — it kills off the good flora in your mouth and studies seem to indicate that’s bad for your cardiovascular health. Brushing and flossing is enough!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Listerine Total Care Zero Alcohol is the one i use.</p>
<p>hmm, maybe you're right. my mouth would feel dry during my meetings. I would always avoid using mouthwash before any meetings/expected long conversations when i know i have one coming up in a few hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Make sure you are using the correct mouthwash. Stuff like Listerine do not help your dental hygiene, it just makes your mouth smell good.</p>
<p>When picking a mouthwash, look for a mouthwash that contains a 0.2% NaF (Sodium Flouride) concentration. The flouride helps protect your teeth after you wash out the toothpaste. It also gets easier into the smaller nooks and crannies between your teeth.</p>
<p>Use it after youve brushed and flossed your teeth, around 10ml and rinse for 30 seconds. Morning and evening is best. Besides helping protect your teeth, they also give you that minty fresh breath.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's 0.02%... and NaF is the only active ingredient in Listerine.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>It makes no difference whether you do it before or after brushing/flossing. There are various pros and cons to both and overall there is no evidence that one approach outweighs the other.</p></div>		</li>
