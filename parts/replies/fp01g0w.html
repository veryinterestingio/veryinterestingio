			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a nitroglycerin ointment they can get you. It gives you a really bad headache but I only had to use it for a few weeks for mine to start to heal to the point the pain was almost gone. Unfortunately mine lasted for a year because it took me a long time to seek treatment.</p></div>		</li>
