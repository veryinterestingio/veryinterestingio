The &quot;spot prices&quot; of electricity (called real-time prices in the market) far exceed worrying about the spot prices of NG - you just can't get it.  Rest of what you said is pretty much spot on.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The Texans came up with a word for that back in the 90s: it's called doing an Enron around regulations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first thing you need to identify is who is the intended recipient of the benefit? Get this right and it is obvious.</p>
<p>A phrase used a lot in the UK around similar issues is socialised risk and privatised reward. i.e. The government bails out any failing companies if times are hard, but those same companies take their profits when times are good. c/f the 2008 crisis in world banking - the UK has had 10 years of &quot;austerity&quot; (basically cutting public services, freezing state benefits and reducing help to disabled people) in order to ensure that no bank collapsed. It is socialism, but for corporate entities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a pretty big difference in how a government is supposed to be run vs a private business. A private business can (and should) optimize for the common \~80-90% of the scenarios they encounter, then figure out the exceptions. But a government needs to prepare for those &gt;5% events that can kill people.</p>
<p>So a coastal town should have building code regulations for the storm that hits every 20-50 years. Not just the &quot;normal&quot; years. This is why places with higher density housing will have stricter electrical codes for houses, for example. But the point should work across all public impact issues.</p>
<p>A power grid system should be able to deal with events like this. The GOP excuses are pathetic.</p>
<p>This was also predictable. (example: flooding in Houston a few years ago - they let people build in a defined flood plane)</p>
<p>It also needs to be said that extreme cold events DO happen in Texas, so the line that this is a &quot;1000 year event) is bullshit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Privatisation is fine as long as corners aren't cut. In this case regulators opened the doors to not winterizing to save the power companies money. Sure the power companies are to blame for cheaping out but if the regulators hadn't allowed them to this wouldn't have happened.</p>
<p>I am not saying privatisation is good, but regulation failures don't kill the idea automatically.</p>
<p>Heck a government ran power grid could have similar problems if it cut costs by avoiding winterizing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the fate of most commercial enterprises. </p>
<p>The drive to cut pennies will eventually cost limbs, but someone got a bonus in the meantime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But...privatization demonstrably leads to corner-cutting. They are privatized explicitly to avoid interstate and federal regulation, by their own account. </p>
<p>A government power grid has regulations which prevent this type of shortsighted (AND DEADLY) cost cutting, which is why it didn’t happen to any of them. </p>
<p>Aren’t you arguing for a solution to the problem that is just the problem itself</p></div>		</li>
