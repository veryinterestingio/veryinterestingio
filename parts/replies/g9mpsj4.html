			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, but only touches on one aspect. There are other aspects of planned obsolescence such as limiting repairability (eg. making stuff inaccessible, non standard parts, limiting replacement parts etc.). Things like stopping software updates (eg stopping security updates or OS updates on phones after a short period). Dropping support for older tech or products. Changing things like standards/adapters/formats etc. </p>
<p>Sure, all of the above can have legitimate reasons for happening, but also can be used to force obsolescence. It doesn't have to be explicitly done at design or manufacturing time, the decision can be made afterwards in a lot of cases, especially in the case of technology products. </p>
<p>I don't think planned obsolescence is as nefarious as people think it is, but it's a well established businesss strategy for decades now for companies to try and get consumers to update their products before they become unusable or fail (by whatever means they think they can get away with).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you think those examples could be more accurately described as Forced Obsolescence, as opposed to Planned Obsolescence?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For water resistance it is a lot easier to glue two pieces together to create a highly water resistant seal than it is to engineer the right screw holes and a rubber seal to achieve the same level of resistance because the glue fills in the cracks without tension in specific places that screws make. Easier = cheaper to manufacture. </p>
<p>If the majority of customers will just upgrade in a year or two then going the cheaper route makes complete logical sense with a bonus of an incidental hurdle for those that are in the minority and want longevity as a feature. I really don't think it is malicious as much as a nice side effect for manufacturers that are already going for the cheapest method of making phones.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is much too broad to be worth saying. It will depend on manufacturer, the metals used in the exhaust, any coatings they use, etc.</p>
<p>Yeah, the bargain basement exhaust you get to replace the one on your 2001 Honda Civic might not last very long compared to OEM. At the other end, a $6000 Titanium exhaust you buy for a 911 Turbo will outlast the car. There are many options in the middle.</p></div>		</li>
