			<div class="markdown"><p>There's some ass physics Happening Here, the fatty part of the ass gets sucked into the hole creating even more of a tight squeeze for the surface area of the wood to make optimal contact.  The wood being a big flat surface also allows for maximum ass hittage, over a hand that is very bendy and curvy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While you're losing contact area, you're also increasing speed because of decreased air resistance. Since kinetic energy goes up with speed squared, at some point going *alot* faster means more than a *little bit* of contact area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not about the even transfer of power per se, it's the fact that when the ball hits your fingers before your palm your arms lose energy, momentum, and acceleration. Additionally, all of that that was lost is transferred into an inaccurate direction, so while 100% of the force is potentially there, only 80% of it is on target, while 20% is in an effectively random direction.</p>
<p>As for the slap, more surface area reduces pain, since the pressure will be lower. It's probably that the water on the surface of your skin is incompressible and slippery, so it is like a hard coating over your hand. At least it is until the water soaks in and softens your skin.</p></div>		</li>
