<p>water evaporates it pulls even more heat out of the fire source.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you for saying this. People don't realize that phase change requires a MASSIVE amount of energy. That's why the fastest way to cool something like beverage cans is to put them in a cooler full of water and ice with salt. The salt water melts the ice and pulls even more energy out of the cans.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT: This is is view as controversial here, I'd like to address the main comments:</p>
<p>I'd also like to shout to u/Introsium whose comment is here and explains in great detail what's happening at the barrier of water and ice: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/gnaxct/eli5_how_exactly_does_water_put_out_a_fire_is_it/fr8ymo8?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/gnaxct/eli5\_how\_exactly\_does\_water\_put\_out\_a\_fire\_is\_it/fr8ymo8?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/gnaxct/eli5\_how\_exactly\_does\_water\_put\_out\_a\_fire\_is\_it/fr8ymo8?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x</a></a></p>
<p>1)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, it's because the water better surrounds the cans leading to better heat transfer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, it's actually that the salt lowers the melting point of water so the temperature change is greater</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will say this, these two statements are in fact true. Both 1 and 2 contribute to heat transfer but they are NOT as significant as the ice melting. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You can verify this with a simple experiment. </p>
<p>Take 4 coolers - ALL AT THE SAME INITIAL TEMPERATURE (This absolutely can be done, if you don't do this, it's because you are cheating)</p>
<p>A) has just cold water</p>
<p>B) has water and ice</p>
<p>C) has water and  salt. </p>
<p>D) has water and ice and salt. </p>
<p><strong>The only rules</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) Once you add the cans, you cannot add more water or ice</strong></p>
<p>2) You must have the same mass of H2O in all coolers (i.e. account for ice)</p>
<p>3) You must have the same concentration of salt in both brines </p>
<p>Now because of the freezing point of water, you need to do this in pairs (because the freezing points will be off)</p>
<p>If statement <strong>(1) -</strong> That it's just a surface area thing, is true then cans cooled by <strong>A &amp; B</strong> would cool at exactly the same rate to the same temperature. </p>
<p>This is NOT what you observe. In cooler A the cans will be warmer pretty well always because without ice the coolers temperature will rise.</p>
<p>If statement (2) - That the lower melting point creates a greater temperature difference is true then cans cooled by <strong>C &amp; D</strong> would cool at the same rate and same temperature.</p>
<p>This is NOT what you observe. In cooler C the cans will be warmer pretty well always because without ice the coolers temperature will rise.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>The phase change of the ice IS THE REASON</strong> that the temperature gradient can be maintained. While the ice melts, the water cannot increase in temperature. This means that as long as there is ice, the cans' energy is being pulled.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not some magical property of &quot;Freon&quot;.  It's about the pressure and phase temperature.  Just about anything can be a refrigerant if it's liquid/gas phase change takes place at reasonable temperatures and pressures.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oxygen is very fond of hydrogen, so H2O's friendly little menage-a-trois is usually stable.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>Get some hot magnesium hanging around, and oxygen goes all &quot;OMG too sexy for my bonds&quot;. Magnesium steals away the oxygen, making heat, and the still-hot hydrogen, rejected, just hooks up with next oxygen is comes across, releasing yet more heat.</p>
<p>Which is why you mostly shouldn't use water on a magnesium fire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone was wrong in one of the replies to this, but they’ve since deleted their comment.  I’m just gonna post my response here so maybe someone else can get some knowledge:</p>
<p>Hey!  Time to sharpen up on chemistry!</p>
<p>Normally, at the contact point between water and ice at the freezing point, some ice is melting and some water is freezing.  This is easily testable: when you add a bunch of ice to a water bath, sometimes ice pieces will freeze together, which wouldn’t ever be observed if <em>only</em> ice were melting, without water at the interface also freezing.</p>
<p>As this happens, the heat released in the endothermic process of melting and the heat absorbed in the exothermic process of freezing essentially hit an equilibrium, and largely cancel each other out.  If the ambient temperature is lower than the freezing point, slightly more water freezes, and if it’s higher, slightly more ice melts, but as a whole, they <em>largely</em> cancel.</p>
<p>This is important because the amount of energy absorbed or released during phase change is <em>much, much greater</em> than the amount of energy required to otherwise heat or cool a substance.</p>
<p>Adding salt depresses the freezing point of the water it’s dissolved in.  Because of the depressed freezing point, liquid brine at the ice-brine interface cannot re-freeze, since it’s at the ice’s melting point, which is now higher than the brine’s freezing point.</p>
<p>Because the endothermic process of melting is happening but the exothermic process of freezing <em>is not</em>, the system as a whole needs to absorb a shitload of external energy for the ice to continue melting.  And I mean <em>a lot</em> of energy: the energy absorbed by melting is much, much greater than the energy required to change temperature — <em>144 times</em> as much, in fact (that is, it takes 144 BTUs to melt 1 pound of ice at its melting point, which is enough to heat 144 pounds of water by 1 degree F, or 1 pound of water by 144 degrees).</p>
<p>So, since the system now needs to absorb a fuckton of energy to melt the ice while not freezing any brine (and accordingly not releasing the typical high amount of energy from the freezing process), it readily pulls the required energy out of the nearest thermal reservoir which is, in this case, a beer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Minor point: ice taken directly from freezer is substantially colder than freezing, so when you drop it in water, it may be freezing together without melting at all. of course within a few minutes the ice would be at 32F as its heat capacity is quite low.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>You can't compare the two, since they're in different units of measurement. Melting water takes 144 more energy than changing temperature by how much, exactly?</p>
<p>You can say that melting a quantity of water (or &quot;ice&quot;, as chemists call it) takes as much energy as heating that same amount of water by 144 °F or 83 °C. Evaporation is even crazier - evaporating a quantity of water takes as much energy as heating that same amount of water by 540 °C (1000 °F). If you're trying to completely evaporate water that just melted, and it starts boiling, you're about 1/6 of the way there!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a huge part of it. Steam is MANY times larger than liquid water. There are several ways to put out fires primarily with smothering— dumping sand on them, CO2 or inert gas (especially in enclosed spaces)— but water is very easy to get to a fire and throw on the fire with a tank/bucket and hose. No need for compressed gas canisters. Then when it hits the heat, it transforms into a huge amount of oxygen-displacing gas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This! I used to do demonstrations putting out diesel fires using water. High pressure mist cools a bit, but forces a steam quickly. You can't stop for several minutes after the flame is extinguished. You gotta cool it way down. I've even had some trouble where it's cool enough to not steam as fast but hot enough to flash back to life. That cycle is hard to quell. Just stay on it longer. You start to wonder if the fuel just runs out and that's why you won.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The more modern take is the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Fire_tetrahedron.svg" target="_blank">fire tetrahedron</a>. Heat, fuel, and oxygen <em>on a base of an exothermic chain reaction</em>. You can attack any of the four and stop the fire.</p>
<p>Halons were a means of attacking the chemical reaction directly. In a fire, they disassociated and released halogens, which would proceed to suck up the hydrogen radicals liberated in the process of combustion before they could combine with oxygen (which would release heat and liberate more hydrogen radicals, to combine with oxygen and release more heat, so on until the fuel or oxygen runs out).</p>
<p>Was an interesting thing, because you needed far less halon to extinguish a fire than when using outright smothering agents like carbon dioxide. A CO2 extinguishing system, or even just a nitrogen extinguishing system, would probably kill any human in a room with it. You could survive being in a room during a halon system activation, though it wouldn't exactly be <em>healthy</em>.</p></div>		</li>
