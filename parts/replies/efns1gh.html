			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to that answer, there's this thing called Space Engine. I don't know exactly how it works, but it's something like taking objects we know about, placing them in proper places, and then calculating the ditribution of mass across the galaxy disc, with stellar masses in places that don't break neither physics nor the stability of the entire system. </p>
<p>It's mostly guesswork, but it's educated guesswork - for example, Space Engine correctly placed (well, it was 2 or 4 light years off, so close enough) a red dwarf with 7 small rocky planets before the real-life system itself was discovered to actually have those 7 planets (Trappist-1).</p>
<p>Why am I telling you about this? Because Space Engine puts some planets in nearly all star systems it calculated. While this is nowhere near confirming that these planets <em>are</em> there, it's enough to not immediatly dismiss it.</p></div>		</li>
