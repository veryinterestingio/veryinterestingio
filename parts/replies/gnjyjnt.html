			<div class="markdown"><p>Its kind of why I enjoyed team 4 stars DBZA over funimations DBZ.  I mean they had the luxury that they didn't need to do a bajillion episodes, but they took the time to make the mouth flaps match/redo the mouth flaps.   Makes the dialog so much better even if your not looking at it.  so instead of 'Oh wow...you ok Krillian...man...that must have hurt....ouch...yikes'  (made up example) you get 'man, that must have really hurt!'  (made up example, again) so it sounds liek something someone would say, instead of something someone would say to fill in the spaces of something else.</p></div>		</li>
