			<div class="markdown"><p>Bees are masters at this. They suprise many people in remote arid locations by how quickly they can find it.</p>
<p>Outdoor showers are a race to finish before bees show up. Start seeing bees around you? Probably left a water bottle open slightly. </p>
<p>Gotta do #1, walk about a minute away. Number #2, a little farther and bury it, because that's gonna attract a lot more creepy crawlies than just bees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's for both food and drink. The fast is also invalidated by sex or vomiting. Those exempt are women on periods, children, vulnerable, and the mentally unsound. People are encouraged to drink a lot of water in the early morning to not be dehydrated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water is important but muslims who are fasting should not take anything other than air though their mouths during daylight hours (food, drink, tobacco etc). It is 100% a silly thing to do in a hot place, but that's religion for you...</p>
<p>There's all sorts of conflicting guidelines from different sources on who should an shouldn't observe the fast, usually not the young, old or infirm, but some parents will make their elementary school aged kids fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fasting in Ramadan is from food, water, and also sex. Even in the summer when the days can be 20 hours long in some places. But just so we're clear fasting is done only while the sun is up, not for a whole month nonstop.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Update: I've confirmed they also know how to feel water. If they fall in the pool they stop hopping almost immediately.</p></div>		</li>
