			<div class="markdown"><p>Great read! Although I didn't really get the part where it says that we cannot voluntarily contract the orbicularis oculi (the muscles raising the cheeks and producing crow's feet around the eyes). I'm pretty sure I am able do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ha, that's so interesting. I didn't consider that facial expressions are unconsciously controlled, especially because we are required, as part of society, to keep our expressions controlled in public. However if expressions weren't unconsciously controlled and people forgot or were otherwise preoccupied you'd just get people looking like zombies, no discernible feelings on their face, dead eyes, just because they weren't paying attention to their face muscles. That would get weird fast.</p></div>		</li>
