<p>Gravity would decrease as you get closer! </p>

<p>This is true once you are inside the core, but from the top of the crust to the core-mantle boundary, you would expect the gravitational acceleration to increase (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preliminary_reference_Earth_model#/media/File:EarthGravityPREM.jpg" target="_blank">this figure</a>) because the sphere below you is denser than the spherical shell above you (i.e. because the Earth is not a homogeneous sphere).</p></div>		</li>

<p>In fact the law applies to all fields.</p>

<p>I'm sorry to be splitting hairs but the law only applies to conservative fields. If the field is not conservative, Gauss's law can't be applied.</p></div>		</li>
