			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely! Most members of the vespidae overwinter as reproductive adults, and typically use a thermal cue to tell them when to 'wake up'. So as soon as you see average daily temps of around 14C for a few days you should start seeing activity wherever they are congregating, which in this case, is your porch.</p>
<p>Technically, when you see them moving around they are likely already long out of diapause when this happens and are instead in a metabolic state of readiness called 'post-diapause quiescence' where they can quickly ramp up metabolic activity once temperatures become appropriate to do so</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So with this can u trick bees into being active early. Like haveing a space heater on them or even a hair dryer? If they do wake up early can they go back to diapause with in a day or so of coming out?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, just ask my cousin who, years ago, cut down a hornets nest and tossed into the back of his pickup planning on cleaning it out and hanging it in his living room. Couple of days later it warmed unseasonably up and had his pickup taken over by a swarm.</p></div>		</li>
