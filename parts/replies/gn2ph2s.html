			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the thing, before talking therapy, <em>there was no &quot;therapy&quot;</em>. Before the idea that a psychologist could: talk with you, get to know you, find where your issues were coming from, and help you address them, you were just &quot;that crazy whackjob from down the street&quot;. Go back further in history and you were &quot;a witch&quot; or &quot;possessed by a demon&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Therapy&quot; was doing nothing unless your mental illness led you to commit a crime or become a nuisance, then you get put in a mental asylum (again usually with no treatment just just keeping you away from society). Go back further in history and you were cast out from your family or village, or burned, or stoned to death.</p>
<p>Modern psychologists have realized that Freud wasn't so good at the &quot;find where your issues are coming from&quot; step. But he still pioneered the process of <em>even trying it.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, indeed, let's not forget that psychology is such a young field. Before that, there were hot baths to simulate fever, and spinning wheels, drawing blood, etc. to treat mental illness. Not fun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very good. Basically Freud was one of the pioneers of the &quot;bottom up&quot; approach rather than a &quot;top down&quot; approach. </p>
<p>For those that don't know a top down approach focuses first on the person and what's wrong within them. What's going wrong inside this person that this problem exists. </p>
<p>Bottom up focusses first on the problem and then how that situation could affect that person. </p>
<p>In medical terms if a person has a cough a top down approach will give them cough medicine. A bottom up approach may find through talking with the person that pollution is causing the cough and then may suggest moving to the countryside. </p>
<p>That's in crude terms anyway.</p>

<p>Some character flaws in stories could be basically overlooked mental illnesses, like a short temper, seemingly random irritations or incredibly specific reactions to otherwise harmless things, being more than such. Where someone's not just &quot;like that&quot; there's a word and a pathway for people &quot;like that&quot; to not cause harm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well they did that trepanation thing. Bore a hole in their head to &quot;cure&quot; them or even to &quot;let demons out.&quot; That dates back thousands of years.</p>
<p>There was also things like bloodletting based on the theory of bodies having &quot;four humours,&quot; and for a time you just simply tossed them in an asylum and let them rot there.</p>
<p>Talking seems like such an obvious solution but well actual <em>treatment</em> for mental health is a relatively recent medical subject, and it used to be just observe them or take in accounts from parents or whatever witnesses and make a judgment call off of that rather than going to the source.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, trepanning was to release the pressure of brain swelling after traumatic injury. The &quot;letting the demons out&quot; was a metaphorical representation of the pressure release and therefore the release of symptoms. Trepanning was a legitimate medical procedure that saved lives. They still do a variation on it today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I might add that while Freud’s specific theories of psychoanalysis are pretty bonkers, the psychoanalytic school of thought is alive and well. It stands in contrast to the “quick and proven” therapies like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in that it emphasizes long term therapy relationships and fundamental change of a person’s character and sense of self rather than addressing the behavior and thoughts themselves. In other words, it treats the source, which is a longer and harder process.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of reason to think that CBT has become popular because it’s got a big short term payoff and is therefore very easy to quantify and research, but that with that, there’s little research on long term efficacy. Therefore a psychoanalytic approach, which is harder to study on modern research grant cycles and therefore has less immediate evidence backing it, may be preferable for someone desiring a fundamental change.</p>
<p>(I may be biased since my wife is a psychoanalytic therapist, or at least is inclined that way).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was trying to find this. Psychoanalysis is still a thing, it didn't ended with Freud.</p>
<p>It must be pretty neat being married with a psychoanalytic therapist. Sounds like a really healthy relationship.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CBT treats specific isssues, it's not the same as the more overarching psychoanalysis. In fact, psychoanalysis often has the goal to find a therapy like CBT that will work for you and the things you struggle with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're diminishing Freud greatly by saying he merely started people talking about their 'problems'. The whole idea of there being a subconscious layer to the psyche starts with Freud. It's now so axiomatic that you don't realise there was a point before people were cognisant of this. Can you imagine how people thought of themselves, psychologically, before this? He's comparable to Copernicus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are factually wrong on both counts. He did not start people talking about their problems (he didn't even coin the term talking therapy) and he did not originate thw idea of layers below consciousness. He popularized a particular model that's all, a wrong one, partly because he didn't accept evolution by natural selection.</p></div>		</li>
