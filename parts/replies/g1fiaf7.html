<p>I heard sleeping in an elevated position can help as well as not sleeping on your back, but I've never tried it myself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a few things you can do. Not being overweight is a big one. Extra fat in your face and neck causes your jaw to pull back more when you're relaxed while sleeping and obstruct your airway more, which can increase snoring. Sleeping on your side or stomach helps.</p>
<p>And there are mouthguards that you can get that keep your jaw held forward while you're sleeping to keep your airway unobstructed.</p>
<p>There are other causes for snoring too, like a deviated septum which can be fixed through a simple surgery, or even nasal strips if its a mild case.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I have a deviated septum, and was going to have surgery for it about 10 or so years ago (in the UK). Went through all the consultations with GP, Otolaryngologist etc, got to the hospital on the day of the surgery and the consultant surgeon sat down and had a chat with me.  </p>
<p>He said he would go ahead with the surgery if that was what I wanted, but &quot;snoring surgery&quot; is rarely successful, and has a long and painful recovery time afterwards. Deviated septum or not, the &quot;easiest&quot; way to stop snoring is to lose weight.  </p>
<p>Just wanted to add this addendum onto your comment, as people need to understand that surgery isn't necessarily a quick fix option, even in countries with socialised healthcare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This has been bugging me for a while. I tend to fall asleep on the train home. I don't think I snore there since I wake up and no one's looking at me. I do know that in a car ride, I snore. Is it because on the train, I'm sitting upright with no head/neck support?</p>
<p>I really hope I'm not snoring on public transit lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Snoring can also be side effect of sleep apnea, though having one does not mean you have the other.  Generally they have the same causes but apnea I basically where your airway becomes obstructed and you can’t breath. Then your body startles itself away so your airway opens. This ruins your sleep cycle, and might make you want to nap more often.</p>
<p>I mention this because of you are napping on a subway, and you snore, you might not be getting a good nights sleep, and you should see a sleep doctor.</p>
<p>As a side note, for some kinds of apnea, they attach a machine to your face to blow air up your nose to keep your airway open and it fixes snoring too but only while you have it on so you can’t take that on a subway.  It’s more effective than surgery at fixing sleep issues, though to some people it’s uncomfortable wearing a mask on your face overnight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Get a bib and a chip clip, tie a string on the clip and then attach it to a small bell. Clip the chip clip on your tongue and fasten the bib around your neck. The chip clip will keep your tongue from falling back, and the sound of the bell will alert you to potentially snory head angles, and the bib will collect your drool to protect your bed garments. If all else fails, get a larger chip clips or louder bells.</p></div>		</li>
