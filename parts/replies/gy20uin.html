			<div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with osmosis; saltwater fish have a lower sodium content than the surrounding water and thus need to constantly take in water. This means taking in a lot of salt as well. In freshwater fish the kidneys regulate the concentration of salt through frequent urination. Saltwater fish can't afford to lose water so their gills are able to pass the salt. Saltwater fish also urinate but it's much more concentrated than freshwater fish.</p>
<p>Freshwater fish work in an opposite way; their bodies are much saltier than the outside water and thus the kidneys need to work to secrete more urine. If the kidneys couldn't do this the fish would blow up with water due to osmosis; this is exactly what happens during the condition of &quot;dropsy&quot;. Kidney failure leads to a buildup of fluid underneath the scales causing them to flare out known as &quot;pineconing&quot;; in the fish keeping hobby this is usually a death sentence unfortunately.</p></div>		</li>

<p>are humans fish?</p>
<p>I'm sorry if this is a dumb question. i cant remember what I learned.  i think humans came from the ocean right? water homeys into amphibihomies into mammalhamsters etcccc into apes into humans (fast forwarding a bit there in spots on the evolutionary calendar timeline) right?</p></div>		</li>
