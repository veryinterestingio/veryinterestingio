			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my &quot;fall projects&quot; is going to be trying to validate a critical thinking curriculum for medical students and graduate students that I helped develop. It seems like the education field isn't super into publishing curriculum validation, so I guess I'll see how it goes. It will be a blast to teach anyway. </p>
<p>I think one useful way to introduce critical thinking is by using some of the more fun examples that tend to be less politically charged as starting points. If you teach someone how to think about weird stuff like bigfoot, then they can apply those same critical thinking skills later in life. </p>
<p>Everything starts with separating &quot;belief&quot; from &quot;knowledge,&quot; and learning to evaluate different kinds of knowledge for where they push you on the sliding scale of belief. Is eyewitness testimony good? Is DNA evidence good? When can DNA evidence fail? I didn't even hear the work epistemology until I was 18, and think it's something that should be taught constantly and at every level of school.</p></div>		</li>

As an introduction to teaching my students the scientific method, one of the first questions I ask them at the beginning of the year is, &quot;How do you know if something is true?&quot;
I like to use an example of making a bet on a coin flip. I tell them that I am going to flip a coin. If it's heads, I will give them each $100 and if it's tails they have to give me $100 (I also tell them that this is just pretend $). I flip the coin, grab it out of the air without looking at it and say, &quot;it's tails, give me my $100!&quot; The students protest. We discuss the issues of bias and ignorance, and why it makes me an unreliable source in this situation. I ask them if it would be better if I let one student in the classroom see the coin. Or, maybe I could take a picture of the coin and post it on Instagram. We discuss other options for figuring out the truth, working our way towards the obvious best option, which is to simply show everyone the coin when it lands so they can see for themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds like a good lesson. Do you then move on to the situation where the &quot;coin&quot; is not something that can be observed by everyone, or for which special knowledge is necessary to interpret the results? The statistical results of a flawed study for example?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bless. Happy to know someone else is also doing this in pretty much the same context. Since students have way more access to information (dis- or otherwise) than when we were coming up, I also like to incorporate science communication into some lessons. In theory, starting with questions like “What kind of science communication is this?”; “Do you think it informed or even reached its intended audience?”; “Was your impression more info-dump, or like the article was leading you to a feeling?” Any experience with this?</p>
<p>I find the science communication thread more relevant, accessible and useful to current middle schoolers than it would have been for me in 6-8 ~20 years ago. It came more from making technical information more user-friendly and less snoozy than an effort to debunk fake news. But damn if the latter isn’t very convenient to try to make and exercise the point.</p>
<p>E: omitted a word.</p></div>		</li>
