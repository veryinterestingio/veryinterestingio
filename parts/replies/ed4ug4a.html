			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone with Tinnitus, the only time I don't hear ringing is when I'm listening to something like music, idle sounds such as driving a car/plane/everyday world sounds. I have a loud desk fan in my room to help mitigate this. When it's just me in my house reading or waking up in the middle of the night with no sounds, it's just a constant ringing until I turn something on to focus my ears on that. It also doesn't stay the same pitch or ring the same way, sometimes it's just different in way I don't know how to describe.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had ringing for decades, but it's a bit like breathing. When you notice, in a quite room, it's all you can hear. It's drowned out by the quietest of actual sounds. Most of the time, I don't even notice that it's there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that a revolution in ear physiology occurred in the late 1990s, and today they're regarded as active systems involving mechanical gain and a feedback loop including the brain.  Only now is this material making its way into textbooks.  Search for example <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cochlear+amplifier" target="_blank">cochlear amplifier.</a>  So, nothing like malfunctioning of a passive detector; the age-old explanation for tinnitus was far too simple.  Also some mysteries are finally explained: &quot;Spontaneous Otoacoustic Emission&quot; sOAE is when tinnitus can be heard by others, recorded with microphones, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another question is why don't we have a cure? Or at least some sort of suppressent for the sound. I understand that having other sounds toned down the volume, but is there a way I could hear nothing again? (Other than going dead obviously)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I sincerely wish someone would come up with a cure for tinnitus in my life time. I’d love to hear silence. I don’t think I even know what that sounds like. I feel like my tinnitus would explain my frequent headaches. </p></div>		</li>
