			<div class="markdown"><p>Different vaccines last different durations. You are probably talking about TDaP, which is given every 7-10 years. Other vaccines are only given once to the average person. Smallpox and chickenpox vaccines likely last more than 50 years. Even if the immunity fades after 50 years in a small percent of people, herd immunity keeps the disease out of developed countries. Glad I could clear that up for you.</p></div>		</li>
