			<div class="markdown"><p>Happens every damn day on my drive home. Four lanes of traffic come to a nearly complete stop. We inch along for about a mile doing 15 mph. All of a sudden we're all doing 65 again. No accident, no cops pulling someone over, nothing. Blows my mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simple answer if you’ve ever witnessed or been apart of an accident. You’re essentially at the front of the jam in both those scenarios. I live in ATL, so if you’re in the jam, someone wrecked, or traffic is moving or light, you just haven’t made it to the jam yet lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I drive up to Atlanta often. What I don't get is why traffic almost always builds up around those signs outside McDonough where it gives the distance to the different bypasses. It's like people have to slow down to be able to read those giant ass signs for some reason.</p>
<p>Also don't get how all 8 lanes can come to a standstill sometimes over a fender bender.  Yet there was hardly any traffic at all when I drove by an accident scene where the victim was decapitated. Just kinda odd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My personal favorite:</p>
<p>I ride a harley, and I was on my way home one night, riding behind an 18 wheeler.  I left plenty of room to break between us, knowing that if he hit the brakes, he wouldn't stop immediately, but it would take some distance, as it would take me some distance to hit my brakes and come to a complete stop.  </p>
<p>Out of nowhere, he jumped into the next lane, but I didn't have room to go as well as he barely fit into a gap in traffic (almost caused a wreck, which is why I was looking).  When I looked back to my lane, I saw why he jumped lanes.  My lane was at a complete dead stop, nothing but brake lights.  I slammed on my brakes, locked up the back tire, and pumped my rear brake while downshifting, and came to a stop, literally inches away, before hitting the car in front of me.  </p>
<p>If I had a lump of coal in my ass, I would have shit a diamond.  </p>
<p>Had he been paying attention to the stopped traffic ahead of him, and slowed to a normal stop, there wouldn't have been a problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did something similar in a car.  Guy in front of me was moving pretty fast in the right lane and so was I.<br />
We were passing a semi on the left.  He made it in front of the semi to change lanes to reveal another truck in a driveway and the cab sticking out into my lane.  I slammed on the brakes so hard that I hit the steering wheel which sounded the horn.  No damage.  But boy, was I awake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For any other new motorcyclists reading this, don't pump your back brake when emergency braking if you lock your rear and your tires are out of alignment (your rear tire is locked and sliding to the left or right of you slightly). Letting go of rear brake in that situation can cause a highside crash, where immediately your tire jumps forward and launches you over. These types of crashes can cause really bad injuries.</p>
<p>More experienced motorcyclists might be able to handle letting go of the rear brake after locking it if it's in alignment
with the front, but it's sketchy.</p></div>		</li>
