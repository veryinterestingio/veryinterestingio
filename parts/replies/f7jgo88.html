			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on if you're looking at heat index or wind chill. I don't think the former depends on it but the latter definitely does. As far as things like AccuWeather's<a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/what-is-accuweather-realfeel/7198202" target="_blank">RealFeel temperature</a>, it takes that into account along with a number of other factors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I wish more weather companies would do something like RealFeel. Humidity still affects how things feel in the winter, and wind still affects the way things feel in the summer. Then yeah, other factors like sunlight and precipitation can affect the way temperature feels as well. Probably other factors too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does when the weather is compensated in the colder direction. The Wind chill effect is caused by cold air moving at speed, and it has a huge effect on how quickly your body loses heat to the outdoors. </p>
<p>The 'feels like' temperature is adjusted for how quickly your body would dissipate heat if there were no wind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The standard NOAA model assumes a 5 knot (about 5.7 miles per hour) wind speed. Wind speed is not a variable in the heat index.</p>
<p>If you wanted you could go back to first principles and calculate a set of different heat index tables for various windspeeds, as this affects variables 3 and 4 mentioned above. Higher windspeed will increase evaporative cooling no matter how humid it is, but like every thing else, the effect changes depending on humidity. A fast breeze at 30% humidity will cool you significantly, a fast breeze at 90% humidity won't cool as much.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For example, if it's 90 degrees F outside and &quot;normal&quot; humidity then the scale should say it &quot;feels like&quot; 90 degrees F. If it's 90 degrees F out and it's 70% humidity then NOAA says it &quot;feels like&quot; 105 degrees F.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does this mean they also take into account what &quot;normal&quot; humidity is for a region? Like, if your region is almost always 70% humidity would they just call it 90F and feels like 90F? Even though someone from a drier climate it would feel like 105F to them since they are used to 40% humidity?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would guess for the purpose of not making the algorithm ridiculous, the people with the normal 70% humidity would just be used to “feels like” 105F</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I used &quot;normal&quot; humidity as a cheat to avoid explaining, because relative humidity is not directly applicable, but the final result is always stated in terms of relative humidity because the more technical jargon would confuse people.</p>
<p>In fact, the heat index model assumes a constant 1.6 kilo-pascals (kPa) of vapor pressure in the atmosphere. This is because vapor-pressure is the driving mechanism behind evaporative cooling- water only evaporates from your skin when the vapor pressure of water in your skin is higher than the vapor pressure in the atmosphere, and evaporation can just be seen as a phenomenon where high pressure vapor diffuses into a low pressure region.</p>
<p>However, vapor pressure is not the same thing as humidity. In fact, warm air is capable of holding more water vapor than cool air, and this is what relative humidity measures. At 100% relative humidity the air is saturated (completely full) of water, but 100% humidity at 90 degrees holds more water than 100% humidity at 50 degrees. The result is that a constant 1.6 kPa atmospheric vapor pressure is a lower relative humidity in warmer air and higher relative humidity in cooler air. </p>
<p>For the NOAA model that assumes a constant 1.6 kPa vapor pressure:</p>
<ul>
<li>The corresponding relative humidity at 110 degrees F is 14%</li>
<li>The corresponding relative humidity at 100 degrees F is 23%</li>
<li>The corresponding relative humidity at 90 degrees F is 33%</li>
<li>The corresponding relative humidity at 80 degrees F is 46%</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting. I thought it was more limited to the fact that humans don't feel temperature through our skin, we feel heat transfer, like how a cool breeze feels much colder than stagnant room temperature.</p>
<p>This is far more in depth than I realized.</p></div>		</li>
