<p>I imagine that this is due to the material that is cut, such distributes forces in an unbalanced fashion onto the chisel ground knife as opposed to the flat ground knife that has symmetrical cross section</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh sorry, I've been using asymmetrical to indicate &quot;chisel&quot; ground or single bevel.</p>
<p>I don't think I've ever come across asymmetrical &quot;flat ground&quot; edges before. Not in my few asymmetrical Japanese knives anyways. </p>
<p>The only time I've seen that kind of geometry is with cutting tools with oddball stuff like glass cutting drill bits which will often have a negative rake angle and/or very little relief angle. I might lightly grind on a bit of negative relief angle on a drill bit (backwards relief angle) onto a drill bit if I am doing a lot of drilling in brass on a lathe or drill press with piloted holes (small hole already drilled). Brass is a fairly catchy material. A cutting edge can bite into brass and really want to drag itself into a cut sometimes. If this is a problem, grinding in a little bit of backwards relief angle can mitigate this issue.</p>
<p>With thicker slices, symmetric edges will perform better because the flanks of the knife will be symmetrically supported on both sides of the knife. You don't really see steering effects unless you're shaving pretty thin slices. An asymmetric single bevel knife will steer like mad when cutting in the middle of a cucumber or cutting a slice thicker than maybe 4mm.</p>
<p>With something firm like a carrot, I reckon the effect of asymmetric load on the flanks of an edge will become more apparent as you make slices 3mm or less. They'll really become apparent when you're trying to do anything 2mm or less. Softer materials like fish will show steering issues with thicker slices up to maybe 5mm which is why you see single bevel being popular in the classic sushi yanigiba knife. </p>
<p>The asymmetric edged kitchen knife is a bit of a specialty knife really. You'll see it often with knives intended for thin cutting and basically never in general knives like a chef's knife, utility knife, or paring knife because they're generalist cutting knives that are often making thicker cuts or splitting things. </p>
<p>I think that the impression that a knife is really good for cutting thin things leads to the sense that it is wicked sharp. It sure helps to be sharp, but if you want to turn a log of daikon into a paper thin roll of veneer for a fancy garnish, you really need an asymmetric edge. It also has to be bleeding sharp because so much of the edge is engaged in a cut all of the time, but the general geometry and edge sharpness are different parameters in a knife.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is true for general cutting tasks. It's different when you're cutting very thin slices.</p></div>		</li>
