			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for asking, I'd never looked up the exact details. Sadly, the value was not literally measured in a calorimeter (at least not in the original case), so it seems I was the victim of a game of telephone. </p>
<p>Strangely, the first detailed result I found is in this research paper (full text): <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4035446/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4035446/</a></p>
<p>Synopsis: Dr Max Wishnofsky came to the (derived, not literally measured) conclusion that a pound of whole human body fat tissue has an energy content of 3750 kcal.</p>
<p>His conclusion (frequently quoted but almost always over-simplified) was the rule we all know, that the energy content of weight change was about 3500 kcal/lb. But his actual report included the fact that this must be from more than fat loss, and is based on a meta-analysis of multiple reports of weight loss in humans on various kinds of calorie restriction.</p></div>		</li>

<p>On the flip side, it's also why some people can have a high body fat percentage and be a superstar on health metrics;</p>

<p>Super skeptical on this.  Just to be clear, what's considered high body fat %?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it was overweight or obese categories. 25% in men and 30% in women or something like that. I thought this came from something specific I read on slatestarcodex.com, but I'm having trouble finding it.</p>
<p>I think the less casual way of stating what I remember would be, &quot;The correlation graph between body fat percentage and poor health outcomes, and also body fat and certain specific proxies of health is distinctly and importantly multi-modal.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
