The best evidence we have for the presence of a liquid ocean under the ice of Europa is by looking at how Jupiter’s magnetic field changes near the moon. Our best estimate is that this ice shell is around <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/jupiter-moons/europa/in-depth/#:~:text=Scientists%20think%20Europa's%20ice%20shell,all%20of%20Earth's%20oceans%20combined" target="_blank">10 km with a liquid ocean perhaps 100 km thick underneath it</a>. To put that into perspective, Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench (the deepest point in the Pacific Ocean) is nearly 11 km deep. That means that the deepest parts of Europa’s ocean may be <strong>10 times</strong> deeper than the deepest point of Earth’s ocean.   </p>
<p>Question #2 - great question about Europa’s past! We think that <a href="https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/news/jupiters-grand-tack-reshaped-the-solar-system/" target="_blank">Jupiter was much closer to our Sun in the past</a> (perhaps closer than Mars is to the Sun today). If, at this time, Europa was already formed with all its H2O then it would have had much higher surface temperatures than it experiences today. Europa is also heated internally through tidal forces and the slow decay of radioactive isotopes in its rocky core. That radioactive heating would have been much stronger in the past leading to even higher temperatures. There is a lot of ongoing research to figure out if all these factors may have been enough to expose Europa’s liquid water to space. But even if it were warm enough, there is so much water that it would have completely covered any rocky surface – leaving it as a water world. So, it is very unlikely that any land was ever exposed. - Joe</p></div>		</li>
