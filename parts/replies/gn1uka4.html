			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the great comment and sources! Do you have any more info about your line &quot;Customer's who handle raw poultry are believed to be at higher risk&quot;?  I'm more curious from the cook side, since they can handle large amounts of raw poultry (chicken), but I haven't heard it mentioned for them (as someone who's worked in the food industry and handled lots of chicken).</p></div>		</li>

Perhaps there‚Äôs a lack of studies, I‚Äôd assume nobody wants to know that food is trying to kill us... ü§î I guess all jobs are trying to kill us anyway, but then again, lack of a job usually gets the bad reputation. üò¨</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of this is based on how these studies are done. When something is implicated as being dangerous, the researchers first look at those closest to the risk, with the highest exposure. So, for example, when asbestos was first implicated in lung cancer, the first group they looked at was miners, then processors, then distributors, then installers. Consumers are the hardest to study because there are so many variables and a lot of noise making the signal harder to discern (including air pollution and smoking and dietary factors), but they can make a projection based on the downward sloping curve from the miners on out, and if the curve appears to track a trajectory that is above the average for the general public, the researchers cautiously make such a projection.</p>
<p>The same sort of curve appears for poultry, with meat plant workers getting rare cancers associated with the virus, and then butchers. If rare cancers associated with a virus are showing up in them, erring on the side of caution, you can simply look at the exposure and the associated risk, and make an educated projection, because again, on the consumer end, there is a lot of noise messing with the signal from other lifestyle factors.</p>
<p><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-role-of-poultry-viruses-in-human-cancers/" target="_blank">This layperson's video</a>, citing the sources I mentioned above, explains.</p>
<p><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/poultry-and-penis-cancer/" target="_blank">This video</a> cites the second paper I cited above, pointing out their data shows that Poultry workers have an 8-fold increased risk of dying from penile cancer (which is pretty uncommon) compared to controls. The viruses have also been found in eggs:</p>

<p>Penis cancer isn't the only cancer these retroviruses are known to cause. They are implicated in liver and pancreatic cancer as well:</p>

<p>Quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Methods:</strong>                       A pilot case-cohort study of both cancers within a combined cohort  of 30,411 highly exposed poultry workers and 16,408 control subjects  was conducted, and risk assessed by logistic regression odds ratios (OR)  and proportional hazards risk ratios.  </p>
<p>...  </p>
<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong>                       This study provides preliminary evidence that exposure to poultry  oncogenic viruses may possibly be associated with the occurrence of  liver and pancreatic cancers. Case-control studies nested within  occupational cohorts of highly exposed subjects of sufficient  statistical power may provide an efficient and valid method of  investigating/confirming these findings.</p>

<p>Lest you think beef is better, beef appears to be a vector for bovine oncogenic viruses, which seem to target mammary tissue and are implicated in a large number of breast cancers. As many as 37% of breast cancer cases may be attributable to bovine leukemia virus exposure.:</p>

<p>To me, the fact that this viral threat is passively accepted because vaccinating the herd of cattle and chickens would be expensive is a scandal with a huge body count. At the very least, if this can't be done cost-effectively, people should be informed so they can take informed risks. Cooking the viruses kills them, but still, if people knew the risks, they'd glove-up and perhaps be more vigilant when washing their hands when handling raw poultry and beef.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your last paragraph really hit home why knowing/thinking about these things is so important. As a person, all I can reasonably do is take reasonable precautions like you mentioned, but at the very least I so agree education needs doing. Thank you for the wonderful and insightful comment!</p></div>		</li>
