			<div class="markdown"><p>Electricity works because electrons travel across a wire and cause electrical devices to do things (like turn a motor, light a light bulb, etc.) In a battery, you set up two different chemicals, one of them with an excess of electrons, the other with less.  We refer to these as positive and negative electrodes, or the cathode and the anode.</p>
<p>(Note that this is backward.  We talk about current as the flow of positive particles, from + to -, but it's actually negative particles that are flowing, from electrically negative to electrically positive.  I don't have time to get into it here, but it breaks down to the idea that historically electricians made circuits work before scientists knew why they worked, so the terminology is based around the flow of positive particles, while the reality is negative electrons are flowing)</p>
<p>In an average off the shelf alkaline battery, zinc is one electrode and magnesium dioxide is the other end, both in a solution of potassium hydroxide.  Zinc reacts with the potassium hydroxide, making free electrons through a process known as oxidation.  The electrons travel along the circuit until they reach the magnesium dioxide electrode, where in a process known as reduction, the magnesium reacts with the potassium hydroxide to make magnesium trioxide.  When there's not enough zinc left to react anymore, the electrons stop being produced, so the battery dies.  (I'm still simplifying, what happens in a wire at a quantum level is even more confusing)</p>
<p>Rechargable batteries, like the lithium-ion battery in your phone, work the same way, through an oxidation reaction in the cathode and a reduction reaction in the anode.  However, when an  outside current in the opposite direction is applied, like when you charge your phone, the reaction is reversed and the electrodes recharge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation, I was really hoping for an Arrested Development one armed man lesson at the end.  </p>
<p>And thats why you never recharge non-rechargeable battries.</p></div>		</li>
