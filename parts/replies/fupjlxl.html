			<div class="markdown"><p>Nowadays this is called “Mucormycosis,” it’s only immunocompromised people who are really at risk of bread mold taking over their body but this can be extremely deadly and disfiguring. Infection is often associated with the fungus eating the face necessitating surgical removal of the necrotic tissue to survive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have a normal, intact immune system you’re most likely safe. The fungi that cause Mucormycosis are basically all around our environments, hence why bread will get moldy to begin with. As the above posters said, it requires the person’s immune system to be compromised either medically (like immunosuppressive medications for organ transplants and cancer) or pathological (diabetes, cancers, genetic dysfunction of the immune system, etc.).</p></div>		</li>
