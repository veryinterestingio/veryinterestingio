<p>When photographing moving objects, it is also possible to &quot;pan&quot; the camera, change the angle of view to follow the object. That technique is more often used for terrestrial photography like racing cars.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's also <em>extremely</em> common on space telescopes.  Since you have conservation of angular momentum without any external friction, reaction-wheel systems can achieve extremely precise continuous rotation of the telescope to follow remote objects.  Hubble, for example, has a rated precision of 10 milliarcseconds (i.e 3 x 10^-6 degree), with a rotation rate of up to 6 degrees per minute.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of time when someone explains decently in detail and imo, should be simple or perhaps require just one-time Google to understand (I know some do went overboard), it will end up with replies saying &quot;ELI2&quot;, or &quot;That's not for five-year-old&quot; etc..</p>
<p>In the end, only when explaining with analogy, could they understand. So, it kinda make sense most will just use analogy to explain now..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add a few things here, amateur terrestrial telescopes do this with an &quot;equatorial mount&quot;.  The axis of the mount is pointed towards celestial North, close to Polaris.  A synchronous motor then gradually moves the telescope about this axis to compensate for the Earth's rotation.</p>
<p>In the old days, you'd hold that exposure for hours and occasionally check it against a guide star using your spotting scope to make sure it wasn't drifting too much.</p>
<p>We've come a long way.  The modern technique is to take a number of shorter digital exposures throughout the night.  Then you process all those exposures with software that throws out the defects.</p>
<p>Pictures on /r/astrophotography/ today look like what I used to see printed from multi $million research telescopes in the '80s.</p>
<p>edit -- to get to the heart of OP's question though, and others have mentioned this, the motion of the planet against the stellar background is negligible during a photography session vs. the rotation of the Earth.</p></div>		</li>
