<p>No one knows for sure. The current theory among economists is a 'savings glut' (popularized by Ben Bernanke in 2005)</p>
<p>The reason savings accounts used to pay more, is that banks needed depositors. Banks loan out those deposits. Basically, the savings rate they offered is giving consumers a cut on those investment returns, in exchange for letting them use the deposit.</p>
<p>In recent decades, there hasn't been as much need for capital- there's tons of very cheap capital (which is unusual historically, usually capital used to be a limiting factor). Now we seem to have more capital than easy good investments, which drives returns down. If you don't want to invest at low rates, they'll just to the next guy with cash. High supply, low demand.</p>
<p>It also means there's less room for banks to invest, and kick some of it back to depositors.</p>
<p>And it's not just savings accounts rates. Mortgage rates are historically low, U.S. treasury rates are low, etc. There's a lot more free money looking around to be invested productively in the past, and that pushes down returns.</p>
<p>As to <em>why</em> there's a capital glut- that part is way more speculative. Some people attribute part of it to an increase in global capital- places like China tend to want savings, and so there is more capital coming in from abroad. Others blame technology; we've kind of gotten all the easy ideas with modern electronics/the internet, and new foundationally different ideas are harder to develop. On top of that, the population of many advanced economies are no longer growing as fast, which also puts an emphasis for more stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The basic reason is that they wanted people to be able to borrow more (helps businesses and property investors). Thirty years ago you'd be paying something like 15% interest on a mortgage, now it's between 2-5%.<br />
The inflation on lending is tied to the inflation on savings, low lending rates means even lower savings rates (else banks wouldn't break even).<br />
Edit: this is the UK reasoning at least.</p></div>		</li>
