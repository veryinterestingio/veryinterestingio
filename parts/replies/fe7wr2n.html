			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Phone cameras are designed to capture a similar field of view to what you see. So, you're taking your whole field of view and shrinking it to the size of a phone screen, which takes up like 1/10th of your field of view, hence the 1/10th apparent size.</p>
<p>Hold your phone right up against your eyes and the moon will look full size, if completely out of focus since it's practically touching your eyeballs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that's completely wrong. Most phones use a focal length that is equivalent to the field of view (not distortion!) of a lens with around 20mm on full frame (actually just something like 2mm with huge crop, thus the extreme distortion).</p>
<p>Our field of view is similar, but the distortion we see (virtually none) would be best represented by a lens with a focal length of around 50mm on full frame. </p>
<p>Which is why that lens is the most versatile and popular, it looks natural.</p>
<p>And this distortion is the reason why the moon looks small on phone pictures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't quantify &quot;2x better&quot; for you, but I can be pretty sure it'll be 4x bigger (2x length and 2x height = 4x the area) if you use 2x zoom.</p></div>		</li>
