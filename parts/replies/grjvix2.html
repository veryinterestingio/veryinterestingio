<p>And thorium is not automatically safer than uranium. Modern reactor designs (at least Generation IV) all have passive safety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Building new reactors has always proceeded at a snail's pace when the government has been spearheading the development.</p>
<p>If we want liquid fueled thorium reactors, it's going to come from giving the national labs direction and funding, and that's going to require Congress, and that's going to require public demand and support that will never happen.</p>
<p>A corporation is unwilling to take the risk on a project that will tie up hundreds of millions of capital, potentially for a decade, with no guarantee of success or even regulatory permission assuming development succeeds. Shareholders will not allow the unrealized revenues. </p>
<p>I would love to see molten salt thorium, or any molten salt reactor in general. But I don't think it will happen in the US, just due to the money.</p>
<p>China will do it, and we'll drag our feet for another decade, until relenting and buying their licensed design from them, even though we essentially gave them the technology we developed in the 60s for free.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're talking about fuel cycles, not specific reactor designs. Can you elaborate on what kind of reactor you're thinking of, and why the moderator would make it less safe?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This generalization is not correct. The safety built into gen IV reactors depends on the specific details of design. For example, there are gen IV water moderated reactors that are safer than previous generation water moderated reactors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. LFTR's are in theory safer for many reasons. The safety advantage with the moderator is that the fuel can be removed from the moderator in case of an emergency. As criticality is dependent on the moderator the chain reaction would shut down. It's not the specific moderator that creates this safety factor but the design of the reactor. This all happens passively with the use of a freeze plug that is essentially a pipe that must be actively cooled to keep the salt within solid and prevent the loop from draining. The other primary safety benefit is operating at ambient pressure. Both features are common to all molten salt reactors. In fact you could and likely would use U-235 as fuel in an LFTR with no added safety concerns. The benefit of Thorium is that it can breed in the thermal spectrum and it is hundreds of times more abundant than U-235 which is the only natural occurring fissile material on earth. U-238 breeding is the only other major fuel option but it can only breed in the fast spectrum which is significantly harder to design a safe reactor around.</p></div>		</li>
