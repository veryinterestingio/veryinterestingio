			<div class="markdown"><p>So a black hole’s singularity is infinitely dense?
Does that mean it has infinite mass, or is it just an infinitely small point in space?
Wouldn’t it suck instantly the entire Universe?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, according to General Relativity.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>No, there are black holes with different masses.  Compressing things to an infinitely small point doesn't add any mass or gravity.  If the sun turned into a black hole we would still orbit around it because its mass/gravity would be the same, only the density changed.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>No, otherwise we wouldn't be here right now.  Even if it did suddenly get infinite gravity, gravity propagates at the speed of light, not instantly (nothing propagates instantly).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Should also be noted that General Relativity's determination that the black hole's singularity is infinitely dense is one of the ways we know General Relativity is not complete.  The infinities that show up in General Relativity are big flashing signs saying &quot;Ok, it's wrong here&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hypothetically, if I launched a probe slowly at a black hole as something was travelling towards the event horizon, could we infer where the mass was positioned by how the probes trajectory is affected over time (obviously lots of time). I'm kinda thinking that while the two masses are far apart, the probe should be attracted to each of them. But as the matter from the mass is absorbed, this should impact the trajectory until it is essentially impacted only by the singularity itself.</p>
<p>Assuming the change in gravity is propagated outside the event horizon of course</p></div>		</li>

<p>The formation of a gravitational singularity causes our math (physical models) to break down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find this <em>fascinating</em> because it means our scientific models and math aren't complete or accurate. But these things (black holes) still <em>work</em> perfectly fine, so there has to be some sort of explanation or set of rules they abide by.</p>
<p>And if there's a working model of something we should be able to figure it out, understand it and duplicate. So the existence of black holes (or whatever the hell the Sun is doing?) is proof and encouragement that we could <em>have</em> those things someday.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has a definite mass (the star from which it came plus any matter that has since fallen into it) but occupies an infinitely small space i.e. a single point with any mass would be said to have infinite density.</p>
<p>So no it wouldn't suck in the universe. If our Sun, for example, shrunk into a blackhole, we are far enough away that our orbit wouldn't be affected. It would be dark and cold but Earth would continue orbiting it as if nothing had changed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda like how some TVs have &quot;infinite&quot; contrast ratios (not really but very large). Brightness isn't infinite obviously, but if a screen's blacks approach absolute darkness then it's effectively infinite no matter what the brightness is. The denominator (such as in Density = Mass/Volume) approaches zero, result approaches infinity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The size of the event horizon depends on the object's Schwarzchild radius. All mass has a Schwarzchild radius. </p>
<p>For example, Earth has a Schwarzchild radius of ~9mm. This means that if you shrunk the entire mass of the such that its radius was smaller than it's Schwarzchild radius (like into a single point - a singularity), it would become a black hole with an event horizon of ~9mm.</p>
<p>The Schwarzchild radius is defined by: </p>
<pre><code>r=2GM/c^2</code></pre>
<p>Where 'G' is the Gravitational constant, 'M' is the mass of the object, and 'c' is the speed of light. Mass is the only real variable.</p>
<p>To answer your question: the size of the black hole's horizon depends on the total mass of the object. The more mass you add, the larger the event horizon will grow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation.<br />
Question, though.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>the larger the event horizon will grow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be clear, traveling into the event horizon, eventually you reach ... something.  You reach a point that is more dense than the mass just inside of the event horizon.  Does the density not increase as you reach the center of a black hole?</p>
<p>Like, eventually you slam into a solid object, assuming you could survive it?   It might not technically be solid, but for all intents and purposes, it is the most dense material we could smack into.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the the singularity is infinitely dense, how is the mass effected? I imagine I'm grossly wrong, but if something is infinitely dense that sounds like it can't get any denser, so what happens to mass when added? Does it just joint  the singularity? How does the black hole's gravity increase if the density doesnt change? What happened to the mass?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the more mass packed into the singularity, the larger the escape velocity to overcome the increased gravitation must become.  where that velocity equals the speed of light is the event horizon.  as you increase the mass in the singularity, the radius of the event horizon increases proportionally.</p></div>		</li>
