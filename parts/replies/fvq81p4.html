			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add to this that, although there are other parties, those parties' candidates are not always on the ballot. </p>
<p>Each state has its own set of requirements a candidate has to meet in order to &quot;qualify&quot; for a place on the ballot. This year, it's looking like one of the third party candidates will appear on about 35 of 50 state ballots and the others won't even come close to appearing on that many. If you want to vote for her (Jo Jorgensen) in the other 15 states, you have to write in her name and hope that something doesn't happen to discount it. It's hella sketchy and just feeds into the two-party funnel, because the two parties want it this way and they're the ones making the rules.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you provide a little more explanation on the topic please? I honestly don't understand how it is possible that most people vote for one candidate and then another one wins? And how can that be called democracy?</p>
<p>Edit: much thanks to everyone for your answers, but please don't send any more - I think I need a day or two to digest all this information as it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Check out Cgpgrey on YouTube. He explains these sorts of topics really well (I understand it, and find it interesting  even though I'm not from the US, thanks to his videos).</p>
<p>He has a few different videos that answer your question (there are various ways a candidate can win despite not getting the most votes, depending on the type of voting). Here's are two videos about the electoral college: <a href="https://youtu.be/OUS9mM8Xbbw" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/OUS9mM8Xbbw</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/7wC42HgLA4k" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/7wC42HgLA4k</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how most representative democracy works. Assuming from your name that you are Scandinavian: You elect your local MP, the party with the most MPs forms a government. </p>
<p>But unless you have a proportional representation system (Scotland has a complex partial system) then the actual number of votes for any party is not likely to correspond directly to the number of representatives. Smaller parties can actually garner a measurable number of votes across a country (UKIP &amp; Greens in the UK) but not gain enough votes in any single area to get MPs elected to represent them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First past the poll voting means that joining into parties works better.  You can see this later episodes of the that Survivor show.  There's a movement to change how we vote in the states to ranked choice voting where the voter ranks candidates.  This method would be much better for the voter. </p>
<p>Please research &quot;Ranked Choice Voting&quot; on YouTube or at one of the many local movement's website.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have proportional representation here in Ireland. It works to a point in that areas have multiple reps from more than one party, so you can have your choice working for you even if they are an independant or from a minor party, at a local level. But the main parties still hold sway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People don’t actually vote for one of the candidates.</p>
<p>Each state gets a set amount of electoral votes. When a party wins the state, the candidate (in theory) receives <em>all</em> these votes. The candidate with most electoral votes wins the election.</p>
<p>The weird thing is that one electoral vote does not represent the same amount of people in each state. This has caused a ‘problem’ several times, where the winner of the popular vote did not win the election.</p>
<p>Also, an electoral vote is done by an actual person in the electoral college. They pledge (promise they will cast) their vote to the winner in that state. Not all of them keep their promise and vote for someone else.</p>
<p><em>Edit after reading bit more into it:</em> Apparently voting is ‘ceremonial’ and has no constitutional value. A state is not required to hold elections for these electoral votes and they can basically do whatever they want. By law, that is; it’ll cause chaos if they actually do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An episode of the podcast “My History Can Beat Up Your Politics” on the electoral college said it was put together by a sort of “odds and ends” committee towards the end of the Constitutional Convention. They’d figured out all of the big stuff, and had this committee figure out the specifics of electing the president, and this group wanted to preserve some element of the senate, where all states are equal, while being more based on population like the House, and they also had to deal with the technology of the day, hence sending Electors.</p></div>		</li>
