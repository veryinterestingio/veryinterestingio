<p>Edit: The US should go to a standard Hot Pocket Fusion unit or the power need to microwave a Hot Pocket to the temp recommended on package, that being 80M Kelvin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an American, I have literally <em>no idea</em> how much electricity is used to heat a kettle. Is that a lot? A lot? How does it compare to other things? </p>
<p>Man, I do wish that there was a logical and reasonable measurement of electrical usage so I could compare this to other household devices. How many kettle powers is a microwave minute? What about compared to a toaster dozen? Or a light bulb weekend?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point is that it is such an insignificant amount of energy that you don’t think about it, you just put the kettle on.</p>
<p>So if you made the effort to unplug your phone charger every time you finished with it all your effort for the year would be undone if you congratulated yourself with a cup of tea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A kettle is around 2000W in average.</p>
<p>Assuming it takes 3 minutes to boil water, that's 2000/60*3 = 100Wh per boil (same as leaving a 10W light bulb on for 10 hours).</p>
<p>Another comment said a plugged phone charger uses around 0.25Wh, that's 0.25*24*365 = 2190Wh per year, or equivalent to boiling a kettle almost 22 times (or leaving a 10W lightbulb on for 219 hours or 9 days).</p>
<p>If you pay your electricity US$0.15 per kWh the cost of boiling one kettle is around ¢1.5 and the cost of leaving a phone charger plugged in for one year is around ¢33 per year.</p>
<p>Conclusion: kettle is not a good unit of measure, Watt is more convenient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be more pertinent than horsepower and it would even be roughly commensurate. </p>
<p>1hp is about 750W. A plugin kettle probably consumes around 1.2kW (max wattage from a 15A circuit is only 1.8kW) which would put the kettle at about 1.6hp.</p>
<p>A 200hp car would be described as a 125bkp (British Kettle Power) vehicle.</p></div>		</li>

If you heat your home with electricity, this heat isn't waste at all, you've just got a very small radiant heater.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unplugging chargers has a real if negligible effect but unplugging simple devices such as kettles, toasters, dishwashers etc will make no difference.</p>
<p>The issue with advocating turning things off is that it makes people complacent about far larger changes that they could make, and uses up goodwill. It would be far, far more valuable to cycle rather than drive on a single, short journey than to spend a year studiously switching stuff off at the wall. Of course you can do both but people are not good at that (look up moral licensing if you are interested).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually did get switch off powerplugs, with a globel switch, and per plug. To leave everything connected but off. Although more on a firehazard point of view than drawing energy. Although I am working towards off the grid living which is a real eye-opener on many things. Althoug moreso water. For now at least as I'm already waterindependent. I wonder if you 'd have to cycle to get your energy, if the différence it makes to unplug all would be enough to actually care to do so or not. Perspective changes a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really because power generation also scales up with population. Our grid also isn't very smart and has very little storage built in. This means the power companies need to generate the power that might be used not just what vis used. So regardless of whether you keep your charger plugged in or not they will still be generating the same power whether you use it or not.</p></div>		</li>
