			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called the ventriloquist effect, and it's really powerful.  If it didn't work, watching the TV would be annoying because the voices would appear to come from the sides or bottom of the screen where the speakers are, rather than from the person in the middle of it.</p>
<p>It's basically that we allow our eyes to manipulate where we think a sound is coming from by pinning it to a plausible source.  If you have two speaker that are say 15° apart, you can easily tell which a sound is coming from.  Now, add LEDs to the top of each.  When you play a sound, make one of the LEDs blink in time.  You'll perceive the sound as coming from whichever speaker has the blinky LED, regardless of where it actually is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really interesting. Just the other week I was watching a YouTube video and I kind of desync from it and got disoriented because it was super obvious that the sound was not coming from the person's mouth. I don't know why that happened but I started thinking about it, glad to have a name for the normal behavior now! It hasn't happened since then thank goodness because it was really distracting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, when live TV became a thing, they were really worried about audio sync issues.  Turns out we don't care <em>too</em> much as long as the video is ahead of the audio.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s also the transitive gaze.</p>
<p>If you, the ventriloquist, are talking then you look at the audience and point the dummy’s gaze your way. When the dummy is talking you direct your gaze at the dummy. The audience just follows.</p>
<p>As a performer you have extreme control over the audience. People already suspend disbelief when they buy a ticket.</p>
<p>The stage is a wonderful beast and I love every minute I’ve spent on it. (Not a ventriloquist but a seasoned actor).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did an experiment on this for a class in university, and we were able to prove this effect quite easily. We had two monitors set up, each with a speaker. At random times a clap would be shown on one side, and the sound would be played by one of the two speakers. The participant would have to choose which speaker the sound came from, and there was a definite skew to the video side, even when the participant was told to ignore the video. The brain thinks it's smart!</p></div>		</li>
