			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on industry, there can actually be considerable tax advantages even if you are talking only tens of thousands. </p>
<p>But back to the original question, many of these benefits are set up for business owners who are able to build wealth through their business or assets, and not just through their actual paycheck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Long time ago I had a web developer job at a huge international bank. The kind that offered every kind of banking to consumers and institutions in dozens of countries. Not quite a household name but they did a lot of advertising. One of the sites I built for them for a marketing site for their offshore banking business. It wasn't heavily qualified with minimum investments and seemed to be aimed just at normal people with a lot of savings. Like people approaching retirement. But basically anyone could ask to open an account and it wasn't secret at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a different thing. What you're describing is the point where you can live of the interest of you money. If you make some very safe investments, you can get around 2% return per year (used to be much higher before 2008, but then never really bounced back afterwards). This means that if you have $5 million, you can just live of the $100k of interest per year and you never have to work again. </p>
<p>This is unrelated to the point where it becomes worth it to set up offshore accounts and hire accountants and lawyers for dodging taxes.</p></div>		</li>
