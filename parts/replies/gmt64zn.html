<p>I didn't grow up around farm animals, so the few times I've petted a cow, I'm more intrigued than relaxed, for instance.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's still automatic for those with traumatic/different experiences, but there's a combination of A) different chemicals being released and B) different reactions to those chemicals. The end result is a different &quot;feeling&quot; when around certain animals. </p>
<p>Yes, I know this is largely semantic in this instance, but I think there's a lot about the human body and more specifically brain chemistry which is still largely unknown/undiscovered at this point. So some type of levels of minor pedantry would help others better understand what's going on inside their own heads.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No no, you're completely right. I should have worded myself better. With &quot;automatic&quot; I meant &quot;pet &gt; I feel good&quot;. If you had a traumatic experience, the automatic response will be &quot;pet &gt; I am uncomfortable and want to leave this place now&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

He's like, wrestling with it on the floor, and I'm like, &quot;wtf is it doing now?!  is it dying?!&quot;  Definitely a comfort level thing although he is a Good Boy and is quickly rewiring me.</p></div>		</li>
