			<div class="markdown"><p>The increased transmissibilty of the new strain in the UK most certainly wasn't announced to generate clicks. It was done because PHE scientists had found that the new strain was being found at a much higher rate than would be expected given the November lockdown in England.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, but we need to understand why mutations aren't a big deal, and why they could be.</p>
<p>Most mutations won't change how the virus acts.  Even a variant spreads more easily, that isn't a long term problem so long as vaccines continue to work against them.</p>
<p>And that's the danger of South African variant.  The mRNA vaccine makes your body produce antibodies that attack the primary method that the virus infects cells: its spike protein.  If the spike protein mutates, it could make the current vaccines useless.  Currently, it's being reported that the South African variant has a mutated spike protein.</p></div>		</li>
