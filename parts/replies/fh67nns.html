			<div class="markdown"><p>I seem to remember reading once about a study that showed that a significant percentage of elderly patients who fell and broke their hip actually broke their hip in the process of walking when their bones had become weakened. The fall was a result of the fracture, not the other way around. Do you see any evidence of this happening in  your work?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess is that it does happen. Although we are mostly guessing at this.  Asking whether pain care before the fall or as a result of the fall. This is very hard for many of our patients to accurately remember. We definitely get patients that very clearly state that they were walking, turned rapidly, and then had severe pain causing them the inability to bear weight (and thus fall).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In your experience, how often is alcoholism or simply intoxication a factor in hip fractures in elderly people? I have known two women 80+ who both were drunk when they fractured their hips, but nobody talked about it due to the shame that comes with alcoholism.  </p>
<p>Does that happen a lot or did I just meet two really rare cases?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alcoholism certainly can play a role. Alcoholic patients generally have poor nutrition, bad livers and slew of other comorbidities.  Intoxicated patients tend to wait longer before they seek medical attention further complicating the situation. </p>
<p>Unfortunately we see it a lot where I live. We have large elderly population.</p></div>		</li>
