			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;very hard&quot; how exactly? Does it normally take that head off and turn it into fatty acid? I imagine it's all about cycles. And there's only one path for fatty acids in that cycle and it can't be processed, and there's no renal or fecal clearing since it's fat?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the amount of LNP is tiny, simply by way that the amount of vaccine injected into the body is tiny. What is the toxicity concern for the funny end of the LNP? To my uneducated ass it seems like there is no bioaccumulation risk, and the amount in the body is so small that even if it does kill cells, it is &quot;stuck&quot; to the cell it killed and would be expelled through the body's normal waste expulsion.</p>
<p>Is my thinking wrong?</p></div>		</li>
