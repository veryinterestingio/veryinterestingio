			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comment, (as well as the top voted one) miss the point.</p>
<p>The center point is irrelevant to whether the size of the set is even or odd. The issue is that adding/removing a single value to an infinite set does not change its size, making the concept of even/odd sizes not relevant to infinite sets. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ea0opz/i_have_a_theory_if_there_is_an_infinite_amount_of/faopnry/" target="_blank">See my other comment for a more thorough explanation</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't miss the point, it refers to the demonstration of positives and negatives having the same cardinality. </p>
<p>You can say you couple {1,-1},{2,-2} etc, add 0 and say it's odd, but you could also couple {0,-1},{1,-2},{n,-(n+1)} and you get to the same point: negatives times 2 equals all integers, so the number must be even</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While the top comment's counter-example of a different center point was not entirely convincing, this one actually provides a good one. Because you can split numbers into <0 and >=0 means you can pair up (0,-1), (1-,2), etc. so by OP's logic, you would specifically have an EVEN number of natural numbers here. This shows that OP's reasoning is wrong, that 0 is an arbitrary &quot;center&quot; and that you mustn't treat it special when counting the number of natural numbers.</p>
<p>You provided the necessary fact, that adding a single value to an infinite set does not change its size, but this comment thread provides a great reasoning to overcome OP's misleading intuition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another way of looking at it as by treating the numbers as line segments between points on a line rather than the points on a line themselves.</p>
<p>So, whereas there would be 11 points between -5 and 5, there would only be 10 line segments.</p></div>		</li>
