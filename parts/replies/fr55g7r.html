			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, to be clear, the white blood cells can't chip away at them. Ink is too large.</p>
<p>Sun damage via UV rays break down the ink into small enough pieces your white blood cells can take them away.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is why heavy duty lasers are used to &quot;remove&quot; tattoos--they don't actually remove the tattoos, they just break the ink into very, very, very small pieces and your white blood cells take them away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for adding the sun damage concept.  It 'fades' the ink.  Which is why you shouldn't let your tattoos see sun.  Hence the old blue sailor tattoos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The blue is because of the black ink they used. It's a very, very dark green or blue. As it fades it looks more blue or green. Modern tattoo black is made from carbon and never loses it color. The other colors are made of other things and subject to fading. Another thing to consider is the layers of skin above the pigment will also make it look faded more than it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would tattoos fade more slowly on people dealing with severe immunosuppression and a lower white blood cell count? Or would the broken down ink just circulate in their bloodstream until the limited number of white blood cells are available to dispose of them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, a bunch of the discussion in this thread is mostly incorrect. Tattoo ink particles do agglomerate to sizes beyond those accessible by immune cells, but most of them don't. Also, light degradation of ink proceeds by a lot of different processes, and many of them don't make the ink significantly smaller. Rather, the light destroys the specific chemical structures that give a tattoo its color.</p>
<p>Generally, most tattoo particles are actually engulfed by immune cells (macrophages) that are permanently resident in the skin. As those immune cells die, new immune cells from circulation pick up the ink as they replace the old immune cells. The ink is held in place by the scar tissue generated by the tattooing process and structure of the skin itself, but it does very slowly migrate downward through processes that aren't fully understood (which is one of the reasons tattoos get &quot;smeary&quot; over time).</p>
<p>So in this case, the tattoo may actually smear faster in immunosuppressed people because the ink particles start to migrate in the absence of new immune cells holding them in place. It's also worth noting that some tattoo inks have been associated with a variety of skin cancers, and those may become more common in immunosuppressed people.</p>
<p>It's not ELI5, but here is a paper describing the process: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29511065/" target="_blank">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29511065/</a>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Perhaps it deserves its own post.</p>
<p>Equally, will they fade quicker on people with chronic  inflammatory illnesses?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with the other guy this should be it's own post, especially if you don't get an answer here. It's an awesome question. I'm leaning more towards circulating until there are enough cells to get rid of them, just because I think the sun would still be breaking down the tattoo and I doubt the broken down ink would just sit still in the same spot. That's just my guess though, I don't know enough to give a definite answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can’t speak to the mechanism (UV over time vs Laser) but the people I’ve dissected with tattoos tend to have pigment accumulate at their lymph nodes. If they had sleeves, for example, they’d have pigmented axillary lymph nodes. It was pretty neat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This, to me, is the ELI5 answer.  Your cells are replaced, but the new ones are in the same place as the old ones -- so they don't really disturb the ink.  The ink doesn't get replaced; it's not part of the cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No because tattoos are in the dermis (skin), fat is stored past that. If anything the tattoo can get stretch marks from skin stretching to accommodate the extra fat</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's wrong though. The tattoo is actually absorbed and held in place by white blood cells, which are then replaced by new white blood cells.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the only correct answer in the whole thread.  </p>
<p>It always amazes me that people can have so much conviction of some shit they heard from some guy who they thought was clever, so now they're the expert.  </p>
<p>And a nice direct quote from the article to summarize:</p>
<p>&quot;The fate of tattoo pigment injected into dermal tissues has been studied in the past, and fibroblasts were considered the primary long-term reservoir of the pigment granules (Ferguson et al., 1997; Elsaie et al., 2009). However, the morphological study of Zaba et al. (2007) and our present data combining multiparameter cytometry and the use of CD64dtr “depleter” mice demonstrate that dermal macrophages constitute the primary store of dermal tattoo pigment in both mice and humans.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically pooping it out. White blood cells engulf tiny fragments of the tattoo ink then die, then they are filtered out by your spleen and liver and excreted as waste in your poop along with the tattoo ink fragment.</p>
<p>Technically some waste will be excreted via urine or sweat too but the majority will be in poop</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd assume not. It's not so much an &quot;ALERT THERE'S A FUCKING ATTACK GOING ON!&quot;, more like &quot;Oh shoot, there's some garbage, better clean it up&quot;. Initially after taking the tattoo there is a stronger response to the damage, but that's no different from any other small wound.</p></div>		</li>
