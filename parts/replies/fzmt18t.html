			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting historical tidbit</p>
<p>If you look at the long line of islands that formed and moved away from the hot spot, extending towards Asia, you’ll notice a large kink in the line as the oldest islands (now entirely underwater) extend north toward Russia.</p>
<p>That kink was very likely formed when the sub-continent of India slammed into Asia forming the Himalayas, and changing the direction the pacific plate moved from then on, and that change of direction shows in the kink of the chain of islands</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback on u/km816 's post, the Pacific plate is crawling to the northwest, the hotspot stays where it is and <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ZiPlKCe.gif" target="_blank">punches through as the plate drifts over it, making new islands.</a>  </p>
<p>I think that's kinda right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want you to know how much you just helped me. I am an Earth Science teacher and I always struggle to find a good analogy for hot spots and the plates moving over them. But this is genius! Especially since we have 3d printers in school and they all use them! Thank you!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was in school, my science teacher took us on a field trip to the schools welding lab. He used a cutting torch in a vice and held a piece of metal with the northwest US drawn on it over the flame. As it heated up he explained the warm crust was the reason for all of the hot springs, geysers, and other geothermal features in Yellowstone. But then he began to explain the 640k year cycle as the plate moved over the hotspot. When he wanted to illustrate an eruption, he pushed the lever and blew a hole in the metal. </p>
<p>Probably not the safest for the kids watching, but it left an impression!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're not always underwater. Yellowstone volcano is over a hotspot. You can also see the remnants of a hotspot that moved under New England as a trail of circle-shaped mountains moving from Montreal east toward Maine, and then as a line of sea mounts that go southwest from Cape Cod.</p></div>		</li>
