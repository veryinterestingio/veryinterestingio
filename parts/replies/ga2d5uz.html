			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this kind of how sand dances on a piece of paper on top of a speaker making all the pretty shapes?</p>
<p>Are these shapes analogous sort of ish to electron orbital of certain energy level? </p>
<p>E.g. they change the tone and the sand just switches to the other mode almost instant! </p>
<p>I feel like sand phenomena can be very spooky</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re thinking of Chladni plates and yes it’s fairly similar. And yes the shapes are in some sense analogous, but the boundary conditions are quite different so they lead to very different shapes... but the idea of a system having a discrete energy spectrum and energies being connected to some spatial patterns is the same.</p>
<p>I will say that with chladni plates, you hit a narrow peak where the plate vibrates, and then this moves the sand around. Hence why the pattern “switches.” It switches quickly as you pass through the narrow peak, but after you’ve moved through the peak, the amplitude of vibration across the whole plate drops substantially and the sand just stays where it was moved. Hence the switching.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very cool so the circle of the plate being its boundary condition being 2-D but then the electrons get packed up in the different quantum number energy level but in 3-D space with electromagnetic fields keeping the electron in check?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The standing wave is usually called an orbital, which you may have heard in a chemistry class. In an into to QM class, you would derive the orbitals of an H atom from the wave equation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best way to think about it. And, there is no ‘quantum weirdness’ that completely prevents the electron from interacting with off-resonant light. The electron completely interacts with the light. But, since light’s frequency is much faster than the transition rate of electrons between states, off-resonant light quickly cancels itself out before any transitions can occur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does it cancel itself out because neighboring electrons all oscillate with different phases? I mean if you say it completely interacts with the light, then the electron oscillates with the electric field and creates it's own radiation, or not?</p>
<p>Now I'm wondering what is exactly happening when a photon is reflected?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn’t really have anything to do with neighboring electrons. It is actually about the ‘Linearity’ of the transitions. Basically meaning, any transition that happens in one direction, can also happen in the exact opposite direction the same way and with the same strength. So you can sort of just imagine that the “peaks” of the light’s sine wave exactly cancel out the “troughs” though it’s a bit more complicated than that.</p>
<p>And yes, electrons DO produce their own radiation, but due to linearity they also absorb the exact same amount of radiation, so there is a net zero effect</p></div>		</li>
