They do cane candies broken up into pieces and also like use the old timey rollers to squash the candy... dough? Into a mold and then it breaks apart. We actually ordered some and it was really good. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking of little holes (stay with me) you'll do well to note that plastic bags don't isolate their contents, but restricts airflow. There is no household item than can truly seal objects, the best quickly available is tin foil.</p>
<p>If you e.g. were to pack cat shit into a plastic bag or even triple sealed into three bags and throw it into the garbage, the stink would find its way out sooner or later. tick <del>tack</del> tock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And this is why drug-sniffing dogs can find drugs that are triple-sealed in plastic.  People think of plastic as an isolation chamber for whatever is in it, but low-density polyethylene, which a lot of things are made of (baggies, Saran wrap) let things through. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends what it's sealed with I guess. You'd probably want a mason jar with a vacuum. But the rubber gasket would probably leak slowly over a long time.</p>
<p>Stinky molecules are a lot smaller than bacteria so just because it's bacteria proof doesn't mean gasses won't escape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Traditional canning does more than simply close the lid of the jar. You have to seal the top with beeswax, and the canning process creates a vacuum inside of the jar, which sucks the lid onto the top of the jar. You can’t just tighten down a mason jar lid and expect it to keep things fresh; The canning process is actually fairly involved.</p>
<p>So if you actually <em>canned</em> your weed? Maybe it <em>would</em> prevent a drug dog from smelling it, because the vacuum would constantly be preventing any odors from leaking out of the rim of the lid. Sort of the inverse of a clean room using positive pressure to prevent dust from getting inside. By pressurizing the room, it ensures that any tiny gaps that would normally let dust in will blow dust away instead. In this case, the atmosphere is blowing the odor back into the jar.</p></div>		</li>
