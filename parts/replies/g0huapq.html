			<div class="markdown"><p>I scrolled a long way to find someone mentioning a password manager. I’ve been using one for the last year and loving it... for the most part.
A few times I hate my ridiculous passwords. Like when the PS4 needs me to enter a password. Or when I set up a new phone last week and needed to enter my 20 ish random password.
99% of the time the password manager is excellent though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same... I use 1password and there is a QR quick scan recovery image that I have printed and filed away in a secure location of my house.  When I upgraded my phone I just pulled it out and snapped a photo.  Only problem was I had to use another device to figure out my Google account password before I could setup my android phone to even install it again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Love 1Password! Took me a while to finally get all my logins migrated over. I’d started with the important ones like banks, credit cards, investment accounts, etc. but now <em>everything</em> is in there and every login is unique. Even dumb little sites like Facebook or some small company I bought something from and had to register for. It’s kinda life changing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked in an NSA SCIF for about 6 years. There was a big hupla when I was there because their password requirements were insane and way beyond what is standard. They also required you to change it constantly. Like insanely often. They had all kinds of algorithms check to make sure they weren’t at all similar to previous passwords. </p>
<p>Some big internal review found out like over half of everyone wrote down their password and kept it in their wallet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! This is such a massive problem with password security. InfoSec / security awareness training should be pushing long, but highly memorable passwords.</p>
<p>I also never quite got the idea of password rotation. Like, sure, if theres a silent password breach, it is ephemeral, but they'll likely just breach again. And in fact, it was likely breached because the password had to be written down.</p></div>		</li>
