A less common but useful tool is <a href="https://cdn.darknet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/Cain-And-Abel-Download-Windows-Password-Cracker-640x385.png" target="_blank">Cain and Abel</a>, and another more common tool is <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html/wsug_graphics/ws-time-reference.png" target="_blank">Wireshark</a>. Most of the time, though, they’ll be using tools that just have simple command-line interfaces that look something like <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/telbE.png" target="_blank">this screenshot of nmap</a>.</p>
<p>Just imagine a few windows looking roughly like this with lines scrolling by as people use the internet. Depending on whether the website uses https and if the victim whose traffic is being sniffed is using something like a VPN, then it’ll generally be harder to extract any useful information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could also literally be the desktop of the user, if they are able to compromise them to that point, but most likely a threat actor isn’t going to bother with RDP or a similar Linux protocol and will just open up a shell and do damage from there.  However I agree with the previous user that most hacking going to be done on an insecure WiFi is going to be done through intercepting your network traffic. </p>
<p>Let me take a moment to also say that if your WiFi password is under 10 characters definitely change it.  Make it something long and complex since generally it only needs to be entered once for each user.  Don’t make it a simple word.  If you’re going to use words at all use 5-6 of them strung together. </p>
<p>It’s super easy as a threat actor to force any device on a pre shared key WiFi (home/ WiFi) to reauthenticate, grab their hashed WiFi password, and crack it into a clear text password.  But this does require being within range of the WiFi.  However, still assume any WiFi with a short password  or public shared password is insecure and should only be used with VPN. </p>
<p>The likelihood of your home WiFi being directed targeted is probably pretty low, but it’s definitely possible to drive around and quickly find insecure WiFi networks.</p></div>		</li>
