			<div class="markdown"><p>Websites needing to warn users about the presence of cookies isn't a result of the GDPR. The EU already passed a [directive] (<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm" target="_blank">http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm</a>) back in 2011 which meant websites had to warn users about the usage/presence of cookies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea but with the gdpr is supersedes that and requires to allow a user to opt out and a bunch of other things. So more sites are being compliant with both now</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except it's not correct. The cookie message has nothing to do with GDPR. It's connected to a much earlier EU directive: h<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm" target="_blank">ttp://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh that's interesting, I'll go take a look at that, thank you for the link! Do you happen to specialize in this area (&quot;EU law&quot;)? I've always wondered what's going to happen after brexit - will the UK still be bound by EU directives and laws until it makes it own versions of the laws? I'd be curious to know if you happen to know or know where I could go look. This is a little off topic of course, but maybe you can help!</p></div>		</li>
