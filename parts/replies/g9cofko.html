			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really a dish. It's multiple small antennas looking for other radars. They can even use triangulation by measuring when each antenna saw the signal and how strong each signal is to determine where in 3d space that signal came from since each antenna is kind of pointing in different directions. Kind of like how your brain can process the direction that a sound comes from but the radar warning system has more than 2 ears making it more accurate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, so the movie scene deal with the rapidly escalating series of beeps that eventually becomes a solid tone is actually somewhat accurate to what is happening?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More or less.  </p>
<p>It's more complicated in real life and depends on the piece of equipment on the detecting aircraft, called a Radar Warning Receiver.  Some will emit a short beep when it detects a radar beam sweeping across it.  In the case of a searching radar scanning the sky, it would sound like &quot;Beep......................Beep.....................Beep.......................Beep&quot;</p>
<p>If the radar locks on and starts tracking you though, it might sound like &quot;Beep.Beep.Beep.Beep.Beep.Beep.Beep.Beep&quot; because the sweep is much shorter and the RWR is detecting it more often.  If it detects a fire control or seeker radar, it'll let off a different tone like &quot;WooWooWoo&quot; in addition to the beeping.</p>
<p>Other RWRs might just give a loud beep when it detects something new, and then a shorter beep if that contact updates, and then an alarm if it detects a missile.</p></div>		</li>
