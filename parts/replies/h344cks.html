			<div class="markdown"><p>We used to use dandelion root to cut weight, stuff makes you piss until you feel literally unsafely dehydrated. Quite bitter, not a gross taste but you wouldn’t drink it for flavor.</p>
<p>It’s awesome highly recommend to anyone participating in weight class sports where you’ll have at least a few hours to re-hydrate</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I started gardening I learned a little about herbal medicines because a surprising amount of plants have weird medical applications and many are still used as sources for medical chemicals today. </p>
<p>The ones that are toxic/poisonous will often (not always) carry the dangerous components throughout the entire plant but in varying concentrations, the roots usually have the highest concentration and then the berries the second highest concentration (vice versa in many cases as well). </p>
<p>As other people have pointed out, there’s a chemical in dandelion that acts as a diuretic which seems to be largely concentrated in the roots.</p></div>		</li>
