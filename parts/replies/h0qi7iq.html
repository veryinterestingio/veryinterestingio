			<div class="markdown"><p>Say it‚Äôs for a visual thing. Like a magneto type character bending light into different colors or something for entertainment or as an artist/magician. Or maybe as a ‚Äúportal‚Äù where you bend light and reveal a hidden world. Idk just spitballing I guess. Or using magnetic manipulation to make yourself invisible or chameleon-like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would annoy me (amateur scifi writer here). If it's <em>sci</em>fi, then stick with science except where your story absolutely fails without the handwavium or a mcguffin ray gun or whatever.</p>
<p>Basically, the better established the science is, the more annoying it is to ignore it. Example: Heavier objects falling faster than lighter objects: annoying.  FTL drive: not a problem,reality may have a breakthru in the next thousand years or so.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's the out of the box thinking and complete disregard of reality that makes stories good... Stories.</p>

<p>This could be confusing, so let me clarify what I think you mean. When charged particles like electrons and protons accelerate, the change in the local electromagnetic field creates a photon. This can come from atoms rotating (radio), atomic bonds bending/wobbling (infrared), electrons changing level (optical), electrons escaping the atom (x-ray), or nuclear reactions that create or don‚Äôt involve electrons (gamma-rays).</p>
<p>Still, not a bad answer üç™</p></div>		</li>

<p>No. No. No!! Photons are not the byproduct of anything. Photons are particles. Electrons are particles. Charge is a property that some particles can possess. Electrons poses this property, photons do not. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Light is a duality it acts like a wave and as a particle (depending on which is easier for you to work with)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since I'm at it...this is a distraction serving to confuse and perpetuate a common trope. Namely, every. single. thing. in physics can be viewed from multiple different view points and this is certainly true when working with light/optics. And so, in certain sets of problems one can exchange the view points between wave/particle for ease of calculation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What about the annihilation of electrons and positrons, wouldn't that technically produce a set of photons thus, one of the photon would be a byproduct of an electron?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely! And photons annihilate to produce electrons/positrons. So what came first, the chicken or the egg?!</p>
<p>...point is, there are them things here called photons, and similarly, there are them things here called electrons. One is not the cause of the other, nor the effect! They are equally principle/fundamental in their own right!</p></div>		</li>
