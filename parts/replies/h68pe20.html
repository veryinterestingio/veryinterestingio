<p>unless the spike protein is altered in some way</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All the variants of concern <em>do</em> have multiple mutations in the spike protein. You can see which ones on the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-info.html" target="_blank">CDC page regarding variants</a>.</p>
<p>For example, Delta is characterized by the following list of spike protein mutations: T19R, (V70F*), T95I, G142D, E156-, F157-, R158G, (A222V*), (W258L*), (K417N*), L452R, T478K, D614G, P681R, D950N</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-021-00573-0" target="_blank">This peer-reviewed article</a> gives a summary of what effects the various spike protein mutations have been found to have, from changes in transmissibility to changes in antibody effectiveness.</p>
<p>It’s true though that the spike protein is the most conserved protein of the 4 structural ones that make up the virus… which is directly related to why mutations in the spike are so significant.</p></div>		</li>

<p>These vaccines should function similarly when targeting all variants, unless the spike protein is altered in some way (but this is unlikely, we hope).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One reason why this is less likely to be a concern than other mutations is because the shape of the spike protein is critical to the virus’s access to the cells.  If the virus mutates to change the shape such that the protein cannot as easily access the cell, then that covid variant is simply a less effective variant.  Of course, the spike may still mutate in other ways that make it difficult for the vaccinated body to recognize it without that mutation changing the virus’s ability to access the cell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or even worse, a mutation could make it more difficult for the immune system to recognize the virus and simultaneously make it <em>better</em> at accessing the cell (this has <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33621484/" target="_blank">already happened</a>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to note, <a href="https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/06/17/curevac-comes-up-short" target="_blank">there has been a failed mRNA vaccine</a>.  It also doesn't seem sufficient to target the Spike.  Or, rather, you have to target a particular version of the Spike.  The failed mRNA vaccine, CureVac, targets the Spike as it's found on the in-the-wild coronavirus, whereas Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna target a modified version of the Spike, designed to keep it from collapsing/folding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are the differences between this one and the other two mRNA agents? The biggest one that I can see is that the CureVac vaccine does not use any modified mRNA bases – in fact, they have pointed to this as a feature, in the hopes that this will induce a more wide-ranging immune response. Meanwhile, the other two have made extensive use of bases like N-methylpseudouridine, in an effort to improve stability. So one possibility – a pretty likely one, in my view – is that the all-natural RNA idea has turned out to be a mistake, and that the CureVac agent is getting broken down too quickly to be effective, both inside and outside cells.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(As a side note, Astra-Zeneca/Oxford use the all-natural Spike as its target; J&amp;J uses the modified Spike)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're actually incredibly lucky that some people (Barney Graham and Jason McLellan) were working on the two proline (2P) modification prior to the pandemic to target SARS-1 and MERS.  The co-inventor of the stabilized spike, Jason McLellan, has since gone on to develop a refrigerator-stable six proline mod (Hexapro) that will be incorporated into a low-cost, locally produced, single dose, highly effective, flu-mist type vaccine grown using existing egg-based production facilities around the world</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In early 2020, McLellan, who holds the Welch Chair in Chemistry, and his team joined with collaborators at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ Vaccine Research Center to design a version of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that is stabilized to help the body recognize the threat. <strong>In nature, the spike protein changes shape, making it more difficult for the body to recognize, so the team used two mutations to hold the protein in its shape. This 2020 version of the spike protein is the basis of all the vaccines approved for distribution in the United States.</strong></p>
<p>Building on that success, the UT Austin team designed HexaPro, an even more stabilized version of this protein — <em>featuring not two but six mutations that act as molecular staples</em>. The result is the production of more spike proteins to help the body fight infection.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A nitpick, but you seem to have misinterpreted the significance of the N-methylpseudouridine substitution that Pfizer and BioNTech used.</p>
<p>It's not a change in the spike protein produced by the mRNA: it is a change in the structure of the mRNA itself, replacing one of its bases with a similar enough molecule so that it still transcribes into the same protein. The effect of this change is to make it more likely for the mRNA to get into the cells and to be actually transcribed, in large part by avoiding an immune reaction to the mRNA before it gets transcribed into the spike protein.</p></div>		</li>
