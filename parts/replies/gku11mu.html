The more people want the shares the more it's worth.   They are banking on Tesla continuing to grow and grow so more people want to invest in the company... Driving the price up and up...</p>

Money is just a placeholder for wealth for bartering purposes, people lived without money in the past just fine. Just think of all the land and buildings in the world, there's not enough cash on the planet to buy it all</p></div>		</li>

<p>those are still tangible &amp; finite assets. When trying to compare stocks to a tangible asset, I always like to think of it as artwork - there's virtually an infinite supply and its value is not so much defined by its raw consumption properties (such as buildings providing shelter) but by arbitrary market factors. <a href="https://www.liveauctioneers.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2014_0514_blackfire_lead.jpg" target="_blank">This Barnett Newman</a> selling for $84 million is pretty much value/wealth pulled out of thin air, and if hypothetically the market were to value it now at $100trillion, there wouldn't be enough money in the world to buy it (only $37 trillion in circulation) yet the owner would, on paper, have $100trillion worth of wealth simply because he's the owner of an asset others value that high.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you actually wanted to liquidate a billion dollars in Amazon stock, it will quickly become difficult to find enough buyers to actually get the supposed market value.  A rich person’s wealth is often hard to quantify because the exact value of these things is nebulous.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is very often claimed, yet holds little basis in reality.</p>
<p>Of course, if i want to liquidate my entire stock within the next hour, i have an issue. However, for example for amazon, the total value of stocks that get traded daily is about 10 billion dollar ( <a href="https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:AMZN/explorer/volume_dollar_avg_3m" target="_blank">https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:AMZN/explorer/volume_dollar_avg_3m</a> ) </p>
<p>If you spread it out over 100 days, you can liquidate 10 billion in amazon stocks while being only 1% of the trading market share.</p>
<p>Obviously it's not nothing, and it likely will get noticed. But to claim that it is hard to liquidate stocks is simply wrong. In fact Bezos <em>did</em> liquidate 10 billion dollar in amazon stocks this year and it hasn't made a noticable dent in the price.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's nothing preventing a government from printing more money if they want to (outside of damaging the economy by causing too much inflation), but most money is just numbers stored on a computer now-a-days.</p></div>		</li>

<p>i never understood this. gold is just as arbitrary as anything else. we only consider it &quot;backed&quot; because it's non-trivial to increase the supply, but there's nothing stopping everyone from just agreeing that gold is now worth more than it used to be, or on something else entirely like giant rocks at the bottom of the sea. &quot;real&quot; currency has always been a fiction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, even amid an economic downturn, some of these billionaires simply have businesses that are thriving in this climate. Chief example being Bezos. Online ordering + grocery delivery + demand for web services have all skyrocketed during the pandemic. Unsurprisingly, Amazon's stock price has nearly doubled YoY.</p></div>		</li>
