			<div class="markdown"><p>I'M SO GLAD YOU ASKED! I WAS WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO ASK THIS BECAUSE THIS IS MY FAVORITE FUN FACT ABOUT MAGNETS!</p>
<p>The iron filings themselves are ferromagnetic, and behave like little magnets themselves in the field. As a consequence, you can imagine they also have a tiny little bar magnet field around them that other iron filings will want to link up with. This ends up breaking the symmetry by creating a little local feature in the field where the iron filings are more strongly attracted. </p>
<p>If you don't believe me that those 'lines' aren't real features of the field, there's even an easy experiment: do it twice. Pour your filings, map the 'lines' and then sweep them away and pour the filings again. When you do, you won't get 'lines' at the exact same spots.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The whole “little magnets” thing is why Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and its cousin, Magnetic Resonance Imaging provide useful data.  I believe the original “discoverer” of NMR expected to measure the phenomenon then dismantle his instrument.  But he found the fine structure of the peaks related to nuclear spin and the shift of the peaks from where he thought they’d be based on the “tiny magnetic field” of the adjacent atoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ohhh, this explains something I did as a teen.</p>
<p>I had a large electromagnet and ferrofluid, I gave the electromagnet a heavily DC biased triangle wave, at ohh, 1hz or so.</p>
<p>Basically, the number of spikes (spike density) in ferrofluid changes with magnetic field strength.</p>
<p>When you feed it just the right waveform, you can make a single spike appear and disappear each cycle.</p>
<p>But the spike does not appear or disappear in the same place each time, its more or less random, and all the other spikes move out of the way to accommodate its existence. (Although it seems spikes generally appear/disappear at the edge of the mass of spikes)</p>
<p>The result? the spikes would 'walk' across the surface of the ferrofluid, some would even make it all the way across! Their movement seemed truly random with no desire to return to their original locations. </p>
<p>Was VERY cool to watch, but sadly my electromagnet would start smoking after about a minute of this due to the field strength required.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Doesn’t this assume the lines are straight or the charged particle has no mass?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s actually just a tad off. Electric field lines show you the direction the electric field pushes the charge at that point, it does not point the direction the charge is moving. </p>
<p>For example, if a positive charge is moving to the right in an E-field that’s pointing up, then the positive charge will continue moving right while accelerating upwards from the E-field, so it will be moving up and to the right.</p></div>		</li>

<p>assumes you put a particle there with 0 momentum and no other forces. so if you had this configuration on a table and and just gently put a chharged particle at a point then it would take this path.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To continue your analogy, elevation lines usually represent distance above sea level, which is really an arbitrary reference point (though a pretty good one to pick)</p>
<p>Field lines can be drawn using any arbitrary reference point, and scaled to show an appropriate level or detail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no single correct way to draw them, because they're arbitrary. Regions with a higher density of field lines have a stronger electric field strength. But how many lines you choose to draw is completely up to you.</p></div>		</li>
