			<div class="markdown"><p>I have done 3 day fasts with water and a tablespoon of olive oil in the morning as my only sustenance. The first day is not so bad. The second day is hard to bear. But the third day, you reach a new equilibrium, and you feel very peaceful while moving very slowly through your day. But every shaking leaf, insect, and bird flying by comes into sharp relief, as your body instinctively hunts for something, anything that could be a food source.</p>
<p>The next couple of weeks, I feel kind of weak, but after a long fast, I find I stop having as many allergies/minor illnesses (fasting causes your body to absorb decommissioned t-cells from previous illnesses for food, and resets your immune system to its baseline), and it's something of a spiritual experience, too. Feels like ego death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No way people do this to spend less money. I'm talking about deliberate fasting, not &quot;forced fasting&quot; that the poorest layer of society may have to do.</p></div>		</li>
