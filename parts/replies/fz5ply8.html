			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  We have a home theater (92&quot; screen and projector, 200×5 watts for the mains and surrounds, 750watts with an 18&quot; woofer for the sub.  It'll easily do movies like that justice.  But we don't use it at night when the kids are asleep.  The room is too sound isolated to hear them if they get up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually pretty easy,  you just run the audio through a compressor and limiter, then tweak a few knobs during the mastering process. The real reason there is such a difference in volume, in addition to what the redditor said in the original comment, is more of an artistic choice than anything. All movies, straight to video aside, are produced to be <em>experienced</em> in theaters. And, part of what makes that experience powerful is the Dynamic Range of the recorded audio. When the audio is mixed,  the audio engineers try to ensure that quiet parts (such as dialogue) remain quiet and the loud parts (such as music and explosions) stay loud. This limits the amount of distortion in the audio before and after the mastering process and maintains overall audio fidelity. </p>
<p>ELI5: Audio engineers expect you to watch the movie at max volume in a movie theater, so they mix the audio accordingly. Quiet parts should be audible, but explosions and music should be in your face. They don't normalize,  or compress the audio, because it can cause unwanted audio distortion.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically what I said above. Yes there should be a cinematic cut (or mix, because audio) but also they should pay someone to remix it for home theater, or digital distribution or whatever.</p>
<p>I'm a video guy and I have this argument a lot with my editors and engineers. Sure, it looks great on your $10k reference monitor. What's it look like on a cheap Asus monitor, or a Vizio or what have you. The important thing is how it's actually going to be experienced, not how it can best be experienced.</p>
<p>Edit: I didn't say it above. Multiple threads and all of that. Either way my point should stand. You should design your media for how it <em>will</em> be experienced as opposed to how you think it <em>should</em> be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes it really feels like movie audio track get mastered like the visual frames in that really <em>&quot;dark&quot;</em> episode of Game of Thrones, where they used only use about ~20% of the available luminosity range. I get they produce and tinker with that stuff on equipment more sensitive and capable than anything 99.999% of end users will have.. but it can still leave you just scratching your head going what were they thinking??</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more like it's their job and take it super seriously. Typically normalizing audio comes at the cost of compression, or losing out at the high and low end of the spectrum. Audiophiles wouldn't go for that, despite it being better for the majority.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I was gonna make that point. There's a lot of that in video village too. Yes, there should be a cinematic cut where everything is set for a perfect experience in ideal settings.</p>
<p>Then you also need another cut for everyone watching it on their $500 Samsung or their IPad or whatever.</p>
<p>I have little tolerance for those kinds of divas though. It causes a decent amount of friction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Audiophiles are superstitious idiots. Don't get me wrong, I love being able to watch movies with cinematic dynamic range on my projector with my surround sound setup. And I can do that because I live in a corner house.</p>
<p>When I lived in an apartment downtown I would have loved it too but I literally COULDN'T have done it because the neighbors would be furious.</p>
<p>They really need to make a more compressed option for people in those situations.</p></div>		</li>
