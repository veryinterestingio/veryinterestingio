			<div class="markdown"><p>The gravitational forces work the same as in a binary system, only there are now two different forces acting on each object. As such, the orbits can't be neatly described like they can for two bodies.</p>
<p>We use a variety of techniques to work out the orbital evolution: the simplest is just to use software to integrate the equations, which is fine for short times, but gets infeasible once you start caring about the evolution on longer (~millions to billions of years) timescales.</p>
<p>There is an approximation we use called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kozai_mechanism" target="_blank">Kozai-Lidov mechanism</a> which treats the system as a pair of binaries, and describes how the binry orbits vary over time. This gives us the speedup we need to investigate how these systems evolve, but can only be used for <a href="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~snaoz/Cartoon.png" target="_blank">systems where one star stays sufficiently far away from the other two</a> (this keeps the perturbations small, and prevents the system just flying apart).</p>
<p>By the way, this approximation can also be used to explain the evolution of the Solar system when it comes to things like asteroid migration, and the mysterious alignment of Kuiper belt objects implying the existence of Planet 9</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve recently hopped down this rabbit hole after reading The Three Body Problem by Cixin Liu. I’m just a layperson who barely remembers high school physics but I assumed, while reading this book, that computer models would be able to offer some reasonable facsimile of a prediction based on course plotting and observation? Like if we have a fair enough guess of how the last 100 (earth) years went, along with close enough approximations of the mass of the objects we should be able to punch that into a computer and get a rough guess if we should dehydrate soon or if we’re good to advance for a few more decades?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about the earth-moon-sun system. The moon orbits the earth, and the earth orbits the sun. This is stable because the earth and Moon are close together and relatively small compared to the sun.</p>
<p>Now just replace &quot;earth&quot; &quot;moon&quot; and &quot;sun&quot; with &quot;star&quot; &quot;slightly smaller star&quot; &quot;really big star,&quot; and you now have a three-star system</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I’ve been looking for. I’ve been trying to ask this question for a while now but I’m never really sure how to phrase it. So if we take the system you described, could there feasibly be a planet orbiting the smallest star in the system? And then a moon orbiting that? I’m assuming yes and I would love to stand on that moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In triple stars systems I think it is more common that the three stars orbit the center of mass. Usually two of the stars orbit in a binary system. The stellar pair and the third star orbit each other. That is why the system is unstable. If the stars orbited like sun-earth-moon it would be more stable just like earth and moon have stable orbits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, although the smallest component (Proxima) is in a very wide orbit, with a period of around half a million years. As a result, it doesn't affect the inner binary much</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a three-star system where the third star is roughly 700 times farther away than the distance between the other two, and is roughly a tenth the mass. My understanding is that the difference in distance is so large that the distance from either A or B to C is similar, and you can treat AB as a single object as far as C is concerned.</p></div>		</li>
