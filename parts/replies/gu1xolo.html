<p>If you eat a dense milk chocolate bar every day, dark chocolate will be bitter and unappetizing, but if your diet is almost devoid of sugar, a dark chocolate square will be yummy and rewarding. </p>
<p>Broccoli is sweet. It tastes like it has a dash of sugar sprinkled on it sweet, if you ask me, but if you associate sweet with Lucky Charms, Broccoli is not sweet, relatively. </p>
<p>Eating “good” for many years has taught me that healthy food tastes incredible and unhealthy food tastes too salty, too sweet, or too greasy. But to get there, you need to train your taste buds to enjoy the subtle, not the excess.</p>
<p>PS: lots of hate on salt here... eating healthy requires salt. Not so much the food tastes salty, but salt is like a herald for your taste buds and warns them “yummy stuff is coming.” It helps all food taste be more absorbed by the tongue. This is why sweet food always includes salt even though we rarely taste the salt. A little salt on watermelon for example makes it explode in flavor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you. My wife is WAY healthier than I am. After eating her cooking for years I have to agree that foods I used to think were flavorless are actually quite flavorful. I was just so juiced up on over sugared and over salted foods I didn’t know what “normal” food should taste like. </p>
<p>I think the “salt hate“ comes from people abusing salt. Like my father, who before even taking a bite of a meal that was prepared for him automatically adds salt. “You didn’t even taste it. How do you know it needs salt?” “It always needs more salt.” That’s a problem and sadly a common one here in southern US where I live.</p></div>		</li>
