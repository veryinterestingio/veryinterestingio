			<div class="markdown"><p>Same conclusion but not Descartes' full reasoning.</p>
<p>The line is &quot;dubito ergo cogito ergo sum&quot; - I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I am</p>
<p>His reasoning is that if he is doubting his own existence, then he must exist in order to do the doubting, therefore he exists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's foundational mainly to a branch of philosophy called '<strong>epistemology</strong>', which is the philosophy of knowledge. It asks questions about what 'knowledge' actually is and how we gather knowledge. As /u/xPanZi mentioned, lots of knowledge and methods of gathering knowledge can be doubted, but what he couldn't doubt was that there was <em>something</em> doing the doubting: his self.</p>
<p>Epistemology is a fascinating area of philosophy that has implications for lots of other areas of academic interest, such as science (there is a philosophy of science, which is kind of 'applied epistemology'), experience, consciousness, testimony etc. It's also the area that gets accidentally invoked most often by people who aren't good at philosophical questions; for example, I've known a few people who have responded to an ethics question (&quot;how do we know if it's OK to euthanise people?&quot;) with a nuclear-option epistemological question (&quot;well, how do we know anything at all? Huh?&quot;) and that's just not helpful!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all philosophy. Eastern philosophy commonly regards the &quot;self&quot; as illusory. Even Nietzsche refuted Descartes' &quot;immediate certainty&quot;. He argued that thoughts are not evidence of a thinker, thoughts are evidence of thoughts alone. Philosophers have tried for thousands of years to avoid the subject-predicate problem. But hey, grammar demands a subject, and so this experience has an experiencer, whether it's true or not!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of a joke:</p>
<p>A horse walks into a bar and asks the bartender for a beer. The bartender starts pouring one and says to the horse, &quot;You know, I see you in here pretty often. You think you might be an alcoholic?&quot; The horse replies &quot;I don't think I am&quot; and then poof! The horse disappears from existence.</p>
<p>You see this is based on the famous saying &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot; but if I had explained that part first, that would be putting Descartes before the horse.</p></div>		</li>
