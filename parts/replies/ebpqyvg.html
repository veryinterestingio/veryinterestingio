			<div class="markdown"><p>Additional question: The first harmonic is just the sound the bat hears because it's producing that sound itself, right? It's not an echo that bounced from the object?</p>
<p>If I got that correct, what is the timelag between the first and the second, third, fourth harmonics?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The time lag depends on the distance to the object that it bounces back from. The pulse travels at the speed of sound, so the delay in the echo is used to calculate the bat’s distance from the target. As to how this applies to the mechanism I described, the first harmonic of the call temporarily opens a neural gate in the bat’s brain to be able to respond to the echo of the other harmonics for a brief time interval. If the bat doesn’t hear the echo in that time, it won’t hear it at all, since the neural gate will close again. In that sense, the bat’s sonar has a certain spatial range that it operates in</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned this in a neuroethology course in college. The textbook was Behavioral Neurobiology by Thomas Carew. It assumes a little bit of prior neuroscience knowledge and it does get fairly technical at parts, but it’s well written and very interesting. One of the few textbooks I didn’t have to force myself to read through in college, it was so interesting I actually enjoyed it</p></div>		</li>
