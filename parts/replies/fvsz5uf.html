			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and it is super easy to detect. Walmart sells the radon detectors but you have to not be in the house while measuring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something about moving around the house opening and shutting doors effects the results. If any real concern you really should just have a professional come in and measure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well, to be more exact, you want to not be on the floor you are measuring.  SO that means if you have a basement and you are measuring your basement, you want to avoid going down there while the measurement is happening so you don't &quot;contaminate&quot; the sample with artificial ventilation that might happen as you go in or out.  This allows your measurement to capture a &quot;worst case scenario&quot; so to speak.</p>
<p>If you do not have a basement and you are measuring your main floor, it gets more complicated.  Because, you know, you live there.</p></div>		</li>
