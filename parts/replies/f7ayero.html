			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this thread is about ocean water, but interestingly, water in the Great Lakes gets so cold decomposition doesn’t always happen. The average temperature of Lake Superior is about 36 °F, inhibiting bacterial growth. This is why bodies on the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald are still there and intact.</p>
<p>OPs question relates to submarines though, and as far as I’m aware none of them operate in the lakes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There aren't any submarines currently in the Great lakes to my knowledge but they used to build them in Chicago during WW2. They also recently recovered a WW1 era U-boat that the US owned in lake Michigan. I don't know if they ever took subs into Lake Superior though. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I very much doubt there are subs in Lake Superior because in order to get there they would have to pass through the Soo Locks. Since going through the locks would require the lock operator to be aware of your presence (so they can operate the lock for you), and the whole point of submarines is to be sure nobody knows you are there, it seems unlikely there is one in Lake Superior.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify, looking at a world-average thermocline isn't a great method of determining temperature at a given depth. The thermocline varies a ton with location, season, wave action, etc. To use an obvious example, at 100m, temperature will be very different in the Mediterranean vs the Arctic Ocean.</p>
<p>Based on a quick Google, it looks like temperatures are more like 10-15°C in the area the sub went down</p>
