<p>No, no device cannot tell what frequence the radio is tuned into. In theory that kind of equipment can be done, but not to measure radio audience.</p>
<p>There was a time when radio broadcasting was a huge business. For that business statistical methods were used to develop reasonable and reliable methods to measure the audience. </p>
<p>However all of this is in the past. Terrestial Radio is becoming a small niche, as people use their own smartphones to listen what they want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned this was possible in my first graduate course in communication systems in the 90s.  The principle is that for some radio designs you can detect the receiver's oscillator, and for PLL systems you can measure the local frequency as it's closely related to the input signal.</p>
<p>Here's a few references to a practical implementation:</p>

<p>91% of people 18-34 listen to the radio every week. </p>
<p>That’s pretty far from “a small niche”</p></div>		</li>
