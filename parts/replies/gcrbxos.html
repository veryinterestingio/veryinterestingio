			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth mentioning that we lean pretty heavily on the &quot;if this were possible at all, it could also happen without our help&quot; principle. If some super-scary extremophile space bacteria <em>does</em> exist, it's most likely hardy enough that it could also have hitched a ride into our atmosphere on a naturally-occurring meteor.</p>
<p>eta: This is also the principle we rely on when considering those &quot;what if this CERN experiment creates a particle that eats the universe?&quot; type scenarios. We can be reasonably sure of not doing that because every kind of high-energy particle collision we can engineer in our little facilities, and plenty more besides, are almost certainly happening all around us in the cores of stars etc, all day every day already.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's strange that you hadn't heard it because it is the primary scientific rebuttal. That the collisions are occuring naturally in our atmosphere, let alone in other stars etc.</p>
<p>The amazing thing about CERN is that it enables us to analyse the collisions, which is simply not possible without overcoming a number of obstacles that CERN succeeded in overcoming.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I did a comparison of LHC to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greisen%E2%80%93Zatsepin%E2%80%93Kuzmin_limit" target="_blank">cosmic ray particle energies</a>. LHC 1.3e^13 ev protons. Energy of cosmic ray particles = greater than 10^20 ev. Nature has been doing this for billions of years with particles 100,000,000 times higher energy. And the universe and earth are still here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, one extreme-energy cosmic ray, the Oh-My-God Particle, which has been found to possess a record-breaking 3.12Ã—10^20 eV (50 joules)[1][2] of energy (about the same as the kinetic energy of a 95 km/h baseball).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The particle one makes sense. But isn't a ship in space providing a considerable amount of new surface area in the &quot;surfaces to travel to earth on&quot; category? Like, does a ship's worth of worth of rocks fall to our surface every year? And if so, doesn't that mean we're doubling the probability?</p>
<p>And thats also not considering the possibility that our metal is a better surface than other naturally occurring material, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a one-off basis, I think you're probably right about that, but in order for that to become a dominant risk there are some pretty big statistical multipliers to overcome; if this space-pathogen is terribly infectious, then it might only need to nail a successful landing once, and it has had millions of years' worth of Earth's history to try.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably worse odds on the spaceship. Spaceships are all smooth, and space rocks have more little nooks and crannies for them to hide.</p>
<p>Also there's thousands of times more space rocks than spaceships.</p></div>		</li>
