<p>Banks borrow 200 money from the federal reserve at 1% interest.</p>

<p>Great explanation. I knew roughly how it worked. But this clarifies a few things. So the 1% the banks get charged is the rate Trump keeps trying to lower?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. Interest the banks pay to the fed is calculated into the interest you pay to the bank. So, if fed interest rates are reduced, bank interest rates will be reduced as well, whether it's for home loans, auto loans, business loans, etc, encouraging taking loans to boost the economy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that a law or is it that banks SHOULD reduce interest? Because them getting lower interest doesnt mean they’ll willingly lower their interest rates equivalently necessarily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not fully true.  The government does have other sources of revenue (taxes, tariffs, etc) which could (technically) be greater than the borrowed money.  However, no recent government has shown any interest in moving in a direction that would make that possible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is only actually around $1.5 Trillion in physical US Currency. The annual GDP is roughly $20 Trillion. Many times more dollars are moved around spreadsheets daily than there is physical money in the world. This is true for all fiat currencies.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Just diving into that a bit.  Another way to think of what money is, is a medium of trade based on stored value.  Without money, there is barter - 306 widgets would have to be traded for another good.  Instead money lets you sell those widgets for a 'value' that can then be used to purchase other goods.  The value money represents is generally an assumed societal value for work done.  The social construct is that a belief money represents that stored value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Money gets really weird when you start thinking about it in those terms. </p>
<p>Like people think of paper cash as money, but then once you start thinking about where the value is, it seems like the paper is only a placeholder (e.g. a dollar bill can be spent a thousand times and add $1000 to the economy and still only be worth $1 at any point)</p></div>		</li>

<p>No fiat currency was able to be taken out of banks, so they just used veritable &quot;spread sheets&quot; backed by bank checks and carried on normally</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>at step 5, you have 306 money, when you give 206 money to bank, you have 100 money.</p>
<p>Then at step 7 and 8, bank keeps 4 money after giving 202 money back to federal reserve.</p>
<p>100 (you) + 4 (bank) = 104 (world)</p>
<p>And federal reserve destroying money (202) that they created (200) to prevent inflation. But I'm not sure why they needed to destroy that extra 2 money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You made 306 money. You paid back 206 to the bank (loan of 200 + 3% interest).</p>
<p>Now the bank has to pay back the federal reserve from that 206 money. The bank keeps 4 money and reserve gets 202 money. The bank has 4 money and you have 100 money (your profit after paying back the loan).</p>
<p>The world now has 104 money (even if you don't deposit the 100 money in the back). Hope this makes sense...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does thanks. Reading it this morning after a coffee made it much clearer :) is this showing how wealth can be generated? That is, people can create and sell things for a profit, effectively turning 200 money’s into 306 moneys?</p></div>		</li>
