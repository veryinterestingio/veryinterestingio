			<div class="markdown"><p>I read that your body also produces adrenaline when you are tired (because of little sleep) because it thinks you are in a &quot;fight or flight&quot; situation where you need to be fleeing. So it keeps you up by giving you adrenaline. Could be wrong tho.</p></div>		</li>
