			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Violently boil first, then, giving off a lot of heat by boiling (and a little by radiating), it would freeze quickly.</p>
<p>You can even replicate this in a laboratory vacuum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heat is lost in phase transformation to gas because there's no pressure in space. But the process of freezing isn't as rapid as you think, because radiation is the <em>only</em> method of heat transfer in space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact that, water only boils at 100 C at sea level.  If you live somewhere at higher altitude like in the mountains, when you boil a pot of water it will start boiling at a much lower temperature because of the lower air pressure.  If you live in Denver, for instance, your water is actually boiling at 94 C.</p></div>		</li>

I feel like that's how a lot of school was too. They tell you things, you say okay and memorize them for the test, but you don't really understand them until a conversation/read years later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One key fact about pressure being exerted throughout the entire surface is what makes the difference in part of the OPs question. So it's not like &quot;being crushed from both sides&quot; the way you might think, since <em>objects</em> pushing on you from two directions are still separated from each other (i.e. not pushing directly against each other), but rather both pushing against a third thing in between them.</p>
<p>By contrast, your interior pressure is in direct contact with the air pressure, so they just push against each other and nothing moves. With no net force, there's nothing for you to feel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your inner ear is a (semi-) closed chamber filled with air so there can be a net force due to imbalance between air pressures in the ear and externally, especially when you've recently changed elevations.</p>
<p>But that's the exception to the rule I guess.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are plenty of other enclosed spaces in your body with less-flexible walls with nerve endings such that the deformation caused by pressure equalization as the contents of the enclosed space compressed could cause pain, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4xeaiv/how_much_pressure_is_needed_to_compress_water/" target="_blank">it takes over 200 atmospheres of pressure to compress water by 1%</a> and our bodies' enclosed spaces have a high water content, so the deformation is tiny. That's why your eyeballs don't pop out of your head when you get on an airplane I guess. You might feel that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK, pressure vs weight...I'd like to know some more. Let's say (just for discussion's sake) that when I stand up, my body weight puts 14 psi pressure on my feet. I definitely feel that weight/pressure, even though I've had all of evolutionary history to get used to it. Why is air weight/pressure of a column of air so different from a column of my body mass? Is it a fluid vs solid thing? (and not to be rude, thanks so much for responding to my very naïve questions   ;-)  )</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are some reasons that cause your body's psi exerting outward and the air's psi to become imbalanced?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couple of nitpicks. </p>
<p>1) Your feet get <em>less</em> than 14psi. My foot is ballpark 9&quot; x 4&quot;. That's 36in\^2, times two feet is 72in\^2. I weigh 220lbs so 220lbs divided by 72in\^2 is only 3psi. Now obviously running/jumping exert far more pressure on your feet but the point I wanted to make was that just standing there, your feet see quite a bit less than 14psi.</p>
<p>2) Gravity is an acceleration, not a force. The equilibrium force required to balance that acceleration is called weight, and it scales with the mass of the object. To stop a tennis ball accelerating at 9.8m/s\^2 it takes far less force than stopping a hippopotamus from accelerating at 9.8m/s\^2. Gravity supplies the acceleration, we measure the equilibrium force required to hold that object stationary and call it weight.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Exactly. Solids stay in shape under force, while gases don't. You can push on a pole without the pole getting wider, but you can't do that with a gas. Just imagine what would happen if the ground was liquid: you would sink, and not feel force on your feet. </p>
<p>You can actually try that out. It's called scuba diving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of how you feel in a strong breeze.. that is caused a tiny unbalanced difference in air pressure. When you’re in a room without a breeze, the air pressure on you is largely balanced and you can’t feel it.</p></div>		</li>
