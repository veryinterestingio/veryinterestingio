			<div class="markdown"><p>because the brain would most likely be destroyed in that process. which isn't really an advantage for an organism that needs one.</p>
<p>our evolutional advantage is the ability to learn.</p>
<p>so why resetting your age when your memory and experience which would help you in your life would be deleted? it is more of an advantage if you have offsprings that you can actively teach to survive.</p>
<p>the jellyfish works in that regard more like a plant in that it doesn't have any knowledge that needs to be preserved.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;You get to live forever&quot;, for a definition of &quot;you&quot; that only depends on your genetic code.  That's what &quot;being immortal&quot; means for this jellyfish.  That's unlikely to check the box for humans, where &quot;You get to live forever&quot; mostly uses a definition where &quot;you&quot; means that your personality and memory.</p></div>		</li>
