			<div class="markdown"><p>Materials at the nano scale behave very differently to bulk amounts. think of it like sand. a single grain of sand is a solid, but a bunch of sand behaves almost like a liquid. at the nano scale quantum effects start coming into play. A lot of our physics is based on averages across a large amount of material. Newtons laws aren't 100% accurate, but they work when dealing with large objects because weird things average out.  <a href="https://www.nano.gov/nanotech-101/special" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nano.gov/nanotech-101/special" target="_blank">https://www.nano.gov/nanotech-101/special</a></a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quantities such as temperature and pressure are defined only for large ensembles of particles--they dont really make sense for individual molecules.</p>
<p>For example, the pressure of a gas is based on its molecules colliding with each other. If you have only one molecule, it doesn't have anything to collide with for pressure to make sense. You can talk about things like kinetic and potential energy of that individual molecule, but not thermodynamic quantities like pressure and temperature, which are ensemble quantities.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>You can define temperature for individual molecules.  The more complex case invokes temperature to describe an ensemble, in which the temperature corresponds to the probability distribution of the particles energy.</p>
<p>The less complex case is a molecule big enough that it has a thermodynamic number of degrees of freedom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd argue that a certain number of molecules is required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The terms &quot;solid&quot;, &quot;liquid&quot;, and &quot;gas&quot; all refer to properties/behaviors that a substance exhibits. For example, solids are incompressible and have fixed shape. More specifically, water will form a crystalline, ordered structure that we call &quot;ice&quot;. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's say we are at -10 C and 1 atm and look at a single water molecule. Based on the temperature and pressure, we would call that molecule an ice molecule. But does that actually bear any meaning? More specifically, we should ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does that single molecule exhibit incompressibility?  </li>
<li>Does it exhibit a fixed shape? </li>
<li>Are the molecule(s) arranged in an ordered, crystalline lattice?</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd argue that you either cannot answer these questions for a single molecule or that the questions are irrelevant for only a single molecule. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given that most of the properties that define &quot;solid&quot;, &quot;liquid&quot;, and &quot;gas&quot; are dependent on intermolecular forces of attraction between molecules, you'd need a certain amount of molecules for those forces to give rise to the relevant properties. What's the threshold required?  It will depend on the specific molecule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a little like asking when does traffic occur. Can you have traffic with only 1 car? Maybe. But traffic with only 1 car is nonsensical, nonexistent, or undefined. What about 2 cars? And so on. This isn't an exact analogy, but I think it gets the point across.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: fixed some grammar and wording.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Statistical thermodynamics was three strokes ago for me, but I'm not exactly sure how pressure or temperature would even be defined for the one molecule.</p>
<p>Pressure is a measure of the forces of atoms bouncing off the partition function, if memory serves, or the integrated effect of that bouncing off a container wall, because for me that's easier to think of than a partition function. </p>
<p>And although a lot of people like to transform change in entropy = dQ / T, I always preferred to think of it as temperature = dQ / dS, i.e. temperature is a measurement of the energy required to make an equivalent amount of disorder, or something along those lines.</p>
<p>I suppose both can be called 'still defined' for one molecule, but the pressure is only a 'single' value for a bulk of gases because the molecules have very similar velocities, or close enough to not matter very much, and there's gazillions of them so the angle one molecule hits the wall at doesn't matter.  For one molecule, I think that breaks down a bit, no?  Maybe it's still moving fast enough that there's no difference, but I'm still less than completely confident we know what temperature and pressure really mean for one atom or one molecule.</p></div>		</li>

<p>he meant the system, at STP -10 C, the water <em>should</em> be a solid, but a single molecule is like you stated, not really defined by those.</p></div>		</li>
