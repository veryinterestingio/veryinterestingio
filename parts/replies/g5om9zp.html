Eminent domain is for cases like: we want to build a railway, and your house is the only one that won't sell to us. Sorry dude, you lost the vote, you have to sell us part of your property so we can make the railway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's still a case of &quot;sorry dude, you have to sell your land to us&quot;. They still have to pay for the land, so obviously they'd rather pay for the cheaper land. Sucks for the people living in those neighbourhoods... but I can't really argue against it. It's just logical to bulldoze cheap stuff instead of expensive stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately it is cheaper to plow through lower income housing. Construction costs rise massively if you try to build in a nice developed higher income area.</p>
<p>It really isn't even about the added power most rich will have (though that come into play still). But really the conversation ends quickly as it is much cheaper to buy up low income and bulldoze it.</p></div>		</li>
