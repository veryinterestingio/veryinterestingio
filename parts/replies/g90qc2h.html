			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, this helped me understand. I forgot that checking the spin collapses the wave function, which was causing the particles to be entangled in the first place. It's sad to think entangled particles are only one-use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to be clear: you cannot even send a single bit of information using entanglement. You have no control over which direction the spin is and there is no way to know if the particles are still entangled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard it described thusly by Gilles Brassard (coinventor of quantum cryptography) in his quantum computing class (yes, I am shamelessly name dropping :) )</p>
<p>You are teleporting the information, but it is encrypted. The only way to decrypt it is by receiving the key (a measure of the first electron spin) , that can only be sent via conventional means.</p>
<p>It is still useful because any evesdropper would only hear the key, and cannot do anything with it. Hence, quantum cryptography.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't this proposal for entanglement encryption mean though that, while no one could break the encryption and <em>steal</em> the data, any attempt to steal it would still corrupt the data irrevocably and make it unreadable to <em>anyone</em> including the intended recipient? Since the attempt to observe the spin would change it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is correct. It is impossible to intercept the transmission of the entangled particles, measure spin, and retransmit because an interceptor should not know which direction to measure the spin. Measuring spin in the wrong axis gives random results not entangled with the sender's particles stream.</p>
<p>Just as in virtually every communication system in use today, there are checks for packet corruption, and protocols to retransmit corrupt packets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is basically a quantum denial of service attack. Sure you can't decrypt the data, but you can continually intercept and destroy it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it just the two axes that you can measure along, or are we talking an infinite number of degrees? If it's just x/y, couldn't you technically guess the axis and have a 50/50 shot at getting the right one?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>You can't <em>set</em> the spin of an entangled particle. Any way you try to do that, you'll just break the entanglement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But then, doesn't that break some spin conservation law? Or would the act of changing the spin include/result in some third particle changing its spin for conservation's sake?</p></div>		</li>
