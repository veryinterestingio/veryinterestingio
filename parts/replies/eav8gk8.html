			<div class="markdown"><p>1) Ketones. </p>
<p>2) not enough water, bacteria feasting on the sugar you ate but didn’t wash off. </p>
<p>3) tonsilar crypts, with tonsilliths. </p>
<p>4) sinus drainage from post nasal drip exacerbated from the previous meal. </p>
<p>Get checked for diabetes.</p>
<p>Brush your teeth, and your tongue ( the back part of the tongue too ) after every meal. </p>
<p>Drink water, not sugary drinks (this includes milk)</p>
<p>Gargle warm salt water (as whatever the best internet source says—I grew up being told 5-10 minutes after brushing your teeth) to remove phlegm and tonsillithes.</p>
<p>If you are doing carnivore or keto diet, it’s keto making it smell.  </p>
<p>Put down the fucking pastrami, curry, onion, garlic... seriously if you can smell someone eating it from across the room, we can smell you from across the room. </p></div>		</li>
