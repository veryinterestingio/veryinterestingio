			<div class="markdown"><p>But did you report it? That plats a roll too, plenty of people wont report and some would think that having almost no symptoms (but still some) is not worth reporting either. In my country the reporting seems to be mostly done by caretakers and if i hadn't been so tired on the 2nd day after i would just have pushed through and not called in sick (1 day is ok without doctor's attest here), which in turn would have left out another report in our system. One with non dangerous side effects but that still cost me 1.5 days of work time, not counting the half day i thought i was going to be fine but definitely wasn't in hindsight.</p></div>		</li>
