			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. It's literally just a series of anonymous posts on 4chan and now other sites. This person with 'q clearance' is referred to as Q, but anyone can post claiming to be Q or passing along a message from Q. There is a lot of noise around this, and whole communities analyze what might be a 'legitimate qdrop' or someone pretending to be Q.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, they’ve left “coded messages” that are literally just keysmash (meaning they can’t truly be encrypted text since the letters in encrypted text would occur with random frequency). <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/swiftonsecurity/status/1029218289657016320?lang=en" target="_blank">https://mobile.twitter.com/swiftonsecurity/status/1029218289657016320?lang=en</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the *chan websites, posts are made anonymously by default, so &quot;anon&quot; is the name used to refer to a poster. If a poster needs to be uniquely identified, a notable quality about their post is prepended to it. The anon with Q level security clearance is called Qanon.</p>
<p>If you made a post about how you did something dumb, you might be called &quot;dumbanon&quot;</p></div>		</li>

I’m pretty convinced these are the same people who send money to Nigerian princes and are still expecting their paycheck any day now...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, I'm pretty sure these exact people aren't too interested in helping a <em>Nigerian</em> prince...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And, you know, early Christianity. Trump is the new Messiah and Biden/the Clintons are the new Satan, and Trump will lead the forces of good against the forces of evil in a final battle and usher in a golden age, etc. etc.</p>
<p>As someone who studied history in college and was always fascinated by how quickly and thoroughly Christianity spread throughout Europe, watching how easily mass amounts of people get duped into this QAnon shit (even family members of mine, I'm embarrassed to say), it totally makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When Revelations said the apocalypse would be ushered in by the sound of 7 trumpets, we must have misinterpreted. There are 7 members of the Trump family: Don, Melania, Don jr., Eric, Ivanka, Tiffany, and Baron. Clearly the apocalypse will be ushered in by the sound of 7 Trumps. Once we hear from Barron, it’ll be all over I bet. Can I turn this into the next conspiracy? It would be nice to rake in some ad revenue for my website I’m gonna make for it.</p></div>		</li>
