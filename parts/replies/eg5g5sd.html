			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually very cool. So there are two neuronal lobes, the α/β and the gamma (γ) lobes. For vinegar/fruit flies where the nervous system has been well studied, the γ lobes are formed embryonically prior to the first instar, while the α/β lobes are formed just before pupation at the third instar. So there are three instars in these flies before pupating. It's known that the γ lobes are reduced before pupating while the α/β lobes remain intact throughout metamorphosis. The moths used in this experiment, however, have 5 instars. Given that this lobe development works the same way in moths, the reduction of the γ lobes should occur during the third instar and birth of the α/β lobes should occur at the fifth instar. Basically, the reduction and birth of the two lobes are more separated in time than in flies. This would mean that memory training at the third instar of moths would not result in memory retention after becoming adults since the memory was stored in the γ lobes before they were reduced. However, the memory should be retained in the FIFTH instar since the memory is stored in the α/β lobes that formed before pupation and remained intact throughout adulthood. The scientists found exactly these results.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to Google instar. The definition I found was, &quot;a phase between two periods of moulting in the development of an insect larva or other invertebrate animal.&quot; </p>
<p>Does that mean that some caterpillars shed their skin several times and then grow new skin before building a cocoon? In high school, we were taught that only insects without a larval stage do that. It sounds like my teacher was wrong. How does this really work?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not really sure what your teacher's saying. Almost every insect sheds their skin when going to the next instar. What they do is shed their old cuticle to free the new one under it to grow properly. After some time, they then shed again to go to the next instar, usually larger than before and sometimes with additional features as well. The one's that don't are weird exceptions that will separate old and new layers of &quot;skin&quot;, but not actually shed it, so they have just have multiple layers of old skin piled on top of it, which again is a really weird exception. When larvae are at their final instar, they will shed their skin to become a pupa, or build a cocoon before shedding and then shed to make the pupa (the cocoon and the pupa are separate things). When the ones that don't become larvae, and are often <strong>nymphs</strong> instead of larvae, will just shed their skin on their final instar to immediately become the adult <strong>without making a pupa or cocoon</strong>. I think the confusion here is that the one's without larval stages still shed their skin, but just don't form the pupa or cocoon.</p></div>		</li>
