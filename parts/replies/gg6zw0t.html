			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotal evidence here, but I got a Prince Albert about 10 years ago, but mostly stopped wearing it when I realized that the real world isn’t porn and a metal ball at the end of an above average length tool is like shooting a pellet gun directly at your partner’s cervix. Now I have an extra hole on the bottom, and I get no velocity unless I very tightly cover second hole. On the plus side, I can pee out of the bottom of my dick! Still waiting on the situation that will call for this unique skill set, so I can do my best Liam Neeson.</p></div>		</li>
