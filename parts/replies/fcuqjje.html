			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I hijack this thread to ask you a question?? I recently found out I have small non-obstructing kidney stones on both kidneys. My GP doesn’t think it’s a big deal and won’t refer me to a specialist.  Should I be concerned and push for more analysis?? Anything I can do to minimize the agonizing pain that’s likely to come in the near (or distant) future? Thx so much for any additional info you can provide!</p></div>		</li>
