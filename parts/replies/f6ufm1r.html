			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually would like to know more about this tech. From what I'm reading on the Wikipedia page, this looks a lot like what Fitbit and Apple are advertised as doing with their products, but I'm almost certain those watches are not using this technology, and are instead using way primeative versions of this concept. </p>
<p>Am I wrong in that assessment? Is the actigraphy tech just too expensive for consumer electronic devices? I'm really intrigued by this...</p></div>		</li>

<p>This seems to show the Apple Watch being pretty reliable compared to clinically approved actigraphy devices.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apple doesn’t tend to fool around with the Apple Watch. They’ve invested heavily in the product to make it a true health companion and this report validates that. This being said, Apple has now gone through 6 revisions of the Apple Watch and they still don’t have native sleep tracking, instead relying on third party developers to provide apps (AutoSleep, SleepWatch etc).</p></div>		</li>
