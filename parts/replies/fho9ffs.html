			<div class="markdown"><p>They've studied preindustrial subsistence farmers in Africa too and women there menstruated a lot less often, due to worse nutrition.<br />
(though note that hunter-gatherers tend to be less chronically malnourished than preindustrial farmers.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like your comment may be the most revealing here when it comes to potential reasons for a monthly cycle. If carrying a baby to term is already hard enough with a long gestation period, and resources are scarce, to procreate women need to be ready to go as soon as there is a boon in nutrition.</p>
<p>Nomadic tribes or cultures that lived through cycles of food availability likely benefited from menses that depended on their situation being conducive to having kids.  Less resources lost when times are tough and more when times are good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference is that an agricultural population is able to store and ration food so they just about survive a bad year.<br />
Hunter gatherers, on the other hand, will just starve.<br />
So it's a very plush lifestyle 99% of the time and death the other 1%. </p>
<p>This also means that hunter-gatherers don't butt up against malthusian limits as strongly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s true in non-hunter-gatherer societies as well. Some pro-lifers use lactation as a form of birth control. It’s more effective than none, but not that effective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The baby suckling causes an increase in prolactin which prevents ovulation. It’s a hormone that is high in pregnancy.
There are so many variables that it’s not a reliable method of contraception, even when studies show with perfect use it is effective. If someone has a baby that is an efficient eater and empties the breast’s in 20 minutes and is satiated, then that may not be enough suckling to increase the prolactin. There needs to be comfort nursing, nursing around the clock every 4-6 hours maximum time between feedings.</p></div>		</li>
