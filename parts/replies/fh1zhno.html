			<div class="markdown"><p>There really aren't any lead acid batteries at the sizes used in remote controls. They are almost always alkaline or lithium based. There are zinc carbon ones too. But no liquid based ones that I have ever seen. And I doubt that agitation would have much effect on anything not liquid based. </p>
<p>I'm open to having my mind changed though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a quick Google and there don't seem to be any acid based AAA batteries.
There's a table in this wiki article.
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA_battery" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA_battery</a>
Lead acid is really only used in vehicle batteries because of their weight.<br />
Some of the battery types can use a paste, but that's usually  zinc chloride and really too thick to be shaken about like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup you're right, its more the terminals getting fresh contact when you smack it (also works when you just spin the batteries in place)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotal evidence, but taking out AAA batteries and hitting them has brought them back to life for a short time for me before. It's been a while since I've tried this method though, so not sure if they were acid or alkaline at the time (certainly not lithium). The effect was minimal, and for continued use I'd have to repeat the process quite often.</p>
<p>Edit: also, it certainly wasn't due to taking it out and putting them back in cleaning the terminals. I'd do this long enough that the terminals should've been polished clean and it would still work.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I noticed kids in Zambia doing this years ago, their batteries were really dented and battered. I've tried it since and it seems to work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I used to warm them up.  If you try it again, do a control where you just take them out and replace them to see if the hitting does any good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Take a brand new alkaline battery and drop it.  Then take a dead one and drop it.  The dead one will bounce.  There is a chemical reaction that occurs inside which makes it lighter.  Notice also that there are vents on batteries which act to allow gasses to escape to prevent them from exploding if you discharge them too fast or some other critical failure.  Shaking the battery could possibly just loosen some of the particulate matter inside and cause the reaction to work for a little longer.</p></div>		</li>
