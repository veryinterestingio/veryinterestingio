<p>Is there a civil protection reg or something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it's too far of a reach to sue them. Sueing someone you need to have evidence that you were directly harmed by the person. </p>
<p>A good example is someone doesn't mow their lawn and property values drop. You cant sue the guy into taking care of his lawn so there are laws that do it for you. </p>
<p>It's also noted that contamination is quite uncontrollable as anyone could just dump shit into the water. If anything the main grower might sue the contaminator instead. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s no duty of care to a unrelated third party. You may have damaged but there’s no corresponding obligation. I don’t think. I’m a Canadian lawyer so that may or may not be true in the US.</p>
<p>Edit: just realized I’m in ELI5: It’s as if you’re the stinky kid in your elementary school class and the teacher came in and smelled you but assumed the whole class needed a bath. Your parents are liable for not bathing you but don’t owe any obligations to the other kids who were unfairly punished for their negligence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be awarded money damages, you must:</p>
<p>1.) Prove that some specific person / entity's action or inaction caused you a loss, and</p>
<p>2.) Be able to pinpoint a reasonably precise dollar amount of the loss.</p>
<p>It's the second requirement that a lot of claims fail.  It's not enough to say &quot;I had to mulch a bunch of lettuce that should have been worth $10,000.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This sounds a lot harder than it is.  The US music and movie industry has a history of suing individuals for millions of dollars, with the logic that every single time the individual's computer shared a piece of pirated media, the industry was losing one sale at retail price.</p>
<p>A reasonable person knows that people download all kinds of crap they already own in order to play it in a different format, or stuff that they never even watched or listened to, and wouldn't have even considered purchasing at any cost.</p>
<p>And the courts have accepted these as reasonable damages to pursue in litigation.</p>
<p>But, yeah, your #1 point is more apropos.  They must prove they have standing to sue, and they probably can't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just that someone caused you a loss, but in this case you'd also have to show a duty of care. A lettuce farmer does not have a duty to farm in a responsible way to all those who have money invested lettuce, but only to certain people, like his neighbors, his customers, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's usually more criteria, with the specific wording depending on the legal system.</p>
<ul>
<li>The action must generally have some form of illegitimacy. </li>
</ul>
<p>E.g. Adam is filming a movie in his garden. During a scene, Bob walks by on the sidewalk in a chicken costume. Bob must not cover the cost of retaking the scene, because it's not illegitimate to walk on sidewalks in chicken costumes.</p>
<ul>
<li>There must be a reasonable connection between the illegitimate act and the outcome.</li>
</ul>
<p>E.g. Adam bet $100 that a plane will land on time. Bob doesn't know about this, and causes the plane to be delayed. Bob might be forced to cover the cost of the delay, but not Adam's loss.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope.  Not an official USDA recall.  Look at the USDA beef recalls - they all have the offending company and location, affected dates, affected product lot numbers.</p>
<p>This was a CDC alert, which only said, don't sell or eat romaine because people are getting sick.  The government did this on the Tuesday or Wednesday before Thanksgiving without tracing the source of the problem and left to start their holidays.  </p>
<p>Anyone with inventory on hand was screwed.  The insurance companies are not paying the growers loss claims.  The growers are not honoring credits to their distributors.  Those distributors either eat the loss or lose a customer by forcing the loss upon their customers.  </p></div>		</li>
