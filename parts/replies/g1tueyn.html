			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add to this that modern jet engines have become very reliable and usually are overpowered to an extent.</p>
<p>Jet engines haven't always been this reliable, such that until the mid 80's a two-engines plane wasn't allowed to cross an ocean, but four engines would be cost inefficient for smaller planes. Because of it they came up with 3-engine planes with one sitting in the back below the tail fin and its air intake on top of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some additional ratings and certifications necessary to fly a two engine plane over the ocean, though. Including having places within reason to stop the plane should an engine fail. </p>
<p>There’s a pretty interesting YouTube video on it, I tried to find it but I'm not sure if I did or not. This is what I found: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amyTW7ld9qo" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amyTW7ld9qo</a></p>
<p>It's a good video about tri-jets and touches on what you mentioned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well most Operational trijets just do like the Dc-10 and slap it on the rudder. None of the convoluted over under BS. The higher engine itself too was over all a much better design, better line of thrust, easier to maintain, more structurally sound, etc. Which is why the dc-10, and md-11 are pretty much the only trijets that's survived in any functional capacity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, this is known as trimming and is essentially locking in small adjustments to your control surfaces to maintain level flight without having to constantly manage the controls.</p>
<p>This is how single prop fighter planes from WW2  could maintain level flight in long convoys without the pilots becoming extremely fatigued!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also fun fact, torque rolling is what happens when you slam the throttle open and the engine spins up before your velocity increases enough for airflow over the control surfaces to compensate, and the plane rolls over. Dunno how much it affects jet engines but prop planes with a lot of power have to be careful.</p></div>		</li>
