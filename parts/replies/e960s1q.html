			<div class="markdown"><p>A Democratic Congress could impeach Trump, but that alone doesn't remove him from office. It would require 50% of the House to agree to impeach the President, which means to accuse him of crimes such that he should be removed if found guilty.</p>
<p>What would happen next is that there would be a trial in the Senate. If 2/3 of the Senate votes the President guilty, then he is removed from office.</p>
<p>The 2/3 requirement of the Senate is what might prevent the Congress from trying to impeach him. They might decide there's no point in doing it if they don't have the votes to remove him. Only twice in the nation's history has a President been impeached and both times the Senate found him not guilty.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And those two Presidents for the record were </p>
<p>Andrew Johnson - for violating the Tenure of Office act by dismissing his Secretary of War while congress was out of session, and then refusing to abide by Congress' decision to overturn that decision when they returned</p>
<p>Bill Clinton - For obstruction of justice and lying under oath with regards to the Monica Lewinsky affair.</p>
<p>Richard Nixon on the other hand resigned while impeachment proceedings were under way due to the Watergate affair and he would certainly have been impeached for it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Impeached and convicted, to be fair. He was on his way out no matter what</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From an outside perspective: say whatever you will about the guy, but has Trump even done anything that they could accuse him of, that would actually constitute an offense worthy of impeachment?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's really no concrete standard of what constitutes an impeachable offense. The Constitution says &quot;high crimes and misdemeanors&quot; but interpretations vary widely of just what that entails. In the end it's basically whatever Congress decides, which unfortunately can make it pretty political.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that what constitutes worthy is defined as &quot;High Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot;. So if a president issues an executive order that gets determined to be unconstitutional that COULD be grounds. Thats why there is a trial the house has to prove to the senate that the president is guilty. </p>
<p>And thats the other part there is only one punishment. Removal from office. The senate cant find guilty and censure or take any other action. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Some have implied that a democratic Congress could impeach Trump, I'm not sure if that's realistic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s not realistic. As terrible as Trump is, there is not (yet) really an ironclad reason to remove him from office. There are like 500 national elections happening today, and the number of Democrats who actually mention impeachment in their campaigns is single digits. </p>
<p>The impeachment talking point is just a big red herring designed to motivate voter turnout (on both sides) and is mostly based in people not really understanding what it means to impeach an elected official: Removal from office is a second step that has to done <em>after</em> a successful impeachment, and has <em>never</em> been done to a sitting president. Andrew <del>Jackson</del> Johnson (oops) and Bill Clinton were both impeached, but not removed from office. Richard Nixon was never even impeached, he resigned.</p>
<p>The real question of what the midterms mean for the US is a lot less sensational: Bills need to pass the House of Representatives and Senate and be signed into law by the President. If one of the chambers of Congress goes to the Democrats, it will be harder for Republicans to pass far-right laws because at least <em>some</em> Democrats will need to sign off on any new laws.</p></div>		</li>

<p>An impeachable offence — and the evidentiary standard — is whatever Congress wants it to be. While it's still <em>highly unlikely</em> that Trump would get impeached before the special counsel's report, it's not totally unrealistic either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not impossible, but I personally wouldn’t hold my breath waiting on impeachment unless more solid evidence comes forward (which may or not be inbound soon, depending on what’s going on with Mueller.) Especially if what appears to be the more likely scenario comes to pass, and Congress is split after today’s election.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Democrats could lower the standard, but not without significant cost. Almost all Republicans (and many Democrats) would be unhappy about using dubious claims for impeachment, especially since the Republicans could then do the same to them whenever they're in power again (it always goes in cycles).</p>
<p>Unless there's strong evidence for it, it's easier to just wait him out.</p></div>		</li>
