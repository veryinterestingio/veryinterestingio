			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it as a chemical chain reaction. Picture the &quot;parent&quot; molecule as a puzzle piece that has slots for other molecules and atoms. As the parent molecule floats around in its soup it bumps into all sorts of other materials. Eventually those materials get trapped in the puzzle-piece slots until the parent molecule is twice its original size. Then it breaks apart into halves, and is replicated. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some very simple molecules can form with a structure that provides a template that attracts matching minerals which then snap together to form a new chain and break off, thus creating a mirror-pair which itself goes and makes another mirror-pair that is just like the original. This is a 100% natural physical process that just happens. However, it only works with very simple molecules, once they get bigger they just break apart under their own stresses. It's like building a giant LEGO tower, but only one brick thick. Once you get too tall it will just fall over and break apart under its own weight.</p>
<p>The question has always been, how do you get bigger than the limit of these natural replicators? One of the problems in nature is that you'd need a very protected environment for these replicators to even come close to their maximum complexity, and a &quot;mineral soup&quot; would not work. This article suggests rock formations could be the protected space where this happened naturally.</p>
<p>Still, it's unclear how complexity can increase enough to form what we think of as RNA without help.  All the RNA in our cells survive and replicate only with the help of special enzymes that grab and snap the right pieces together or hold them there so they don't break. These enzymes are manufactured by the RNA in our cells itself, so how could have RNA evolved before the enzymes that it needs to survive?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't watched the Nova documentary yet, but I read a bunch of articles and discussions regarding this theory over the years. This comment assumes a very basic knowledge of physics, chemistry, and biology: </p>
<p>What is particularly interesting is that DNA analysis points towards life evolving from &quot;extremophile&quot; single-celled organisms that inhabit the thin areas around hydrothermal vents, surrounded by cold ocean water (specifically the plausibly most ancient DNA hinted at a sulfur-based analogy of the oxygen based Kreb cycle, where there is an input of energy, you start from a molecule, go in a circle, get something new that helps the cycle, and repeat the cycle without losing the original catalyst). The massive hot/cold gradient is extremely attractive from a thermodynamic perspective, because there is a huge energy gradient, which generally enables work (in a physics sense) that is necessary to go from from low complexity to high complexity. A rough analogy is that a combustion engine needs a high temperature reservoir and a low temperature reservoir to turn thermal energy into potential energy. In particular, large, probably RNA, molecules need to form, and these molecules are not an an energetic minimum; energy is released when the molecules break apart. An input of energy is required to bring them together. Furthermore, these molecules are in an unstable energetic equilibrium, which means that they are in a small valley at the top of a large hill. </p>
<p>Thermal energy helps to bring these molecules to the top of the hill, and helps them smash through the activation barrier, but it also breaks the molecules apart, but if these molecules are created, someplace hot, then exist someplace colder, and they can still diffuse form the cold place to the hot place, the molecule itself can be both long lived, and self-replicate. </p>
<p>Why is clay so important and so attractive? It's because clay forms in layers, with water in between,that act as a poor man's cell membrane. If this broad theory is correct, life originated and evolved in a very unique and special thermal-vent environment. The ideal environment is one in which a large (probably RNA) molecule was produced in a hot layer of clay, which soon became a cold layer, because these vents are always growing, and every hot layer becomes a cold layer. The molecule persists, and then diffuses to through the clay membrane to a hot layer and self replicates. The self-replicated molecule soon inhabits a cold layer, before it breaks apart, as new layers of clay or formed above, fed by the minerals and elements from the vent. But, it can still diffuse to the hot layer, and start the cycle all over again.</p>
<p>The other critical aspect of clay membranes, is that they serve what some people think is the primary advantage of cell membranes: the rate of rare chemical reactions are exponentially sped up if the volume in which the reaction occurs is very small. If you need molecule A and molecule B to come together to form molecule AB, and there is only one of each molecule in a huge volume of water, it probably won't happen. If two molecules are together in a very small volume (between clay-layer membranes, or inside a lipid cell membrane) they will almost certainly come together to form molecule AB. For the quasi-stable molecule AB to persist, high temperature should be present to bring them together, but to stick together, very cold temperatures are ideal. In Darwin's surface pond of primordial soup, the chances of this event happening repeatedly and indefinitely are very small. In a vent producing energy-gradient after volume-constrained energy gradient, the conditions are as close to the optimal conditions as yet imagined by humans.</p>
<p>The final clue to abiogenesis goes beyond RNA-world and hydrothermal vent hypotheses. That is, in the 1990's chemists learned that RNA and DNA molecular components are ideal self-replicators. That is, there are many, many molecules based on close chemical variants of A, T, C, G, and U that will spontaneously turn a chemical soup composed of their components into the original components. There is an old Scientific American article out there that describes the seminal research. A grad student studied a variant of a base pair component, did mass spectrometry on the solution it was in, and was shocked to learn that the molecule had converted almost the entire solution to itself. These were called synthetic self-replicating molecules. When two of these molecules meet, the stick together. Two more of these molecules form on the backs of the original molecule, then they break apart because of thermal perturbations (like being in a hot layer, not a freezing cold layer). Then, after they break apart, they repeat the process. Since chemistry is ultimately stochastic, mistakes are made. Almost all of the known synthetic self-replicating molecules were formed via an evolutionary process. Take the original molecules, put them in a new soup, check the soup, find it's mostly a new molecule that more efficiently self-replicates, put it in a new soup, rinse, and repeat. Some of these molecules don't make mistakes, and are evolutionary dead ends. But, but the best self-replicators, evolved form the originally discovered synthetic self-replicating molecules.</p>
<p>Why is this important? It is important because to form an RNA-based ribozyme (RNA enzyme), the ideal conditions are soup in a very small volume that is filled with RNA components. </p>
<p>Today, all RNA is right handed. Some day, it is very plausible that an experiment will be conducted under conditions in which right-handed RNA bases eventually form new, right-handed life. What is required is an input of energy, a cold place, the basic required atoms, and small chemical reaction volumes. Hydrothermal vents check all of the boxes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the reply. That's very interesting. Would you say that it's possible the earliest form of life could  actually be those creatures and other organisms living near said vents, at the bottom of the Ocean? I mean, the Ocean wasn't that deep billions of years ago. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I'm not a scientist but what that documentary was saying was that it was possible that life formed through minerals. I forgot a lot so I'd probably have to watch it again, what I did remember was really interesting... That there are more minerals now due to life then there were before life started.</p></div>		</li>
