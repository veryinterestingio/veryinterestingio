			<div class="markdown"><p>FYI: The term 'liberal' does NOT mean liberation. It refers to classical liberalism. Or the 'liberty' and 'freedom' movement. There's also a religious freedom and laissez-faire element here. Think a lot of the American mindset in revolutionary days on philosophical level. Not all of it was anti monarch. It was pro-rights/people having individual freedoms. <strong>That's classic liberalism</strong> (or as policy wonks call it little L). These views which led to the US revolution, the french revolution are derived from intellectual scholars including Paine, Adam Smith, Tocqueville, Thomas Jefferson just to name a few. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the top comment is correct with regards to the origin of &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; from the seating positions in the French National Assembly and the respective opposition to and support of the monarchy <em>at that time</em>.</p>
<p>The &quot;liberalism&quot; definition is in some ways a distinct issue from that, and messier to settle, so you're right to discuss that in greater detail, but this is ELI5, after all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>because folks don't understand history or know history. another problem is that during Ancient Regime prior to the revolution there was Estats-General. Made up of members of the 3 estates. From what i read, the concept of left vs right started here but the term wouldn't be adopted until the creation of the nat'l assembly after the first phase of the revolution. It's significant b/c this is the body that created the 'declaration of the rights of man'. The 'liberals' walked out of the event to the tennis court at Versailles and wrote what is considered one of the most significant political documents ever written. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting to note that whereas in the rest of the world the concept of &quot;left&quot; was taken over by the working class movement, in most of the Americas such movement never took place (or wasn't big enough, or was harshly repressed) so the definition of left in those places is still that of the 18th century (=Americans equating liberalism with leftism).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the movement definitely happened in the US, it was just suppressed ultimately. There was a huge workers rights movement, mainly.led by prominent anarchists and communists, in the later 1800s. </p>
<p>But somewhere along the line it stopped at that, they had broken into the political sphere but never really gained the same respect. anti-union sentiments and later the red scare made sure it stayed that way and completely dissolved support for any workers party.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wasn't there a quote along the lines of &quot;Socialism never took off in america because the poor don't consider themselves poor, they're just temporarily embarrassed millionaires?&quot;</p>
<p>Basically much of america's working class doesn't want to support laws that limit an employers ability to get rich off of dicking over their employees because they're all hoping that one day they'll get to be the rich employer doing the dicking over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not entirely true. The actual working class has leaned towards Democrats, supported unions, etc. Not every single one but overall. If you include higher paid professionals as working class, that starts to change things as they become more economically centrist and right. </p>
<p>It's just recently where more seem to be supporting Trump and that's partly due to Democrats and also Trump being a good salesman to certain groups, saying what they want to hear and making them believe he can make it happen. The Democrats are at fault for moving towards the right (in terms of economic policies, not social, &quot;Third Way&quot;) in the 90s and onward, leading to a lot of the working class to lose faith in them. I think that's finally coming to an end, but they're not fully out of that yet. </p>
<p>The bigger issue is the rural poor though. They overwhelmingly remain staunchly Republican no matter how much they get fucked. See the election map of the US and all of that red is mostly rural areas. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just that. The anti socialist program rheteric in America is insane. Socialist programs (universal healthcare, free education, unions, etc) are compared to communist Russia/China and Canada/European countries that already have these things are ignored. </p>
<p>You literally have conservatives in America who talk about moving to Canada or some other more liberal country if a liberal policy that already exist in that country is passed as if it would be better for them.</p></div>		</li>
