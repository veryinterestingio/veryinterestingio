			<div class="markdown"><p>Again, to be pedantically accurate, this isn't the magnet &quot;losing power&quot; per se. It is a decay of the physical structure itself. You might as well ask whether the Sun will ever lose its gravity. Well, no, gravity doesn't get used up any more than magnetism does, but the structure and mass of the Sun changes over time, and that will affect its gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not how it works. Under a certain level of thermal energy, there's just not enough to create any long lasting changes, not even in billions of years or more. Look at zircon crystals formed 4.5 billion years ago, they're just as new</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Afaik most computer Hard drives use neodymium magnets and they're always 'sealed' so not a perfect vacuum but definitely sealed from the outside. Only a couple of years ago some of the manufacturers started using Helium but mainly to benefit the data density and lower the drag on the disk thus requiring less power to spin them. </p>
<p>The magnets in these always survive longer than the drives themselves, which usually is at least 3 years before they die depending on the use. This might be because the magnet doesn't actually have much function other than balancing the reading arm. So they cancel eachother out in most designs. So in theory if they degraded at the same level it's not going to matter.</p>
<p>There have been some cases with old IBM harddrives that had magnetic degradation which caused small particles to hit the drives. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hard drives are sealed, but absolutely not a vacuum. The read/write head relies on moving air to keep floating just above the disc surface. Newer models have however started using helium because of its lower density.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The magnets in a hard drive don't balance the read arm, they're secured to the enclosure. The read arm has a coil on one end that moves between the magnets. Current in the coil pushes or pulls against the magnets, causing the arm to rotate and move the head across the disks. Although the magnets don't degrade in a timescale meaningful to a hard drive, slight degradation would result in the same amount of current in the coils causing less acceleration, causing the arm to move slower. This type of voice coil actuation is closed-loop so it will still work, but at with an increse of seek time and corresponding decrees in performance.</p>
<p>You <em>could</em> have physical/chemical degradation of the platter surface resulting in data corruption because the reduced strength of the magnetized zones representing ones and zeros aren't creating a strong enough signal in the read head. It's magnetic layer is microscopic and many platters are made of glass or aluminum. Head crashes have nothing to do with the strength of the magnets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We need to amend the first statement of this, claiming that the only way to demagnitize is chemical in nature only. If we're considering bulk magnetic properties, we need to consider the so called &quot;demagnitization field&quot; generated by the material itself. Through magnetic affects alone, a magnet can and will demagnitize itself, see: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagnetizing_field" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagnetizing_field</a></p>
<p>There are configurations used top limit this affect (see RKKY configuration), but they are not perfect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, what are you trying to say? isn't the magnetic susceptibility a material/chemical property? If you don't change the susceptibility you're not weakening the magnet. Also, I'm sure you know this, but the demagnetizing field doesn't demagnetize a magnet with time, and doesn't physically exist. It's just a useful trick for calculations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of magnetism and gravity as the <em>shape</em> of the universe being affected in ways that are not... intuitive.

			<div class="markdown"><p>No more than jumping and letting the Earth pull you back down causes it to lose gravitational power. It’s a fundamental force of the universe, it doesn’t wind down on the atomic scale and get used up, and since it’s just a function of organisation on the atomic scale whether you observe it on the macroscopic scale there’s no “transfer” of magnetic power - you’re just rearranging the metal bar so it’s magnetic.</p>
<p>I figure that the force acting on repelling magnets is generally low enough that nothing should happen. But in a very high field, you can reverse the magnetisation - that’s exactly how a hard drive works, magnetic platters than can be written to with magnets (and why you never bring a magnet near a computer).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no. you're just taking advantage of the magnetic field that is being generated by your magnet. that magnet is generating the same field whether you have the metal bar there or not. the field is what causes the bar to become magnetized. </p>
<p>second question: it could. it depends on the strength of the interactions that reinforce the moments (the &quot;coercive field&quot;. if you magnetize an iron bar with a neodynium magnet, and then push the opposite poles of the bar and the magnet together, you'll demagnetize the bar, because they now want to align with the new field you've created. an Nd magnet can demagnetize some of the more common magnetic alloys. it's very material dependant </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So say you had two magnets of the same shape/size/material and forced repelling poles together, would both magnets experience degradation in their fields?  And would both eventually become demagnetized or would there eventually be some sort of equilibrium point?  Or would there be some sort of structural damage to the magnets?</p></div>		</li>
