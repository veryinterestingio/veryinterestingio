			<div class="markdown"><p>-OR-</p>
<p>You could get addicted to pursuing things because it’s fun to pursue them. The external goal being secondary to the internal success of completing a task. </p>
<p>Failure as motivation is the surest way to ensure that you eventually quit. It builds an association of pain and fear. It also means that you weren’t as focused on your task. Any time spent indulging the fear of failure is taking your eye off the ball as it were. </p>
<p>The part of you that wants to do something must be separate from the part of you that accepts credit, good or bad. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some one spoiled The Force Awakens for me in an article about the Indianapolis Colts. I had avoided most of the internet all day because I couldn't see it until Saturday. I went to the Indy Star's website to look up something about the Colts and the first comment was telling me who died.</p>
<p>I'd like to point out that I do not remember the specific topic of the article, but I am still angry about the death.</p>
<p>I think this is a fairly accurate summary of selective memory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sort of happened with me in the force awakens, a friend, whom i repeatedly asked not to say ANYTHING about it, ruined it by saying &quot;You really want to see the next one at the very end.&quot; </p>
<p>So, 30 mins into the movie, I realize, Luke isn't going to be in the movie. they show him at the end, and thats why you really want to see the next movie. FFS. Really people, dont say anything when a person hasnt seen the movie! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whenever someone says something to the effect of &quot;Not spoilers but...&quot; I immediately stop them because there's nothing they can say that I won't be thinking about before and during the movie.</p>
<p>It's like &quot;Not racist but...&quot;. If you have to start with a disclaimer, it's probably a spoiler.</p></div>		</li>
