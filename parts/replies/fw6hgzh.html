<p>Edit: I tried to give an oversimplified explanation and failed. Listen to the Taco guy below for a solid learning experience. I’m sorry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick correction here:<br />
There are different definitions of acids but the simplest one is Arrhenius' that states acids increase the concentration of H+ (and bases increase OH-). Acids aren't always positively charged. </p>
<p>Hydrogen (H) is the simplest element with just one proton and one electron, so when you have a hydrogen without an electron (H+), its just a proton. Proton pumps can also be called H+ pumps. And since these pumps are pumping more H+ into your stomach, they are acidifying your stomach. By inhibiting these pumps, you can reduce the acidity of your stomach juices.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Celebrex is the only one left on the market in the US now! It’s super interconnected because Cox-2 is actually cardio protective because it produces a prostaglandin derivative that has vasodilation proprieties while Cox-1 produces a molecule that causes clotting and vasoconstriction. So selective inhibition of only Cox-2 (or mainly Cox-2) actually up regulates Cox-1 and the cardio destructive pathway leading to increased risk of heart attacks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely! There are a ton of proton pumps throughout your cells. Probably some of the most important proton pumps are the complexes of the electron transport chain in your mitochondria. These create the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane that powers ATP synthase. </p>
<p>In addition to having specificity for gastric proton pumps, clinical PPI's are not well absorbed and have a short half life which keeps them from affecting other organs. This means that they only have a local effect on the pumps on your stomach epithelium which is exactly where they need to work. Pretty clever!</p>
<p>The major side effect of PPI's is stomach cancer which can be pretty scary. This is why PPI's are generally not prescribed if another therapeutic can be used. </p>
