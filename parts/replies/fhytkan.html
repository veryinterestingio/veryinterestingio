			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but those birds existed for 100s of thousands of years before walmart did. What did they do then, what strategies have they employed on an evolutionary scale to persist at the population scale? That is the essence of the question. Any ornithologists in this thread?</p></div>		</li>
