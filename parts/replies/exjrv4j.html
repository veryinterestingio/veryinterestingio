			<div class="markdown"><p>The worst one for me is the sound of something scraping ice. I also live in Canada.. going in the deep freeze for food is a game of operation for me, especially since styrofoam on ice is double bad. Can't scrape my windshield without almost dying and also when it gets to around 30 below the sound of crunching snow turns scratchy and drives me nuts. Haven't met anyone else who is similar yet, maybe a Redditor will agree with me.</p></div>		</li>
