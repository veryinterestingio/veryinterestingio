<p>What I have a problem with is plastics use in places where they could easily be something biodegradable, like say the containers my blueberries come in, I need that to last a few days, not years, or say a bag of chips is the same thing.</p>
<p>We need to find some short-term solutions to several problems where the properties of plastic are desirable such as being able to see through them or short term stability (like, wont fall apart immediately if it gets wet.)</p>
<p>I can't even fathom how much plastic is used worldwide for food packaging that could be replaced with biodegradable alternatives (granted a good chunk of it could be replaced with paper right now) as well as packaging in general, there is no need for an SD card to come in a 6&quot; square thick plastic box for example.</p>
<p>I'd also guess its possible to engineer plastics that can bio-degrade on a useful expected lifetime scale.  Like, the soles of my shoes don't need to be around for 5000 years, if they can degrade in say, 15-100 years that's just fine.  There is likely far more use for degradable plastics than you might think.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We've biodegradable bin liners. Better or worse than normal plastic bags?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, there are no biodegradable bin liners, only &quot;degradable&quot;.</p>
<p>For degradable bags, they do not &quot;naturally break down into organic components&quot;. Theres are basically plastic bags with a special chemical that lets them degrade into millions of tiny pieces of plastic, which hang around forever and eventually find their way into the fish you eat.</p>
<p>They are worse that standard plastic bags because standard bags at least mostly stay in one piece.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slowly releasing methane is good. It's supposed to happen. Wood and other living things decay. The problem is not that stuff releases it in general, but that we've released too much sequestered carbon. There is a natural amount of carbon production and sequestration and we've exceeded the sequestration by a huge amount. Bioplastics don't sequester carbon, but they are closer to neutral which is a step in the right direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think when most people think about biodegradable plastics they are thinking of single-use or few-use items like bags, forks, straws, water bottles, packaging, etc.  Like OP I have often wondered by biodegradable plastics are not more widely used for these applications.</p>
<p>Basically, if the GPGP was made up of biodegradable plastics it would be a non-issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't even need to be plastic.  Wax paper is biodegradable and perfectly useful for things like wrapping sandwiches.  Egg cartons are made of paper.  I made the switch to paper straws for home use and discovered I barely notice a difference.</p>
<p>The reason that it's not used in more application is cost, I suspect.  Egg cartons need to be a thicker material to protect the eggs, so cardboard is the most suitable.  Eggs also have reduced risk of leaking, unlike the fruits and vegetables that get sorted into plastic bins.  But wax paper is pretty good for stopping such leaks, so my assumption is that thin plastic is simply cheaper than heavily waxed cardboard for blueberries and sushi trays, with the added benefit of being clear to allow the consumer to inspect the contents.  Eggs can be safely opened and visually inspected, unlike a lot of other foods.</p></div>		</li>

<p>TLDR: it’s not completely about money, it’s about the chemistry. If you want an advanced society, you need to accept that fact that there will be persistent plastics that don’t grow in farms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strictly speaking we can use algae or w/e biosource to source hydrocarbon chains (e.g. butanols or ethanols), and then use conventional chemistry to synthesize these into the required petrochemicals.  It's a much harder and more expensive feed process compared to just pumping the hydrocarbons out of the ground though.  Much harder than trying to use the chemical components of the plants directly, though it would give you your pick of properties.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've done some work with bio-oils and while they are promising, I can't imagine them becoming a primary hydrocarbon source anytime soon. Algae is the most promising oil source, but oil-rich strains don't grow quickly in the sorts of environments that they need to for large scale farming and carvon capture. Biotech may allow us to create a fast-growing, oil-rich, acid-loving strain of algae, but even then there are a lot of issues with algae oil as a a feed stock. It requires a lot more processing because a lot of its oils are triglycerides and fatty acids which don't behave like the hydrocarbons found in petroleum. Further, I have some concerns with potential ecological risks associated with farming gene modified algae designed to be faster growing and more resilient. </p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of bio oils and biological feed stocks, but we aren't getting off petroleum anytime soon as the primary chemical precursor. In fact, I think we'll be using it for chemicals well past the point where we stop using it as a primary fuel.</p></div>		</li>
