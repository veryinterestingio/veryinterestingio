			<div class="markdown"><p>I was responsible for a lab accident in which I <em>almost</em> knocked myself out with chloroform. I was conducting experiments involving the addressing the optical states of nanoparticles, and the first step of this process was to get nanoparticles in solution. Chloroform worked great for suspending semiconductor nanoparticles,if simple stirring didn't get enough into solution, functionalizing the particles with polymers to remove their charge and make them functionally less dense did the trick. </p>
<p>However, I got ahold of some diamond nanoparticles, and at this time, there was very little in the literature regarding getting the beasties in solution was extremely hard to do, because they itsy bitsy diamond chunks held onto charges like grim death, accumulated into clumps made out of electric dipoles, and they would fall straight out of solution in visible conglomerations. None of the usual tricks worked. </p>
<p>Then my advisor suggested sonicating the diamond nanoparticles in chloroform. This means putting a very high power, very high pitched (ultrasonic) acoustic horn in a solution and blasting it with acoustic energy. I had only done this with water-based solutions, so I was a little apprehensive, but I had the goahead from my advisor, so why not try it?</p>
<p>As it turns out, sonicating ultra-hard diamond nanoparticles in chloroform for more than ten seconds can cause your usual sonicating jar to spontaneously break out in cracks, spraying chloroform throughout the tiny glass-windowed sonicating chamber. When I saw this, I completely freaked out, as chloroform in a really nasty chemical, and contaminating a sonicating chamber is a grievous sin. Without thinking, I turned off the horn grabbed a paper towel, and opened the glass window. </p>
<p>Inside the sonicating chamber, a good portion of the chloroform had been vaporized, and I was hit with a wave of a disgustingly sweet, noxious smell,  that I knew was very carcinogenic. I was wearing the usual lab attire, but my face mask would do nothing to stop vaporized chloroform. I swooned and hit the floor, completely dizzy, but still conscious. The small room was filled with vapor, and in another mistake, I had left the door closed. I felt like Johnny Depp looked in the Ether scenes of Fear and Loathing. I drunkenly crawled across the spinning/tilting room, and missed the door knob on my first attempt. I successfully opened the door, closed it, and posted guard for the next twenty minutes making sure no one else went in. Eventually one of my students walked by and I put her and guard duty and found the chemist I trusted most to help me spend the afternoon quietly cleaning up the room and sonicating chamber with proper gasmaks without filing an incident report. </p>
<p>tl;dr: getting hit with lots of chloroform is like being suddenly and extremely drunk. Walking is not a possibility, but I also didn't have loony-toones tunnel vision symptoms that I would usually associate with an impending blackout. Breathing chloroform is not a pleasant experience, and I wouldn't recommend it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What was the volume of chloroform in the sonicating chamber? Seems to me that it would've evaporated quite quickly and wouldn't have required gas masks for cleanup. Chloroform isn't edible and I wouldn't want to inhale a ton of it but it ain't methylmercury either. </p>
<p>As for sonicating small particles of an extremely hard substance in what I assume was borosilicate glass or at best quartz... not your advisor's best idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did research for many years. One day i was in the &quot;mouse room&quot; using isofluorane to anesthetize some mice. We had a special delivery system, but the hose wasn't connected properly. My lab mate and I got very light headed and knew something was wrong. We had to immediately leave until we felt better.</p>
<p>Isofluorane is used on horses and is super potent. But, it wasn't an immediate response of going unconscious. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isoflurane, along with sevoflurane and desflurane, are the three most common anesthetic gasses used in hospitals.  If I'm giving it to a patient and have to disconnect the breathing circuit for a second I'll sometimes get a blast of it to the face... Definitely will give you a headache in small doses. </p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NINJAM7" target="_blank">NINJAM7</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. It's an anesthetic. You would have to be under for quite a while before any permanent damage was done.
Our mice would occasionally die if we had the flow rate too high, or under for too long. Otherwise, we just give them oxygen and they come out of it pretty quickly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, not the ones that died haha. For the most part the mice do fine (99% of the time) if you montitor the flow rate, and length of time they're under.</p>
<p>In the end though, all of the mice will be sacrificed at some point (especially the experimental groups). Many of these mice get cancer or other issues. It would be inhumane to keep them around for too long. We would always monitor the mice for suffering, and kill them in a painless manner. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about researchers shooting animals with tranquilizer darts? I'm pretty sure I've seen that in nature documentaries. They look at the teeth, weight, etc to find out if they're healthy and attach a GPS collar so they can track their movements or find out how they died.</p>
<p>Do they do this just for the show and half of those polar bears die from being knocked out?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hospitals have good recipes for this.  Benadryl 50mg + Haldol 5mg + Ativan 2mg administered intramuscularly (known as the B52 among other things) has a very sedating effect on very nearly anyone.  It's not instant but it is very fast.  Typically used for psychotic/violent/intoxicated patients who require medical care but pose an immediate threat to themselves or others.</p></div>		</li>
