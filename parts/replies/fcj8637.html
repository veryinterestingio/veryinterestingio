			<div class="markdown"><p>Doctor here. This is right. Some other answers are mentioning debridement, which is different (debridement is removing dead or damaged tissue that could get infected and feed bacteria, usually by cutting it off). To clean the sand or other dirt from a wound, the standard procedure is just to use saline (sterile salt water) on the wound until the dirt has come out. A lot of saline.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about in cases where let's say, a patient falls and is impaled on a tree branch or something of that nature and there's gunk <em>inside</em> a very deep wound. Do you just irrigate until you feel satisfied and hope there's nothing left in there that the body can't break down?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pure water is hypotonic which means that it has a lower concentration of salts and other solutes than the water inside your cells. This causes your cells to take up the extra water which can cause them to swell or even burst. Saline is isotonic so it doesn't cross the cell membrane, and therefore it's much gentler.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pure water gets taken up rapidly by the exposed cells in the wound which may cause them to burst (through osmosis). The used saline has the same salt content as the body and prevents this damage from happening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes they may need to use a local anaesthetic in as well if it’s deep or in more complex structures/near nerves.   But this is basically it, often combined with an x-ray if they’re worried other bits are still in there like glass, a script of antibiotics for good measure and a tetanus shot/booster if you need it. </p>
<p>If it’s very deep they may have to investigate the injury after initial cleaning.</p></div>		</li>
