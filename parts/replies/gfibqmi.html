			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh I'm not very optimistic about that. You feel the effects of sleep deprivation mainly mentally. Your mental health deteriorates, concentrating becomes hard - your brain literally starts malfunctioning and shutting down.</p>
<p>That said, I believe in the studies that are beginning to show gut health plays a far more significant role in health, including mental, than we ever anticipated. So maybe those 2 things are related.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's true that we feel the effects mentally, but that doesn't mean there isn't a connection to the gut. We could feel those things because of things happening in the gut. I agree it's possible that mental symptoms are unrelated... </p>
<p>But of all the side effects of severe sleep deprivation, death seems like a pretty key one to look at, and an exciting one to solve</p></div>		</li>
