			<div class="markdown"><p>I can speculate that it's for the same reason: frame shifts will be less likely to initiate inappropriate transcription, thereby reducing the number of improper proteins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its the same. If there are more start codons, the probability of reading frameshifted start codons will be larger thus leading to an increase production of undesirable proteins. </p>
<p>Actually its addressed in the journal I linked. Quote: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notice that the cyclic permutation of the start codon ATG yields the stop codon TGA, i.e., the start codon shifted one nucleotide to the right leads to an immediate stop provided the next base is A. The fact that there exists only one start codon AUG in the standard genetic code (see Table 1) has also a certain evolutionary advantage, since the number of positions, from where the genetic information is read, is minimal. If there were two or more start codons in a genetic code, then the probability of reading frameshifted start codons would be larger, which would lead to a larger production of dysfunctional proteins than for one start codon.</p>
<p>Finally, let us emphasize that ATG is not the only universal start codon. For instance, ATA (corresponding to the purine bases mutation G  A in the third position) stands for the start in some mitochondrial genetic codes. Also ATT may rarely serve as a special start codon, see Faure et al. (2011).</p>
