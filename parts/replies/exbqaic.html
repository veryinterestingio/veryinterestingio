<p>A quick Google search brings up a lot of hits for using Deep Brain Stimulation to get them working again. </p>
<p>Is it something you think will be an effective treatment in the future? Would it work for a wide variety of patients, or just specific cases?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! I try to keep things understandable :).</p>
<p>Sometimes, yes - but deep brain stimulation, or anything that involves opening the skull, is extremely risky in a healthy person. Compound that with someone whose brain is already damaged, and you're exponentially increasing the risk. On top of that, most current DBS techniques are a lot less accurate than we'd like them to be. It's very difficult to target a specific spot for electrical stimulation. </p>
<p>The main problem imo though is that, many times, things like DBS are (currently) temporary solutions. They don't replace they broken circuits, but install a separate, manual 'on button'. For something as fundamental as consciousness, that's problematic. You don't want your consciousness systems to be disconnected from the signals that make them work.</p>
<p>That said, I've heard some promising things about deep brain ultrasound stimulation technologies. Ideally, though, you want something that will stimulate repair, not replacement of a circuit. I see more promise in stem cell treatments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A long time ago I heard something about using olfactory neurons to repair broken connections in a spinal cord injury. Something about how olfactory neurons are the only type that can rapidly divide, thus making them good at filling in the gaps.   </p>
<p>I never heard anything more about it, but t would be interesting to try using that procedure to repair damage to the brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry if I’m misinterpreting you, but your last paragraph... Where it says modern DBS aims to stimulate repair rather than replacing of the neurons. Does this mean that currently there’s a risk of a “successful DBS patient” coming out of it all with a new... rebuilt conscious?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, there are promising results in using Deep Brain Stimulation in Patients with the vegetative or minimally conscious state. Some patients started responding after years of unresponsiveness, some even regained verbal contact. But it's still in studies because these states are not caused only by one region of the brain. We need first to understand how consciousness works and then stimulate, if necessary to see how they will react.</p>
<p>I think it's very promising, because direct electrical stimulation may &quot;open up&quot; new pathways or avoid &quot;traffic jams&quot; in the brain, that keeps the patient in a coma or vegetative state.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact we're now starting to really understand what's going on in these conditions, and work on treatments like this is incredible.</p>
<p>So it's a case of signals bouncing off each other going nowhere, or getting caught in loops? Maybe similar to a fight or flight response that leads to indecision or inaction?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In induced comas, what tends to happen is withdrawal of the sedating agents (i.e. propofol, morphine for pediatric cases sometimes) when they are ready to wake up the patient. If the patient has adequate cerebral function (i.e. not suffered a hypoxic/traumatic head injury), withdrawal of the sedating agents should result in them waking up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That part I don't know. I know more about the structure/healing side of things. As far as I'm aware the damaging aspects of chronic drug use are 1) escalating side effects as your tolerance increases, and 2) withdrawal. I know some drugs with limited tolerance build up/side effects are actually OK for people to be on long term (comparatively). People absolutely can go into a coma from withdrawal though. Alcohol and benzo withdrawal are notorious for it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not for the normal drugs of abuse. If you don't consider stuff like coma from eventual organ damage like from alcohol abuse.</p>
<p>But you won't be falling into a coma gradually. </p>
<p>If you were to use a drug that keeps your blood sugar highly elevated you would eventually fall into a hyperglycaemic coma.</p>
<p>But amphetamines, cocaine and morphine don't cause comas on their own.</p></div>		</li>
