			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered this. I don't eat crazy hot stuff but I do like a curry. They sometimes make me a bit rumbly in the guts but I'm pretty sure that's the oil content rather than the chilli.
The whole ring of fire thing has never troubled me. I assumed it was just comedy imagery until fairly recently.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's real. It's extremely real. It's why I cannot eat anything spicier than a few drops of tobasco, despite loving spicy food. </p>
<p>It's just not worth the consequences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was always confused by this too.  In my 20s I just thought I wasn't eating spicy enough food and everyone else was freeebasing ghost peppers when I wasn't looking.  Then I kept going for hotter and hotter, and more hot food in a setting.  Never had &quot;the ring of fire' from spicy food.  It must be a genetic trait.</p>
<p>Luckily for me it seems my ancestors really liked to freebase their ghost peppers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those big yellow split peas do seem to have an effect but it's inconsistent. If I cook curry myself I'm fine, I just find that if I get a takeaway and its one of those with a layer of oil across the top of every dish then I feel it the next morning. But this theory has not been subject to rigorous scientific scrutiny.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Age has seemed to invert my GI tracts tolerance to spice. My mouth can handle anything but I can literally point to where a curry or a hot chicken wing is burning in my GI until it comes out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have the same thing here, and I assume my mom doesn’t either. We eat spicy food a ton and never ever complain about feeling sick from it. I’ve had ghost peppers and also tried some of the really spicy sauce from hot ones and still nothing. I always assumed people joke about it but don’t experience it tbh.</p></div>		</li>
