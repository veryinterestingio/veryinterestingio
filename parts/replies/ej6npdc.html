			<div class="markdown"><p>I work at a small airport, about once every few months an old portly man with coke bottle glasses and overalls comes in, waits for all the passengers to come out, and when there's nobody left he comes up to the counter and shows us a picture of a Russian passport belonging to a woman. He'll ask us to look her up and we tell him we can't give out passenger information. It's sad.</p></div>		</li>
