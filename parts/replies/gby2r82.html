			<div class="markdown"><p>If the galaxies themselves were moving, we would expect to see a uniform distribution of their velocities. In other words, there would be no preferred or more common direction of the movement. This is absolutely not what we observe. Apart from very few exceptions (Andromeda is one of them) EVERY galaxy is moving away from us, and the further they are already the faster they are receding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially, yeah. The expected uniform distribution I mentioned if there wasn't any expansion we do observe, but it is imposed on top of this general outwards motion. Since this outwards motion is faster for things further away (Hubbles Law relates the recession velocity to the distance), if an object is close enough than the recession velocity is very low, and the random directional velocity can be the dominant observable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't overcome it, it replaces it. Expansion is a &quot;thing matter can do&quot; in the same way as gravitation is – which one happens just depends on local conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember right it's because every galaxy we can observe in the sky appears to be moving directly away from us, and the farther away they are the faster they seem to be moving. Either we are at the exact center of the universe, which violates a few principles of physics, or space is expanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simple answer number 1: we know galaxies move in all directions (locally this has been measured), yet every large scale feature (distant galaxies and clusters) in the universe is always redshifted away from us by increasing amounts (i.e. farther objects are moving away faster) — the only explanations for this would be that our galaxy is sitting still at the center of a universe where everything is flying away from us, or, more reasonably, that space is uniformly expanding, which would lead to every galaxy or point in space observing the same effect. Our universe actually has an “observable horizon” because if you imagine a rubber band being stretched with dots on it for galaxies, and stretch it some set amount, the galaxy at one edge sees that at the other edge moving the fastest — eventually, the small stretch of space at every point along the way is enough that a galaxy far enough away is “moving away” faster than the speed of light. Thus its light never reaches us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I understand correctly, then, there should be galaxies near the limit of our ability to see them that are moving near the speed of light.  What would we see when they surpass that?  would they simply seem to disappear?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, more or less (in theory). Actually observing such galaxies produces a whole host of observational challenges not worth going into, but the basic idea is such a galaxy's light (just past the threshold) would be &quot;infinitely redshifted&quot; and never reach us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Motion cannot be faster than the speed of light, the question what we would see then is meaningless.</p>
<p>The expansion of space is not a velocity, it's velocity per distance. Go to distances large enough and the distance to these galaxies increases faster than the speed of light. That's what we observe. A motion of galaxies through space cannot fit to these measurements.</p></div>		</li>
