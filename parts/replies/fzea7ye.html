			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, and thanks for that great question! Choosing places to land on Mars is a very difficult trade between engineering and science. Often the most scientifically interesting places to land are also the most challenging from a safety point of view! At any rate, many potential landing sites were thoroughly vetted for Perseverance's specific payload, and Jezero Crater rose to the top of that list. Not only should this landing site be safe, it appears to be an ideal environment for past habitability on Mars, including a very likely ancient river delta outflow. That's why this site was selected for NASA's first step in returning Mars samples to Earth. â€“TB</p></div>		</li>
