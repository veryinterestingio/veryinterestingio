			<div class="markdown"><p>OP asked how our ears can pick up our names in all the noise. The answer is that the ears pick up all the sounds. It is only the brain that has trouble picking the different conversations apart. But the brain can be trained to notice specific words, such as our name.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what happens is your brain splits pertinent and non-pertinent sounds up. So all the irrelevant noise heard in a large, noisy crowd is filtered out.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I can't explain more since I don't know much more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know a little more! </p>
<p>I think what happens is that the brain identifies &quot;language-like sounds&quot; from the rest of the total mass of perceived sounds, then from those language-sounds it accesses its mental lexicon (the extent to which this mental lexicon &quot;exists&quot; as opposed to being shorthand for complex processes we don't understand is debated) to identify the specific words that best match the perceived sounds, allowing us to understand what is being said.</p>
<p>Synapses in the brain can be strengthened by frequent activation, which is a fancy way of saying that the more you use a word, the better your brain is at picking that word out from among the constant stream of aural input. Since your name is likely among the first words you ever learn, and you keep using it and hearing it on a daily basis throughout your entire life, it is not surprising that the brain is quite good at perceiving it. (Which also explains why you sometimes <em>think</em> you hear your name at the cocktail party if say your name is Michael and someone says a similar-sounding but less frequently used word like &quot;cycle&quot;.)</p>
<p>Beyond that I can't explain more either.</p></div>		</li>
