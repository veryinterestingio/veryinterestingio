			<div class="markdown"><p>So you're saying you pay a dollar for the slice and 2.50 for the water? There is literally no place in NYC that has that pricing system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was at a 99 cent slice spot in midtown last night around 2am.  You are liable to get your ass kicked asking for a liter of water.   It's a fucking regulah slice and a can of coke or you can fuck right off because 25 drunk people are right behind you and we dont have time for your bullshit metric water order.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. As someone that looked into setting up a soda tap at my home: CO2 and Syrup are a bit more expensive than many people think. Sure, the ice is cheap, resulting in less syrup/CO2 cost, but if you compare the cost of a 2-liter, to how much is costs you to produce 2 liters from a tap, you're not really making a killing.  </p>
<p>I found that making 2 liters from a soda tap would come out to something like $1.30. Compare that to the stores that will sell 2-liters for around $1-$1.50. These calculations took into account getting the BIBs at no markup from 7-Eleven (Got a friend that's a manager and said he'd sell them to me at the cost the store pays) . If you try to buy a Coke or Pepsi BiB from Costco or something like that, expect it to cost you closer to $2 per 2 liters you produce.  </p>
<p>I also contacted Coke and Pepsi to see if I could order straight through them, and the answer was no. For restaurants, you have to sign an agreement in most cases only to sell their brand, and you have to order a minimum amount of BIBs per month or they won't continue doing business with you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe those slices can be a &quot;loss leader&quot; if they're not profitable. They sell the pizza cheaply in hopes that they'll get you in the door to buy other things like soda, chips, etc.</p></div>		</li>
