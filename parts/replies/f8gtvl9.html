<p>Do you use varying frequencies at all? I’ve read (only slightly) about the healing qualities of sound and vibration. I’m not overly versed but hella interested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I only have a bachelor’s, but no, we don’t use varying frequencies. You may be thinking of sound healing, which is more of an alternative modality. Music therapists DO use varying tempos, meters, accompaniment styles, etc. For example, if the treatment goal is to increase relaxation, I’ll use a 3/4 meter (“waltz style,” relaxing feel) at approximately 60 beats per minute, which matches an adult’s resting heart rate. Hope this helped clarify!</p></div>		</li>
