			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an imperfect sphere surrounding your eyeball (or your telescope detector). The reason that the sphere is not perfect is because of gravitational effects on light, such as lensing. Some light travels a longer or shorter path to reach you. Light also travels slower through a medium, so for example light travelling through a diffuse region of gas might take a little longer than other light. </p>
<p>This effect is not going to be very big though, because the universe is at large scales homogeneous in every direction, so these effects will pretty much cancel out. But it is not accurate to say the sphere is absolutely perfect.</p>
<p>But no, we are not closer to an 'edge'. The edge is a period of time when the universe bacame transparent, and the distance to this edge corresponds directly to the time since recombination. It happened everywhere. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would imagine you could somehow determine the size of the universe though?</p>
<p>Like, 13.8 bya it was the size of a quark or something infinitely small. Since then it has accelerated in every direction at a rate slightly faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>So if we work backwards 13.8 bya and utilize that acceleration, shouldn't we be able to figure out how much it has expanded since then?</p>
<p>I think we call the observable universe infinite because we could never reach or see the edge, since it expands faster than light. Even if we somehow traveled at light speed, we could never reach the end. But this doesnt mean it is <em>actually</em> infinite, just that we can never reach the end. I think infinity doesnt exist, we think of it incorrectly by trying to quantify it as a number, its just a concept to show an ever growing number. </p>
<p>Thats why we have order of infinity. There are infinite whole numbers and infinite even numbers, right? But there are still more whole numbers than even numbers. So one infinity is larger than the other. This illustrates that infinity isn't really empirical, it's just a concept to show that you can keep tallying forever without reaching the end of a given set.</p>
<p>Anyways, don't you think the universe probably has an edge expanding into an even larger set of infinity, just at a faster speed than we will ever be able to reach or see the end, even using our imaginations? This is how it achieves infinity. Not by being actually infinite.</p>
<p>Edit: tldr: just because a set of numbers is infinite doesnt mean we cant figure out what the first number was and then determine how far we have come from there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By laws of physics, do you mean the speed of light?</p>
<p>It's always been a bit of a nagging incongruency for me that I haven't heard plainly explained (mostly because I haven't asked). If the universe is X billion years old, and our horizon for light traveling to us is about the same X billion years away... Since light from &quot;further away&quot; wouldn't have had the time to travel to us.... One would expect that we can see the entire universe UNLESS (to my feeble brain) the universe is potentially much older than our horizon (but then the light would've had more time to travel), OR the universe for a period expanded quicker than the speed of light <em>after</em> becoming transparent ... which is the only way I can envision there being stuff beyond our horizon. I do think that, since light is traveling IN space-time, and it was space-time itself that was expanding.... it would make sense that such a thing would be possible. </p>
<p>Is that the theory? Or am I missing something?</p></div>		</li>

<p>1) How do we see past all the stars and galaxies emitting light?  Do they not emit any microwaves?  Or do we subtract them somehow ?   Is the CMB distant? Or everywhere in the universe?</p>
<p>2) How/why do we believe the CMB is from the early universe?  Why can't it just be noise created during, say, the last 10 billion years?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) Most of space is very empty. If you point a straight line in a random direction, it will most likely go forever to the CMB without ever hitting a galaxy. However, the Milky Way takes up a big chunk of the sky and does emit microwaves, so we need to take that into account and subtract it out.</p>
<p>Whether the CMB is &quot;distant&quot; or &quot;everywhere&quot; depends on semantics really. The photons are everywhere, but they were emitted billions of light years away. There was a CMB emitted from our local universe too, but because these photons were emitted billions of years ago, the CMB radiation from here is now billions of light years away, and the CMB radiation that's here now is the stuff that was emitted somewhere else.</p>
<p>2) The big deal here is that the CMB radiation spectrum is a perfect blackbody. You can only get such a perfect blackbody is the gas is pristine (not many complex heavy elements), and very very hot. The CMB radiation is very cold right now - 2.7 K - because it has been redshifted. For something that hot to have become this cold, it must have experienced a <em>lot</em> of redshift. It also needs to have been around before the stars polluted anything. Additionally, it's extremely uniform, which means that it predates any sort of structure forming in the universe - so it has to be older than galaxies etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is what I never understand, I see that it travels for really really long time, but than it either hits our telescopes or passes and its gone (unless we can see the reflection on the next object it hits).</p>
<p>So the Big Bang was really short from my understanding (some 1E-x seconds) then this light would hit us and then its over and we can't see photons from behind. The same when we send radio signals to a distant galaxy, an alien has to look in the right direction AND at the right moment. Given the universe is all around as the first doesn't apply but the second. Why can we take years and years to study the Big Bang then and for how much longer? When is the  &quot;impulse&quot; over?</p></div>		</li>

<li>The CMB is constant, and EVERYWHERE. Essentially. I mean, there's an exceedingly tiny amount around your body right now, because our atmosphere absorbs much of this light.</li>
<li>CMB is light, not noise. It was once ultra-hot and energetic, but time/expansion has resulted in it being barely above absolute zero, but since energy can't be destroyed, it's still out there, just going 'shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh' forever and ever and ever.   </li>
</ol>
<p>BTW, it was a consequence/prediction of mid-century Big Bang cosmology that there should be a CMBR at an estimated wavelength of light. When it was discovered by chance by radio astronomers, they weren't aware of the prediction, and were simply trying to get rid of this weird 'noise' they were observing everywhere they looked. They even thought it was bird shit on their telescope, or perhaps the wrong kind of screws had been used. They called up a local university's astronomy department where leading theorists happened to be working to see if they could provide any insight, and it was from that phone call that these astrophysicists realized they'd been scooped! </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>

<p>Noise can be light.  I meant noise as in chaotic fluctuations.  This is still the part I don't understand really.  I mean I totally get that the Big Bang theory predicts a microwave background and that's what they've found.  But when I read about it, it sounds like noise (as the first radio astronomers you talked about thought it was).   I understand it is real, and not noise from instruments, but I guess I don't really see why it can't be noise from something else and why astronomers are so certain it points to the Big Bang.   To be clear, I'm not really arguing against the theory as much as explaining what I don't understand in the findings.  Perhaps a bit of me feels like when I watch science lectures, cosmologists/astronomers/astrophysicists seem a little too certain that they know what happened 13+ billion years ago.   I don't disagree with their theory as much as not understand their certainty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add onto this, it's also possible that there are thousands of alien civilizations outside of our observable sphere that we will never, in all the combined time of human existence, be able to see or interact with in any way due to the constant expansion of the universe. That is, unless we manage to invent a way to travel a ludicrous number of times the speed of light. Space either already expands faster than the speed of light or is accelerating up to that point (I don't remember which exactly), after which time stars will start to wink out of existence (from our perspective), starting with the furthest away, and going faster and faster and faster until, finally, we are the last things we see in the universe before we, too, fade into eternity.</p></div>		</li>
