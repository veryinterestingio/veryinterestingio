			<div class="markdown"><p>To answer your question seriously, there are different kind of muscles; some are contracted by default and need a conscious effort to relax and some are relaxed by default and need a conscious effort to contract. (And other we have no control over whatsoever, like f.e. the heart) - by examine the muscles you can tell the difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Knowing the default setting of a muscle doesn't really answer the question of how we know a whale is consciously vs unconsciously operating that muscle, though. Does it?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost all voluntary muscle is striated skeletal muscle (has stripes under the microscope). Almost all involuntary muscle is smooth (no stripes under the microscope). So you can take a sample from a dead whale’s blowhole and check which it is. </p>
<p>The exception is heart (striated, but involuntary and a few other differences to skeletal muscle) and the mammalian diaphragm (striated skeletal muscle, but under conscious and unconscious control).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In what way is it a bit of both? The answer seems to be that it takes conscious muscle to open, and closed is the natural state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the muscles are designed both to keep the hole open and closed as needed. the default (more relaxed) state is closed, but there would always be some muscle tension so that the hole does not get randomly open when not meant to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Smooth muscles are often controlled by the central nervous system in such a way that they are generally not fully on or off. Think of them like a dimmer switch that is generally kept at 30% brightness. </p>
<p>This example doesn't work very well for a sphincter, but it works very well for vascular smooth muscle. Most arterioles are rarely fully constricted or fully dilated, but almost always exhibit some amount of smooth muscle contraction. This is called vascular tone. </p>
<p>There is no &quot;natural&quot; state of a muscle. When it receives a signal to contract, it will do so. When the signal stops, it will stop contracting (this is not a hard and fast rule as there are weird examples, especially with smooth muscle). Where it gets complicated is that signals for muscles to contract are generally sent multiple times per second, and the rate at which the signals are sent, will determine the forcefulness of the overall contraction. This phenomenon is known as &quot;twitch summation&quot;. If you stimulate the muscle fast enough, you will achieve a tetanic contraction, representing maximal force production for that fiber (or motor unit).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not saying they couldn't, but diarrhea isn't caused by a problem with the sphincter. It's the digestive system going into maximum overdrive to flush something out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like /u/TheyCallMeStone said... it's possible. But, generally the only things that cause problems with the action of smooth muscles (or skeletal muscles) are uh.... very, very deadly. </p>
<p>Botulism toxin.
Most Nerve gas agents.
Succinyl Choline.
Many, many types of poison/venom target portions of the neural control of skeletal/smooth muscle. Few, if any, are something you'd want to try.</p></div>		</li>
