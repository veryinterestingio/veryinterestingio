			<div class="markdown"><p>Most common misconceptions started as something similar; some kind of vitality spreadding of a believable falsity... The &quot;you eat x spiders in your sleep a year&quot; was actually a social experiment to document the strength and prolificity of the effect... People still believe that/talk about it.... and while yes, the amount of spiders the average human eats in their sleep (on average) is a non 0 sum( if one single human ate a spider accidentally it's a non-0 sum, as the average would be 0.0000000000001%) , but no one could have possibly gathered the data from enough (at home) sleeping participants to calculate the average is 5 (or however many) a year.</p></div>		</li>
