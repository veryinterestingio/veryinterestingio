			<div class="markdown"><p>Some one else mentioned the circadian rhythm and that would play a bigger role in making sure you wake up at the right time to not feel groggy. Basically you want to entrain your system to fall asleep and wake up at the right times in your sleep/wake cycle. </p>
<p>You could essentially plan for 4 cycles at say 6 hours then add or subtract time based on how you feel. But this is more or less impossible for most people do. Because so many things influence length of each stage of sleep from age to things like caffeine, blue light, noise, medical issues &amp; zeitgebers. </p>
<p>All things aside I think the best thing is to wake up naturally to feel least groggy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ie: if you wake up in the middle of a dream or right before REM, you're going to have &quot;sleep hangover&quot; it can take longer than you'd think to recover from. If they had woken up at the end of the previous cycle naturally, they would have been fine. I've found often times when you beat your alarm, it's time to get up. You'll feel better, have a little more time to adjust to wakefulness, drink water, and in general return to daily life</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dreaming occurs in stage REM sleep. Which is the deepest stage of sleep. So you are getting some deep sleep if you remember your dreams. A few reasons I find people remember their dreams more.... either they are sleeping so well that they are getting ample amounts of REM sleep or they are waking up directly out of the dreaming state (stage REM). One characteristic of REM sleep is lose of muscle tone, which if you have OSA your more likely to wake up in that stage. But it is very subjective. I see people who have excessive amounts of REM in my lab that never remember dreams and vice versa</p>
<p>As a side note: all the stages of sleep do varying things and are important for restoring your body, hormone regulation, memory fragmentation, etc. This is regardless of how “deep” of sleep it is. </p>
<p>Normally REM sleep becomes a bigger percentage of those 90 minute cycles as the night progresses. If you feel your dreaming as soon as you fall asleep, it could be from having a sleep phase delay(later bed time that your body wants) or from things like shift work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The notion that some people's circadian rhythms are adapted to a cycle (the big cycle, not REM/NREM) of more than 24 hours, is, to put it mildly, very disturbing.</p>
<p>Sleep will always be delayed every time, since it extends beyond the hours of the day.</p>
<p>Myself, I'm really weird. I have to sleep 10-12 hours to wake up rested. Is this normal? I use Melatonin sublingual (micro-dose &lt; 1mg) every night.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically our sleep cycle is 24.2 hours.  Which was discovered by studies in a cave with no light. When they tracked the bodies natural wake and sleep time they would progress .2 hours per day. </p>
<p>I find Melatonin is a useful tool when used wisely.
From what i have seen, micro dosing melatonin is the best way to do it. Because many of the supplements out there are made to knock you out. 5mg of Mel. is not a natural amount so it ends up making people take more and more to get the same effect. I see people in the lab who take 30mg a day. But likely just need CBT or light therapy, etc for their insomnia. Melatonin to me is a patch for an underlying issue. </p>
<p>are you having night when you sleep much less? normally 9 hours recommended. </p>
<p>I personally only get about 5-6 hours when i work and then 10-12 on my days off to make up for staying up all night.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for replying, interesting to know!</p>
<p>Personally (or rather anectdotally), melatonin has been a blessing. As long as I remember, sleep has been a problem for me through childhood. The insomnia almost turned scary for me to experience as a child. But I forced myself to lose those 2-3 hours of being awake before passing out. As soon as I'm fast asleep, it's ironically very hard to wake up.</p>
<p>I tried melatonin when I was 16 and was amazed, also a little sad, because it seriously felt like melatonin was a part of me that I found for the first time. That's why it's our essential sleep hormone. </p>
<p>In Sweden, melatonin is prescription only, not only that but they did not prescribe it to me because they said it's not well known. They recommend synthetic drugs instead. But I kept fighting and 10 doctors later, I find one who even tells me he uses it himself and it's safe. This very surreal, because melatonin is an essential natural part of our sleep, and to not make the Drug Authorities (those who approve new medicine) study that is bad. It's also as safe as any essential amino acid, really. </p>
<p>I've taken melatonin every night for over 2 years and it works as good every time, <em>honestly</em>. I must agree with you that microdosage is key with melatonin. I too followed the words on internet that less made you more sleepy, and too much had opposite effect. The Doctors sometimes try to prescribe too much as well. </p>
<p>I'm glad to hear melatonin is gaining a better reputation over where you are.</p></div>		</li>
