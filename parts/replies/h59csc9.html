			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you're right there's an intense jolt of pain right away. The dull feeling lags behind, so their answer must be incomplete.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No doubt there's a huge amount of those nerves but anyone who says that you don't feel immediate pain can't possibly convince me they have testicles.</p>
<p>Or they are close to anybody who has owned a pair of testicles.</p>
<p>Or has seen literally any nut shot video on the internet.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AFAIK the unmyelinated neurons have the speed of around 10 meters per second. The myelinated ones 100 m/s. So your answer kind of makes no sense, 10 m/s is still a great speed and by this logic you should not feel this pain with a perceived delay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, we have a LOT of neurons, but that does not mean that the distance from a zone, for example from the testicles to the brain (where the pain is perceived, in the prefrontal cortex, sensitive area) is so big. Actually, it is quite good optimized: from this region to the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frxharun.com%2Fanatomy-of-spinal-cord-injury-treatment-complication%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw0Spz_UYeWJbgWkJeyYgkNQ&amp;ust=1626439122919000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAsQjRxqFwoTCODluIOM5fECFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD" target="_blank">spinal cord</a> to the brain. For superficial pain neurons (within the skin), it takes only 3 neurons to reach the brain. For visceral neurons (such as the testicles), it takes much more, but they are quite short.</p></div>		</li>
