			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone that has been developing therapeutic antibodies for the last 15 years, I can add one more piece of color to this: neutralizing vs non-neutralizing antibodies. Everyone with a competent immune system will develop antibodies to the virus, but the antibodies each person develops are different repertoires (types, numbers) dependent on their particular HLA haplotype and just random spatial and temporal chance. An individual develops antibodies to various viral proteins, and to various locations on those proteins, but they may or may not develop antibodies to the very specific location on the COV-2 spike protein where it docks onto the ACE receptor. Those particular antibodies that bind to and block the  receptor binding domain, RBD, are called neutralizing antibodies or antagonist antibodies. If an individual develops antagonizing antibodies they completely prevent the virus from ever infecting the cells for the duration of B cell memory (a separate question). If on the other hand, they develop anti-COV-2 antibodies that don't block the virus from entering the cells, the individual can have possibly a mild infection with some virus produced (maybe). The virus and any cells infected will still be recognized by the innate immune system (neutrophils, NK or cytolytic T cells expressing Fc receptors) and killed, but that response can be a little more delayed than immediate neutralization of the RBD. Not sure how delayed the cellular response is compared to just complete blocking. Lot of companies out there are trying to develop neutralizing antibodies to ameliorate the disease, Astrazeneca, Lilly, Regeneron, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We recently saw some infected who were not asymptomatic, but also didn't develop a serious condition. Our GPs are currently investigating. Those folks 'simply' have respiratory irritation or suffer shortness of breath for a prolonged period (around 6-8 weeks) . Could that be the first type (neutralizing antibodies) ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are so many varying factors that contribute to the disease you can't know until a lot of clinical or GLP testing had been done on the patients. For example, the human population has varying ACE receptor sequences (SNPs) that can positively or negatively impact viral docking. Not sure how well the scientific community has characterized the factors driving the minimal symptoms in children for example. There's a lot of work that needs to be done and a lot of unknowns. Viruses are incredibly complex, efficient machines that change over time and the whole human cell machinery is involved in viral infection and reproduction, with many steps along the way that individuals can show quite varied responses to. I worked with someone that never developed a response to the HepB vaccine for example, and those individuals definitely exist in the population, though rare. That's why Hawaii asks for records of antibody responses to the rabies vaccine for dogs coming to Hawaii instead of just proof of vaccination.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your response iaYork! That makes perfect sense that scientists need to gather empirical evidence before they say anything with certainty. I have seen all of these headlines (even in reputable papers) that say scientists don't know if infected people are immune. It went against everything I knew about our immune system, but I assumed that I was just less informed about the science.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It sounds like immunity is highly likely. However, good research needs actual evidence.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I think it's a disconnect between how scientists talk and normal people talk. Many people miss the distinction between &quot;don't know if people are immune
and &quot;know people are not immune&quot;. The whole point of science is to question the obvious.</p>
<p>Like people complaining about scientists saying &quot;we don't know if the virus infects by aerosol&quot;. Besides the word &quot;aerosol&quot; meaning something specific for scientists, just because it seems obvious to you don't make it true. We literally don't know for sure, but people hate uncertainty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent point. I think a better way to ask my original question is, &quot;What degree of certainty do scientists have that antibodies cause long-term immunity?&quot;</p>
<p>There are so many opinion articles, even in highly-reputable newspapers, that assume scientists have no idea whether long-term immunity is possible. I think a large part of the reason people are misled (myself included) is because science articles rarely do a good job communicating with the public. </p>
<p>Realistically, most people can't read a scientific article and understand its implications. Instead, people have to read a second-hard article about what conclusions the original research made. All of the nuance is lost, and regular people can't verify these conclusions because they don't understand all of the jargon in the article. </p>
<p>Take the rhetoric over climate change. The argument against climate change deniers is often just , &quot;trust the scientists.&quot; Of course we should trust scientists. But at the same time, how can a normal person verify all this information without years of specialized information? They have to learn the Jargon, understand the concepts, then spend money on getting full access to a Nature article. Its just impossible. Putting trust in scientists is a lot easier, but without the ability to verify the facts, alternative (false) beliefs like climate change denial seem just as valid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting topic I ran across while doing armchair research on convalescent plasma therapy for critically ill COVID patients was &quot;antibody dependent enhancement&quot; (ADE). Basically, what I got out of reading various papers was that certain viruses have evolved mechanisms which IMPROVE how well the virus can infect cells when the virus is targeted with antibodies. </p>
<p>Viruses such as West Nile Virus and Dengue virus have exhibited ADE in studies. ADE can make vaccine research and convalescent plasma therapy very difficult. Granted, the COVID-19 virus is a completely different virus from the two mentioned above, but I just thought this was something interesting I learned! Unfortunately, I don't have access to the papers I've read at the moment so I can't reference anything in particular!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, ADE has been known for decades.  I learned about it in my very first virology course, in 1981. It’s one of those things that people are just finding out about and think because it’s new to them, it’s new to scientists. It’s well known and well understood and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines specifically take steps to overcome it, using the well tested approaches that were shown to work in SARS and MERS vaccines. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There have been studies using convalescent plasma as a potential treatment for COVID-19. There are a number of limiting factors and issues with this as a potential treatment that need to be resolved before it can be a widespread approach. I'll highlight just a few below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Convalescent plasma is actually a very old treatment. We have records of the technique being used as long as one hundred years ago. However, we still do not know the exact mechanism by which it confers its beneficial effects. Similarly, we do not know the full risk profile of using plasma as a treatment. For example, plasma contains a huge array of different pro and anti-inflammatory agents, and we could risk potentially aggravating the immune response of an infected patient far beyond what they can handle. Plasma is also rich in clotting factors and by using plasma as a treatment, we could reasonably expect potential side effects relating to blood clots and coagulation.</li>
<li>We are bottlenecked by our rate of testing and the percentage of potential donors who have high circulating concentrations of anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies (which also doesn't necessarily guarantee their plasma will be therapeutic). We would need to easily and quickly identify recovered patients who would be good candidates for plasma donation. After the actual donation, there need to be established protocols for the safe preparation and delivery of said plasma. It would also require many donors to have enough plasma for it to be a widespread treatment.</li>
<li>We don't really know when to administer plasma to maximize its potential therapeutic effects. There have been reports that plasma does not seem to confer any benefits when administered in the later stages of infection.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tl;DR: It's a promising avenue of study, but we need a lot more data to really determine its effectiveness and safety profile.</p></div>		</li>
