			<div class="markdown"><p>Please see my other answer: midline vs not. Secondarily, your argument that evolutionary novelty dictates the order of development is an interesting hypothesis but lacks evidence, and has two claims that contradict each other. The liver is not older than the kidneys, the pronephros came first, and develops first.</p>
<p>The heart is actually MORE vulnerable to fatal arrhythmia because of the two hearts being fused. Circulation would still work, albeit badly, if one stopped pumping efficiently: “congestive heart failure” is the common name for Left Ventricular Failure - water backs up in the lungs, to which the right heart could pump blood, if only it could receive sufficient venous return from the now-failing left.</p>
<p>You get lung buds around the same time as you get a face/pharynx. They keep growing well past birth, but they are there very early, well before others are “nearly finished.”</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is only one midline (sagittal) plane. Like the median on a road. Some things, like the primordial heart tubes, start as two paramedian lines (think double yellow) but they grow so wide and are so close that they they merge into one median tube almost immediately. So, because there is one one middle, there is only one heart.</p>
