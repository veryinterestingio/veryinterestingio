			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda related, but your body is also amazingly good at figuring out more efficient ways of doing something.  For example, if you have never cross-country skied before it will be super difficult the first time.  If you do it 3 or 4 times in the next few weeks it will get much easier.  It's not like you're getting more fit from a couple hours of practice, your muscles are just figuring out more efficient ways to move.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>It's also why you want to switch your workout program every few months (6 I believe). Your body gets used to the exercises, therefore becoming efficient, therefore becoming less efficient at tearing your muscles.</del></p>
<p>EDIT: I was misinformed. While it is good to switch up your program, it has nothing to do with muscle memory or confusion. This is a common myth that is false. I apologize for the misinformation that I shared, I was unaware that it was false. Thank you to those that pointed it out to me, but not to the rude ones, the rude ones are mean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was wondering about that at the gym. Over the course of a month or two, I could do a lot more push ups. It felt like it wasn't so much about how much muscle I had built, but rather getting better at the form, getting rid of the wasted movement, etc. I'm sure I added a bit of muscle, but I'd bet the majority of the progress has to be overwhelmingly attributed to mastering the efficiency of the mechanic. Maybe once you get close to efficient form, THEN further gains can be attributed to developing more muscle. And I suppose it goes both ways...perfecting the form allows you to more efficiently build muscle in the areas that the exercise requires.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had an instructor that led a well-funded study on muscles and aging/sarcopenia.  This clearly was how he got paid to do what he loved.  He would go through all the neuro events and connections that occur before a signal ever arrives to the muscles.  He would simulate couplet and triplet transmission (sending the same signal 2x or 3x) and show the increase in strength.  He would also put college students in a cast for a week and biopsy the muscle.  Very little difference in tissue and muscle density was noted, but those neuro events had drastically changed.  The changes in strength, as you might guess, more closely mirrored what was going on in the nerves rather than the muscle.  And, to your point, his favorite example was always taking someone that hadn't worked out and having them lift weights.  Strength goes up quickly, but the muscles have very little reorganization and growth.  Instead, it is changes in the nerves...kinda a cool concept, and he seemed like a kid in his lab.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Seriously just walking up the flight of stairs to my (now old) office used to raise my heart rate to 130 and I would feel tired and start panting etc, and now it's like <em>aight this aint no thing</em>. Weight loss and exercise does wonders for you, even just walking a lot around the office every day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the other comments answer that. It's half of the answer, this is the other.</p>
<p>Your energy stores increase, ATP, ADP, and you use them more effeciently.</p></div>		</li>
