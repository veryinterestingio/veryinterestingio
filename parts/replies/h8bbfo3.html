<p>With ~$200 worth of equipment and ~$100 worth of ingredients, you can make 30 bottles of wine.  </p>
<p>So call that $10/bottle, then next time and Everytime after it's more like $3/bottle.</p></div>		</li>

I'm back in London now, but I cant seem to find the same quality/taste back here. Is there something specific about that type of wine that gets it flavour, are there any other types that have a similar profile that you know of?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wine is allocated and sold in specific quantities to specific places. CDP is one of the most competitive and recognizable AOCs in France, so there’s a good chance that if you were drinking the good shit, there would only be so many cases sold to one or two distributors in England, who would then sell it to collectors, private clients, and restaurants.</p>
<p>Some restaurants fight for two or three bottles of wine every year.</p>
<p>If you know who produced the wine, you can call around London to wine distributors and see if they have allocations of that producer and take it from there- you can also check out distributor portfolios online.</p>
<p>As for similar wines to CDP: CDP is in the southern Rhone valley and is almost always primarily a blend of Grenache, Syrah, and Mourvèdre grapes. Ask your wine shop for a GSM blend, or a Rhône blend, and they’ll give yo something in the ballpark. If you know the vineyard that produced the wines you like, you can look them up online and get the elevation, facing of the hills they were planted on, soil composition, and other info that you could use to try and find similar wines. Wine is influenced by how much chalk is in the soil and which side of the hill it’s planted on just as much, if not more so, than the species of grape it’s made of.</p>
<p>Also, I’m assuming you’re talking about red CDPs, but the magic really happens with their whites…</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, Gigondas and Vacqueyras are similar to  Châteauneuf-du-Pape while not being that expensive. I've tasted all of them (my SO's family lived there and usually friends who come over bring bottles) and while they are all three different if tasted at the same time, I couldn't pinpoint one or the other if I drank just one of them. And once they are aged, wine geeks and people who have a very educated palate will be able, but your average Joe won't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>chateauneuf-du-pape (cdp) is a blend of several rhone varietals. typically syrah, grenache and mourvèdre, though you can find many other grapes in cdp as well. these are commonly called rhône blends, and they’re my absolute favorite wines!  you can look to other regions like cotes du rhone, or gigondas if you’re looking to stay in france. in spain a region like priorat may have blends that you enjoy. portuguese blends from the duoro are also super tasty. in the states washington makes some tremendous rhône blends in the columbia and yakima valleys. california makes great rhône blends in areas like paso robles, central coast, and even sonoma (though not typically napa).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It means both. You can refer to a specific vintage, even a recent one, but describing something as “vintage” with no further qualifier definitely means old.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vintage</p>
<p>\9. representing the high quality of a past time:
vintage cars; vintage movies.</p>
<p>\10. old-fashioned or obsolete:
vintage jokes.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With champagne, a vintage is declared when a particular year is unique and good enough to stand on its own without blending. Most champagne you see at a store will not have a vintage as the wine is a combination of barrels from different years to produce a desired experience. A champagne producer may go many years without having a harvest worthy of being declared a vintage. These are good ones to buy and age as their value tends to increase over time. </p>
<p>If you’re interested in investing in champagne, Dom 2008 is considered one of their best vintages in the past 40 years and the value has steadily increased.</p></div>		</li>
