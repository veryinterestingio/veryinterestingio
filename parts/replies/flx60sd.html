<p>For the more technical answer, modern timekeeping is based on atomic clocks. Atomic clocks measure the number of oscillations of a cesium atoms. Really complicated and mathematically heavy but let's just say scientists pegged the length of a second to the time a cesium atom produces a particular number of oscillatotions/atomic vibrations.</p>

<p>To clarify, computers themselves don't have atomic clocks to keep track of time (although the internet time servers typically do, or are closely synched to an atomic clock). 99.99999% of computers use a quartz crystal that vibrates at a specific frequency, which means that a certain number of vibrations will equal exactly one second. It's not 100% perfect for say, scientific purposes but for 99.99% of cases, a computer could be left alone for decades and not have enough drift to cause any problems.</p></div>		</li>
