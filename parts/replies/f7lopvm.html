			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, for a long time it has confused me that we fish for crabs off Alaska and lobsters off Maine. I've always thought warm waters would enable faster growth, but the richer oxygen is why so many cold water organisms can't survive in warm waters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I follow you. Speculating also. I haven't seen any study mention atmospheric pressure, insofar the actual molecular density of a free flowing liquid with extreme pressures exerted onto it. Would we not find water more tightly packed together?</p>
<p>A popcorn kernel comes to mind when I try to imagine what I'm trying to explain. Water in its sea-level state is like a piece of popcorn with a lot more instantly available energy than the compressed unpopped kernel of the depths. Say10 pieces of popped popcorn occupy the same space as say 50 kernels.  My take on it is that when 02 Intake \ CO2 Exchange happens at these extreme pressures that more molecules are brute forced into these organisms of the abyss. The idea of decreased availability of oxygen in water is negated and more than compensated to the point of surplus for these giant creatures.</p>
<p>Any of you grad students using this hypothesis that I conjured while sitting on the toilet better realize that the  foundation of your paper is 6 beers and a McChicken sandwich.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way water behaves at depth doesn't actually change very much. Water is an incompressible fluid. It's density won't increase under compression. Increasing the pressure on it just makes it raise to that pressure until you finally compress it far enough to make non-crystalline ice.</p></div>		</li>
