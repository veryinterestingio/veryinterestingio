			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, since it prefers colder waters, it tends to limit the food sources in those waters. It is very easy to throw off a trout population by eliminating their food source with the introduction of rock snot. That is one of the biggest issues in many bodies of water here in NY. That is also why there are tons of warnings regarding the use of felt soled waders on the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation website. There are also ample warnings near the public fishing rights access and public access locations near popular trout and salmon waters, such as the Salmon River. Even the regulations guide (New York Freshwater Fishing Digest) has chunks of information regarding the transfer of rock snot.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Clouds form when water evaporates, which is the same mechanism that distills alcohol and evaporate maple syrup and such - the water (and alcohol, and maybe some other liquids, depending on what you're doing) turn into gas, leaving the other stuff behind. There are very few situations where water is picked up as a liquid and turned into clouds. </p>
<p>The only real risk with that is a hurricane or tornado picking up water and dropping it elsewhere, but again, the part of that that turns into clouds would be evaporating, leaving crap behind. </p>
<p>Lastly, clouds are made of tiny droplets, almost certainly too small for a diatom to survive within, and if they did, they'd have nothing to feed on to multiply. So you'd end up with a few diatoms that don't do anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay another question about rock snot.  Can this be transferred from river to river through watershed, and if so, how do you prevent it from jumping to different rivers and eventually infecting all water ways?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could, but one of the quirks with rock snot is that it sticks to rocks and other surfaces so well, that it would most easily travel by surface adhesion on objects going from river to river. It does not, under it's own power, travel.</p></div>		</li>
