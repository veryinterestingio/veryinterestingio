			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how it was with a family member of mine. They underwent 8 rounds. The first round they went to chemo in the morning and then worked the rest of the day. Maybe didn’t even have to take any further time off. </p>
<p>Further treatments they progressively got worse, to where they’d take a couple days off after treatment, a week off, and more. Symptoms didn’t usually set in until the next day or so though. </p>
<p>Their last couple treatments however they were so sick that they never got back to ‘normal’ between treatments, so they were laid up sick for several weeks. About a year ago they hit their year mark of remission so it’s a happy ending.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, it is indeed cumalative and gets harder as you progress. My first couple of rounds I breezed through. I've done 6 now and my last one was absolutely brutal. Still got 6 to go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They give you the good drugs with the chemo drugs and they take time to work them out of your system. I would be fine the day of my chemo treatment, sometimes even the next day but then the nausea would hit hard and it felt like I was always trying to take enough antiemetics or finding the right combo of them before everything went wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thankfully it was just the opposite for me...first one was the worst by far and got easier and easier as I approached the end until the last one my body was completely used to and I felt nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree with your answer, but will add that this varies a lot from one chemotherapy to another. I had oxaliplatin IV as part of mine. That hurt like a bastard going in with the pain building up during each 3 hour session. No sickness from it, but other weird side effects like extreme cold sensitivity.</p>
<p>The most painful part for me was foot sores that left me unable to walk.</p>
<p>Edit: because the same question had come up a bit. I had the oxaplatin through a cannula rather than a PICC line. I now know that this makes it more painful. It was a poor choice on my part driven by bad thinking and optimism that I'd only have a few rounds.</p>
<p>In answer to the other common question: yes, doing fine now thanks. Some things will never be the same but I am alive, spending time with my wife and kids and not having any further treatment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's so bizarre that chemo affects everyone so differently. my dad was on oxaliplatin biweekly for 2 years and the only side effect was the cold sensitivity which he viewed as a minor inconvenience. no nausea, no pain, and he frequently said he looked forward to the chemo weeks because he slept so much better after it (and usually slept during the infusion). i hope you are doing better!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obviously feel free to ignore if you don't want to answer, but I'm just curious if your dad recovered and if so was there any long term stuff he said he felt as a result of the chemo? Like did the cold sensitivity ONLY occur right after treatments or was it something he felt the entire time, or is it something he still deals with now?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And oxaliplatin put me in a deep dark hole for the 6 months I was on it. My vision constantly faded out to black and then back in. I was insanely nauseous and just so tired.</p>
<p>I had a port though, so no localized issues at the infusion site</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a less obvious front, people react to pretty much all drugs differently. I can down a bottle of most sleeping pills and not feel anything but nausea, while certain meds that cause mild drowsiness knock me out. It's even genetic and has led to most of my family becoming addicted to prescription drugs. </p>
<p>I've also known people who puke their guts out if they take imitrex but have no issue with other triptans. That one's oddly common given that I've never heard of it except anecdotally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom had the foot sores as well. By her last three treatments she was in a wheelchair due to the sores and because she could barely stand anymore. Thankfully she’s been in remission for ten years. I think most of the time she doesn’t believe it’s gone and she keeps expecting to wake up terminal. She’s terrified of going through chemo again. Now I’m possibly facing it myself. Having seen her go through it, I understand her fears.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing about chemo is that yes, it gets worse the more you do, but you kind of level up as you go. By the time you're all messed up it's been slowly building for long enough that you cope with it much better than if it hit you like that on the first go. Does that make sense? Good luck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fear of it coming back can be hard. It's probably more than just the gear of chemo though.</p>
<p>I hope you dodge it friend. If not do remember that everyone's experience of it is different. There are lots of forms of chemo that treat our bodies differently. Also our bodies are all different and cope in different ways.</p>
<p>Good luck</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. This is why anesthesiologists get paid so much for what seems like a simple job. All they’re doing is dosing and administering anesthesia. Which seems simple, but there is actually a lot of factors and even the slightest mistake could permanently disable or kill someone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about the sort of twilight sedation that dentists use for wisdom teeth?  Easier and cheaper to administer, and probably safer and more suitable for long term sedation (a whole day or two after each chemo treatment) </p>
<p>But perhaps it wouldn’t entirely eliminate discomfort, as general anesthesia would?</p></div>		</li>
