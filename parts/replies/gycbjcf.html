			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really good explanation! I knew that most of the issues with covid were due to both the low oxygen and the clotting due to the lungs being badly damaged on a cellular level. This explains all of that very well. At least, that sure seems to be why there would be clotting, as the body is trying to heal the wounds caused by the virus destroying the cells plus the tissue being stretched.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a strong suspicion that the Covid virus itself directly damages surface-lining cells called endothelial cells, and that damage to the endothelial cells lining blood vessels might be what causes the intense and hard to treat clotting that we see in Covid.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are the cells lining the alveoli, right? Definitely makes sense then. Cause if there is tissue damage caused by cell destruction, like a degraded sheet of rubber, when that lung tissue is then stretched by breathing it would tear, which is what would happen if you stretched such a sheet of rubber. Not the best analogy, but I guess it works. With that tearing comes clotting due to efforts to stop the resulting bleeding and heal the tears.</p>
<p>One thing I was hearing about was the respirators killing covid patients. If the lungs are so badly damaged that any use tears the alveoli, of course that'll happen. Btw, is extra oxygen used so that the lungs don't have to be fully inflated? Seems like that would help. Damaged tissue heals best when not being put under stress.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi and thank you for your work! I was on the clinop team for the third trial phase for one of the mRNA vaxx. COVID does cause damage to endothelial cells, though the mechanism of damage is either through direct damage to the cells or damage to the environment of the cells, which then results in their death/damage. </p>
<p>This damage is the current front runner as to why those with COVID suffer from lack of taste/smell. The damage to the endothelial cells runs down a line that eventually causes damage to our olfactory neurons. I try to explain to people that the loss of those senses isn’t because of being stuffy, like a lot of people think. It’s a literal neurological disease, which makes it significantly scarier</p></div>		</li>
