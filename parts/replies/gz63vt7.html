			<div class="markdown"><p>I was bitten by bats both times within a 2 year period. Day 1 ( the day I was bitten), I received 2 doses of the Vaccine and 3 doses of the Immune Globulin. The Vaccine was injected one in each arm and with the Globulin; 2 in the bite site and 1 in my buttocks ( opted there instead of my stomach).  The actual Vaccine itself was like any other shot I have experienced. I felt &quot; a little drained&quot; for about 12 hrs after each shot administered. The Rabies Immune Globulin on the other had was actually very painful. This was because it was injected subcutaneously instead of intramuscular. This meaning, injected between the skin and the muscle. I could feel the liquid fill up this space with and it was very painful.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, the standard of treatment is to only give immunoglobulin once ever; the idea is, by the second time, given that you also received a vaccine, you are already making your own as the body recognizes the intrusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was given rabies Ig after a dog bite a couple of years ago and it was very unpleasant. The amount of fluid they have to inject is quite high (9ml in my case vs. 0.3-1ml for an average vaccine), which left a large swollen blob under my skin near the wound for a day or so. Really grateful to have received it, but I wouldn't wish the experience on anyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>just watch one of those very NSFW videos on people that actually got rabies, and it will feel very pleasant, is incredible that we live in this world with that thing around us, if it wasn't so lethal will be a real plague zombie movie scenario.-</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find it just mind boggling that a virus with 100% lethality can still persist in the world. And the victim is not infected for long until they die, maybe a week or 2. Why hasn't this virus died out?</p></div>		</li>
