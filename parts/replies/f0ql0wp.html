<p>The salts and sugar help the water be absorbed faster by the body, as there is a natrium-glucose cotransporter in the intestines. You can look up oral rehydration solution for a medical product that does basically the same. But it does not hydrate the body more. You only get the water a few minutes quicker in the bloodstream.</p>
</blockquote>

<li>
<p>ORT does it much better, sports drinks and energy drinks mix hydration, energy and rebalancing, the ratios are not primarily geared towards hydration</p>
</li>
<li>in seriously serious situations, ORT absolutely does hydrate the body more, you can usefully input ORT at a much higher rate than water or gatorade (to the extent that IV hydration has been replaced by ORT the world over for cases of dehydration and severe illness: ORT is much safer and not far below in terms of hydration capacity, IV is only for the most extreme cases or fads)</li>
</ol>
<p>You're completely right that just drinking water is the better pick pretty much always though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. It would make you thirsty which might encourage you to drink water, but ORT works on a physiological process of cotransport: absorption of glucose by the intestine brings sodium along for the ride (cotransport), which causes water absorption to maintain osmotic pressure. This allows a much higher throughput of water through the gut lining and into the body (and thus allows rehydration even in the presence of ridiculous diarrhoea e.g. cholera).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely! Most people don't find it's the greatest-tasting thing on the planet, but it's not gonna hurt you in the slightest.</p>
<p>Plain, regular ole water is still best unless you're sweating very profusely for an extended period of time (think: outdoor football practice in full padding in the summer), though. Your body really knows how to manage water very effectively when you're not sick or otherwise incredibly physically stressed.</p></div>		</li>
