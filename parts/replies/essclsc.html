			<div class="markdown"><p>IANA scientist, but visible light is a form of radiation, so UV, xray, and gamma rays would never reach us either since they all travel at the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. To add, microwave, radiowave, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma are all the same thing, electromagnetic waves or electromagnetic radiation. They differ only in wavelength, and thus energy content. </p>
<p>Further, any massless particle travels at the speed of light, and can only travel at the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 1.8 comes the equations describing the cosmological redshift.  Yes, as the object recedes from us faster and faster, its light will become increasingly redshifted.  However, for the light that was emitted today by the object with a redshift of 1.8 or greater, all of its light (all wavelengths) will eventually be carried away from us by the expansion of the universe before it can reach us.  The technical details are in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0107568" target="_blank">this paper</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To generalize, the 1.8 is correlated to an extreme distance from earth - let’s call it “far” - and that any objects with a greater redshift - let’s call it “farther” - has such an extreme distance the current expansion of the universe will cause the photons emitted today to completely miss our place in spacetime at some point in the extreme future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The light we are observing it today left the object about 7 billion years ago, and has been traveling to us ever since.  The light that leaves the object today will never reach us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, I must be misunderstanding what a redshift means. So it's accelerating away from us, meaning light reaches us now, but in the future will not because it's accelerating away from us?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the two bodies do have mass. It seems like you are saying that while we are moving away from each other faster than light, we are not moving through space faster than light, and that makes the difference?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I read somewhere else in this thread (and it sounded logical), our universe has its own laws of physics. But outside it (whatever there may be) there might very well be other laws.</p>
<p>This sounds very weird, but our universe isn't in itself (like a balloon is not in the balloon) therefor it can be that it doesn't obey the laws of physics we know</p></div>		</li>
