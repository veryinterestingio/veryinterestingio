			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting, but could such a setup do anything to block the functionality of the site until you disable your adblocker? Or would it basically have to trick you into thinking so?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This already exists on many news sites, a paywall.</p>
<p>Another less used method of detecting ads is to serve them yourself, if someone requests pages and never hits an ad then they can be rerouted to a please turn off your blocker page</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, I was just contemplating what the point of the ad-overlayed-message would even be, if it couldn't function as a paywall. I assumed sort of tricking you into thinking it was a paywall. But now I recall that some sites are kind of nice and just say &quot;please support us by turning off your adblock!&quot; in a sidebar, so maybe it's mostly used for that purpose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work a big media company. We run both ad blockers and paywalls. Ublock origin can get you past the adblocker but the only way to avoid the paywall is to access the Amp version of the page. And even then we are in the process of closing that loophole. </p>
<p>Incognito used to get around the paywall but we closed that off first. The only way I know is a vpn and changing your ip</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's kinda static. That itself won't do anything to affect the functionality. However, the site may have other scripts that could.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just use the adblocker to hide the overlay. Might take a few clicks and a reload - but you can usually do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are fun because you just add the message container to the block list. For the scroll disabling ones a bookmarklet could &quot;fix&quot; it in a click. I think people are getting less savvy about this kind of thing though.</p></div>		</li>
