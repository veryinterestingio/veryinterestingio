I type this comment, press submit, and in less than one second the comment is sent from my device, to my router, to everything this guy mentioned, somehow gets to a website, communicates back the way it came, and gives me new data in my device, and my comment is live to an entire planet of people.... In less than one second. </p>

<p>I once flew a drone at the crack of dawn. It streamed video live from its stabilized camera back to my control unit, which sent it down a tiny cable into the attached phone. Because I didn't have a sim in that phone, the phone sent it to a second phone in my pocket (hotspot), which then rebroadcasted it over 4G to the nearest tower. The video then took the journey OP described, hit Facebook's servers, which then pinged my friends and allowed them to watch - in near real time - what I was looking at <em>over there</em> while standing <em>over here</em>.</p>
<p>This is all consumer technology. The future is gonna be <em>kickass</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So when a government decides to censor information on the internet, how do they do that? Do they force ISPs to block certain pieces of data, or do they prevent ISPs from making certain connections (or all connections like in North Korea)? Is the censorship done at the physical network level or the digital network?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a billion different ways to do it. They could have a presence in all of the mentioned data centers or just important ones and tell every ISP, you have to route your traffic through our router before you can do anything else with it. Then at their router they'll determine what to do after inspecting the data.</p>
<p>Or they could supply ISPs with the hardware to do it. Or lots of other things.</p>
<p>Bluecoat is a massive player in this game and they build the equipment for everything from businesses keeping their employees off facebook to whole countries keeping their citizens off facebook. I have built and administered a few Bluecoat implementations, it's very powerful stuff, especially if you have access to root authority certs, which a well administered business/organization would for any machines on their network and a country just <em>might</em> have them for various root certificate authorities around the world that everyone uses no one really knows if they've been compromised on that level but I wouldn't be surprised if a few have. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a super high level overview, but they basically run all continental traffic through their own DNS (name) servers and security appliances (hardware firewalls) that perform packet inspection and are configured for restrictive filtering. All ISPs there are by law required to run their inbound and outbound connections through these filters as an additional hop. Depending on the location, this is either done internally by the ISP or at a dedicated site.</p>
<p>Here is a nice article on it:</p>
