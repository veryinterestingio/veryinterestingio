			<div class="markdown"><p>Happy cake day to both of us! And I don't think the bliss point applies here because meat is still way more satisfying than other things with the same amounts of salt and fat. It's also super delicious unsalted, and without much fat (like plain lean ground beef). I haven't looked at the other comments yet but I suspect that our body can detect all of the nutrients in meat.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In terms of detecting nutrients I’m not sure - digestion and absorption of those nutrients would depend on a lot of different factors as well. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I'd argue though that the reason that texture was satisfying in the first place is that over the hundreds of thousands of years of evolution of our species that texture generally had the most nutrients we needed.</p>
<p>Even if we can't sense exactly what nutrients were in it we knew that texture + that fat + that saltiness were what we needed to stay alive many, many years ago.</p></div>		</li>
