			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer is that scar tissue is made up of a collagen-based matrix.  Vitamin C is a major building block of collagen and so the maintenance of these tissues is significantly diminished.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eating less carbohydrate results in needing less vitamin C. This is because glucose competes with Vitamin C for access to the same metabolic pathways in the body.</p>
<p>So if your carbohydrate intake is high, you will have to increase your intake of vitamin C containing foods or natural supplements to get enough vitamin C to overcome the high blood sugar. It's only when eating the standard American diet which is high in carbohydrates and grain consumption that vitamin C needs are higher. Lowering your carb intake lowers the need to supplement with Vitamin C.</p>
<p>Don't believe it? Read this:</p>
<p>While studying the Inuit people in Alaska, anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson documented the fact that the Inuit diet consisted of about 90% meat and fish. During his time there, he followed their custom, and he and the entire tribe would eat nothing but meat and fish for 6-9 months of each year. This was essentially a zero carb ketogenic diet. Stefansson survived on this ketogenic diet for 9 years while living with the Eskimo. When he returned to city life and described his experiences, doctors were amazed that his health had not suffered.</p>
<p>Stefansson himself wondered if his health had suffered during those years, so he agreed to an experimental study. He would live at the Bellevue hospital in New York City and eat nothing but fat and meat for an entire year. The doctors involved with this study came from Harvard, Cornell and other prestigious organizations, and they were convinced that he and another volunteer, Dr. Karsten Anderson, would develop health problems or at least vitamin deficiencies.</p>
<p>The volunteer's food intake was kept under close scientific scrutiny, so cheating was out of the question. The food that they ate was analyzed and the end of the study, the daily totals were averaged and noted:</p>
<p>Total daily calories: 2000-3100</p>
<p>Daily Protein Intake: 100-140 grams (15-25% of calories)</p>
<p>Daily Fat Intake: 200-300 grams (75-85% of calories)</p>
<p>Daily Carbohydrate Intake: 7-12 grams (1-2% of calories)</p>
<p>At the end of the experiment, Stefansson and Anderson remained in perfect health - no vitamin deficiencies or serious health issues occurred. The results of the study were published by the Journal of Biological Chemistry in 1930.</p>
<p>It's kind of ironic.. eating fruits and vegetables increases your carbohydrate intake, which increases the danger of a vitamin C deficiency. Good thing that fruits and vegetables have vitamin C included.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don’t organ meats have adequate vitamin levels if you eat enough of them? My understanding was that the Inuit did OK because they ate plenty of organ meat (and skin, cartilage, etc), so their results don’t reflect what would happen to someone who tried to live on “normal” grocery store cuts of meat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was this guy who has a broad range of massive food allergies, and he can only eat raw meat. He said you get enough Vit C if you basically eat all the part of animals, including the ones that are usually removed in western cuisine, like connective tissue and organ parts. <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/nnqw3q/this-guy-has-eaten-nothing-but-raw-meat-for-five-years" target="_blank">https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/nnqw3q/this-guy-has-eaten-nothing-but-raw-meat-for-five-years</a></p>
<p>That would line up with how Inuit diets worked. Also I guess the raw part is important, since boiling, frying, barbecuing makes water soluble vitamins leak out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they were eating an authentic Inuit diet they'd still be getting some vitamin c from raw meat. I have no difficulty believing that the need is reduced by a low carbohydrate diet, but it's not eliminated. </p>
<p>OP's question was starvation, not unusual diet, and so perhaps it would be beri beri or rickets instead of scurvy, but I'd still expect the body to run out of micronutrients or even protein before total calories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think we run out of energy before we run out of nutrients. I watched a documentary about a morbidly obese woman who stopped eating and eventually died when her nerves stopped working as she'd ran out of nutrients. She lost a lot of weight and survived a lot longer than a non-obese person would have been able to just on her fat though.</p></div>		</li>
