<p>The inner ear is a spiral, and there are tiny hairs all the way from the tip to the inside. The deeper the hair into the spiral, the lower the frequency response that hair is “responsible” for. The detection for high frequencies is closer to the entrance of the cochlea (inner ear) because low frequency tones have the energy to push the air alllll the way down to the end of the spiral. High frequencies are little laser like air movements detectable even in small changes. I assume this has something to do with how sound cancellation attenuates. It would be different for everyone because the hairs die over time. This is also why you lose the high end of your hearing first, because the low end is deep in your ears and the hair takes more energy to damage. Humans tend to hear 1kHz-4kHz “louder” due to our biological need to hear voices, branches moving etc. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Welp, I'm terrified. No more dubstep or EDM for me. Strictly harpsichord from here on out. </p></div>		</li>
