<p>While not common, there are certain indications for skin grafts but they are often in salvage after poor outcome rather than primarily. One example that jumps to mind is to the lower eyelid after bleph with resulting ectropion due to over resection of skin or unlucky scarring. </p>
<p>However, other grafts are very common. Fat grafting is one of the most common plastic surgery procedures in both cosmetic and recon. You suck the fat out, wash it, and re inject it where you want. This is how Brazilian butt lifts are performed although that would be considered massive amounts of fat grafting and lipo sculpting.</p></div>		</li>
