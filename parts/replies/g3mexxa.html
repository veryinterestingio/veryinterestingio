			<div class="markdown"><p>This is indeed true for many applications, though a phone charger would most likely use a switching mode power supply, rather than a transformer.  A transformer would be heavy and bulky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Switch mode power supplies used in most cell phone chargers are mostly what’s called a fly back topology and do in fact use a transformer for galvanic isolation for safety. You’re probably thinking of linear transformer designs like the old brick style AC/DC adapters more popular from the 80-90s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While not always true, many switching mode power supplies still have a transformer but it can be smaller than an equivalent linear supply because it’s not on all the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be smaller because it operates at much higher frequency so you need less inductance to transfer the same amount of power.</p></div>		</li>
