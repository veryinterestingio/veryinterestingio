			<div class="markdown"><p>Certainly it will be the case that plants are less &quot;floppy&quot;. Structures that are not rigid enough to serve as adequate support on Earth might very well work on the Moon -- plants that grow as vines on Earth might be able to support themselves. <a href="https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2229-12-232" target="_blank">We discovered relatively recently that some aspects of root growth which were thought to depend on gravity don't, which is a good sign, at least for the particular species tested.</a> But apparently <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23889757/" target="_blank">phototropism, i.e. growing towards or away from light, is reduced in low gravity.</a> The effect of reduced gravity on various plant behaviors is still an area of active research, including <a href="https://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/Experiment/exper/13379" target="_blank">recent ISS experiments</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting.  How about on the cellular level?  I've heard that humans in reduced or micro gravity lose bone density and can have vision problems.  Are there equivalant problems that are suspected with the growth of plants?</p></div>		</li>
