			<div class="markdown"><p>So if you had something like a dialysis machine, except that it oxygenated blood and removed CO2, would you lose the urge to breath?</p>
<p>EDIT: did a little research to see if such a device has any practical purpose. Turns out, it's basically the &quot;lung&quot; part of a heart-lung machine.</p>
<p>So now we just need a someone to be conscious while on a heart-lung machine, and they can answer the question. Any volunteers? üòÄ</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is why CO and other gases kill people without them knowing.  All the body knows is that CO2 is leaving the body, so no panic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lifeguard PSA:</p>
<p>It's dangerous to hyperventilate (many rapid breaths or even several deeper exhalations) before attempting a long no-breath swim. Yes, it helps you stay under longer without breathing--but not from an increase in O2. Rather, you're pushing your blood CO2 levels below the threshold that your body uses to trigger breathing urgency. You can therefore abruptly pass out underwater and drown.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A friend of mine was on a breathing machine while he was in the hospital from a motorcycle wreck and he said that when they took him off it, he freaked out because he had to start breathing on his own again. It only took a little while for him but I e heard people that are in there longer need more help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Presumably that was a ventilator? So his lungs were still being used but maybe not his muscles. There are varying levels of support given depending on how fucked up you are. </p>
<p>If your lungs are really fucked, but they think maybe recoverable, you may get ECMO, which is a machine that oxygenates your blood for you. Some COVID patients have had this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if the mother were to start suffocating, like for instance she was drowning, would that cause the baby to start breathing in the womb due to the increase in c02 in the mother's bloodstream? What would happen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The baby would have increased urge to breathe, but there's no air in there. If mum drowns the baby would too.
If a pregnant woman dies suddenly the baby can survive for few minutes, if this happens in a hospital and a peri-mortem c-section can be done fast enough the baby can survive. Most drownings don't happen close enough to a hospital for this to be successful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure about the c02 part nessecarily, but if the mom suffered a trauma or is having trouble breathing it usually sends the baby into distress and eventually the baby's heart rate starts slowing down-- I assumed because it wasn't getting enough oxygen, but the c02 part makes more sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, but I think a lot of OBs are trying to walk people off the crazy path, and you can‚Äôt force them. Birth is just the first step, then there‚Äôs vit K, DTaP, regular checkups, MMR, keeping tabs to make sure the kid isn‚Äôt handling feces from the indoor/outdoor cat... it never ends if parents aren‚Äôt on board.</p>
<p>Her kiddo is fine, BTW. Two weeks of anguish, but he‚Äôs fine. Same age as mine, our friendship suffered a bit when I had a c-section and she did that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My brother was born two weeks overdue and mom said his placenta was grey, and clearly on the way out. In the UK two weeks is about the limit before they will induce you.</p>
<p>While I might not agree with decisions made by some women bodily autonomy is really important. For this issue for example, being induced comes with a lot of risks in itself. I think most of us would say it's worth it to avoid the far worse but perhaps smaller risk to the baby, but we can't force that. </p>
<p>For people who are already &quot;pro natural&quot;, attempting to control and coerce them will only make them double down while also losing trust from everyone else.</p>
<p>Historically there have been so many issues with women not having control or autonomy during birth. The answer is education, not control.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, that can also happen if you give birth at full term. I guess there is greater risk the later you leave it since the baby's systems are all matured and ready to go. (With my daughter we had meconium but thankfully she didn't breathe any in. She was born bang on time.)</p>
<p>I can't imagine being able to wait four weeks past your due date. I was so terrified of something going wrong right at the end, stillbirth is a very risk if you go overdue. Not to mention how uncomfortable life gets at the end of pregnancy.</p></div>		</li>
