			<div class="markdown"><p>That's sort of what I suspected might be happening sometimes but I didn't want to be too cynical since I don't really actually know shit about tech ðŸ˜… But others have also offered good explanations about how the last 10% can take longer because it's a qualitatively different process than the others, so I'm sure it can be either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This only happens on REALLY shitty websites. It is objectively terrible UX to show a meaningless progress bar. It's less terrible - but still bad - to show a progress bar that doesn't take into account the time it takes to complete tasks. </p>
<p>Making a progress bar that's accurate can be very hard and developers often don't want to waste time on something comparatively trivial.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But then I'm confused. You say in the beginning only really shitty designs have meaningless progress bars, but then at the end you sort of seem to imply that meaningless-to-some-degree progress bars are a relatively logical choice for developers.</p>
<p>Or am I inferring the wrong thing? Like is it sort of implicit that there's a wide gulf between the &quot;meaningless&quot; progress bars (i.e. no correlation to actual progress whatsoever) at the beginning of your comment, and the &quot;inaccurate&quot; progress bars at the end (i.e. some correlation but still not specifically representative)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in the modern day, you're right to a certain degree, but it's worth stating that in the past, progress bars were expressly meaningless, except as a means to show that the computer hadn't crashed; in the beginning, there were no progress bars, but once computers went mass-market some tasks that were slower than a minute or so would make users think the computer had frozen, and they'd reboot it, thus aborting the process and requiring them to start from scratch.</p>
<p>In essence, for the barest of UX, it's better to have a meaningless progress bar than to not have a progress bar at all.</p></div>		</li>
