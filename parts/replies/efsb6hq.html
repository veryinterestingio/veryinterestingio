			<div class="markdown"><p>Ethanal is oxidized to ethanoic acid. This process requires an oxidizing agent, NAD+. Sugar is oxidized through various steps which need NAD+ too. Sugar oxidization happens everywhere in your body including your liver. So both the sugar degradation and the ethanal degradation needs NAD+, but your liver can only produce so much of it and generally only has a limited amount of energy to work with. It will prefer to degrade sugar, as it needs the energy (specifically in this case and generally your cells take as much energy as they can get for evolutionary reasons) so ethanal degradation will suffer. Ethanal is toxic and relatively small amounts will already cause hangover symptoms which, obviously, are worse the more ethanal is in your bloodstream.</p>
<p>Fun fact: two enzymes participate in ethanal degradation, ALDH1 and ALDH2, the latter one doing most of the work. A lot of Asians (~30-50%, depends on specific ethnicity) have a small mutation in their ALDH2 gene which makes it useless, which is why a lot of Asians don't tolerate alcohol very well. This mutation is not seen in the gene pool of other ethnicities.</p>
<p>For specifics: a blood alcohol level of 0,05% in a European person results in an ethanal level of less then 2 micromoles per liter. In a Japanese person the same blood alcohol level results in an ethanal level of about 35 micromoles, so about 18 times as much, which results in much worse symptoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't this basically what I described here? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/anb26b/comment/efsydrv" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/anb26b/comment/efsydrv</a></p>
<p>I'm genuinely curious, since the thing about sugar inhibiting ethanal metabolization was just a passing remark in our OChem lecture and I researched the mechanism by myself. So basically the limiting factor for both is NAD+/NADH ratio and both are &quot;competing&quot; for NAD+? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be very surprised if the liver preferred metabolizing fructose over acetaldehyde. Mammals have had a hundred million years of eating rotten fruit to get that metabolic pathway figured out. Not to mention the liver basically never runs out of fructose storage, you'd probably have to literally starve yourself for weeks to run out of liver fructose.</p></div>		</li>
