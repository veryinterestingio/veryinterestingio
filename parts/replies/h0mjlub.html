			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The moment of maximum magnetic field strength corresponds to minimum electric field strength, and vise versa. The process of one field collapsing creates the other. This symmetrical transformation of energy is what allows photons to propagate in the first place. They are, after all, massless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not true. Maxima occur in the electric and magnetic fields at the same time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to tag onto what Pan has said, those electric and magnetic waves are perpendicular to one another. So while looking at one sinusoidal waveform, you can imagine the other coming in and out of the screen/paper in what would be considered the “z” direction were this spatial coordinates.</p></div>		</li>
