<p>It’s just a cosmetic thing so my landlord isn’t going to do anything about it, but was wondering what you suggested? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>House cleaner here, hot water, a bit of Dawn dish soap, and a lot of elbow grease if it's really dirty. I'd recommend starting with a good microfiber mop that is well wrung out, like O'Cedar spin mop. Once you've cleaned it well that way, you'll be able to see the trouble spots and go at them with a microfiber cloth. </p></div>		</li>
