			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact. Because some loading operations are linear and sequential, it might not be that much faster.</p>
<p>Depends on how MSPaint is coded, but if its not well parallelised, basically, it might be waiting on stuff to get done before it even starts to think about other stuff. Think maybe it waits for the ribbon buttons to load before it begins loading the icons and text. That seek time might be the bottleneck, not operations per second.</p>
<p>You can't hire two pregnant women to get a baby faster than 9 months is a good way to think about that.</p>
<p>But, that said, you could probably open millions and millions of MSPaint copies simultaneously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Computers and software use what we call the client and server model.</p>
<p>While a client (PC) and server are functionally the same thing underneath they perform different roles.</p>
<p>A client accesses data (surfs the web, accesses a database, opens files, checks email) while a server presents data or serves data (hosts a website, a database, fileshares, or email database)</p>
<p>Basically it's the difference between a machine meant to perform a task and be accessed remotely vs a machine meant to sit in front of a person that is optimized for it's interface.</p>
<p>But if they are fundamentally the same thing why are servers so much more expensive?</p>
<p>Server hardware is purpose built for that role, so they have optimized processors, redundant RAM + Hard drives + power supplies, and extra redundancies meant to keep them running 100% of the time. You can have these same technologies in your PC at home but cost wise it just isn't practical.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This isn't necessarily true. A significant portion of the pricing for servers is due to support, warranty and guaranteed compatibility.</p>
<p>Like building a &quot;normal&quot; PC, if you're happy to do away with those (besides warranty, because that's just shifted to the component level) and don't need vendor specific software/hardware (i.e. iDrac), you can usually build a server with &quot;enterprise&quot; components cheaper.</p>
<p>I'm building a server at the moment with bog standard components, i3-10320, non ecc ram (though this is only because it isn't supported by the CPU) etc for media serving and backups.
I'm not fussed about having ECC ram as I'll have end-to-end integrity checks on my backups.
It'll easy outperform any new Dell Server &lt;£2000 whilst costing &lt;£600.
The vast majority (if not all?) of consumer hardware is designed to run 24/7. That said, I will be using NAS HDDs.</p></div>		</li>
