<p>Gut coiling is a current area of research, symmetries and coiling type are not random but controlled through complex regulatory pathways! In fact coiling the wrong way or not at all is a known disease phenotype they are attempting to pinpoint the genetic architecture behind.  </p>
<p>Not so random, just complex! Supa coooool</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget physics! Those complex signaling pathways actually lead to a pretty simple physical explanation of the standardized coiling. The labs of Lakshminarayan Mahadevan (MIT) and Cliff Tabin (Harvard) published an interesting paper on this in 2011. </p>
<p>Here is an excerpt from their abstract:<br />
<em>Here we use developmental experiments to eliminate alternative models and show that gut looping morphogenesis is driven by the homogeneous and isotropic forces that arise from the relative growth between the gut tube and the anchoring dorsal mesenteric sheet, tissues that grow at different rates. A simple physical mimic, using a differentially strained composite of a pliable rubber tube and a soft latex sheet is consistent with this mechanism and produces similar patterns.</em></p>
<p>Here's a news article describing/linking to the paper (which is behind a paywall, but happy to share) <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2011/08/gut-coils-help-its-elastic-neighbor" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2011/08/gut-coils-help-its-elastic-neighbor" target="_blank">https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2011/08/gut-coils-help-its-elastic-neighbor</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably more common in veterinary medicine due to breed predisposition and lifestyle. In horses, intestinal volvulus and strangulation can be associated with colic. Things like foreign body obstructions, tumors, hernias, intussusception (one portion of the intestine slides into the next, causing a blockage), mesenteric torsion etc. can cause ischaemia in any of our pets. Humans thankfully aren't silly enough to eat a rock and then zoom so hard that our guts flippy-flop inside of us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s <em>always</em> horses. I swear I don’t know where that expression “healthy as a horse” comes from. </p>
<p>They can’t vomit so they kind of just, die, if they ingest something inappropriate. They got these massive bodies and these little spindly legs, which break easily. And what about when they get stressed and they start swallowing air (which they can’t burp out) so you have to use a syringe to deflate them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Omg, my horse did something like this. She zoomed too hard and looped her intestine over her left kidney. 36hrs and $750 in vet bills later, lived to zoom again. The most absurd part; the vet couldn't fix it without $20,000 surgery, so my friend said why don't we just lift/support her belly and see what happens. Suddenly normal again. Intestine slid off kidney and fell back into place. It's unreal the way stuff is all set up in there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Google “volvulus rates” and you’ll get some info.</p>
<p>Very rare below 65, rare above that.</p>
<p>This article mentions a possibly different kind, ischemia was a somewhat vague term, but it has a few statistics in the intro you might be interested in.  If you check out the top ncbi links in that volvulus rates google search you might find more.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>200k per year is not rare. So 0.1% get it every year?? 5% of people get it in their lifetime? 1/20 is not very rare my dude, surely those numbers are off.</p>
<p>Edit: so in reading your link 63,749 cases were diagnosed from 2002 to 2010. That's roughly 7k per year. Not sure where your 200k figure is from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Volvulus and mesenteric ischemia are different things. Ischemia means inadequate blood flow to a tissue in the body (in this case the mesentery/bowel) and volvulus is a possible, albeit rare, cause of mesenteric ischemia. Other causes include atherosclerotic disease (narrowing of the arteries from cholesterol/plaque, like in heart attacks) and embolism ( a clot from somewhere else, usually the heart, travels through the bloodstream and clogs one of the mesenteric arteries).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My grandmother had a bowel impaction last year, which killed a big portion of her intestine. I wasn't there, but going by what my mother told me, it is horrifically painful, and morphine wasn't doing much, she was basically delirious with pain for about 2 days until they put her under. She had a stroke at some point during this event, maybe due to high blood pressure from pain? But it lead to brain damage and she just never woke up after surgery.</p>
<p>People, if you don't poop for like, a week, go to the ER before you get an impaction or an obstruction :/</p></div>		</li>
