<p>This is really important for stuff like golf clubs and hockey sticks, because if my stick is really stiff, a little bit of flex absorbs a lot of force.</p>

<p>Isn't the point that it <em>doesn't</em> absorb the force but instead puts most of it right back into the thing you're hitting? </p>
<p>For example if I drop a ball on a rug it won't bounce as high as off hardwood because the rug absorbs the bounce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but this is ELI5. If you want a more scientific answer, the force from your slap shot is converted to elastic energy in the hockey stick, then the elastic energy is converted back into kinetic when you hit the puck. The energy is &quot;absorbed&quot;, then released.</p></div>		</li>
