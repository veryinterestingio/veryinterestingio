			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, at the very least homeless people are still gonna have head lice, and that will act as a reservoir for future contamination. Might be fewer cases for a while but it will be back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who works in an elementary school, your hope that head lice will be treated in so optimistic. I had a few students who had it year-round and the families were basically of the opinion that treating it wasn't needed because they would just get it again. Some will get treated but some will continue to have it just because their living situation isnt terribly sanitary and no one at home cares to treat it (or can't afford the supplies to do so).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's prevalent enough here that, by state law, we are not allowed to send kids home over it. I believe the exception is if the school nurse sees live adult lice but not every school has a nurse. CPS is also fairly direct that unless it's coupled with other concerns, lice is not an issue that warrants their involvement. I think they see it as an affect of poverty and don't want to separate children from their parents just because they are poor. I understand the concern but I also think there should be a plan for helping these children get treated. I'm already planning to put together a hygiene pantry at my school next year so that these students/families can hopefully have some resources. It makes me so upset to see children coming to school has hungry, in dirty clothes, obviously not bathed, when I know it's because the family just doesn't have the money to make it happen. To me, there's no reason for that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At my daughter's elementary school, 2 of the kids (sibling) constantly spread head lice to the school.</p>
<p>They would be denied until treated, but after a few weeks without lice they would return with lice and pass it on.</p>
<p>It's only later the school realized the parent(s) didn't treat themselves &quot;because only kids have head lice&quot; and thus, constantly re-infected their kids (and the school).</p></div>		</li>
