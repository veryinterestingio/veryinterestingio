			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally, it abscesses. It causes an infection under the skin that depending on your immune system could heal itself, or go bad, really bad. &quot;Misses&quot; are bad, but hitting an artery is worse. All of the nasty particulate matter in the syringe gets shoved through the smallest and most delicate of the hand/arm's blood vessels, causing them to rupture, this causes immediate pain and swelling due to the tissue damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting.  Sometimes when I get blood drawn something feels very wrong and I end up getting a giant bruise, while other times it feels 'normal' and I get no bruise. I always assumed some were missing the vain.  Any thoughts on this?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Apparently this doesn't happen anymore. What i get for commenting on something i last did nearly a decade ago!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you explain what you mean by &quot;patent&quot;, &quot;aspirate&quot; &quot;subcut&quot; (I'm assuming subcutaneous? but not sure what you mean when you say it) and &quot;IM&quot;.</p>
<p>Also EBP.</p>
<p>Sounds interesting but I don't know what those terms are in this context.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could still have an air bubble if you draw your own blood. You need to push the plunger all the way down after drawing anything into it to get rid of an air bubble. Funny enough though, I immediately thought the exact same thing until I thought about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pushing the plunger all the way down does not get rid of the air, as the actually hollow needle at the end is still full of air, as well as the space between the needle, and the plunger itself which is the &quot;dead volume&quot;. This is why you may have heard them mention &quot;Low Dead Volume&quot; syringes for COVID. Because they have a much much smaller &quot;dead space&quot; more vaccine goes into arms because less waste is left behind in the syringe that gets discarded.</p>
<p>Usually you would pull enough liquid into the syringe to fill that dead space and a little more, then push the plunger down all the way, which now the dead space is full of liquid, rather than air, and draw back on it which will fill the rest, ideally without air if done right.</p></div>		</li>
