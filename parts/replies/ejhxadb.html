			<div class="markdown"><p>Don’t plants have a crazy amount of energy as compared to consumers? ~90% of energy consumers eat is lost to heat. This 90% drop in energy continues to reduce the amount consumers receive from consumption as first level consumers are eaten by other consumers, etc.. They have higher metabolisms for sure, but they have to eat a high amount of food because of the loss of energy in the transfer of trophic levels. </p></div>		</li>
