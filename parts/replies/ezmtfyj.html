			<div class="markdown"><p>The sound energy is very small compared to the power lost as heat.  But it is not zero.  Optimizing the steel alloy used to get low magnetostriction is part of how low loss is achieved.  But magnetostriction is typically called out as a separate spec from the loss because the noise is annoying even when the loss from it is negligible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Car engines are notoriously inefficient in themselves, yes.  But equally unfortunate is burning all that fuel to move a 4,000 pound hunk of metal around to transport a 180 pound human passenger.  Iâ€™m quite certain I once read that less than 5% of the fuel burned in a car engine actually goes to moving the human(s) inside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once I learned about the electronics that are actually at work inside of a regular old microwave, I was so surprised.  Really high-power transformers, big capacitors, very high voltages and the magnetron itself.... really pretty dangerous stuff to be around, but nobody gives it a second thought.  It's both amazing and scary at the same time.</p></div>		</li>
