			<div class="markdown"><p>Borealopelta is what we affectionately refer to as a &quot;bloat and float.&quot; What's weird is that most of these types of fossils tend to fall apart and look terrible, but it seems like this specimen sank and was buried relatively quickly. That's a good first step, because the sediment/water interface is actually a pretty destructive zone, so removing remains from scavenging and other degradational processes is a good first step. There's a cool, recent study on an artificial &quot;<a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/deep-sea-gator-fall" target="_blank">alligator fall</a>&quot; in deep water, that will probably end up being a really good point of comparison for understanding this specific fossil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in Knoxville.  I have always planned to go back to school and get my Ph. D. in paleontology, preferably human.  I am sorely disappointed to discover that there are no such classes in the anthropology Dept now.  What area should I look into -geology?  Evolutionary biology?  I’ll probably have to get another bs since my undergrad degree was in the political science honors program.</p></div>		</li>
