			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m an 80s baby and had a toy that did something similar in the 90s( minus the lsd) it was as a big mat that hung from the wall and had a flash that imposed your shadow on the mat, we figured out rather quickly that it one person stood behind the flash you could also close your eyes and see the image that was imposed on the mat. It became its own game of who did what. </p>
<p>Now I can imagine my youth spent playing drug games without the drugs!</p></div>		</li>
