Such as having ethnic minority rule in order to keep  political in fighting going with the locals while the exploitation of natural resources by the colonizers was happening in the open.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Durand line is an internationally recognised border, recognised by all countries and supranational organisations of the world, except by Afghanistan which insists that the border was &quot;time limited&quot;, whereas no such wording exists in their border demarcation treaty with the former British empire</p>
<p>The only proper conflict the Durand line has seen (outside of the Anglo-Afghan wars, or the Taliban terrorism of today) was the ill-fated attempt by the Kingdom of Afghanistan to infiltrate it with soldiers and militia to create an uprising in the local pashtun people inside Pakistan back in the 1950s. Pakistan not only successfully routed the Afghan military and militias, but even bombed Afghan tanks inside Afghanistan using the airforce</p>
<p>Since then, successive Afghan governments have made noise about the border to garner local votes and support, but internationally it's not even considered a dispute, let alone a &quot;conflict for generations&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not really understanding what the point of that colonizer dig is, they still would need to use some geographical features to mark things off.</p>
<p>Also isn't every country going to want favorable borders for themselves?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Take a look at the borders in Africa or the Middle East, and compare them to borders in Europe. Former colony borders are often just straight lines, drawn with little consideration about the people living there. It's one of the reasons why there is so much conflict in these regions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, bordered were (and mostly still are) not physical, in fact, many borders were set without even knowing what was there. For example, when Portugal and Spain split the unknown world in the Tordesillas treaty they just split it on a more or less random vertical line. The border ended up not sticking but thatâ€™s how colonisers did things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The colonizers usually set the boundary based on politics, ensuring that the total area of a colony wouldn't upset the political balance. This is especially evident in the post WW2 era where the colonies were split into countries simply by drawing straight lines without regard to geography, religion, language, or culture.</p></div>		</li>
