			<div class="markdown"><p>Computer Engineering is kind of a crossover between CS and EE. In the days of old most CS people were either electrical engineers or mathematicians of some variety. A simplification perhaps but Alan Turing, for example, was a mathematician primarily. Computer Engineering is sort of like a modern incarnation of these sorts of developers.  </p>
<p>Computer Engineering, not unlike CS and EE, is actually pretty vague. It can be used to refer to an electrical engineer working mostly in computer systems, someone who develops integrated circuits (a super vague classification in itself), or maybe just someone writes software primarily for execution on hardware with electrical interfaces. I fall into the latter.  </p>
<p>To give you an idea in school getting a computer engineering degree I had core classes in math, electrical engineering, computer science, and physics (to a lesser extent). I also took some mechanical engineering  electives for a better understanding of mechatronic systems. You learn electrical engineering design principles, code (assembly, C, C++, Python, Javascript), Hardware description code (Verilog, VHDL), and algorithm design/analysis. It is like having a minor degree in math, CS, and EE. Professionally you will likely fall into a more specific specialty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my experience so far, it hasn't really mattered much. </p>
<p>I could have taken EE, CS or CE and done exactly what I'm doing now. </p>
<p>But I think CE was certainly more fun. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™m in computer engineering, and it mostly involves writing code specificity for hardware. It can range from programming drivers so your graphics card can work with your CPU all the way to designing integrated circuits. It falls right in between CS and Electrical Engineering. Computer Engineering is often flexible enough to work in most CS or EE jobs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone in IT, I would say that IT just ensures that there is cement available when needed.  Yes, we keep the mixer running, but we also ensure that the raw materials are always there to be mixed and that the cement gets to the site ready to use.  We also run more than one mixer as regular maintenance is needed that will take a mixer out of production, and we need to maintain 100% uptime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aside from the stuff in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/anr40s/eli5_whats_the_difference_between_cs_computer/efw4xrs/" target="_blank">my other reply</a>, IT/CE don't really need to know <em>anything</em> about academic CS for their core competencies - they are interested in making stuff that behaves up to spec - whatever that is. But you absolutely <em>need</em> to know the chemical properties of cement to built and maintain a mixer.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Pure CS could be done - and still provide useable knowledge - by writing on a cave wall with a charred bone chunk, and thinking those blinky boxes are fairy houses. At least at the current stage, theoretical chemistry can come up with stuff, only for it to turn out that theory is great, except for that part where it doesn't work in our universe.</p></div>		</li>
