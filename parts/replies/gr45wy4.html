			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife took me in to have a nosey at a bed sale in a department store. There was a nice looking one but before we could look at the price chart we were pounced on by a salesman. I absolutely loathe predatory salespeople. The sale price was $6,000 down from $10,000. I wasn't actually looking to spend any money that day but the guy took my refusal to buy as some tough haggling tactics. It went from free delivery, to &quot;actually its end of month so I can knock off $1,000 if you buy today&quot;. This $10,000 bed somehow ended up under $2,000. Makes you wonder what the actual cost is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My brother sells mattresses so I can give you the actual answer. Its a lot like how phones are sold. Some distributors (not all models) will not allow a price to go under a certain amount, but the salesman can make up for it by dropping prices on other items like pillows, frames, sheets, etc. Most mattresses will come down in price though. Insider tip, you can request a mattress that someone took back within the &quot;trial&quot; period for up to 1/3 of the price. These mattresses are basically brand new and most of them were only used for a couple days.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If &quot;the mob&quot; had enough Capital to have a mattress store in every town, they wouldn't need to be the mob in the first place.</p>
