			<div class="markdown"><p>The ancient egyptian empire was absolutely a large power in the middle east, it was comprised largely of modern-day Cairo and hugged the mediterranean coast to encompass what is now israel, lebanon, and jordan. Other than that it spread south on the western coast of the red sea. It was and is still separated from the rest of africa by the sahara, so culturally it was much more middle eastern than african.</p></div>		</li>
