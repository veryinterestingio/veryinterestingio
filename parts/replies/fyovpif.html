			<div class="markdown"><p>This is such a reasonable explanation. When Tesla brought this issue into the public recently the excuse dealers gave was that they protected the consumer and it sounded hollow and pretty weak. I don't know why they couldn't explain it this way</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because the logic doesn't apply to Tesla's problem. Tesla never intended to have dealers, they wanted to only sell direct so there were no dealers to screw over. The dealers were trying to change these laws, which originally said &quot;no selling direct if you have dealers&quot;, to &quot;you must sell through dealers&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They didn't just try, they were successful in some states. Some states don't let Tesla sell cars at their dealers, so you have to buy the car in another state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They definitely succeeded in some states. Our former Senate President and one time Gubernatorial candidate, who also happened to own one of the largest car dealerships in the state, managed to get Tesla’s banned from being sold in this state because they didn’t go through a dealer. There are a fair amount around here, but they all come from other states.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>None of what was explained protects the consumer. Dealerships don’t protect consumers from manufacturers. There are more than enough manufacturers to have a competitive market without dealers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But this won’t really change the price of cars. If Chevy knows you’ll pay $20,000 for a car with a dealership involved, they will still charge $20,000 without a dealer. All of the profit is just going to flow to them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tesla's cannot be sold in Texas.  They have service centers, and they have show rooms where you can look at the cars, but you have to go to Oklahoma to get one.  </p>
<p>Tesla won't support independent dealerships because they know the dealers would do their best to &quot;upsell&quot; prospective buyers into other cars.  This is because Teslas tend to have lower maintenance requirements due to their construction and fewer moving parts, which is where many dealerships make much of their money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Car dealers existed to fill a niche in a local economy where the products were being created in Detroit but needed to be SOLD and SERVICED everywhere. The manufacturers had no interest in this investment so they let car dealers meet this demand. As time went on the car dealers used regulatory capture to solidify their place in the supply line and now we are stuck with them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But dealership exists for everything. You dont go to the farmer to buy his veges directly. He is too busy to open up a store. The same applies for cars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like that is because it would be madness to go to every individual farmer to get every individual food item you need, it’s easier to consolidate in a grocery store. But for cars, you’re going to go to a Ford dealer or a Toyota dealer (if it’s a new car), not a “car store” that sells a dozen different makers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Prior to modern communications it was pretty difficult for large companies to run a network of hundreds of offices. It made more sense to engage local businesses to sell your product so you didn't have to worry about the day to day hassles remotely. Also , access to capital was much more expensive so having dealers means someone else builds the building, buys the inventory, and takes on some of the risk.  This allows quick expansion into many markets - franchising is still an extremely common business model for this reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Originally most stuff was bought through catalogs, you could even buy a house through the Sear's catalogue. Traveling salesmen would go around and make the sale, and the car would be shipped to the address.
Most likely people wanted to be able to see and compare cars in person before purchasing, which is where the bead for dealer show rooms came from.</p></div>		</li>
