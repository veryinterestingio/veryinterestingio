<p>Or maybe the people behind the campaign actually get in trouble, but the damage is already done! If you see the brand of crackers in the store and remember having read somewhere that they used illegal chemicals, would you stop to actually check? Or would you just grab a different box?</p>
<p>Add to that how incredibly easy it is to spread misinformation on the internet nowadays, and you may create all the effect you could ever dream of if you just tattle to the right person, I guess</p></div>		</li>

Any of the paid astroturfers just kick the responsibility around and unless they've been sloppy, there's not enough evidence to prove that the astroturfing isn't just loud idiots who have latched onto a cause to a court of law.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dihydrogen Monoxide (DHMO) is a colorless and odorless chemical compound, also referred to by some as Dihydrogen Oxide, Hydrogen Hydroxide, Hydronium Hydroxide, or simply Hydric acid. Its basis is the highly reactive hydroxyl radical, a species shown to mutate DNA, denature proteins, disrupt cell membranes, and chemically alter critical neurotransmitters. The atomic components of DHMO are found in a number of caustic, explosive and poisonous compounds such as Sulfuric Acid, Nitroglycerine and Ethyl Alcohol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>'Astroturfing'  refers to giving credibility to a statement or an organization by obscuring the source's financial connection, and making it appear that the statement or organization is supported by 'grassroots' participants instead of a corporate-sponsored disinformation campaign.</p>
<p>The obvious connection to AstroTurf is that most or all of that so-called 'grassroots' support is fake, just as AstroTurf is fake grass.</p>
<p>In the 'cracker company' example, the company is shielded (for the most part) by plausible deniability -- they can just deny the rumors and pretend that 'it wasn't them'.</p>
<p>The people being paid are also protected, to a degree, because a defamatory statement doesn't cross the line into 'slander' unless those that spread the misinformation are aware (or could reasonably be expected to be aware) that it's untrue.</p>
<p>'Review bombing' is a form of AstroTurfing: it's about making the barrage of negative reviews appear spontaneous, rather than a genuine expression of an individual's opinion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dont think of it as only corprations. The fact is this leaves behind traces. Most companies/corporations would NOT do this knowingly or as a corporate initiative. Some manager or someone in the company may do it, but most corporations would not endorse this or allow it. The risk if they get caught is massive. </p>
<p>Now on the political areana it is rampent. LOTS of people NOT associated officially with a candidate, policy, etc have the willingness to do what is neccessary to fit their ideology. Lots of people fell morally enclined to say, well the ends justify the means. I dont think Bernie or The orange one, or Creepy Uncle Joe would knowingly endorse this kind of action and woudl ensur ethye have no knowledge of said actions. Now the people who wnat them in office......Yeah they woudl fucking do it in a heart beat.</p>
<p>The other part of this: The willingness of the populaiton to have their biases confirmed. In the exampel you give LOTS of people woudl then forward that and &quot;get involved&quot; based on their biases. </p>
<p>Lets look at your post it implies that corporations are going to formally do this in an organized capacity as a business plan. It implies you believe that corporations are at least mostly corupt and this is &quot;semi-normalized behavoir. There are lots of people in this country that partake of that trope and woudl then willingly partake of the movement because they assume, based on their biases, that a company woudl intentionally use an ilegal ingrediant that is harmful. Other companies than the postulated first company woudl also happily partake of that. </p>
<p>The root of this is what I was told by a great grandparent who gre up in the depression - You can't con and honest man. It takes people with biases and a willingness to filtere life through those biases for this to work. If the majority of the population looked at all political, media, and product messaging with a critical thought process, vice bias confirmation. this woudl nto even exist. </p>
<p>These people, as they say in X-Files, &quot;Want to BELIEVE&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The problem with the term is that it's been used against political antagonists and people with genuine differing opinions, deteriorating its meaning once again.</p></div>		</li>
