Any protein based medicine, like growth factors and antibodies? It's going to denature/precipitate and lose activity, becoming from useless to dangerous. Most small molecule based medications, typically pills, would tend to be quite stable over long durations if not exposed to oxygen and humidity. With oxygen, many many of them get oxidized and lose activity or have a different effect. With water a lot of them would hydrolyze or react in some way. It's very molecule dependent, some survive hours to days in solution with air, like vitamin C that oxidizes readily, some are stable for years. Thermal decomposition is also a thing, which can limit lifetime even in a dry nitrogen atmosphere. If you don't have some good understanding of how the molecules behave, best is to avoid using them long after expiry dates. Companies do test these things, typically monitoring stability with HPLC, and even with accelerated aging to extrapolate to longer times (applying heat or oxygen/humidity to simulate long storage).</p></div>		</li>
