			<div class="markdown"><p>The pertinent point is that the moon is not a mirror aimed at you. Just like any other rough surface, it reflects incident light fairly evenly in all directions, so the amount of sunlight reflected to your eye is a minuscule fraction of the total.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Actually that's not true. Lunar regolith is somewhat retroreflective, reflecting light more strongly back in the direction it came from, which is why a full moon looks so much brighter.</p>
<p>It's not a perfect mirror, of course, and it's very very dark, so it's still a lot less bright than the Sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd imagine another easy litmus test would be: do you get eye damage from staring at the ground?  Because that's the same idea: light reflecting off a surface, that you're magnitudes closer to.  Yes, the moon is lighter color and therefore reflects more light, but I think if you feel safe looking at the ground, you're safe looking at the ground a couple hundred thousand miles away, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ALSO the moon doesnt even reflect UV much at all.  the spectrum of moonlight:  <a href="http://www.olino.org/blog/us/articles/2015/10/05/spectrum-of-moon-light" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.olino.org/blog/us/articles/2015/10/05/spectrum-of-moon-light" target="_blank">http://www.olino.org/blog/us/articles/2015/10/05/spectrum-of-moon-light</a></a>  Is shifted towards the other colors.  As you can see there's almost no UV being reflected by the moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great way to test this is taking a camera in manual mode (some phones will allow that too) and locking ISO, aperture and shutter speed settings on values that make a good photo on a sunny day outside and taking a picture with those same settings inside and during night. You'll probably end up with one photo of sunny day and two black rectangles.</p>
<p>Examples:

			<div class="markdown"><p>Little fun fact.  I'm a photographer (BFA in photography) and it's pretty well known that the exposure settings for shooting a moon are very close to the exposure settings for any rock in the sunlight in day time.  The moon is actually dark grey and when shot at daytime photography settings will appear dark grey with lots of texture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, taking pictures of the moon it's actually surprising how bright it is. I have a hard time believing it's dimmer than the sky on a cloudy day. Judging from daytime photos I took of it, it's actually brighter than a clear daytime sky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A clear daytime sky is dimmer than a cloudy daytime sky too. A clear sky has pretty well scattered light in almost every direction and OH MY GOSH DEATH RAY in a <em>very specific</em> direction. Clouds diffuse the entire death ray brightness over the whole sky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it's bright enough to be seen quite clearly <em>through</em> the daytime sky. That tells us that the surface brightness of the Moon is at the very least comparable to that of the sky, otherwise it would have too little contrast to be visible.</p></div>		</li>
