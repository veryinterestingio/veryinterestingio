			<div class="markdown"><p>If you get yourself a cheap molecular modelling kit (just ball and stick will do) it will help you visualise different isomers and you'll immediately see why 1-methyl pentane isn't a thing. The straws in a modelling kit nicely represent the freedoms of rotation bonds have. They don't represent the freedoms of bending and stretching very well (you need springs for that) but they don't tend to be so important particularly at this stage.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But as far as Asymmetry goes and Chirality... yeah well I‚Äôd have never passed Orgo if not for those modeling kits!</p></div>		</li>

<p>They wouldn't help much anyway. Springs would let you build models of molecules if you already know exactly how they look, but won't really provide you with any insight you don't already have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both 2-methylpentane or 3-methylpentane (C‚ÇÜH‚ÇÅ‚ÇÑ or CH‚ÇÉC‚ÇÖH‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ) are valid systematic names, although they are also structural isomers of hexane (C‚ÇÜH‚ÇÅ‚ÇÑ), with a single branch containing the methyl group.</p>
<p>Sometimes it makes sense to call them branched hexane, sometimes methylpentane. The latter contains more information, so if you need to know exactly what the molecule is like, then it's better to use that. If you just need to balance a reaction equation or something like that, hexane is sufficient.</p></div>		</li>
