			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and &quot;on average&quot; is the key phrase; it does make certain people better off <em>at the expense of others</em></p>
<p>Thus we have businesses like Apple trying to make it impossible for anyone to be repairing small issues on their products, thus forcing people to buy a whole new device (not just Apple, but they're a nice low hanging fruit)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not correct. Trade of existing goods can make people better off. If there two kids in a cafeteria and kid A trades her ham and cheese for kid B's PBJ, they could both be better off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm saying that <em>after</em> the sandwiches have been made and distributed to kid A and kid B, trading the existing sandwiches will make both kids better off than if they hadn't traded. The trade itself increases happiness overall and for each individual. A similar story could be told about buying used goods. Introducing money into the illustration adds unnecessary confusion though.</p>
<p>This gets into part of the reason GDP is an imperfect measure of aggregate economic wellbeing. There are economic actions that could make people better off without affecting GDP (household production, trade of used goods, etc).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Services are counted as something &quot;new&quot; being created. The point of the fallacy is that the service provided (fixing the window) isn't creating &quot;new&quot; value, it's restoring the value of something that was at full value before the window was broken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's important to clarify that fixing the window is of value, because you're upgrading a broken window to fix it. What is not of value is breaking a window in order to create a demand for labor to fix it. </p>
<p>It might sound like I'm splitting hairs, but it's important to remember that a huge percentage of the valuable economic work being done today is maintenance work (I think David Graeber has some good comments on this). Heart surgeons, mechanics, and even window fixers <em>are</em> adding value. The broken window fallacy just shows that it's wasteful to artificially and unnecessarily create a need for more maintenance workers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But imagine if, after leaving the salon, someone mugged you and shaved your head so you had to go get ANOTHER haircut. Would the mugger be making you better off by making you spend your money on an extra haircut?</p>
<p>And...yes, I know thatâ€™s not how hair works.</p></div>		</li>
