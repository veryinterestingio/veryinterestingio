			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm yes that is fascinating! This was an afternoon nap too, so it wasn’t an ordinary sleep schedule. I did set an alarm for 3pm and remember checking the clock to see that it would be exactly half an hour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not flexing or anything but I have not used an alarm clock for several years now thanks to this. It helps that I don’t have to wake up too early and that I don’t have a fixed time to start working. And of course if I happen to have any special appointment in the morning I do set the alarm</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use an alarm but I don’t need it because I wake up mid morning for work. When I used to get up at 5am for work I needed the alarm clock even if I went to bed early. I think you’re just sleeping the natural way with no fixed time to have to get up</p></div>		</li>
