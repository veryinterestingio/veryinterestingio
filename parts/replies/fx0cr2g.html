			<div class="markdown"><p>Easy. Which is going to sell more TVs? Which has a higher adoption rate? Is the layperson buying a TV going to be more impressed by 4x HDMI ports or 4x Displayport ports? Does an end user want to buy all new cables just to save the TV manufacturer more money (because let's be honest, are the savings really going to be passed on to us?) I know a lot of my devices came with HDMI cables included. The same cannot always be said about Displayport.  </p>
<p>Just because it is cheaper at face value doesn't mean there aren't a lot of other factors to consider. Also, since XKCD is always relevant: <a href="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png" target="_blank">https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png</a></p></div>		</li>
