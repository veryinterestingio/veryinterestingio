<p>As someone who rescues and rehabilitates reptiles, it is unreal what I’ve seen them survive. We had a snapping turtle someone had beaten with a golf club, and her shell was crushed to where you could see her lungs and heart. Water would get into her body cavity through the hole, and then simply drain out when she would come out to bask. She made a complete recovery, despite our underfunded medical care.</p>
<p>If any animal is going to survive the bodily stresses of polycephaly, I’d say that reptiles have some good cards in their deck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We did very little in the way of surgery, just removing small fragments of shell that were no longer connected, not to mention a fuckton of antibiotics.</p>
<p>Eventually the holes sealed up, bone tissue regrew slowly. The scarring was obvious, but it was just as hard as the rest of her carapace.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Reptiles are not often treated like living beings, mostly due to poor public perception.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know literally nothing, but here goes. </p>
<p>Reptiles are designed to be reliable. Like an Ak-47 they are designed with loose tolerances. </p>
<p>They work even with two heads. </p>
<p>Mammals are more intelligent / complex and thus more sensitive to multiple heads.</p>
<p>Tighter tolerances equate to less ability to adapt. </p>
<p>The more perfectly adapted you are your environment the less ability you have to deal with environmental catastrophe. The sharks and cockroaches will keep marching on.</p></div>		</li>
