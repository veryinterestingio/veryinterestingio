<p>Ok so yes. They fly due to many things. That answers your question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I study a pretty specific part of biology (amphibian diseases) and I suffer from a similar thing. I could go on for hours and easily bore people, so when someone asks me about it I tend to overcompensate and hold back too much, resulting in a very sparse explanation of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love watching ants. Sometimes I sit in the backyard for over an hour, head bent at 90°, just trying to get a read on what they're doing. </p>
<p>I've gotten this weird impression that the ants I've been watching are aware of things above them, things in the greater environment like a low tree brancb, the foot of a reclining lawn chair, a low hanging flower basket. Watching the ants navigate, I started thinking they were using things above as, well,  <em>landmarks.</em> I know this is probably crazy and imaginary on my part, but I just have to ask. Since you know something about ants, is it at all possible that ants look up and remember an object above?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do, except for the ones with no eyes. In fact, one species of ants in the desert actually keeps count of its steps when leaving the colony. They figured this out by adding little pieces of straw to its legs to make them longer, and would watch the ants overshoot their nest. Based on how much longer their legs, and stride was, they could calculate how many steps they took. For one of my undergrad projects, i filmed ants and calculated their speed, and then used that to make prediction models of nest ranges. Because I'm a weirdo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn, that is quite ingenious. How did they fix the straw to the ants legs if you know? So what about knowing the direction the ants have need to go to? Do they have a way to know that information as well? Step number alone would not be enough with direction too right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a rather clever experiment design.<br />
Do you have any idea what clued them in to the possibility that they were counting steps before they devised the experiment?<br />
Also, what did you find regarding the nest ranges (not weird, fascinating btw)?<br />
Are you an entomologist now?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You actually used the correct terminology for visual cues that ants and other animals use in navigation: landmarks! There are several examples of ants using landmarks including the <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/A:1020987922344.pdf" target="_blank">forest canopy</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00265-008-0657-6" target="_blank">light and furniture in a lab</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982206025036" target="_blank">high contrast edges</a>, and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen_Yanoviak/publication/303324013_Orientation_at_the_water_surface_by_the_carpenter_ant_Camponotus_pennsylvanicus_DE_GEER_1773_Hymenoptera_Formicidae/links/59fcb2c2aca272347a226410/Orientation-at-the-water-surface-by-the-carpenter-ant-Camponotus-pennsylvanicus-DE-GEER-1773-Hymenoptera-Formicidae.pdf" target="_blank">sticks coming out of the water</a>.  </p>
<p>So you're observations are totally in line with our current understanding of visual cues and ant navigation, nest mate recognition, and foraging.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Mine is weaver ant.  They're very abundant where I live.  Watching them build leaf nests will never be boring.  They also have good eyesight and will actively track any suspicious movement within 30cm.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I laughed for a good ten seconds after reading this. Something about picturing ants zeroed in on <em>suspicious activity</em> just ended up being the most enjoyable thought of my day.</p></div>		</li>
