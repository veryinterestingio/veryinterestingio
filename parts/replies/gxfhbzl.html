			<div class="markdown"><p>Bulk or zero waste stores are becoming more and more attractive. You take your vessel there, get it tared and then you can keep using it over and over, and all they do is scan the barcode or put in the weight and charge you for what you actually take. Supermarkets, at least pre-pandemic, were starting to be much better with bulk products or zero waste packaging for fruit and veg, but rolled a lot of that back. Hopefully we'll see that come back as things start to open again.</p></div>		</li>
