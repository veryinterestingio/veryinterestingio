			<div class="markdown"><p>Since current vaccines recognize regions of the spike protein, new mutations would need to change structure of the spike protein to enable escape and reduce vaccine efficacy. Mutations in other virus components might affect virus transmission and/or virulence (severity of disease). They would alter a different function for the virus than what the Spike protein does in entry.  For instance a mutation in the viral replication polymerase might enhance virus production so the circulating levels of virus eventually overwhelm the immune system's ability to cope with progeny or with virus products.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think everyone needs to be careful to use language clearly reflecting the fact that viruses don't mutate themselves in a diabolical strategy to evade our defenses. That mutation is accidental, and what we see as &quot;evasion&quot; is merely the success of a random mutation where perhaps millions of others have failed. Too easy to fall into &quot;...new mutations would need to change structure...&quot; which is entirely accurate but entirely misleading to readers who don't already understand the nature of viral mutation.</p></div>		</li>
