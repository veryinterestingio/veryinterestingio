Evidence suggests people with properly functioning immune systems are highly unlikely to exhibit complications from Covid.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Interesting read. It suggests a more trained immune response may actually be detrimental. The body learned too much from other viruses, and for this novel coronavirus, those responses it tries are ineffective. In a statistical sense, the immune system is learning too fast and experiences over fitting, and unable to accurate predict how to combat a novel pathogen.</p></div>		</li>
