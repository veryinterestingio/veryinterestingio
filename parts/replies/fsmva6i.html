			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically, do you perceive a possibility that everything can ever be full circle with carbon? </p>
<p>Ie, we admit into the atmosphere, recapture it, use it for Graphene/carbyne and then use those new carbon based materials to build? Obviously then repeat the cycle as you build..</p>
<p>In a scenario like this, how possible is near 100% reusability with not only carbon, but all matter involved in the processes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Growing trees is a way to go full circle. Grow tress underground under a forest with artificial light, grow trees above oceanic deserts, reforest desertic areas, create greenhouses (to capture water) in the Sahara, make forests in Antarctica, and you can recapture carbon.</p></div>		</li>
