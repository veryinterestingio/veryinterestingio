<p>Actually, the man attacks the thieves so hard he hurts himself, but the thieves don't necessarily leave, and he just keeps on attacking them and hurting himself.</p>
<p>The disease/thieves doesn't respond/return fire, it/they just don't die or  leave.</p></div>		</li>

<p>According the the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chickenpox/hcp/index.html#high-risk-people" target="_blank">CDC</a>, the groups at highest risk of having severe varicella (chickenpox) includes immunocompromised people, premature babies, and people with HIV/AIDS. Obviously the people in those groups <em>can't</em> have all that strong of an immune reaction to the virus, so what is it that makes them so ill?</p></div>		</li>

<p>This was a generalization I made. Of course the virus itself is bad. But not for most people. Varicella isn't one of the big bad viruses out there. The immune system can take care of it pretty easily, which is why kids aren't hurt too bad. Their immune response is optimal at fighting the virus. The adult's is overactive and hurts the normal tissue itself. The immuno-compromised individual's immune system, on the other hand, is under active. The virus cannot be brought under control by the host system and it's free to wreak whatever havoc it wants. The infection paves way to more serious complications ranging from bacterial infections on the skin to even pneumonia (I don't know how exactly the virus works so can't give u an accurate pathophysiology). Also, even in kids, sometimes the virus isn't completely eradicated. It later gets reactivated in adult as shingles. It all depends on how good ur immune response is.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I was under the impression that it's almost never completely eradicated. The virus makes its way into your nerve cells and becomes inactive for a time, usually decades; shingles is caused by the virus reactivating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The immune system is trying to attack the virus, but misses the mark, and ends up destroying surrounding tissue. Basically the immune system attacks by releasing a bunch of chemicals that will digest the pathogen, but the catch is that those chemicals are bad for normal tissue too. Another reply to my comment pointed it out and I clarified that it is more like the body is being damaged by ricocheting fire, than the infection fighting back.</p></div>		</li>
