			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, this is purely hypothetical but the part you didn't seem to pickup very much vs. what OP is talking about is that they teach us in schools viruses are just piles of garbage genetic code that exist sorely to spread and reproduce and do not have anything going on with them that is more complicated than that. So lipid mebrane etc. felt more complex to OP, hence his curiousity. This feels like a summarization that is not 100% accurate so I would be glad if you could englithen us.</p>
<p>edit: the potentially inaccurate thing is what they taught us, not your post</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Viruses only try to reproduce in the same way any organism only tries to reproduce. Viruses are incredibly diverse, and have all sorts of adaptations for surviving in different environments. Lipid envelops tend to help viruses survive better outside the host. Viruses will also have proteins that help them hijack cellular machinery, confuse the immune system, and help process or assemble their own proteins. Some viruses carry their own polymerase, that lets them replicate their genes once they reach a cell, without having to use a cellular polymerase.</p>
<p>Viral genomes tend to be rather ingenious, basically the opposite of garbage. Natural selection puts pressure on the size of viral genomes, so most of a viral genome ends up having some function, unlike you, me, and other Eukaryotes who have tons of waste genome. Some viruses even encode two proteins in one section or their genome- the code produces one protein when read forward, and another when read backwards. Imagine writing an entire paragraph that read coherently, but with different stories, both forwards and backwards. Incredible stuff.</p>
<p>The main thing that separates viruses from cells is that viruses can’t metabolize. This means outside the cell, they are completely inert. They can’t move, reproduce, or do much of anything without cells to infect. In a way, this means viruses lack the opposite principles of life that say a fire lacks. Fires are self sustaining, but don’t propagate systematized information. Viruses propagate information, but cannot self sustain without something to prey on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Does</em> our genome have a lot of waste? Yes there's plenty of non-coding regions, but we're starting to find out that 'junk' DNA isn't exactly as superfluous as once thought. For instance it's believed important for chromosome bundling, which genes when and where get expressed, and the attachment of transcription factors. And probably a lot more we're missing, particularly in the highly conserved regions.</p></div>		</li>
