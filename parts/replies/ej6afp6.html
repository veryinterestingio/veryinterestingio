			<div class="markdown"><p>On a higher level of the networking model, I also find routing protocols fascinating for much the same reason. Each router advertises the networks that are connected to it to the rest of the network. Eventually, each router has a sort of a map built for how to get to all the networks. Then, when circumstances break one of the links between two routers, they will tell the rest of the network about the change so that traffic can be redirected around the outage. All of this happens without humans having to explicitly map anything out, you just got to tell the routers which protocol to use, and sometimes who's in charge, and they handle the rest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spectrograms are really neat for musical audio as well. You can see the sounds being made as well as the immediate history of sounds. The spectrogram makes it possible to discern a lead vocal from bass and drums, for instance, and even lets you identify individual chord tones from complex harmony.</p>
<p>A frequency analyzer is cool and all, but I love spectrograms so much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I knew Oona's blog would be linked here somewhere. <a href="https://www.windytan.com/2012/11/the-sound-of-dialup-pictured.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is the post on her blog. You should follow her if you're interested in signal analysis, she's an amazing engineer.</p>
<p>But for an explanation of what's happening in the image, here goes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>dial tone</em>: the dial tone is sent by the exchange or PBX to your telephone when &quot;off-hook&quot; is detected. Initially this would be a closed loop of a subscriber line. The dial tone stops when the first digit is dialed (Fun fact: there are multiple kinds of dial tones! they were intended to be used to signal e.g. dialing a prefix from a private PBX, or a warning to properly hook your telephone if you've left it off-hook for a long time, before disabling the line)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dialing. The precursor of modern signalling in digital exchanges was the DTMF system (aka &quot;Touch Tone&quot;). They keypads associated with DTMF had 16 keys: [0-9], #, *, and [A-D] anticipating the need to access automated response systems but also neatly fitting into the needs of existing long-distance phone operators in manual or semi-automated signalling. The DTMF system uses 8 frequencies transmitted in pairs to encode 16 signals: they are clearly visible in the picture!</p>
</li>
<li>The V.8, V.8 bis, &amp; (negotiated here) V.34 procedures. It is a &quot;handshake&quot; between the two endpoints, to decide on a common way to communicate.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>init + CRe: <em>Capabilities Request</em>. Sent by the answering station, because it does not know if the caller is V.8 bis-capable. Why did I group these together? See #2.</p>
</li>
<li>resp + CRd: These two signals are the CRd message. The first, dual-tone, part is the response and the second, single-tone, identifies it as CRd. Why are they structured like this? Because this part of the handshake takes place in a voice context, the signals are meant to be identifiable even in the presence of voice. The dual-tone part of CRe &amp; CRd is:</li>
</ol>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Direction</th>
<th>Messages</th>
<th>Frequencies (Hz)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Initiating</td>
<td>MRe, MRd, CRe, CRd and Esi</td>
<td>1375 + 2002</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Responding</td>
<td>MRd, CRd and Esr</td>
<td>1529 + 2225</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>the offset is clearly visible in the picture!</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>ESr: <em>escape signal</em> Marks the transition into an information-exchange context, instead of voice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Capabilities List</em>: essentially whether the caller supports the full ITU-T V.8 or &quot;Short V.8&quot;. The network type (PSTN, ISDN, cellular) is also included here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Mode Select</em>: selection of the mode of operation (e.g. V.34 is &quot;A modem operating at data signalling rates of up to 33 600 bit/s for use on the general switched telephone network and on leased point-to-point 2-wire telephone-type circuits&quot;) and the exchange format. There are multiple modes for data, simultaneous voice &amp; data, special types of terminals, H.324 multimedia, file transfer, synchronous data link control, etc. The advantage of deciding on a mode, before even training the modems to exchange data, was to enable specialised applications in a terminal to start up while the channel was being set-up, shortening the amount of time it took to establish application comms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>ACKnowledgement</em>: positively acknowledging MS means accepting the proposed mode and terminating the handshake. The V.8 bis handshake formally ends here, and we're back to V.8.</p>
<p><em>What? When did V.8 even start?</em> Technically V.8 starts with a call indicator (CI) signal, but it is optional. Skipping it doesn't affect V.8, and shaves off potentially ~2 seconds off the procedure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ANSam <em>ANSwer tone</em> (am = amplitude modulated): indicates the previously indicated modulation mode is available. This message might seem like a duplicate of ACK, but the context here is V.8 and not V.8 bis. V.8 (as most layer protocols) was developed to be independent of protocols operating on top of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Call Menu</em>, <em>Joint Menu</em>: CM indicates (once more) the call function and all the available modulation modes. JM indicates those modes of CM that are available in the receiver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Call Menu terminator</em> (CJ): After JM is detected, CJ signals the termination of CM. V.8 handshake ends here. <em>Did you notice JM ends just a tiny bit later than CJ?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>INFOrmational sequences</em>: After the modulation scheme is agreed, the channel probing sequence consists of the two modems transmitting four signals (two common, two unique per endpoint) in a specific sequence, with specified timings. The purpose of the probing sequence is to select the common symbol rate, &amp; transmission power (in case it differs from the one configured by the user(s)), and agree on filtering options. There is a wide range of options to list here. The summary is that after CJ, the modem(s) expect a suitable signal, in a negotiated modulation mode, to proceed with the exchange. Here, it is V.34 INFO sequences, implying V.34 was agreed by the previous CM-JM sequence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equaliser / echo-cancellation training: there are predefined signals here designed to &quot;train&quot; echo-canceller circuits, S, S-bar, TRN, MD, PP. I don't know how those circuits work. :(</p>
</li>
<li>Final training: the final data signalling rate is agreed after a 3-way handshake, and data transmission begins by beginning a new superframe (not visible in the picture)</li>
</ol>
<p>PS. As you might have gathered, this was an entirely error-free procedure. ;)</p>
