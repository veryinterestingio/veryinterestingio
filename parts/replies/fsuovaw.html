			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I have a question. A while back, I read an essay railing against &quot;shrink wrapping&quot; Dinosaurs, saying we have absolutely no idea what they actually looked like. A T-Rex could look exactly like a gigantic chicken, not the way they're normally portrayed, but we have no way to tell and it's wrong to just assume the skin and muscle was right against the bone like it's always portrayed. I remember the article has a picture of a whale reconstructed the way a paleontologist would do it and it looks like a skeleton with skin, essentially.</p>
<p>Is this at all a valid criticism?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes super valid. Pretty much all living vertebrate animals have a ton of muscle and subcutaneous tissue like fat that fills them out and it's strange to think dinosaurs wouldn't. Any animal today with a skeleton would look pretty ridiculous if given the shrink wrapped look, not just the larger ones like elephants or whales. Go take a look even at a dog skeleton or cat compared to what they actually look like. Even alligators have huge sacks of tissue on their necks that fill them out way more than the skeleton would suggest. So now scientists make dinosaurs look much more robust as it is most like living animals. And that's just with regards skin, fat and muscle. Some feathered dinosaurs could very well have looked like big floofy meme borbs, but that's something we have yet to find!</p></div>		</li>

Is that something that would fossilize in a remotely accurate way? It seems like structures that are a few hundred nanometers might not get preserved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer! I also have a MS in vert paleo, but struggling to get into a PhD program. Do you happen to have any advice that could improve my chances of getting accepted?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. I'd say make sure you try to publish papers. National science grants and grad school programs look for those first and foremost for funding, even before grades are considered. Most people suggest 2 papers is the average level coming out of your MSc, but I know super successful folks who started PhDs with no publications who now have 15+ in their PhD. Publishing anything will help a ton, but if you don't have anything don't stop trying.</p>
<p>Also volunteering or working in fossil preparation, field work, science education or communication etc all looks great on a CV when applying. </p>
<p>You can try to find a new lab with start up funding or a supervisor who just got a new big grant. Look for those opportunities on social media.  I really reccomend being on Twitter and following palaeontologists, or joining Facebook palaeo groups if you aren't already. This is BY FAR the easiest way to hear of funding or project opportunities, and I've made a few friends this way too.</p>
<p>Try to talk with people at conferences too. They'll remember folks who asked them anything about their research if you email or message them about working with them later. When you email them, try to be specific in why you're interested in their lab and their research if you are. And apply for more than one place. </p>
<p>Try to get as many opportunities as you can. But remember, even with a lot of funding and an interesting project, if you force yourself to live somewhere you hate  you will not have a good experience. Try to find a good work life balance. Ask potential supervisors their opinions on things like how much work they expect per day or week, what their support for mental and physical health needs might be etc. A happy student is the best student.</p>
<p>These are the things that have helped me most I'd say.  Hopefully that helps!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow! Thank you so much for that amazing answer! That actually does help a lot. I am currently in the process of writing a paper, so hopefully that will be done before the next round of applications. I will absolutely look into joining some paleo groups and following some paleontologists. Do you recommend any particular groups? </p>
<p>Thanks again!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, I wanted to be exactly like you when I was a kid, and I still got excited to read this as if I were that young again! I'm not much into paleontology now but still love reading about it. Thank you, your reply was refreshing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No problem, it was fun to write. If you find the time and are in the right place you could always still volunteer to work on fossils at a local museum. I know volunteers who are well into their 70s that are new to the field! And look up rock formations in your area, could be you can find some fossils not far from home!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I already know of some Rock formations actually, I'll see if I can't volunteer, again thank you. I've been a big help. Though I'm only 16, not sure if I'm quite old enough.</p></div>		</li>
