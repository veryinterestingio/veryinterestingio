Before she was diagnosed she had to be fingerprinted by the police for a matter (For my mom's honor - she did not commit a crime but was affected by it, and everyone there was fingerprinted).  The fingerprints didn't come out and it was very frustrating.  It was years before she was diagnosed.  I recommend telling your doctor and/or dermatologist if you don't have fingerprints.</p></div>		</li>

<p>EX: My dad used to detail cars, the &quot;wire wheel cleaner&quot; they used is a strong acid that would basically burn off your fingerprints. The shop got robbed, everyone got fingerprinted, and my dad's prints came out smooth.</p></div>		</li>
