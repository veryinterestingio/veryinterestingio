<p>De Havilland Comet Mk 1. Square windows were cheaper, aircraft crashed due to stress concentrations and crack propagation. A huge investigation was carried out by the RAE, involving repeatedly stress loading fuselages enclosed in water tanks. The design was changed to round windows and flew until 1997 (as Nimrod).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact - the Jimmy Stewart movie No Highway In the Sky depicted a nearly identical scenario, where a brand new airliner called the Reindeer begins breaking up and falling out of the sky due to metal fatigue in the tail. The protagonist is an engineer at the RAE who solves the mystery by running vibration fatigue tests.</p>
<p>The movie was released in 1951, a year before the Comet went into service and two years before the first hull loss.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, but the film was based on No Highway, a novel by Nevil Shute (Norway). </p>
<p>Shute was an aeronautical engineer, he worked on R100 as Barnes Wallis's chief calculator and founded Airspeed Limited (made the Airspeed Oxford &amp; Horsa gliders in WW2). He didn't use his surname on his novels, he thought it would be regarded as unprofessional.  His autobiography, Sliderule, is a good read.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It flew a lot longer than 1997 - they were used in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>I've actually been on a Nimrod mission - such a cool aircraft, but even though they'd fixed the obvious design flaw, there seemed to be so many issues with those things. I swear, it felt like every single person who flew one regularly had some kind of story about it being on fire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of older airframes like that. DC-6 comes to mind the number of time I've seen those engines in fire is insane. We just signalled the pilots and they would just crank the engine up and blow it out. They also like to spit fire balls. With the amount of oil pouring out of those fuckers constantly it was sketchy to say the least. I can think of quite a few more. Some where the saying was if it isn't leaking it's empty, for pretty much any fluids it had.</p></div>		</li>
