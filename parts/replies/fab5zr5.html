			<div class="markdown"><p>It's similar with Cheetahs and Tasmanian Devil's. The Tasmanian Devil's (not Cheetas afaik) are so similar to each other that there is contagious cancer. The genetic markers on the cancer are basically the same animal to animal and it is transmitted by cancel cells rubbing off while fighting. Normally the immune system would kill them, but because the markers are so similar/the same the immune cells assume the cancer belongs, and leave it alone. </p>
<p>They could probably also have organ transplants with no immunosuppressive drugs, but I don't known if anyone has tried.</p></div>		</li>
