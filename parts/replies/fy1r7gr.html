			<div class="markdown"><p>Seeing the changes in plant life driving around Hawaii is really interesting.  You can go over a ridge that's lush rain forest on one side and when you get to the other side you're in a desert surrounded by cactus. All because one side gets tones rain and the other doesn't get as much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the subtle features I loved in Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri was that it modeled this.</p>
<p>The prevailing winds went from west to east (left to right). If you had a city on the right side of an island and I had one on the left side of the island, if I raised the terrain in the middle past a certain point, then all the moisture collected on my side and turned it into a lush forest (which meant each tile grew a lot more food) and turned your side into a dry desert (which grew less food).</p>
<p>Depending on circumstances, you could be basically engaging in warfare conducted entirely through terraforming in peacetime, with certain actions starving out an opponents city (thus reducing its population).</p></div>		</li>
