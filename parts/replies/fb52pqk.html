<p>tl;dr building a shitty battery (anode, cathode, and acid) breaks down the metal. AFAIK it is always the anode (sacrificial anode) that becomes oxidized.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is the effect of the electric charge generated, basically making a small battery, for a long time, until one side gives up all its ions.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Batteries are actually very simple.</p>
<p>Two different types of metal, with acid between them, makes a battery. </p>
<p>By their nature, most metals have some free associating electrons. They are able to freely &quot;lose&quot; their electrons, with little to no coaxing. </p>
<p>But this amount of &quot;free-ness&quot; is different for every metal. The cool thing is, too, that the same properties that makes metals willing to give up a few electrons, also makes them able to take a few electrons. </p>
<p>So, when you put two metals together that have different &quot;free-ness&quot;, One is very willing to push off some of its free electrons to another, who is perfectly willing to accept them. </p>
<p>But... they aren't touching! So... how do we make this happen... </p>
<p>Well, We connect them with an acid. </p>
<p>An acid, by its very nature, has a bunch of free floating positive particles in it. That is, essentially, what makes it an acid. </p>
<p>So, when you have one metal ready to give up a bunch of negative particles, and a liquid with a bunch of positive particles in it, and another plate that is ready to accept those negative particles... well, the negative particles flow, baby. </p>
<p>And that causes electricity!</p>
<p>Pretty sweet, eh?</p>
<p>This happens with any two non-intert metals and an acid. </p>
<p>The &quot;down-stream&quot; metal, so to speak, accepts all of the particles from the acid and the other metal, and kinda forms a new metal, over time. </p>
<p>This new metal, generally, is an oxidized version of the original metal. That might not sound like a big deal... but it is.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard of Iron Oxide? That is rusty formed from iron. Basically, iron bonded with some of the free floating oxygen in SLIGHTLY acidic water and... BOOM. Rust. Iron Oxide. </p>
<p>Iron just so happens to be one of the metals that is VERY good at being &quot;Downstream&quot;. </p>
<p>Aluminum is ALSO a preeeety good downstream metal. So, when you mix aluminum, steel (not much of an upstream metal, but w/e), and a kinda strong acid (vinegar, for all intents and purposes, is a bit strong for an acid), You create the perfect environment for the aluminum to turn into aluminum oxide. Basically aluminum rust. </p>
<p>That shit breaks mad easy, bro. Just like Iron rust. </p>
<p>Ruins stuff. </p>
<p>It is also a reason why, on boats, you see metal things break when they are screwed in with cheap/incorrect screws. screw = steel, cleat = aluminum (or whatever), sea water = slight acid... eventual, inevitable failure.</p></div>		</li>
