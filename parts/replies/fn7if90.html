			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not even average. It's the lowest threshold considered normal vision. </p>
<p>Most people who do not need glasses have actually better vision.</p>
<p>I think average vision for an adult (who does not need glasses) is around 20/15, that's very common.</p>
<p>Good vision starts below that, it's not too rare for younger adults have 20/12, and very few lucky ones even 20/10 (well that's perfect vision!), and best ever vision recorded for human was 20/8 if I recall correctly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oh, so average vision.  Got it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know, so annoying. And just because somehow at one point there were enough people who didn't care about the right answer and assumed herd mentality was right. Kind of like when people say the could care less, when they actually mean they couldn't care any less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think there's been any studies done that quantify the overall &quot;average level of vision&quot; in the US. It might probably be closer to 20/25 plus or minus a line, so no, 20/20 is not average, unless a study has shown that. </p>
<p>With all of the disease that's prevalent in the population in all age groups, such as amblyopia, age-related macular degeneration, endstage glaucoma, vasculopathies affecting ocular circulation (retinal artery/vein occlusions), CVAs, trauma, etc. I'd be surprised if the average level of vision in this country is 20/20, but if it was, it would be great news.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes,  that's why they always ask which one is better,  1 or 2?</p>
<p>If you can successfully tell the difference,  you might correct to better vision.   Astigmatism or other vision issues might prevent that. </p>
<p>If you get Lasik corrective surgery,  you can very easily end up with better than 20/20.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't worry. Youll find out when you get old! I had 20/10 as a kid and 20/15 through grad school. I'm now 20/20.  It is a very slow transition and all the sudden one day you say... Shit I used to be able to see that clearly.  Then the eye doc says your eyes are fine you are 20/20 lol.  OH! That's why I can't see that!</p>
<p>And eye strain will get you too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I guess its inevitable.  I guess I should have said I've had 20/10 vision most of my life, but now that I'm in my mid-30's its closer to 20/15.  I actively try and take care of my eyes and prevent eye strain when I can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It varies person to person depending on what little refractive error may be there, but overall clarity usually doesn't change much.  It's the loss of near focusing  (presbyopia) that happens to everyone over time, causing near blur and strain.  If your distance vision got slightly worse too, you were probably just a tiny bit farsighted all along, but it doesn't affect you until the presbyopia sets in around age 40-45.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Did you just go to the eye doctor annually out of habit? I'm 36 and its probably been 20 years since I've seen an eye doctor. I don't know why I would if there wasn't a problem. I feel like I have as perfect of vision as there is - based on being able to read signs far away and people with me say &quot;how can you read that?&quot; through my whole life. But I've never had it actually measured.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My brother and sister both had better than 20/20 vision when they were younger. They are in their 50s now and both need reading glasses.</p>
