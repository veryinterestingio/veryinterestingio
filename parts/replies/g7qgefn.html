			<div class="markdown"><p>Ugh for real.  Those first six months were incredible.  Now, he eats some homemade applesauce and it’s like someone took a paint roller, dipped it in liquid shit that has some gelatin mixed in, and painted his diaper with it, balls and all.  It’s great and in no way makes me want to throw up on him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a lot of parents are skipping the purees and mashes and going straight to solids at 6 months to avoid that. Makes a lot of sense, since that's what we used to do back in the day. Just gotta watch the little buggers cause they'll definitely try to choke themselves more than once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meconium is what you call the first few poops after a baby is born. It is thick black tar like substance. It should change to a yellow liquid with &quot;seedy&quot; white bits in it if they're breastfed, until they start eating solid food. Formula fed poop is a little different.</p></div>		</li>
