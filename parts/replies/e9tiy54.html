			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait why can't you just say 1kg = mass of proton * X where X is an arbitrary number chosen to approximate to the previous kg mass? Same as is done with the second isn't it? The 9,192,631,770 number is entirely arbitrary and was chosen to approximate to the previous definition of second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because when you set up a lab and want a scale to be able to measure things in kilograms accurately, you need to precisely obtain that many protons to calibrate your scale, which is not feasible. It is much more feasible to measure the transition frequency of a cesium state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, the definition isn't really based on what is most elegant.  Its based on what is more useful for experimentally calibrating instruments.  I guess that makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do you need precisely that many protons as opposed to just calibrating with a single one? I feel like I'm almost understanding the reason as a chicken and egg type issue but it's escaping me...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can *say* it but how do you ever use that number to calibrate anything?  You can't count out a pile of protons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that if you would want to build a reference kilogram to use in your scales you will need to count out exactly x protons. For the second that's not so difficult because atomic clocks do essentially that, but for protons that's a lot harder, so you get a big uncertainty on your reference kilogram. The more complicated definition is just easier to implement to a high accuracy in practice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You do realize that your link contradicts you directly as it describes the international Avogadro project as one of the necessary steps to precisely define the planck constant?</p>
<p>It even goes so far to explain that even though the new kibble balance is overall well reproducible, for practical matters of applied metrology having a master kilogramme will still be the best option for most users.</p></div>		</li>

<p>EDIT: or defined inaccurately</p></div>		</li>
