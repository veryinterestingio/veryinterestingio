			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a portion on your retina called a <em>fovea</em> where light is focused. When light hits onto the fovea it communicates to the brain along the retinal nerve.</p>
<p>Without astigmatism, light focuses on it. Like this:</p>
<p>-&gt;)</p>
<p>Nice and evenly.</p>
<p>With astigmatism it can look like any of these:</p>
<p>-&gt;)-&gt; Or  -&gt;-&gt;)  Or  )- &gt;-&gt;  Or )-&gt;</p>
<p>This is crude, but I hope you get my idea. It scatters where the light hits causing the blur. </p>
<p>It's like you have a handful of marbles you're trying to throw into a bucket (or light rays into the fovea) across the room. With an astigmatism you've got a very small chance of getting all the marbles in the bucket. Glasses or contacts work like you're putting a big funnel onto the bucket. Now you throw the marbles and they all flow into the bucket</p>
<p>The fovea now communicates through your retinal nerve with your brain an even amount of light. </p>

<p>Sight is just a sense that lets you navigate through the world, and &quot;correct&quot; is subjective. So long as you're able to agree with those around you that a thing is a thing, then everything looks correct. There's no right or wrong when it's just you and your senses. Things become wrong when you perceive something as drastically different from everyone else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My first corrective lenses were contacts that I got in the sixth grade. My mom didn't realize just how poor my vision was until we were driving home from the optometrist and I kept commenting on how all the trees had leaves! </p>
<p>It sounds absurd, but there are millions of tiny little things we take for granted with respect to our vision alone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no right or wrong, but there's a strong evolutionary pressure in favor of &quot;properly&quot; focused eyes.  But like the question which you're responding to asks, what are properly focused eyes?  </p>
<p>Properly focused eyes are just the evolutionary result of whatever eyes allowed a species to survive the best.  A properly focusing 20/20 vision eye proves a huge survival advantage over an eye that can barely resolve the shape of another person (or predator) standing 20 feet away.  </p>
<p>So properly focused eyes are just the eyes that allow a species to best navigate and survive in their environment.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It turns out that clouds are not like <em>inherently</em> blurry. I had internalised that their blurriness was just a physical feature to do with how dispersed they are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun Fact: The ciliar muscle doesn't stretch thr lens. It's a ring muscle that goes around the lens. On the inside of that ring there's zonular fibers that connect the mucle to the lens. When the muscle contracts, its diameter gets smaller, thus releasing pull on the conular fibres and enabling the elastic lense to get closer to its actual round shape. So the muscle does stretch the lens, but passively by relaxing, while it lets the lens relax by contracting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! I figured this must be true because the other guy had it backwards. I'm longsighted and I can strain to make focus but relaxed I focus beyond infinity. I know enough about optics to work out that my lens must become more convex when I strain but I didn't understand how.</p></div>		</li>
