			<div class="markdown"><p>the answer to OP's post is inevitably &quot;it varies&quot;. </p>
<p>As a baseline, animals that live in small packs are likely to have a more developed ability to develop social bonds, while solitary animals that have no reason to remember their relatives probably will not. It also depends on how long they spent together (a puppy adopted out will rapidly forget it's mum). </p>
<p>If they are apart from a long time, they will lose familiarity, and in any case, maybe they still recognize each-other, but cannot be sure if the other is still friendly!</p>
<p>It's an interesting question whether herding or flocking animals can remember their close relatives, at least for the purpose of not mating with them.</p></div>		</li>

‘If they are apart for a long time, they will lose familiarity’ makes sense from our point of view, but do we know if this holds true across the kingdom? Presumably there could be some mechanism for lifelong memory unaffected by time and distance</p></div>		</li>

<p>you didn't really read the whole sentence. Memory's not the problem, the problem is they're still in front of a wild animal, and, especially in more territorial animals, they can't just assume that because they KNOW that animal, it'll be NICE to them.</p></div>		</li>
