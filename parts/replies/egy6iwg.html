<p>1MB DIMMs </p>

<p>They were probably SIMMs, Single In-line Memory Module vs DIMM Dual In-line Memory Module. But your point stands, someone today looking at a PC from 1994 would be able to identify them no problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ha!  This reminds me of an interview questions when I was at university looking for a 1 year sandwich (work experience) placement.</p>
<p>I was asked to name the two types of memory:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Volatile and Non-volatile? No!  </li>
<li>Single in-line and Dual in-line?  No!  </li>
<li>Cache memory and system memory?  No!</li>
</ul>
<p>I am puzzled and give up, &quot;RAM and ROM&quot; they say with a smug face indicating that they stumped me with a technical question, uncovering my lack of knowledge...  I'd dismissed &quot;RAM and ROM&quot; in my thinking process because they're not the only two options, as there's PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, ... but they weren't interested in hearing my explanation.</p>
<p>I didn't get the job, I don't think I would have liked it there anyway.  I ended up working for a cool small manufacturing company who made educational scientific equipment instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're probably right! Honestly they were older than I am. My dad's friend had an old DOS box he showed me. He called them DIMMs but that was probably just by habit. My understanding is that DOS usually expected just 1MB of RAM right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. You could have quite a bit, and 32mb setups were common. However, without a piece of software called a memory extender (which was built into later programs), software could only access the first 640kb of memory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a sort of limit at 640KB of conventional memory, with anything beyond that requiring trickery to access, if thats what you are thinking of.</p>
<p>My first home PC was 486 with 16MB of RAM which were all SIMMs.</p></div>		</li>
