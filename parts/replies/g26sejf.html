<p>If not, I dont understand that logic. I run a business that uses laser cutters. Now if I was going to upgrade one I wouldn't remove a fully working, all ready paid for machine months ahead of having the replacement!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This logic right here is how you know it's in bad faith and trying to subvert a fair and free election. </p>
<p>IF these new machines were way more efficient, there still isn't ANY reason to be removing them without having the replacements ON HAND. And furthermore, since this IS the federal government, I'd expect that  (under normal circumstances, which this is clearly not) there would be testing sites that show these new machines working well in their intended environment. They would be taking notes about how much faster these machines would be, based on the site tests... People would have heard of this before election time. Like, this is utter bullshit. </p>
<p>When people get their ballots, they should bypass the federal postal service completely IF they can :</p>
<ol>
<li>Request a mail-in ballot.  </li>
<li>Do not mail it.  </li>
<li>Google your <strong>supervisor of elections</strong> to see where you can drop off your mail-in ballot. Its usually NOT THE POLLING PLACE. All states allow this!</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is what you're accomplishing by doing this:</p>
<ol>
<li>You're not relying on the USPS to get your ballot in on time, so no matter what, your ballot gets in on time.  </li>
<li>You don't have to worry about standing in long lines and risking infection. You're just stopping by to drop it off.  </li>
<li>You still voted! Hooray!</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, when you drop it off find out how to track it online to make sure it is verified. California, Oregon, Washington Colorado have systems that can track your ballot just like tracking a package from Amazon.</p>
<p>Edit: I do need to disclaim this might not be an available option in all states.  :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious if the machines were useful before they were being removed, and if there was any news on when replacements will be coming?</p>
<p>Based on what I'm hearing about how <a href="https://twitter.com/FlossdnParadise/status/1294380298474524678/photo/1" target="_blank">more machines were being removed from blue states</a>, I'm wondering if there are any feasible reason for the removal of the machines just before the elections that can still claim this isn't politically motivated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The machines are/were very helpful. They took the magazines and put them in order for our routes. Now they just come in tubs and we have to put them in order. On a good day it can add an hour or more to your morning. Sometimes 3 hours or more on a bad day. If they take away the machines that sort regular mail we might never leave the office.</p>
<p>I think they are claiming all this is just to make us more efficient but this is all just to mess with the election. Hitting blue states first is just one more way they are so transparent in their fuckery. </p>
<p>Replacements are coming &quot;soon&quot;. New Trucks to replace our aging fleet are also coming &quot;soon&quot;. They started saying that 7 years ago. We were trained on how to use some new package scanners to replace our old ones. We would be getting them &quot;soon&quot;. That was over a year ago. They haven't mentioned anything about them since</p></div>		</li>
