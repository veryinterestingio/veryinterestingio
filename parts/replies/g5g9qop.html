			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. And adding to this troubled sleep can add to anxiety. It’s a closed loop: anxiety &gt; elevated cortisol + lower HRV + elevated resting heart rate &gt; increased visceral fat and trouble sleeping &gt; increased conversion of testosterone to estrogen, upsetting the hormone balance &gt; more anxiety &gt; start back at the beginning of the cycle. </p>
<p>Once you have gone around this cycle enough times, it is very difficult to turn things around (speaking from personal experience).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the interest of furthering understanding of PTSD might I recommend the research of Dr. Keicolt Glaser at Ohio State for people who would like to go beyond ELI5. When I was first diagnosed it was very grounding to see my medical problems, even bloodwork results. reflected back to me in her research. If you are struggling may it bring you some peace too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds interesting. Does this research also suggest any solution for constant stress/anxiety, or it is strictly just about the effects of anxiety, like OP asked? I assume, from your wording of &quot;too&quot;, you have successfully achieved a certain level of recovery, which sounds awesome! I'll definitely look into it after work. Many thanks for the recommendation!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really only that when you know the specific mechanics causing the problems it puts solutions in perspective. </p>
<p>Some were easy like fish oil supplements for an imbalance in n6:n3 ratios, that relates to heart health but additionally when I saw those ratios in her research I went to my blood work and was like OMG it’s right there, physical evidence of what I’m experiencing! It was validation that this was not in my head. There was a real, measurable, physical problem with metrics that can be checked to gage recovery and when you realize that it changes how you view the fight ahead and you realize that there are other metrics that can be objectively measured also. Which is a damn sight better than just asking someone how they are feeling. </p>
<p>She also has a paper on the metabolism of trauma victims. It shows how the metabolism drops off a cliff after a meal instead of gradually slopping away. This results in an average weight gain of 7.6 lbs a year. I was doing everything right and I had always been a healthy weight...I couldn’t understand why I was putting on weight or why it wouldn’t come off. I had doctors pressuring me to loose weight because of the high blood pressure I had developed and the blood work on my heart. It was crazy making ....but it was never me. All of it was a result of the trauma I had suffered. It wasn’t my doing, it was all my injury. So if you know that then you don’t waste energy trying to loose weight by being in the gym for hours 6 days a week, you do therapy 6 days a week and 90 minutes of exercise for regular health.</p>
<p>She has something like 20 research papers on the physical effects and what they do is allow you to properly identify the problem so you can identify the proper solution and that is what brings some peace. </p>
<p>Recovery for this injury is slow and never full but things can get better. I’m getting better. 4 years ago I was sleeping a combined total of 45 minutes a night, last year 2-3 hours, this year 4-5 hours. My blood pressure has come down. I don’t need fish oil anymore. It’s a ton of work but it’s really helpful to be able to review those years of metrics when you have days or weeks when you feel like you are day one with this. </p>
<p>... and I think with all the veterans and victims of domestic violence or sexual assault in our lives that it is important for people to know about this research to enable them to be supportive of themselves and others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! For me this resulted in, among other things, almost constant pain in my balls for months. That was a tough one to figure out. Once they found out it was just a muscle down there I could be mindful of it, try to relax it and the problem was almost instantly fixed.</p></div>		</li>
