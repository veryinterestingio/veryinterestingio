			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly, but probably not. Immunity is the outcome of individual, environmental, and viral factors. As with many multifactorial phenomena you end up with a bell curve, but pointing to the far left side of the curve and asking if there’s one single factor isn’t usually productive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the strange quirks of many multifactorial problems is that you can have very strong statistical signals of relationships for each of the factors when looking at a problem as a whole, but when you break the factors up and test them 100% independently, the relationships fall apart.</p>
<p>Probability is a nasty business, and that's before anyone even talks about anything as specifically difficult as a pathogen spreading in a population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 95% effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine is that it is 95% more effective than no vaccine. Of the 10,000 (i dont recall the exact number) in each group, 10 vaccinated people suffered covid symptoms a and 200 placebo suffered symptoms. So not exactly  95% of those vaccinated are immune to covid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strangely enough, for your numbers it equals. Assume 200/10,000 = 2% of unvaccinated people catch Covid. So if nobody is immune, 2% catch Covid. Now let's assume that 95% of people are immune in some specific group. That means 2%*(100-95)% = 0.1% of people in that group catch Covid, which is what happened (10/10,000 = 0.1%).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>95% CI means 95% confidence interval. They are saying that statistically, given their input numbers and the inference they’re trying to make, 95% of the time the true number would be somewhere between 0.01 and 0.02%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't what a confidence interval is. It means that ~95% of calculated confidence intervals based on this experimental design will contain the population parameter. These confidence intervals will vary from replicate to replicate. You can't make an inference to the probability that one CI contains the population mean. It is a subtle but important distinction. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please, don't take offense, but this is why I think it's more important to teach statistics and probability in high school rather than calculus or even high level trigonometry. Many, if not most, Americans are simply not equipped to understand statements like that. Average people are exposed to more statistical statements than circles and infinite sums of infinitely small things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a BA in math and y'all might as well have been speaking Chinese. Mathematical statistics isn't fun and is harder imo than your average undergraduate class. I took differential eqs or history of math instead since it wasn't a core requirement for my track. I'd opt to take graduate abstract algebra over undergrad mathematical statistics and I think that sentiment is popular.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>0.02% is the rate of reinfection they observed in their sample. 0.01% - 0.02% is the range of 'true' values that are reasonably likely to have given rise to this observed value, i.e. any rate of reinfection within that range is very consistent with the observed data.</p>
<p>The point others are making is that this is essentially just a description of a sample. The actual value of reinfection in the total population could be outside this range, and we just by chance got a different value in this sample, or the modelling that was applied was wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think we're at a point we should specifically emphasise reinfection as the reoccurrence of the disease, not just the presence of the virus in a test.</p>
<p>I keep seeing people lose their minds about the exaggerated media reports on reinfection/waning antibody levels/continuously testing positive on a PCR test.</p></div>		</li>

<p>PCR is sensitive enough that it can detect the viral leftovers after your mucosal immune response kicked in.</p></div>		</li>
