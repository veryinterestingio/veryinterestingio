			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd figure if a foreign power interferes with elections, they'd also try to fudge the census to shift more electoral college votes to states in which they have more influence. Probably more difficult than an election, but if it swings a single chair it's worth the effort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Swinging the population high/low enough to move a seat would probably raise some eyebrows. Especially for the IRS who would be wondering why there's a bunch of people who's never payed taxes before/why a lot of people just vanished into thin air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, being someone somewhere is much more static than changing one's voting decision. The census only cares about attendance and not choice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Def. Not suggesting anyone could get away with it. It dawns on me that there is a lag in the apportionment that would give 2 years to investigate any discrepancies, decreasing any likelihood of tampering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, as you alluded to, you can heuristically identify bad data in the census pretty effectively -- because it's gathering a lot of information.  Full address, ethnicity, family connections, et cetera.  You can follow up that data with random samples and other kinds of survey data and will get accurate results.  </p>
<p>There are lots of <em>other</em> ways to get to the same data the census delivers other than taking the census.  Many nations do not even conduct censuses like this and just rely on these heuristics -- there are even some arguments that following purely heuristic models is <em>more</em> accurate than a door-to-door census.</p>
<p>It's MUCH harder to heuristically exclude bad election results.  For a whole lot of reasons.  There's really just no other way to get accurate data on who will win an election other than conducting an election!  And so it's very hard to identify <em>bad</em> election data since all you have is the election data to compare it to.  Thus it's very important to make sure you collect that election data meticulously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If elections are that sensitive to tampering, then we really need to come up with a better system for our in-person ballots which have almost no authentication scheme whatsoever. I could vote in every precinct in my greater metro area by walking in and giving a babe and street address from within that precinct (gathered easily from several publicly available sources) and as long as I didn't pick someone who had already voted that day, they would never catch me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Voting ID laws also prevent legitimate voting by folks who face obstacles to obtaining state IDs. It can be very costly and time consuming to get a state ID if you don't have all the other paperwork (and transportation) lined up. </p>
<p>Without a birth certificate and social security card, you have to get a passport which can require testimony from sworn witnesses as to your identity. </p>
<p>Also consider all the shut-ins who require assistance to get to the polling place on voting day (or who vote absentee, by mail). For them to get an ID, they have to travel to at least one (likely busy) government office that's usually even further than their polling place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Voting ID laws do not prevent this without also preventing people who would be otherwise eligible to vote to be unable to vote because they forgot their card.</p>
<p>To work around this they will almost certainly have a fallback mechanism, similar to what the TSA does at the airport if you don’t have an acceptable ID, or what the US does if you lose your passport in a foreign country.</p>
<p>So with that fallback mechanism you could sill accomplish the stated goal via social engineering (which was what the original attack was too).</p>
<p>Voter ID doesn’t actually solve this problem.</p></div>		</li>
