			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks very much for your question! Please see the resource below for good tips about social distancing with pets in households with infected owners. </p>
<p>There is good reason to have <strong>infected owners</strong> practice social distancing from their dogs, when possible. If this is not possible, the individual should wear a mask when interacting with the dog, avoid sharing food, utensils, or dinnerware, do not kiss or hug the dog, and wash hands before and after contact with the dog.</p>
