<p>Youre going to have to be MUCH more specific with your directions. Where does GMMs (Google Mars Maps) say it is?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't part of the problem with mars that the 'core is dead', and no longer active the way ours is. This is why they don't see any form of volcanic activity anywhere on the planet? So even if you went super deep, you wouldn't encounter warm, hot, and unlivable temperatures the way we do on earth, due to having a live core?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mars does have a molten core that would supply heat. There just isn't a strong enough magnetic field to provide protection from solar radiation.</p>

<p>Even the moon should have a somewhat molten core.</p>

<p>Edit: As pointed out, you would need both a strong enough magnetic field and an atmosphere with a stable ozone layer to provide protection from solar and cosmic radiation. Mars has neither, unfortunately, but who knows what we'll accomplish? Luckily this is not an issue underground or with other forms of shielding, which is how colonization would look in our lifetime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the thin atmosphere is the cause of the problem. If it were thick enough the magnetic field would not be needed at all.</p>
<p>(Edit: there are lots of followup questions about the magnetic field being needed to maintain the atmosphere. I'll avoid the out-of-field answer about the timescales that an atmosphere could be held without a magnetic field, I just wanted to reply to the comment above me that planetary magnetic fields aren't really useful to protect us from radiation. In fact, Earth's magnetosphere would not be even nearly enough if it weren't for our atmosphere!)</p>
<p>Anyway, OP's question is about living underground, so in this case you can just ignore the radiation problem as all the regolith will block it. (Assuming you go deep enough. A few meters would suffice.) It will only be a concern for those who go out, but not a big one: solar radiation is easy to block if your vehicle walls are thick enough, and galactic cosmic rays are only a concern in the long term, not for an outdoors activity lasting just a couple of days.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Minor correction. There is theoretically plenty heat there to generate a magnetic field. The key is heat flux rather than raw temperature. Basically there is not enough heat flow from the core which may be due to the mantle being heated from a large impact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this.  We need to be underground to protect us from cosmic radiation, not chilly temperatures.  A thermonuclear reactor can supply any heat we need, but we still can’t generate magnetic fields large or powerful enough to do us any good against cosmic radiation. Rock works extremely well for that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mars's core is estimated to be 1,500K (1,226C) and for comparrison the Earth's core is 5,473K (5200C), so it is quite a lot cooler. </p>
<p>Mars is also about half the size of Earth though - combine that with the 38% gravity and likely at least a few other factors and the temperature difference might make more sense. </p>
<p>But yea so you could def go deep n find enough heat for life - the core is plenty to melt iron and just barely hot enough to melt steel.</p></div>		</li>
