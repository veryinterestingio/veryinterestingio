			<div class="markdown"><p>I think something that isn't being mentioned here is also the differences in how mammals give birth versus most reptiles. While there are some viviparous reptiles that give birth to live young, in most instances a reptile is going to lay eggs that are all roughly the same size and shape regardless of the shape of the embryo inside. Conversely, mammals have to give birth to much more developed young head first in almost all examples.</p>
<p>Having live births is already riskier to the offspring and mother than egg laying in terms of complications. Breech births are good and fairly common example of this. I have to assume that giving birth to offspring with two heads would be far likelier to lead to complications for a mammal than a reptile. At the very least it would make it much more difficult for the baby to make it out of the birth canal. That kind of complication would likely kill both the baby and the mother without artificial intervention. This would skew the statistic of how many animals are two-headed by quite a bit in favor of egg laying species, since both mother and offspring would be more likely to survive the birth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think when two separate animals fuse together this creates a chimera. You see this in two toned cats with different colored eyes. It can happen even in humans.
