			<div class="markdown"><p>Watts are real power. The power factor is the ratio between the product of the Amps and Volts and the real power i.e. the watts, and apparent power is measured in volt-amperes.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Additionally it wouldn't be relevant to a layman as most utilities only bill for real power. There are reactive power surcharges for very heavy inductive loads in the commercial electrical supply world, but that's another ballgame to the supply of wall chargers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, but I would just like to point out that watts and volt-amperes are physically the same thing, just like joules and watt-seconds are. It is just a (good) convention to denote real power with watts and apparent power with volt-amperes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Va is not a true measure of power consumed. If something has a high power factor then the non real power would be “given back” to the grid. </p>
<p>The wires etc would have to be sized for this non-real load since that current does flow but in terms of actual power used then only the real watts matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good info, and glad to hear the modern stuff is efficient. </p>
<p>Just wanted to add that anything with an LED that lights up when plugged in will draw current continuously. Most wall warts don't have those anymore, but there are still some that do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually you can find a roman numeral on the power supply label that indicates its efficiency level which also has requirements for the no-load consumption.  You'll mostly see IV, V, and VI level.</p>
<p>Here's some more information about those: <a href="https://www.megaelectronics.com/the-difference-between-efficiency-level-vi-and-v/" target="_blank">https://www.megaelectronics.com/the-difference-between-efficiency-level-vi-and-v/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A modern LED draws maybe 2mA at roughly 2V. That’s 4mW. There is more involved that will bring it up to maybe 30mW, or 0.03W. Virtually nothing for these purposes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I noticed that with an LED strip I bought off geek that uses a wall wart. It was hot after not being turned on for a day so I just unplug it now. Kind of silly now that I say this because I also bought an inline switch for the wall wart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have my chargers connected to a power strip and turn that off to cut down on vampiric power use without plugging/unplugging and perhaps losing track of a loose cord. I also do this with my computer, and the basement TV which I don't use often.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just for extra information, 1watt of power in the UK continually consumed (left on 24/7) for a year costs almost exactly one pound, total. It'll be perhaps a dollar in the US because electricity is cheaper there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's about right. One watt for a year is a bit over 8.7kWh. At a US national average of 12 cents per kWh we'd pay just barely more than one dollar for that energy. Slightly less on the west coast.</p></div>		</li>
