<p>And the sheets smell - I should have washed them months ago... And so scratchy why didn't I buy the nice brand?</p>
<p>And what is that fucking buzzing - it's the street lamp isn't it... Oh God I forgot to close the blind, that's gonna fuck me in the morning...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol for me its the opposite, I keep imagining scenario, story, fantasy until I can't turn off my brain. The only possible way I can sleep is if I unconsciously think about nothing for awhile and that's when I fall asleep.</p></div>		</li>
