			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine Cujo in the body of a Border Collie, but in 2D space.  Lots of growling and snarling and spitting and snapping of jaws. His whole body moves as if he were awake, but while laying on his side. It isn’t very coordinated, and he never stands up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I felt so horrible my dog when he'd have nightmares. As he got older he went deaf and blind. I couldn't do anything but hold him till he calmed down.
I miss him, but at 15 he was ready to go. He had bone cancer. </p>
<p>Do you think something like a thundershirt would help him when he sleeps?</p></div>		</li>
