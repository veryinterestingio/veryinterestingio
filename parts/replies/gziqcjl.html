			<div class="markdown"><p>Superb answer, can we say QUARKS ARE FORMED BEFORE ATOMS WERE FORMED? Because they are formed under such high temperatures splitting atoms cause such destruction in  using atom bombs?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes- quarks formed before atoms formed. This was a necessary precondition, because the normal matter discussed in the answer above (neutrons, protons) are in fact formed from combinations of quarks.</p>
<p>The picture was essentially similar to what was described above. Initially the universe was too hot to allow stable quarks to form, but as it cooled down this became possible. After cooling a little longer it became possible for quarks to combine into &quot;normal&quot; matter (called hadrons). </p>
<p>I don't know enough about quarks and subatomic physics to give you a good description. I can tell you that physicists have divided the early universe (starting with the Big Bang) into a series of epochs, and the story for each epoch is essentially the same. The hot universe was too hot to allow complex structures to form, but as the universe cooled suddenly we now have more interesting, more complex structures.</p>
<p>However, the answer about atoms above happens relatively late in the Big Bang chronology, and all of the &quot;weird&quot; stuff had already gone away. In the earlier epochs there are questions about antimatter, dark matter, whether certain fundamental forces did or did not operate, etc. Stuff I really have no clue about.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because of the strong nuclear force. You probably already know that the electron and its antiparticle the positron have a property we call &quot;electric charge&quot;. According to the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the quarks that make up neutrons and protons have an additional property known as &quot;color charge&quot;.</p>
<p>In the same way that having an electric charge causes particles to experience the electromagnetic force, having color charge causes quarks and antiquarks to experience the strong nuclear force, and this is what is responsible for the quarks binding together to form neutrons and protons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How did gravitational time dilation affect the big bang's expansion rate given how much gravity had to be in one place? For instance, would Nucleosynthesis appear to have occurred much later than 10-20 seconds after the Big Bang from an observation outside the Big Bang's gravitational well?</p>
<p>I'm speaking hypothetically here since space didn't exist outside the Big Bang.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think the size of the universe was big enough for time dilation to be significant, and gravitational time dilation comes from the difference in a gravitational field at two points. Since the entire universe was essentially mixed mostly equally (as seen from the CMBR and Inflation), it doesn't really make sense for there to be any notable difference in gravitational fields anywhere, and therefore no noticable time dilation.</p>
<p>However if there is any proof or paper on this I would be very interested to see it, pls send me if you have.</p></div>		</li>
