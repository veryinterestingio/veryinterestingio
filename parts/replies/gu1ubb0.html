			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it is very quick. I had my fourth and final surgery on my leg recently and it was time to put me under. Usually, they'd give me the Sufentanil (painkiller) and within 5-10 seconds they'd inject the Propofol (sleep drug). This time, they decided to wait for about 30-40 seconds... By the end of that, I was in full-blown Opioid wonder land.</p>
<p>I started noticing the Sufentanil about 5 seconds in, but damn it got strong at the 30 seconds mark.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not as much as I felt like I pooped myself. Toward the end, my hands got insanely hot but once they were done I was fine. The weirder part was when they ran saline through the IV and I could taste it.</p></div>		</li>
