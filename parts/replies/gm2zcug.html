I was very sick, my baby died and I nearly died too. Because my liver was affected, I had shoulder pain for a couple of weeks. I thought it was muscle pain from lying in bed so long. Years later, in a facebook group for HELLP survivors I learned about that nerve. The body is weird</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I have a form of cardiac cirrhosis and while I wasn't accused of drug seeking, I was made to feel like I was crazy for feeling pain before it was discovered because ultrasounds were clear and 'the liver doesn't have nerves'. I was told it was gas, and a hepatology PA just said 'well if it's been going on that long it can't be anything bad'.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have migraines preceded by scintillating scoot as every year or two.. I always  wondered what the cause/mechanism was. I just did some brief Googling but couldn’t easily find anything about meninges.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I understood the meninges (vessels) contracts when the body is under a lot of stress, Dehydration, or certain chemicals like nicotin. The Moment the meninges relaxes again it swells and puts pressure on the brain. For me the visual cortex gets the most pressure and thus I turn partly and temporarly blind. The increased pressure triggers inflamation and thus pain. That's how I understood the process but if I'm wrong there is always Cunninghams law.</p>
<p>Here is a picture of the flow of the blood in meninges (If everything works, am on mobile)

<p>I put it here because I think it visualizes why the visual cortex (backpart of the brain) is prone to problems related to migrains. You can see how narrow the paths of the vessels are.</p></div>		</li>
