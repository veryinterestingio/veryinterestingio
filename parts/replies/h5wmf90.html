			<div class="markdown"><p>Targeted therapies is a great example of how far cancer treatments have come and where itâ€™s going. All cancer is different and DNA sequencing has evolved so much in the last few decades. I work in a lab and we sequence DNA from tumors and are able to easily screen cancer patients for very specific hot-spot mutations. Few mutations, when found, have FDA approved drugs that target them. But from the looks of it, there are so many targeted drugs coming into clinical trials with the help of us finding those mutations in patients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think You have a rough idea but that's not entirely true. </p>
<p>I have a patient who had the proper mutation but also had developed a nearly fatal pneumonia by dose 3 then he had fungus growing everywhere, a lobe of his lung and his oesophagus included.</p>
<p>Immunotherapy is like chemo, it has its uses where research shows it works. </p>
<p>Also the hair falling out, while common, is not a necessity - in fact I believe in my ward most don't go bald. We mostly use ciaplatin and carboplatin, vinorelbine, pemetreksed, etoposide.</p></div>		</li>
