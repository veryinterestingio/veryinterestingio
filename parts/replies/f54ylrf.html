			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure but have you ever seen how little land we use in the U.S. and Canada? There is room for the population to quintuple in size and still have tons of empty habitable land left. We just keep choosing to live in the same areas which drives the cost of property through the roof. This is obviously driven by a need to be where the jobs are but how much longer will that last? The IT industry is already adapting and hiring more and more people that work almost entirely from home because there isn’t any real advantage to having them in an office. My cousin is a high level IT admin for a major bank and he only goes into the office once or twice a week if at all. Everything he does can be done from home via video conferencing and remote connections. The internet has largely made distance irrelevant. Soon it will be crane and heavy machinery that are operated remotely from anywhere in the world which has already been developed and deployed in disaster zones too risky for humans to enter. Drone operators can fly surveillance missions from the other side of the globe. As the need to be clustered around job centers goes away more people will be able to move to areas with much lower costs of living. If I could find one of those jobs I would move to Marquette Michigan tomorrow. A beautiful city in Michigan’s upper peninsula with tons of history, character and amenities that has always been hampered by a lack of job opportunities. The future will make its remote location irrelevant to employment.</p></div>		</li>

The property values where they came from are so high that they can sell a modest house and buy the biggest houses in our area and still have money to burn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ofc, because California real estate was the best investment they could've made. That 120k home they bought in 1960 sold for 1.2 million in 2017, and that's before any retirement savings or other income they have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I grew up in an economically depressed area of Florida. The only industry was tourism. As a young adult I moved away in the 90s. Years later I found that housing costs there had doubled but not people's income. I asked others how that could have transpired. They said it was mostly Germans and asian investors that bought up the real estate and that locals were still relegated to trailers and shitty apartments.</p></div>		</li>
