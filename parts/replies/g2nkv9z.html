			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! Monty from Xiph goes into great detail about how digital audio works with hands-on demos in <a href="https://youtu.be/cIQ9IXSUzuM" target="_blank">this</a> video, which I <em>highly</em> recommend for anyone interested in this subject. Most people's idea of digital audio is wrong.</p>
<p>My favorite little factoid that nobody knows for audio production is that most people will tell you there's no difference between 44.1kHz and 48kHz, but actually 48kHz is twice as good in certain situations. The human hearing range goes to 20kHz, while 44.1 kHz audio can reproduce up to 22.05kHz and 48kHz audio up to 24kHz. That means the latter actually has twice as much frequency headroom <em>above</em> the human hearing range. Which means that any time you do processing that needs an antialiasing filter, which has to operate entirely in that frequency headroom band, the filter can be half as steep! That can mean a slightly better sound, or (paradoxically) lower CPU usage even though the sample rate is higher. I learned that from this <a href="https://youtu.be/-jCwIsT0X8M" target="_blank">fabfilter</a> video by Dan Worrall, which I also highly recommend for anyone interested in the audio production angle, and why higher sample rates <em>there</em> do make sense and do matter, but are not always the best option either.</p></div>		</li>
