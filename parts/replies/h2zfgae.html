			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this: Even if accidental, the site must be treated as if a crime scene, as it very well may be. Immediately clearing rubble, on top of compromising search and rescue operations, may also disturb key evidentiary areas (where a propellant exploded, for example).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That actually takes a far distant second priority. First priority is search and rescue.<br />
I live in christchurch nz and we did this first hand after the quakes.<br />
No one even cared about fault or investigations until the bodies were out. That took place months later Here's a<a href="https://canterbury.royalcommission.govt.nz/Final-Report-Volume-Six-Contents" target="_blank">final report</a>in an actual building collapse</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Christchurch was special because of the number of buildings. With just one, you can easily squeeze in a photographer or two while doing the rescue. They can even help planning the rescue efforts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Natural disasters are treated differently in cases such as this, since no fault can be attributed, aside from possible construction or maintenance faults. Search and rescue is always the priority, regardless of cause. What Op was asking is, why don't they just clean the entire site of rubble immediately after, which my original assessment stands, ie crime scene analysis during and after rescue operations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or even if not a <em>crime</em> scene, and even if nobody is injured, it's often just important to determine the cause. Hauling everything out straightaway could destroy that evidence too.</p></div>		</li>
