			<div class="markdown"><p>I read a book by Douglas Adams (author of The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy) called Dirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency. In it, a mathematician moved into a house and the movers got a sofa inextricably stuck in a stairwell. He had a computer running simulations of the couch moving around 24/7. The joke probably would have hit home better if I’d known about this problem.</p>
<p>edit: lol, the Wikipedia article mentions the book.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can imagine how you would brute force the lower bound: you try lots of different sofa shapes and you’ll eventually get a fairly big one that fits.</p>
<p>How do you find an upper bound? How do you guarantee there isn’t a larger and differently shaped sofa that fits? The Wikipedia page links to various academic maths papers on upper bounds but I was hoping for a layman explanation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically you would prove that a certain size sofa is possible to move through the door, but that a sofa of any larger volume must not fit. This would be pretty trivial to prove for the set of sofas of a single shape, I think, but not for arbitrary shaped sofas. So the tricky part is proving that there is no possible shape of sofa that would allow a larger one to fit through. My gut intuition is that the proof would end up being a proof by contradiction, but there are quite a few types of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof" target="_blank">proofs</a> and it's also been a long time since I did any stuff regarding geometry and spaces.</p>
<p>Edit: also it is possible to put upper bounds on the problem. Trivially if the volume of the sofa is equal to the total space in the hallway/corner, then it won't be possible. You can then find ways to lower the upper bounds while also finding larger and larger sofas that do fit. Eventually you might converge to the solution, or at least get a very narrow range</p></div>		</li>
