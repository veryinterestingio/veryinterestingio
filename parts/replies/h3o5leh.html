			<div class="markdown"><p>This information is very helpful, thanks. It raises another question, however. There does exist an Oral vaccine for Polio which is still used in some places. How is it that we can vaccinate against polio orally? Why don't we still use the oral vaccine for polio in the US? Why don't we have oral vaccines for other diseases as well?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The oral polio vaccine is a live attenuated form of the virus.  It passes the mucosal membrane and replicates, just like normal poliovirus, to elicit an in immune response, but is much weaker and has a very low chance of causing paralytic poliomyelitis. However, there is a ~1 in 2-3 million chance of mutation to a more virulent strain, which is why oral is not used in places where polio is no longer endemic, such as the U.S.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oral polio vaccine contains viruses which are functional but weakened, not killed. It has the possibility of spreading to people around the vaccinated individual or causing severe polio symptoms, albeit rarely. Not a risk worth taking in the US with money and a good healthcare infrastructure to distribute shots. The shot form is inactivated and can't spread or cause severe neurological symptoms.</p>
<p>Edit: polio the virus spreads through oral transmission, from contact or ingestion of contaminated food or water. Ingesting the weakened virus orally as a vaccine mimics how you would be exposed to the real virus in nature in terms of activating the immune system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Polio spreads orally through contaminated water. An airborne (Covid) or bloodborne (rabies) pathogen could not be vaccinated for as effectively orally.</p>
<p>You could vaccinate for an airborne pathogen with a nasal spray vaccine.  Nasal vaccines can cross the capillary exchange in the sinuses and get into the blood stream, or flow down the esophagus into the digestive system, but it's not as effective as injections for bloodborne or oral pathogens.</p>
<p>Contact pathogens, like small pox, are extremely easy to spread and therefore can use multiple vaccine delivery modes (including the ancient 'scratch the skin and rub the puss from a cow pox blister into the scratch' inoculation) however injections are still most reliable.</p>
<p>So, injections are the fastest and most reliable form of vaccination for all forms of pathogen; oral, airborne, contact, and bloodborne.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not the same as antibodies, but it's still the passing on of adaptive immunity!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this mean that &quot;immunity&quot; passed from the mother lasts only as long as the baby is being fed? Like with the covid vaccine for example?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.</p>
<p>(Probably less than that, because only the gut-resident antibodies will be replaced from drinking the milk. The blood antibodies are not replaced after the first day or so after birth, so they fade away relatively quickly. However, the baby’s own immune system ramps up over the same period, so that after say 4-6 months the mother’s contribution is quite small, and the baby is providing its own immunity.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The antibodies in breastmilk break down in the guts but stay active for a few days in the throat, which is likely able to fight against pathogens that are just entering the body (those transmitted through air for instance). So, really only babies who are nursing on a daily basis will benefit from the antibodies in breastmilk.</p></div>		</li>
