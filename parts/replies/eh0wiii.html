			<div class="markdown"><p>Another encouraging progress in the field of vaccines has been development and evaluation of evidence-based approaches to addressing vaccine concerns and increasing vaccine uptake.</p>
<p>First some context. We should remember that even now most parents vaccinate their children. Only a small fraction of parents are outright vaccine refusers. However, there is a substantial group of parents categorized as so called “fence sitters”. We have increasing number of tools to address their concerns. </p>
<p>My Emory team along with colleagues at Johns Hopkins and University of Colorado has come up with approaches that combines several streams of evidence in the area of vaccine acceptance. The approach we suggest includes a few steps. Specifically, providers should:</p>
<p>a) establish empathy and credibility with the parents/patients by acknowledging their shared interest in the patient/child’s welfare, b) briefly address any specific concerns c) pivot to the risk associated with severe measles outcomes, d) emphasize the high effectiveness of the MMR vaccine. For example, conveying that individuals can be protected against measles through a highly effective vaccine enhances their perceptions of self-efficacy and response efficacy – a driver of persuasion and behavior change, and e) provide a strong, personalized recommendation for vaccination; emphasizing that provider recommends vaccination not only to their patients but also to their family and friends.   </p></div>		</li>

<p>Someone mentioned that the link isn't working (sorry, new to Reddit). Here's the name of the book: &quot;The Clinician’s Vaccine Safety Resource Guide: Optimizing Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases Across the Lifespan&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>I wasn't able to access the URL with the link given as is. It seems the slashes after the ref are backwards and because reddit converts them into hex codes (%5C) for the actual link behind the text, the site/browser(?) can't correct for it and amazon throws a 400 error. Copying and pasting the text works fine, since the slashes are corrected to forward slashes automatically. It's also possible the backslashes aren't required at all. Usually I don't see those in ref links, just the underscores _. And it's also possible the ref portion isn't necessary unless it's some kind of tracking for promotional purposes or something. Anyway, you might want to double check the ref part of the link.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a layman, I love evidence. I think that people speaking without data to back them up is both counterproductive and dangerous, and ultimately believe that is what has caused a lot of anti-vaccination sentiment. For that reason, I personally choose not to speak on topics I am not well-enough informed about.</p>
<p>With that being said, my fear is that highly skilled doctors such as yourself all the way down to family medicine doctors who <em>do</em> have the data and pre-requisite knowledge to back them up will tend to approach the presentation of information from a very rigid, methodical standpoint as they might in attempting to share this information with their own peers. I feel this creates a bit of a &quot;preaching to the choir&quot; situation - as those who you are sharing this data with either fully agree with the concepts you're discussing, or don't care about the data you are presenting. I feel it detaches from the humanity of the issue. Ultimately while I am extremely pro-vaccine, I feel most who are staunchly against them are against them out of fear, and a misguided sense of care for the vulnerable, especially children.</p>
<p>Do you feel &quot;fear mongering&quot; has a place in the educational community on the pro-vaccine side? Taking a step back from data and numbers and attacking the issue head-on, or do you feel that would be irresponsible?</p></div>		</li>
