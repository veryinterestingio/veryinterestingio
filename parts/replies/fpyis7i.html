			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work for Target Corporate a few years back. When I interviewed I brought up this use case and how incredible it was. Everyone I interviewed with said that Target was ashamed of that and didn’t see it as a positive example, which I found fascinating. But yeah, it was sort of a fluke and the media played it up to be a bigger thing than it really was.</p></div>		</li>
