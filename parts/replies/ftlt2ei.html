			<div class="markdown"><p>I have been eager to claim that I am alive for the advent of world-wide available consumer wifi. I'm thinking of the ability to communicate safely and spread new ideas. Think of how impactful the internet is in the developed areas of the world. Imagine if that were available everywhere. A new age is coming</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dodge is a strong word, but they'll have to plan routes specifically to avoid them, yes. Just remember...space is freaking huge. Even in a specific orbital regime, tens of thousands of satellites is still not incredibly dense. Of course, this assumes that they're in controlled, predictable, documented orbits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They track all know 100,000+ objects in orbit. Even with 40,000 of them, they are the size of a suitcase  hundreds of miles apart.   Like getting dropped in the desert and worrying about stubbing your toe on the last guy who got dropped somewhere in the desert. :-)</p>
<p>But no, it’s something they’re aware of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best way I've seen to visualise how spread out and big space is, is to imagine 10,000 things in your house, then the same 10,000 spread over a stadium, then spread them over a city, then over a state, then over a country, and then over the whole earth, and then push all of those up into space. </p>
<p>The other one I've seen is imagine there were only 10,000 people in the US, all as far apart from eachother as possible, then imagine trying to drive from one side of the US to the other without hitting any, doesn't really sound that difficult. Space is a lot bigger than this, so they will be really far apart</p></div>		</li>
