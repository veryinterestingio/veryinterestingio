<p>ETA: I see someone below already beat me to this demonstration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, exactly. In fact there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_bell_spider" target="_blank">spiders</a> here on good ol' earth that make webs underwater and trap air bubbles in them so they can have a little house to chill in while they hunt underwater creatures.</p>
<p>In real life you wanted to build such a thing you would simply need some sort of chamber beneath the water that was 1) heavy enough to stay submerged when filled with the volume of air the space could hold and 2) had some sort of mechanism to either replenish the air with fresh air from the surface or otherwise &quot;scrub&quot; the existing air so you didn't die from lack of oxygen.</p>
<p>My brother and I made a super primitive one in our swimming pool when we were kids using some poly sheeting, buckets filled with rocks, and a pump clamped on to an old hose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It just takes practice to find the right balance between blowing the air out and the water getting in.</p>
<p>When you get really comfortable with it, it's like you're always right on the edge of blowing bubbles out your nose but you don't. Some leaks out now and then, but it's like you're balanced on a balance beam just keeping the air pressure at the right level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you able to hold your breath without plugging your nose? When you do it, do you hold your breath by blocking the air from leaving your chest (in the same way you might cough), or does the little flap at the back of your throat close up so air doesn't escape through your nose (like when you talk but don't sound nasally/make an 'n' or 'm' sound)?</p>
<p>When you are underwater, many people have the natural instinct to do one of those two things, however neither of those will keep water from entering your nose if you go upside down. However, many also do not. </p>
<p>Try holding your breath on land without plugging your nose, and think about/feel where exactly you are stopping the air from coming out. If your cheeks blow up, you're stopping the air with your nose at the back of your throat. If your cheeks don't inflate or you can still open your mouth without losing air, it's in your chest. Once you figure that out, try holding your breath underwater and see if anything changes.</p>
<p>However, neither of these will stop water from going up your nose if you flip upside down/roll onto your back. The only option is to either blow out air, or plug your nose (or I guess just let water get in, but most people don't like that). Personally, I use my top lip to plug my nose. I pucker my lips and use the bottom to push the top lip straight up into my nose and cover both nostrils. It's weird to think about until you see it happen.</p>
<p>Source: I've been around pools since I was a baby, swam competitively from 5-17, and have worked anywhere between lifeguard, swim instructor/coach, and aquatic coordinator between the ages of 15-25 (current). I've spent a lot of my life underwater.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re blowing out your nose too hard. You only need to hold the water out. It doesn’t take much exhalation to do it. Start by going underwater while blowing very gently out your nose. Then stop blowing. No water should come in.</p></div>		</li>
