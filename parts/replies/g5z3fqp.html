			<div class="markdown"><p>Your answer is much more helpful than most on this thread to anyone curious about how many disparate corona viruses cause disease in humans.  However, just to elaborate because OP didn’t specifically ask about only known corona viruses that cause human infection only though.  There are many corona viruses known that can’t infect humans (that we know of).  As this source (from over a decade ago) clarifies, there are so many different corona viruses in bats alone that we started categorizing them in groups instead of strains. “Phylogenetic analyses of the spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleoprotein structural proteins and the two conserved replicase domains, putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and RNA helicase, revealed that bat coronaviruses cluster in three different groups” including a group which is similar to the 3 most feared of the human corona viruses, SARS, MERS, and SARS2... with SARS1 and 2 having a spike domain that binds to ACE2 membrane bound proteins and MERS binding to a separate membrane bound protein found in cells deeper in the lungs (likely contributing to both the fewer number of exposed people developing a viral infection and the higher fatality rate as just about any MERS infection was already a deeper lung infection than most respiratory infections start out at).</p>
<p>We use these groupings in other animals as well.  Many animals suffer from corona viruses that don’t seem to infect humans,  not just mammals,  but reptiles, snakes in particular, are susceptible to several corona viruses and paramyxovirus as well.  </p>
<p>So we can answer pretty accurately the number of different corona viruses that infect people regularly and are established in our daily lives (note that a strain in this case includes the variants of each with the mutations that keep them able to reinfect those with antibodies from previous infection, if we talk about the “multiple strains” of SARS2 that are just a few mutations disparate than we will have an almost unlimited number of strains of Corona virus (but that’s kind of like saying we have an unlimited number of cell types because each one has minor variations in overall sequence of DNA that is often harmless or doesn’t effect that cell for the short duration that the majority of our cells are alive for).</p>
<p>Here’s another paper that gives a small indication of how many corona viruses there are when we consider those that don’t infect humans.  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7395230/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7395230/</a> </p>
<p>I just want to clarify I’m not arguing with your answer at all, just elaborating in case OP, or anyone else, wanted to know that we are far from having counted all the corona viruses strains infecting members of the animal kingdom even though we have a definite answer for those that we are currently aware of infecting humans.</p></div>		</li>
