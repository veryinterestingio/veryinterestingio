			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact there’s a page on the CDC website that attempts to guide reporting on Covid-19 deaths. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/covid-19.htm" target="_blank">CDC Guidance</a> </p>
<p>If I’m reading it correctly it basically says that they would prefer suspected cover deaths to be confirmed with a test. While tests are in short supply, they tell doctors they can report as a Covid death if the deceased exhibited the symptoms and it was reasonable to assume that those symptoms were an underlying cause of death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different reporting standards may also give rise to misinformation in comparisons between countries, as different countries may not be attributing coronavirus deaths by the same metric. A country that counts any death of COVID-infected individuals as a COVID death is going to be biased toward a higher rate than countries that count only deaths that can be confirmed to be attributed to COVID.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In many cases, ya, probably. There's also the fact that a lot of people will believe what they want to be true before the other way around. Show them two numbers, and if they WANT the lesser number to be true because it supports their view, that's what they will choose to believe.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter if the number they like is published by the national inquirer, and the one they don't like is published by science journal from multiple years long studies done by thousands of experts who have all concluded, including those that were skeptical at first. </p>
<p>In this case, it's two numbers published by the same source. If they're eager to believe the lower number, that's what they're going to believe, no matter what you tell them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few years back I read a fascinating study that showed that people tend to display variable mathematical skills when the data they are analyzing conflicts with their assumptions.</p>
<p>The example given was they had three groups. People that self described as very pro-gun, people that self described as very pro-gun-control, and people that self described as having no significant opinion in either direction. They were provided made up sets of data for &quot;different areas&quot; that were explained to have lots or little gun control laws. They were then told to draw up some simple conclusions based on performing a bunch of averages on the data.</p>
<p>Surprise surprise, in both the pro/anti-gun groups when the made up data supported their opinion, they had a high tendency to do the math correctly. When the made up data clearly declared that their opinion was incorrect...all of a sudden mathematical errors started creeping up that skewed the final results away from where the data was pointed. And in the control group, they showed a fairly even display of math regardless of the data.</p>
<p>Now, to be clear, this wasn't wholesale lying across the board. It was sort of like, on math that pointed in a direction a person agreed with, they had an average of like 4-6% incorrect answers (some people just suck at math). Whereas on data that conflicted, the groups had like 15-20% incorrect answers. A noteworthy increase, but nowhere near allowing one to say that the other side completely lies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This so much. People are screaming to open on community facebook page and keep pulling this info. One if them was asking me to explain why the numbers are different. Like you cant read the page. So quoted the part where it says the data is lagged by 1 to 2 weeks. &quot;I dont understand.&quot; /sigh no you dont want to understand because it goes against what you want to believe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Often people will actively seek out or interpret information in a way that supports their beliefs, but the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias" target="_blank">confirmation bias</a> is also an unconscious process : people will remember information that agrees with them better than contradicting information. Everybody has a selective memory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe this answer is incomplete.  The pages go on to say that the ~35000 number is of deaths that are accompanied by a COVID19 positive test.  The ~65000 number includes both COVID19 positives (confirmed by a lab) and COVID19 suspected (not confined by a lab) deaths.  To count as a suspected case, they list a few criteria that must be met.</p></div>		</li>
