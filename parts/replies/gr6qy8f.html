			<div class="markdown"><p>If youre an average height person whos hyper jacked, it takes about 3500 calories a day just to maintain that amount of muscle. An average height person who isnt jacked would become obese eating 3500 calories a day. Its crazy how effective muscle building is for fighting fat. Only problem is the time and effort it takes to get hyper jacked. Not worth it unless that is a lifestyle you want</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really, what matters is consistently challenging training, regardless of specific reps. It's why both bodybuilders and weightlifters have huge quads, despite very different training protocols. </p>
<p>I think the high reps low weight = size is a correlation causation thing. That's how bodybuilders train, bodybuilders are big, therefore that's the effect. But in reality, bodybuilders train that way because they are not weightlifters, and they can get growth without the safety concerns, technical requirements, and added recovery concerns of lifting heavy weights.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there’s a number of different limitations on muscle strength. One of them is pretty obvious, it’s just the sheer physical limitations of the muscle according to its size. Like look at professional powerlifters, and that’s pretty much the limit of muscle strength in a nutshell. There’s another more interesting factor though, stemming from the action of golgi tendons. Golgi tendons organs are attached to your tendons, and they basically measure the amount of tension on your muscles and put a hard limit on the amount of strength you can exert in order to prevent you from snapping your muscles. That’s why chemically disinhibited people, like on drugs or high amounts of adrenaline, can be so ridiculously strong, their limiters get turned off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>...And can that work the other way? So if you had dysfunctional tendons due to a connective tissue disorder, the Golgi tendons organs might prevent you using your muscles?</p></div>		</li>
