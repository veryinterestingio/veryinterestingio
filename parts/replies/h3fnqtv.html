			<div class="markdown"><p>As light passes through a medium its velocity changes but the energy stays constant</p>
<p>Btw, when light passes through something like water a very energetic particle can go &quot;faster than light&quot; in that situation.  You can get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation" target="_blank">Cherenkov radiation</a>.  This doesn't violate special relativity because it is the speed of light in a vacuum that is the limit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly. Cherenkov radiation is when a charged particle moves faster through a dielectric than the propagation speed of light through that same material. This doesn't violate SR because the light was already moving slower than C.</p>
<p>Now, it IS possible for the phase velocity to be faster than light in meta-materials, which have a refractive index <em>less</em> than 1, but in reality the &quot;speed of light C&quot; is the speed of information. </p>
<p>The phase velocity vp can be less than the speed of light. It can also be greater than the speed of light, but this does not violate special relativity because the single monochromatic wave or constant oscillation does not carry energy or information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  On a macro scale, it's going to be hard to notice.  However, if you have a 1 Âµm -class prism, it would be potentially noticeable.</p>
<p>... Which is how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_tweezers" target="_blank">optical tweezers</a> work.  You have a small spherical (or close enough to) object, and put a big laser focused onto it.  If it moves off-center from the beam, the refraction of the light transfers enough momentum to push the bead back into the center of the trap.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/iPLIFdReFvk?t=2430" target="_blank">This allows you to control extremely small things for all kinds of interesting research.</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Optical tweezers (originally called single-beam gradient force trap) are scientific instruments that use a highly focused laser beam to hold and move microscopic and sub-microscopic objects like atoms, nanoparticles and droplets, in a manner similar to tweezers. If the object is held in air or vacuum without additional support, it can be called optical levitation. The laser light provides an attractive or repulsive force (typically on the order of piconewtons), depending on the relative refractive index between particle and surrounding medium.</p>
