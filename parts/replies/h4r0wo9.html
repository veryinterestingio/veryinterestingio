<p>I believe Malcolm or someone reassesses the assumption that T Rex's vision is based on movement was a mistake.   The reason the T Rex in Jurassic Park had to rely on vision was because it's sense of smell was knocked out by a &quot;cold.&quot;</p>

<p>If I recall right in the first book in that particular scene the rex knew they were there in front of it, but couldn't see them, and kept bellowing to try and flush them out. My reading was that it was just a relic of the amphibian DNA used to recreate it that caused the rex not to see them at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the books they also mention that the DNA is mashed with &quot;compatible&quot; dna from reptiles birds and mostly amphibians which give the animals a lot of characteristics that they wouldn't naturally have. Most of the animals being sick very often, T-rex having extreme movement based sight, raptors being hyper aggressive, dilo's being venomous, or in the second book the Carno's changing skin pigmentation a la chameleons. Also iirc a character stated that the animals were modified to not be able to swim yet a decent amount learned to swim approximately 200 miles.   </p>
<p>To me it seemed like Crichton purposely wrote in flaws to his science to explain any actual scientific flaws that there might be in the future in most of his books. I do miss his style of writing.</p></div>		</li>
