			<div class="markdown"><p>to add to this, the bars mean NOTHING concerning how well your device can reply to the tower. ONLY how strong the signal from the tower is.  </p>
<p>many people forget or simply don't know that your device has to have sufficient power to <em>transmit</em> as well as receive data.</p></div>		</li>

<p>‘Oh just hack the firmware of your device and boost more signal’. Yea, sure. Your laptop will receive data better, but it won’t be able to reply unless you also to hack the drivers of your WiFi on your laptop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And that's only IF your device isn't already transmitting at maximum power.</p>
<p>People like to think they can just &quot;boost&quot; their signal but really, that's a bunch of tv bullshit technobabble. There are a few applications where the device is nerfed on purpose to make manufacturing cheaper like they do with intel chips. Make a giant wafer, cherry pick the best chips off the wafer, call them i7 black edition. Pick the worst, call them i3 chips or pentiums. (I'll admit i'm not sure if the models correspond to the reality of the process, but you get the point.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have 5G launching in blips and blobs in Australia at the moment and everytime a new mobile wireless tech is launched there are some people who come out and start spouting &quot;5G is so fast it will kill fixed line&quot;.  It won't and it's because of congestion.  If everyone was using 5G instead of fixed line, 5G would grind to a halt.  </p>
<p>I wish people would understand this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's hard enough trying to tell my family that 5 people watching 4k Netflix on a single wireless 150N router isn't going to work. It's old,it's slow, it can't handle that kind of traffic. C'mon, bruhs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even from a logistics perspective, using 5G instead of running a line to the building is really stupid. 5G requires line of sight to work well, and even being around the corner of a building will make the speed drop off significantly.</p>
<p>So they already have to run a line pretty close to you for it to work. Might as well just also connect that line to your network.</p></div>		</li>

I’ve always assumed that they mean like, upload and download strength or speed.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Former cellular engineer. Specially the transport side of the house. Cell sites have cap that is easily hit. A few GbE to each site was normal as of six years ago, 10 GbE was used at major sites. The number is users pummeling the sites is greater than the max bandwidth to the site means you get no actual data service. Luckily though, because so many people text and use data your phone calls should be highly available.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is misinformed. Most calls are over the data network and dont use old voice channels. Qos is used to prioritize voice/sms over data. The 10g circuit isnt the bottleneck in cellular service. The bottleneckis the availible radio bandwidth.  Fun fact - if LTE fails most cell towers dont have the legacy voice channel bandwidth to handle standard call levels. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're sending texts via sms then yes, in fact they probably won't even be delayed. But if you're trying to send them over the internet (eg. WhatsApp or possibly iMessage) then there's no queue, it will just fail and try again later.</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Netns" target="_blank">Netns</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. There is a queue. Certain. Users get assigned a frequency and then that frequency gets divided into timeslots. The more users the longer between your phone assigned time.</p>
<p>There is also more signal interference which increases the risk that a packet isn't delivered properly which means you have to wait for your next timeslot and use it to send a request for a new packet and wait for another slot to get it.</p>
<p>To reduce interference problems the network packs information less tightly. Google Quadrature amplitude modulation for more information. But this means less information per radio wave which means less data per time slot.</p>
<p>The big advantage of 5g is that it has much better ability to handle many users. This means it doesn't slow down until there are orders of magnitude more users which allows for high speed low latency connections that are stable.</p></div>		</li>
