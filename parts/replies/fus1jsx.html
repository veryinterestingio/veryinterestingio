<p>But as far as I know (I think I have this from askreddit also) they shake in this case because they are not used to what you are doing. So the load and the movement.</p>
<p>It was something along the lines that you can imagine all your muscles are permanently flexing and relaxing in small steps to stabilise whatever you do.
When you do a new movement, your body doesn't know how to properly controll it, so its flexing harder than it has to, this creates the shaking.
And over a while, when you do the movement more often, the flexing will adapt more to the load.</p>
<p>Damn now I want to find the original answer to that question.</p>
<p>Edit: seems like it can have a lot of reasons. But couldn't find the answer I was googling for</p>
<p>So here you go, I think it was this post but I'm not sure. Also googling showed that it can also be because of lack of nutrients. But I work out a lot and if you ask me there is a difference in shaking when you are used to the movement and when you do a new exercise.</p>

<p>They don't shake if if I place a stronger force on the pedal.</p>
<p>Explain that to me.</p>
<p>Oh and my hands have an essential tremor, however after sports like volleyball they will be nearly uncontrollable. Really any exertion. Doesn't matter how often I do that sport, can be twice a week for years. Still happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it could also be adrenaline, in that case. That would be why weight lifters can be seen to do a few hops and jumps after a huge lift - there's a lot of unused adrenaline in the system for when the body was gearing up for a prolonged and exerted effort.</p></div>		</li>
