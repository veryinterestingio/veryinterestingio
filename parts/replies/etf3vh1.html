			<div class="markdown"><p>Apt analogy too, if we say the balloon is stress hormones, lactic acid and other metabolic byproducts that the body is not prepared to handle at high local concentrations.. While having possibly also diminished functions in the lived, kidneys etc. The balloon inflates if more air goes in that comes out..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True but those are not enough to keep the engine at optimal temps when it idles at high revs.  </p>
<p>Also, when you idle at high revs, you need to use really lean mixture of gas-air and that will also cause additional problems.. In fact, i think this is the closest from all the analogies so far.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, running the engine at high RPMs every so often is good as it'll burn off carbon deposits. It's known as an Italian tune-up (look it up, I didn't believe it when I was first told).</p>
<p>But this seems true for the heart too. Getting it revved up high for a little bit is good for it, but red-lining it for long periods of time is not.</p>
<p>To OP's question, there is some research that short acting stimulants, such as nicotine, might actually have cardiovascular benefits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm. That's probably why my corolla revs to high rpms sometimes during adaptive cruise control (no acceleration increase though, just revving)</p></div>		</li>
