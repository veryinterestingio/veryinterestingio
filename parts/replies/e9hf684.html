			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact! It will cut a baby’s skin! When my family first moved to the US my little sister broke her arm when we was a wee baby. When they went to remove the cast our pediatrician showed my parents how the saw can’t cut skin, and put it on his arm. When he removed the cast he cut her arm open. She still has a scar today. </p>
<p>This happened about 25 years ago, so now that I’m thinking about it, probably not the case anymore. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  The blade's range of motion does not exceed the elastic tensile upper limit of skin but the blade motion is wide enough to abrade the fixed fibers of the cast and cut/break the plaster within.  Skin moves with the blade, the cast moves against the blade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Instead of large cutting motions, the blade essentially vibrates at high frequency and low amplitude.  With the cast being firm and brittle, this cuts right though.  Your skin on the other hand is soft and flexible, so the saw just vibrates your skin.  That being said, I have seen cast saws cause small scratches to human skin, especially over bone or joint line such as a knuckle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other answers are mostly right, but missing a key detail which is that oscillating saws that remove casts are not sharp. They are not &quot;cutting&quot; the cast they are smashing it. They are moving side to side as well as in and out. The same is true of bone saws. </p></div>		</li>
