<p>What's down there that's hot enough and stationary that's causing repeated holes/volcanoes to form as the plates move above it?</p>

<p>well... Earth's mantle, I assume?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not by any means an expert, but.. I've heard one of the things that keeps the earth's core/mantle hot is radioactivity from heavy elements.  Maybe it's possible there's just a large enough concentration of these elements in that one spot to make things hotter than normal and thus enough to melt through the crust?  I have no idea how plausible this is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might be on to something there, although not so much heavy elements it seems as it is just more metals than normal.   </p>

<p>Wiki has a pretty good article on it explaining what they've found the chemical composition of some hotspots to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true to a certain extent. One of the first assignments we had in my geophysics course was to model heat flow from the mantle to the crust integrating all known major radioactive isotopic systems. Apparently the contribution of such heating to Earth's overall heat budget is asymptoting to 18-20 terawatts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plate Tectonic Theory explains that during the density stratification of the earth (during and immediately after accretion) a large proportion of the heavier (radioactive) elements were pulled toward the core by gravity thus displacing much of the lighter elements, elements like Al, Si, and O2 which form the bulk of the earth's crust and that today, these heavier elements near the core release energy that make the motion of the plates possible via convection currents.  There is also another source of heating that is poorly quantified.  Due to the earth's non-circular orbital path around the sun, there is varying gravitational compression on the earth's core that squeezes/relaxes in an annual cycle and it's thought that the friction from this process might be a significant additional source of heating but last I checked, no one was certain about that, at least, to what extent.  And yes, the interior structure of the earth is far from homogenous and, so, there is reason to believe that the energy sources driving the hotspots (and superplumes - like the one currently lifting up and ripping Africa in half from top to bottom) are the result of a localized increased density of energy-releasing elements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple working hypotheses that are currently being investigated through multiple independent lines of reasoning.</p>
<p>Geodynamicists (applied geophysicists) use computational tools to model observed processes (from the surface) and crust-mantle properties (densities, depths, rheology, etc.) in order to predict and qualify the behaviour of the mantle thermal structure. One of my favorite books on the subject was written by Geoffrey Davies (Mantle Convection for Geologists). Here, Davies postulates that hot spots responsible for &quot;plume volcanism&quot; are essentially the thermal opposite of subduction zones, where cold material is returned into the upper mantle (the upper 410 km of the mantle). In this hypothesis, the upper mantle is effectively a convecting mass.</p>
<p>Other folks like geochemists study the intricacies of mineral-melt systems in order to understand the relationships between the rocks produced by the hotspot and the physiochemical state of the hotspot itself. This is done mostly by applying thermodynamic theory to rocks. This work also requires plenty of analytical clout. Most of these data may be used to test and fine tune the aforementioned geodynamic models.</p></div>		</li>
