			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The full moon has an apparent magnitude of -12.7 from earth. According to u/mfb- Venus from Mercury would have an apparent magnitude of -7.7, -5 mag difference(So Venus would be ~1/108 as bright as the moon). Venus has about 3.5 times greater diameter compared to the moon but the moon from earth is only around 384.400 km (ignoring earth and moon diameter and orbital eccentricity. Not important for my point) away. Mercury-Venus is around 50 million km. So Venus would appear a lot smaller(~1/40 if I did make an error) and a lot darker.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You are right in that. Venus as seen from Mercury at their closest distance has an angular diameter of ~0.83 arcmin. The moon as seen from the earth has an angular diameter of ~31.04 arcmin or 37.4 times the size of Venus as seen from Mercury.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The moon is about -12.6 magnitude, each point of magnitude is about 1.5 times brighter than the previous one. The Moon is also much larger than Venus would be from Mercury.</p></div>		</li>
