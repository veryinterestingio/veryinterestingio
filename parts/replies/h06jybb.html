			<div class="markdown"><p>This procedure works so well that exceptions to it are worth noting.  When europeans settled the lower Chesapeake Bay, they had real trouble getting to fresh water.  They dug tons of wells and they invariably turned up brackish water, even those far enough away from the bay itself that contamination shouldn't have been a problem.  This made no sense - Virginia has tons of rain and streams, why were wells so unproductive?  </p>
<p>This was temporarily solved by moving a bit farther away from the bay where well-digging worked fine, but the mystery wasn't solved until fairly recently.  Turns out that the lower Chesapeake was formed when a massive meteor hit the place around 35 million years ago.  The obvious signs of a big crater were eventually obscured so nobody noticed it, but the event had so shattered the local geology that it made it difficult to form those nice lenses of fresh water that wells tap into.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome explanation.
My experience:
My buddy invited me up to his cabin for which I thought would be fly fishing and beer. I arrived and he handed me a shovel. I looked confused as hell. He told me we are building a well. Middle of nowhere in the mountains in Colorado. We dug this fucking well for hours, he put a tube down, and then did the rest of the world. Bam! We had a well and drinking water.
The rest of the trip we drank beer and fly fished haha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends what is the use of the subsurface water.   </p>
<p>You may just dig slightly bellow the surface for the shallow water aquifer but the amount of available water won't be high enough to cover everything, probably just basic needs.  </p>
<p>Or you can choose to dig up a connection to deep water aquifer for more permanent water solution.  </p>
<p>The depth can vary a lot according to local terrain, geologic predisposition, composition of soil, hydraulic connectivity with the water table etc.   </p>
<p>Basically, for deep water well you ideally want to get into phreatic zone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As most have pointed out you need to go deep to have more water. For modern well they dig 75 to 300 feet for residential well and farmers usually dig to 500-600 feet. But you dont want infiltration from the surface water so you place a metal tube called casing and you would force it down until you hit the bedrock. This way water need to come from really deep and is much better filtered. </p>
<p>Surface water usually contain sulfur, bacteria, tanin and more. Deep water will be clean but will contain more mineral such as : calcium, magnesium, iron.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes there are water rights in CO and you can own land but not own the water rights to it, in fact that's common.  However you can drill what's called a <em>household well</em> regardless of if you own the rights. <a href="https://co-realty.com/water-in-colorado/" target="_blank">Source</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Side note:  Abandoned wells are a huge safety risk.  It's a hole in the ground that has been covered up by grass/weeds/debris and you can easily fall in because you'll never see it and you probably won't be able to get out.  So next time you go stomping around the backwoods having fun, especially around an old abandoned house or homesite, be aware that these exist.</p></div>		</li>
