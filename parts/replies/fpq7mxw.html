			<div class="markdown"><p>Key point here..... there are only a handful of INDUSTRIAL processing plants. There are thousands of small, local slaughterhouses. My dad uses one every year to process one of our herd. They COULD do that if they wanted, but it would cost more to do it that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sudden surge in capacity is not something the small, local slaughterhouses could absorb. The small places are setup to do whatever they do plus/minus a percent or five, the current issue would be them up thousands of percentage points in volume. They simply don't have the physical capacity on hand to handle that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed.</p>
<p>I work in a small industry that is BOOMING since this happened.</p>
<p>In April we did 5x the amount of orders we normally do. We've already doubled the amount of orders for last may and it's only the 7th. </p>
<p>When you do forecasting for products you need you can estimate growth rates and order around that.</p>
<p>Currently we have 2-3x the staff we normally have and are having trouble sourcing products for orders and cleaning the warehouse.</p>
<p>So even though it's a boom it's a major struggle.</p>
<p>I can only imagine a slaughterhouse would have a much harder time recruiting qualified staff, keep with any regulations on space / distance and getting every thing you need (PPG, cleaners, blades etc) would be incredibly difficult ... plus delivery turnarounds and sourcing added in would be crazy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. My younger brother owns a local meat locker in small town Iowa. Before the large meat processors had issues, he was scheduled out 2 months. </p>
<p>After, farmers are bringing or selling (at a deep discount) his locker hundreds of head of livestock to process because the farmers can't afford to feed the livestock with a diet to maintain market weight. If you continue to feed the livestock out, the meat becomes pretty much useless for processing for public consumption.  Slaughtering is another option, but then you have the expense of getting rid of the dead livestock. Storage is not an option. He is buying what he can process.  </p>
<p>As of a couple of days ago some farmers are looking at 20 days of being down before they will have to euthanize hogs.</p>
<p>Edit: added a link to an interview of an Iowa farmer talking about the food supply chain issues. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. We typically split a full beef with my in-laws every year as they have the cattle. The local butchers in the 2 closest towns that my in-laws have used for multiple generations don't have an opening, even to slide the local regular guys in, until next April/May 2021. They are double booking as is. My best guess is this isn't local to my area. I don't see the small town butchers being able to handle anything close to what would be needed to make up for an industrial packing center.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small local slaughterhouses have their time booked for months already.  </p>
<p>Their capacity was exhausted almost immediately once the spread between cow and meat exceeded their higher prices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right but the combined total of them nationally that remain is maybe equal to one major industrial processing plant and getting animals to them is a difficult process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many of the small slaughterhouses are closed for the same reason that the big ones are (social distancing), and distributing small amounts of cattle to dozens of different locations (and then back) several hundred miles apart is simply not feasible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would also make costs go way up that way. A local butcher is probably equipped to butcher a couple/few animals a day. Some of the biggest Hormel and Tyson plants can handle almost 20,000 pigs per day. There's no way local butchers can fill that gap, and if they did, it's with hours of labor, not minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tagging on: the other major restriction in some parts of the world is the age of the cattle. In order to prevent Mad Cow (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, yeah I had to look that one up), cattle in the UK intended for consumption must be slaughtered below a certain age.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Feed lots are used to condition/cull animals for slaughter (not raise them) and are short-term holding areas. Every heifer sold at auction is pregnancy tested and no pregnant cows are sold for processing. We‚Äôre currently not selling nor shipping any of our cows because the market is fat, weather and water are good and prices are down (good meat heifers at auction for @ 60¬¢/lb right now). With diminished processing capacity, it‚Äôs smarter to keep beeves on good grass at the home range and wait for the rebound. The media is hyping the shit out of the ‚Äòwe‚Äôre gonna run out of food‚Äô story because, hey, 24hr news is ‚Äòessential‚Äô.</p>
<p>There are more than 800 federally inspected abattoirs in the US, not ‚Äú...only a handful...‚Äù and turning a cow into useful cuts of meat is surprisingly easy. A gambrel, a table, a sharp knife and less than an hour will see a cow reduced to grill-ready grub...and the gambrel is optional. Unless you‚Äôre processing on a huge scale, it doesn‚Äôt take any specialized equipment nor hard work to fill a freezer. States have their own rules when it comes to donating meat. If those criteria can‚Äôt be met, then JoeBob‚Äôs Homeless Shelter is forbidden from frying up any other-than-FDA-inspected meat, regardless of the source. Some states allow roadkill (AlaskaüôÇ) to be processed and donated if it is collected and butchered in a timely manner at a state-approved processor.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The big processors, notably Tyson, are pushing the story to stop any attempts at requiring worker protections. Meanwhile, their investments in congress and the senate (aka legalized bribery through &quot;campaign contributions&quot;) are buying provisions in relief legislation that will protect companies from liability for deaths from the pandemic caused by forcing workers to work without protection.</p></div>		</li>
