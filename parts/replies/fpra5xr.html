<p>They aren't sure whether it's the creation or dispersion of those pockets that makes the noise, but they're sure it's one of them!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would guess it's the cavitation bubble collapse creating the sound, much like how it's the cavitation bubble collapse causing the most damage when a mantis shrimp strikes its target. But then again, I don't know shit and am probably talking out of my ass trying to make conversation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you stretch the joint it creates a vacuum pocket that sucks disolved gasses out of the surrounding liquids. The gasses return to solution when the joint relaxes and the pocket you created ceases to exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was under the impression that the sound came from the bubbles forming, not collapsing.</p>
<p>As in, lowering the pressure beyond a certain point, dissolved gases suddenly release into gas bubbles, making the noise. Then when pressure has returned to normal, gases slowly dissolve back into the liquid, bubbles shrinking away slowly.</p>
<p>Considering how the noise happens when you stretch the joint, not when you release it, I think it fits better with observations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah thats how I see it too.</p>
<p>My right leg is fold for a few minutes.. When I stretch it, I can feel when it pops off.</p>
<p>I have the cringe feeling it I touch or &quot;lift&quot; my kneecap, that it might dislocate if I make it pop. Its in my head but just typing this turned me legs into jelly. Haha.</p>
<p>Also is there a worst feeling &quot;failing&quot; a pop? When I was a teen I couldnt sleep if it happened lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have that cringe feeling about my knees too -- based in reality.  Dislocated my kneecap recently doing nothing but using it normally--this combined with many years of dislocating my fingers just by the grasping heavy thin items (like boards, dry wall, etc.) , ankle and other joint pain since a child, I got checked out and it turns out I have EDS, a connective tissue syndrome that makes my ligaments structurally weak.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yet, the &quot;craking&quot; noise is very impressive and it correlates with what we can read about cavitation in this document <a href="http://brennen.caltech.edu/fluidbook/multiphase/Cavitation/cavitationnoise.pdf" target="_blank">http://brennen.caltech.edu/fluidbook/multiphase/Cavitation/cavitationnoise.pdf</a></p>
<p>&quot;To the researcher or engineer, the crackling noise that accompanies cavitation is one of the most evident
characteristics of the phenomenon. The onset of cavitation is often detected first by this noise rather than
by visual observation of the bubbles.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
