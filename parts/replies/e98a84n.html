			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d like to add a disclaimer to your comment! </p>
<p>You are 100% right that axial-flow (horizontal axis) turbines are slightly more efficient individually. However, an advantage that cross-flow (vertical axis) turbines have is that when in arrays with certain geometries they can perform significantly better together than they would in isolation. This characteristic is one of the reasons that there is current research on cross-flow turbine arrays and they will likely be implemented in the future. </p>
<p>Another thing is that the physics associated with cross-flow turbines are more complex and far more difficult to model than for axial flow turbines whereas for cross-flow turbines simple physics based models don’t exist (like blade element momentum theory). This makes experimental rather than computational simulation work much more necessary for technology development for cross-flow turbines. </p>
<p>Lastly, cross-flow turbines have different structural requirements because they are subject to cyclic loading, unlike axial-flow turbines. </p>
<p>That being said, with cross-flow turbines it is possible to put all the heavy mechanical components at the ground making maintenance far easier. They also have lower optimal rotation rates which is safer for birds and other wildlife. For those reasons and increased array power output I think cross-flow turbines will become more popular in the future. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! With regards to efficiency, is the test something like both styles are put in front of 30pmh winds and one produces more electricity than the other?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One more thing to add on this: your original question states that vertical axis turbines capture wind from all directions. That’s not true. </p>
<p>As other users have noted, axial turbines turn to capture wind from any direction. The problem with vertical axis turbines is that each blade gets pushed by the wind for half of the rotation but then causes drag as that same blade has to move against the wind to finish a rotation. Axial turbine blades are producing energy at all times during their rotation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe I'm missing something, but on an axial turbine wouldn't the same wind that pushes a blade in one direction then move against the blade as it comes back around? Seems no different than the vertical turbine in this regard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, it's not so simple. </p>
<p>With axial turbines,  you can assume mostly steady state airflow and optimize the shape of the blades based on the expected rotational speed. </p>
<p>You can also assume that the airflow around one blade does not significantly influence that around the others due to the large spacing.</p>
<p>These are two assumptions that make simulation and optimizing the shape and angle fairly straightforward for axial turbines.</p>
<p>Airflow around a vertical turbines is not steady state, but highly turbulent and highly dynamic, in a complex, three-dimensional way. One blade operates in air which is disturbed or influenced by flow from the other blades, for the majority of their rotation.</p>
<p>That means that, in the model,  information  created by simulating flow around one blade strongly influences the conditions around the other two. This creates a lot of internal feedback.</p>
<p>So, you run into the problem of GIGO. Garbage, in, garbage out.  If your assumptions about the operational conditions are a little off. You include something in the model that doesn't happen on the real thing, or you omit some factor that you shouldn't, that inaccuracy feeds back in on itself and can cause the model to be unrealistic.</p>
<p>This is incidentally one of the reasons why vertical turbines only tend to be efficient at a narrow range of wind speeds. because at that speed the turbulent wake created by a preceding blade passes the next blade in such a way as to boost it's performance instead of stalling it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don’t need to go full scale, but yes.  You can use subscale models and put them in a laboratory wind tunnel and take measurements.  From these sorts of tests (and/or from CFD or first principles) you can determine the range of theoretical efficiencies for a given style.   In engineering this is frenquently done by starting with a simpler model.  From there CFD and wind tunnel tests can get precise efficiencies for a gven design.  For an axial wind turbine, the simple model is called actuator disc model and from there you can find that an axial wind turbine can never be greater than ~59% efficient.  I’ve never studied vertical wind turbines, so I dont know if there is a simplified first principles model that wstablishes an upper bound on efficiency for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no turbine can be more than 59.3% efficient, it's the Betz limit. if you think about it if the turbine converted all the kinetic energy of the fluid flow into electrical energy it would stop and block the turbine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess as an engineer who deals with different kinds of turbines would be that it would be hella expensive to manufacture, install or fix compared to the marginally better performance RELATIVE to what is already in use and production. Would it perform better? Probably. A lot better? Probably not. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, tendency for designs/pieces to fail increases with the number of parts and intricacy of the design in many cases. Current wind turbine design is simple with 3 identical blades. More complicated designs cost more to create and, probably, maintain</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a lot of research going on with their verticals (VAWT) and their geometries/mechanisms. It all boils down to being able to convert the energy in the wind to mechanical energy we can use. 100% efficient turbines would require that wind of some speed goes in, and stagnant air comes out the other side (impossible, look up the Betz limit). </p>
<p>With VAWTs, blades that just captured wind energy are constantly cycling back around towards the wind, so it gets tricky to keep that backstroke efficient. If you put gigantic airfoils for example, you’ll have to design it in a way that lets it slice through the air when it’s getting back into position for another spin. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moving parts require maintenance. The cost to maintain a rotating wind turbine is likely higher than the profitability of the energy gained by optimizing its angle relative to the wind. </p></div>		</li>
