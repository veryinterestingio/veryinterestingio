			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally it'll be something about the sizer of a pager. I left radio three years ago, so it might have changed. But It's a little pager size thing, that actually detects when people move too. This is to keep you from just agreeing to wear one for the money, then tossing it aside. </p>
<p>At the end of the day you plug it into a base station. As of 2016, these were only able to be hooked up via land line. </p>
<p>Which leads to some MAJOR issues with it, and why I hate how ratings are done. </p>
<p>First, the sample size is tiny. For a major city you MIGHT have 50 of these things in the wild. </p>
<p>Second, the land line thing eliminates a huge demographic. So stations that skew young take a big hit.</p>
<p>Third, it's common for one person in the family to wear multiple ones since their kids won't. You suspect it when you look at the numbers, but I've actually ran into someone working at a store with three meters on them. In a 50 person pool, having one person account for three can seriously fuck up the numbers. </p>
<p>I had a friend who was a statistician, and I went over the numbers/process with him for fun, and I thought he was going to cry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Again though, if it’s a number that is from a totally different market, they’re usually accessing the station digitally and that data is being provided to the station in real time by their online channel.</p>
<p>For instance, my show is out of southern Ontario, but I have listeners all the way out to BC, so their data comes across their internet connection.</p>
<p>Stations apply for different transmitter wattages, and at least in Canada, those transmitter strengths are regulated by the CRTC. Stations can’t just build a new, stronger transmitter, because radio signals bleed into other markets. They have to apply, and certain criteria must be met.</p>
<p>Controls for things like that are meant to protect equity, ensure genre diversity etc. In Canada, for instance, a single company can only own so many signals in the same market.</p></div>		</li>
