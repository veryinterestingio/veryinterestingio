<p>It takes a bigger round to kill bigger critters.  Sure a small round can do it with some luck, but a bigger round is always going to be better.</p>
<p>20-30 9mm handgun rounds would probably kill a polar bear.  Eventually it would bleed out. But to protect people you need to kill it quickly.</p></div>		</li>
