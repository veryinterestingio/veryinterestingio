			<div class="markdown"><p>I know what you mean. I used to work in a medical lab taking blood and frequently people (usually men) who worked in construction or other more physical jobs would come in on their lunch break. They smelled sweaty, but it was like a &quot;clean&quot; sweaty smell, if that makes sense. It's totally different than when someone hasn't had a shower or changed their clothes in days!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is true. I'd like to add that diet has a lot to do with it in my opinion. Back when I ate like crap, I couldn't stand my own stink when I got sweaty. Nowadays, my diet is way better and I rarely need to where deodorant. However if I eat junk food for a day or two, because I'm lazy sometimes, or a lot of red meat,  I'll start to stink.  Also the amount of water I drink seems to be connected too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ime as long as you shower every day sweat is not a serious odor problem. It is when the sweat sits a day and then you sweat again that it gets bad. Fresh sweat doesn't stink, and if you're sweating all day, it stays relatively fresh.</p></div>		</li>
