			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the thing. If you mark it not for kids, and in the FTC's opinion you ARE targeting kids, that will make them hit you harder. It's what got Youtube sued in the first place - they knew dang well that kids were lying when they checked the &quot;I am over 13&quot; box when signing up for a Youtube account. Then they went and marketed to advertisers bragging about how many kids they had on the platform and how the advertisers could buy ads targeting little Timmy using the data that Youtube was collecting on their users.</p>
<p>Some of the guidance coming from the FTC seems to indicate that creators that check the &quot;Not for Kids&quot; box in good faith on their content should be OK. But that requires you trusting that the FTC will follow that guidance, and don't end up trying to make an example of you for some reason. All of the enforcement is supposed to go through a human before action is taken, but given how bad the fines could be, I don't blame creators not trusting them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s YouTube being in the wrong. YouTube should be getting fined for the collection and knowingly using that date to advertise. It’s like yelling at a shop clerk for letting someone who snuck past him entirely into the rated X section. That person had no control or knowing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention, the &quot;signs&quot; of a video being &quot;for kids&quot; are very outdated. The word &quot;yah&quot;, bright colours, animation(i wonder how they feel about hentai content being flagged as for kids), video games and a whole bunch of other bullshit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The wording of the regulation indicates that the FTC can actually look at the video and see if it has things that it feels are designed to attract kids, it can say that you lied about it not being intended for them. It specificity mentions having animations(like CGP Grey's excellent informational videos) or video game footage like about 75%of YouTube's content, or even catchy music. It's incredibly broad language that can be used by anyone with an axe to grind to completely ruin some poor guys life, just for wanting to post some cool tutorials for a minecraft mod.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Kids would love to watch lots of things that are not intended for children. For example, call of duty games are not intended for children, yet little johnny is going to want to watch that 720 noscope off the roof of terminal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Youtube is trying to eat their cake and have it too, by collecting data as per usual, but when it turns out they've collected data on children, blaming the channel owner for not correctly categorizing their videos, despite youtube not providing any actual guidelines for the difference between &quot;designed for kids&quot; and &quot;appropriate for kids&quot; and implying that there is no distinction.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/LuScIN4emyo" target="_blank">Folding Ideas</a> did a very straightforward explanation of the issue with as little drama as possible.</p></div>		</li>
