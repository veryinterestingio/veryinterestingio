<blockquote>
<p>According to a 2016 poll of 1,500 scientists reported that 70% of them had failed to reproduce at least one other scientist's experiment (50% had failed to reproduce one of their own experiments).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really, but not needed. The people who use academic research are academics, and they know which journals are trash and which are prestigious. It's reputation based, since it's a system for experts, rather than consumers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily but (at least in psychology) over the last few years there grew an Open Science community, that is still growing.</p>
<p>A lot of the replication crisis there exists because there is such an urgent need to produce significant effects. Only p&lt;.05 is worth something, not getting an effect means that you have nothing to publish because having an effect is obviously more exciting than not having an effect.</p>
<p>I am not sure if it was the Open Science Framework, but certain Open Sciene Organizations and journals give out badges for certain levels of procedures: Publish your raw data, publish your analysis scripts or experimental code. Now that's not always possible for privacy reasons wih sensitive data, but everyone at least tries.</p>
<p>All studies require pre-registration, which means that before you start experimenting, you write out your hypotheses and exact methodology and submit that. That gets peer-reviewed and if it is approved, you start testing. That in turn means that they publish your result, no matter what. Don't find an effect even though your methodology was sound? You still get published. Not finding an effect might not be exciting, but it is valuable information after all.</p>
<p>Also there are different statistical methods that are deemed better than simple p-values, most prominently Bayesian statistics but I'm not too versed with that either so I couldn't give you any more info on that.</p>
<p>While it's not perfect, it's a step in the right direction. The badge system, if applied and regulated properly, at least gives you the idea that the science there was done properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. Back in April of this year, a chemist published a paper in Science that had an extremely flawed assumption in it. The paper made an assumption that anybody who had taken a single year of organic chemistry (usually a sophomore level course) would recognize as completely and utterly wrong.</p>
<p>Somehow, this error made it past the editors, peer reviewers, and a number of people who showered the author with praise for their incredible work. Needless to say, something like this doesn't happen often, so it caused a big backlash when it did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry about the wait. Totally forgot about it when I got home yesterday. Here's the DOI for the paper (kind of like an ISBN for journal articles; you should be able to just search it and find the article): 10.1126/science.aav0177 </p>
<p>Here's the DOI for the comment article that Dan Singleton wrote in response to the paper:  10.1126/science.aax7083 </p>
<p>And here's the series of tweets he put out putting the reviewers on blast for allowing such a blatantly wrong diagram to pass through the peer review system without catching the error:  <a href="https://twitter.com/dasingleton/status/1115120772132016129" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/dasingleton/status/1115120772132016129</a> </p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the field of organic chemistry (or indeed, chemistry in general), the original authors are suggesting that sulfur in the molecule SO3 is behaving in a way that basically would not even be physically possible during the course of that reaction. Hope this helps!</p></div>		</li>
