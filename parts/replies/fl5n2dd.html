			<div class="markdown"><p>One does not spread fomites. </p>
<p>The term fomites refers to surfaces that carry microbes. Ie a counter top in a dental operatory is a fomite because droplets and aerosolized microbes land on the counter and if someone should touch that area then touch their eyes or mouth the microbes are transferred. </p>
<p>In this same way a doorknob is a fomite so if a person is infected with covid 19 and they cough into their hand then a short time later use the doorknob now those virus particles are on the doorknob. Then along comes sally who uses the knob to open the door then puts her hand to her eye for any reason then bingo jingo jango sally could now become infected. In this way sally has acquired a community infection meaning she won‚Äôt know here she got it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, they said &quot;produces fomites&quot;. Coughing into one's hand and touching a doorknob makes it a potential fomite, no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am an infection control practitioner as well as a dental hygienist . We talk about fomites and how to clean and disinfect them ie how to disinfect the handles on the overhead light used in the dental chair. Ie dental and surgical instruments are sterilized but fomites are disinfected</p>
<p>I hope That I didn‚Äôt sound like I was correcting the term in a lectury way</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They also said ‚Äúspread fomites‚Äù at the end there which pretty strongly implies they think fomites are coming out of the body, not being produced by slathering germs on surfaces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How likely is one to contact Covid-19 from buying goods at a supermarket taht were stocked by someone infected?</p>
<p>If you buy a box of cereal and don't use it for a couple of weeks, will the virus no longer be infectious if on the outside of the box?</p>
<p>I'm thinking I should wipe of yogurt and milk containers with a disinfectant once I get home from the supermarket.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wipe everything down! especially plastic and metal. It can live on cardboard for 24 hours so when I have a delivery.i spray with disinfectant and wipe with wipes and let it sit for a day or two before I open with gloves. Then whatever's in the box I'll also either wipe down or spray depending on the material it's made from. I know it's alot but I have asthma and am trying to stay as healthy as I can. We're gonna get through this together! Stay blessed üôèüèæ</p></div>		</li>
