			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it depends where you live. I lived in a city where they said it was ok to recycle pizza boxes. I almost lived somewhere that said not to. </p>
<p>You can also compost them. </p>
<p>Side note: you can also recycle envelopes with those plastic windows in them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya probably because your center made other products out of them where it didn’t matter.   It can still be used as “filler” among other things.</p>
<p>Our center turns it into insulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's funny because no matter how many times I tell people to throw the pizza boxes in the trash, I always find them in the recycle can.</p>
<p>On the can itself it says &quot;no pizza boxes&quot; along with other items described on the lid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 'dirty' part is most likely recyclable for you.  Very few papermills that need guaranteed clean furnish will buy from recycling centers.  It is predominantly places that make tube and angleboard that buy from them because it doesn't matter if there's grease or chemicals in it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. I work in a paper mill and the furnish from recycling centers is garbage (literally garbage sometimes). There are a ton of refiners and screens the pulp goes through to take all the bad stuff out. If we run a paper that needs to be completely clean we use pulp cubes.</p></div>		</li>
