			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice one excellently explained. Iâ€™m a pain scientist, Iâ€™ll add a twist: the intensity of the pain you experience is related to your past experiences of pain, how threatened you feel about the pain and your biopsychosocial status. </p>
<p>Now like your 5: everyone experiences pain differently, your brain is like a library, every time you experience something like pain, a new book is added. When you feel pain again your brain checks the library and asks: have I had this before? How did it go last time? Was it really bad or ok? If it finds the book, your brain can adjust your pain levels, a bit like a sprained ankle, which is annoying but doesnâ€™t really change your life and the pain often goes away by itself. But if you are a professional football player, and that ankle sprain made you lose lots of money and you couldnâ€™t play for a long time, the pain can be much higher. This is because that injury is now worth more pain points, even though the injury is the same as a normal persons. </p>
<p>Sometimes that means the injury takes longer to get better, and that can make your brain sad. Then you might not sleep very well, and not eat good, and stop seeing your friends and having fun. If it goes on long enough the ankle can completely get better, but the pain will stay there. Thatâ€™s because the pain is just a message that youâ€™re brain receives, and the messenger can get confused and keep sending messages. </p>
<p>This is called chronic pain, and there is a way to make it better but it takes a lot of hard work because you have to convince your brain that what it thinks is real and true is wrong, and we people donâ€™t like doing that. </p>
<p>/ this is the biopsychosocial model published by German Psychiatrist Engel in 1977 as a push back to the biomedical model that dominated medicine, the idea that pain is a result of physical injury and can only be healed by physical intervention diagnosed and prescribed by a doctor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I've heard the reason that acupuncture works is that it interrupts the false chronic pain signal and basically &quot;resets&quot; the circuit. Can this be true based on what you've explained?</p></div>		</li>
