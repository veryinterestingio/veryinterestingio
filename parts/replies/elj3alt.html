<p>There is a actually archaeological evidence that bears have self domesticated at one stage long ago, when times were good, weather great and food supply high. Just like humans are self-domesticated now.</p>
<p>Domestication takes several generations, depending on the effectiveness of the selection process and is inherited.</p>
<p>See the famous silver fox experiment in Siberia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One can make an argument about pandas and urisdae's domestication.</p>
<p>Which is why I phrased it how I did.  For the most part no one with any understanding of the word would use it to apply to bears, but there isolate examples</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tamed= an individual of a species that is partially or completely taught to live peacefully with humans and sometimes trained to follow commands.</p>
<p>Domesticated= a population's biology and temperament changing so that children born to that population are more naturally able to live peacefully with humans and be trained to follow commands.</p>
<p>Individual wolves can be tamed, while populations of wolves were domesticated to become dogs. Sometimes taming is extensive and creates huge changes in an animal's behavior, but falls short of domestication because every generation needs to do it again. That's the case with birds used in falconry-- despite the fact that a well trained falcon will respond to their human's commands, bring back food they've killed without trying to eat it themselves, and return home in the spring if they've been let out for the winter, they are still wild birds biologically and the chick of a tamed falcon isn't any easier to tame than a chick of a random falcon.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm guessing the OP didn't mean &quot;domestication&quot; so much as &quot;raised in captivity&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most likely not.  They do not have to hibernate, and usually only do due to lack of food.  Female pregnant polar bears do however</p></div>		</li>
