<p>English speakers have made a huge deal out of the concept of 'spelling things right', to the point that major change is largely unthinkable at this point - too many people have too strong of feelings about the current spelling system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is hardly unique to English. Not many major spelling reforms have happened in recent history, but if you look up the German spelling reform you will see what a shit show it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly, Finnish didn’t have an official writing system for a very long time, so once it was standardized, they could basically adapt it to the spoken language.</p>
<p>It’s similar with Slavic languages. The Cyrillic alphabet was invented to write Slavic languages, so it includes all necessary sounds and it’s easier to realize phonetic spelling. At the same time you have less ballast from the grammar and spelling of other languages (like French words that aren’t pronounced French anymore, but haven’t changed their spelling).</p></div>		</li>
