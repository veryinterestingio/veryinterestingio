			<div class="markdown"><p>That seems most likely, considering how simple their nervous system is. I remember reading a paper about this and while I cannot recall the details, it had something to do with methylation of DNA that primed their nervous system to react more intensely to the stimulus. So while the offspring where not shocked, they inhereted this potential to become afraid of that stimulus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only within the same caterpillar/butterfly, but (at least the Monarch butterflies) they can pass down memories and information through generations.</p>
<p>It takes the Monarch butterflies of North America about 5 generations to complete their migration.
I remember learning this from a BBC documentary.</p></div>		</li>
