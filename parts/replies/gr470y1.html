			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, if there is no power going to the motherboard (either disconnected from the wall, or the power supply is switch off) you will rely on the cmos battery, which will eventually fail.</p>
<p>Edit: for anyone who is curious how long the battery will last (depends), years and not usually an issue before you replace them. For a pc older than 5 years you might be looking at an inexpensive replacement if it hasn't been already. </p>
<p>There is an <a href="https://superuser.com/q/396019" target="_blank">informative breakdown over at superuser.com</a>. </p>
<p>I'd also recommend checking out /r/techsupport if you're experiencing any issues and /r/buildapc for someone looking to get into building their own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember back in the late 90's when someone had put a bios password on the only internet-connected computer in the library and my buddy and I simply took the cmos battery out and put it back in.
So. Much. Porn.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is a separate battery for bios settings, which could die one day, but that is a bit different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For things like the clock, yeah, there's a battery.  One of those tiny thin ones that's the size of a coin; usually a CR2032.</p>
<p>When the computer is plugged in though?  It's not 100% off.  It's just very very close.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.smpspowersupply.com/connector_atx_pinout.GIF" target="_blank">The ATX power specification includes a purple wire that's always on</a> for running things like that.  It's pin 9, &quot;+5V StandBy&quot;.</p>
<p>This is also what keeps it semi-alive in Sleep mode.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Though if you flip the switch on the PSU I assume it is actually 100% off as if you unplugged it? Not that I would trust that if I was doing work on the computer of course, just asking if that would technically be the same thing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this:
Lots of devices stay on even when they're off (standby), like TVs (it's how they turn on from a remote).</p>
<p>The power supply in a computer keeps supplying a small amount of power to the system.  A lot of modern computers have USB ports which stay powered even when the computer is off to let you charge stuff.</p>
<p>Computers can also turn themselves on when they receive a special packet over the network (wake on LAN).  They're still doing stuff even when they're off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, yes. Although some do use a special battery. The time being correct on your computer is exceptionally important and breaks all kinds of stuff if not correct.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do they really? I remember my old mobos the battery was very easy to spot.</p>
<p>I haven't seen the battery on my latest mobo but I haven't really fiddled with it as much as I used to back in the day.</p>
<p>So I have just assumed that they started using a different way of doing it...</p></div>		</li>
