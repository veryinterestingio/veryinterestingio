			<div class="markdown"><p>And more dielectric also means the punch through Voltage of your capacitors add (for two equal capacitors just doubles). E.g. two 16V caps behave like one 32V cap with half the capacitance.</p>
<p>It's kinda usefull, but in real life they do need balancing resistors, otherwise you may damage the components.</p></div>		</li>
