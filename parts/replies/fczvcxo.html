			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok. So the ear consists of 4 sections. The outer ear (the big dumb flappy things on the side of your head), the middle ear, the inner ear, and the vestibule. The outer ear is strictly to catch noise with its extremely inefficient design and funnel it down to what is called the tympanic membrane. (You can also shove all sorts of metal shit through your outter ear because it males you feel pretty.) The Tympanic Membrane is what is commonly referred to as the ear drum and is the separator of the outer and middle ear. When the pressure from a noise moves the tympanic membrane it causes mechanical vibrations is 3 tiny little connected bones. These bones are called malleus, incus, and stapes. Idiots know these as the hammer, the anvil, and the stirrups and they have a special place in Hell. As these bones vibrate they cause liquid in the cochlea (inner ear) to move. This moving liquid stimulates tiny little hair like structures called hair...cells... (well thats boring) bit what is important about these hair cells is they are not actually hairs! (Wait wut?) They are actually nerves that create and send electrical signals to be interpreted by the brain. Now why can a dog hear a dog whistle but we can't. Because we are human and our stupid little hair cells are too god damned fat to vibrate at 50,000 vibrations per second (50,000hz) like our 4 legged friends the best we can do is about 20,000hz. If you stuck around this long you might be wondering why I didnt talk about the 4th section of the ear and thats because it isn't really used for hearing it's for balance. And thats why you can't walk in a straight line or bend over and pick something up without stumbling...</p></div>		</li>
