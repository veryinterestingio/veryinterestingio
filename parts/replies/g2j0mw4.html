			<div class="markdown"><p>Although unfortunately it doesn't work because it relies on a bad understanding of how orbits work. The rods are already &quot;falling&quot; when in orbit. To get them to come back down you have to neutralise their 20km/s+ horizontal velocity, which would require massive amounts of fuel and rockets. At that point you're better off just using an ICBM, because that's all you just did just really inefficiently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't completely correct. How much delta v needed depends on how quickly you need them to drop out of the sky. If you do a small deorbit burn on the other side of the planet, the rods will take longer to reenter (and have less predictability), but they would also require less fuel.  </p>
<p>Since we're also talking about just needing to deorbit a tungsten rod, we'll also talking far less delta-v needed than what is necessary to deorbit something else. A dedicated 'rods' platform could even now be up there with powerful enough engines attached to each rod. </p>
<p>The disadvantage to this method is the rods would have more drag as they are in the atmosphere longer, would slow down more, and as stated above could be harder to target (or easier, depending on your control methods and how they are being steered. The key factor is the mass + impact velocity and dropping them as straight down as possible would be ideal, but that's when the larger engines are needed. Even so, a less energetic reentry seems like it would still possible while still having quite an effect..</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_bombardment" target="_blank">The most famous proposal</a> was for rods of 6 m length and 0.3 m diameter, with a mass of about nine tons; that’s about the landing weight of the Orion capsule. Calling them ‘rods’ really undersells the size of the proposed projectiles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its still more delta-v than the amount required by an ICBM, which doesnt require orbital delta-v in the first place. The rod from god concept requires orbital delta-v, PLUS de-orbit delta-v (which yes, does not need to be anywhere near orbital delta-v). </p>
<p>Once you take that into account, its no improvement at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but at the same time you could do the same thing with an ICBM with about the same amount of warning time and less rocket fuel. </p>
<p>Its possible, its just not an improvement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were plans to put nukes on sats, but then the hippies forced the 'No Nukes in Space, Man...' treaty, which also ruined the prospect of nuclear powered space engines.</p>
<p>Funfact: In Kubrick's 2001 movie, when the Apeman throws a big stick in the air the shot cuts to a satellite in orbit. The satellite is an orbital nuke silo. The implication being the smarter the monkeyman gets, the bigger the stick he will build.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's been quite a few nuclear reactors in space already. They dont have the best safety record so far. The ones on Earth have done far better.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The US and Russia actually both agreed not to militarize space at all, for a number of reasons. The rest of the world followed suit and has largely stuck by that.</p>
<p>The only exception being spy satellites, and weapons briefly transiting through space such as ICBM's and anti-satellite missiles which are used for non-military purposes more often than not.</p></div>		</li>
