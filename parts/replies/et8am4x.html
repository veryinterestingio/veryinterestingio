			<div class="markdown"><p>If the participant actually buys a product from the parent company, with the intention of re-selling it, they are acting like any other legal company. They are part of the supply chain of selling and re-selling. The problem is usually the product they sell is overpriced, so it's difficult for the re-sellers to move the stock they have. The parent company always makes money, while the re-seller may lose money. In some cases, depending on the market, the re-seller may actually make a profit; however, as soon as the market becomes saturated with more sellers, then they will all lose money because there is not enough buyers.</p>
<p>This is why Herbalife and and similar stay afloat, because they actually sell a product; not everything is joining them as a seller; depending on the product, many people keep buying without even joining as sellers, so the market doesn't saturate.</p></div>		</li>
