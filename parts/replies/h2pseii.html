			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good answer.  To supplement:</p>
<p>The values can be combined to create a Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP).  MAP is the average of the pressures during a cardiac cycle.  The cardiac cycle is in diastole for twice as long as systole.  So the equation is (SBP+DBP+DBP)/3.  This gives us a single number.  We know that a MAP of around 60 is required to properly perfuse all the organs, specifically the kidneys.  So anyone with a chronic blood pressure lower than a map of 60 will have problems.</p>
<p>Also, generally the diastolic is 2/3rds of the systolic. This isn't a rule, but it is common for it to be close.</p>
<p>Narrowing pressures (100/90) are also a cause for concern. This is because the relaxation isn't occuring correctly.  This could be due to some type of tamponade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fluid/blood gets into places it should not be. There is a sack surrounding the heart. Blood gets between the heart and the sack. Too much fluid in there means the heart cannot expand and then contract. </p>
<p>Imagine hold a balloon in your fist… also imagine extending your fingers and then making a fist over and over vs barely moving your fingers and then making a fist over and over. The fist is contraction, and how much your fingers can move from the fist is relaxation.  The relaxation is the filling phase of the heart. If it can’t relax, it can’t fill. Your BP is maintained, but only because the fluid has no where to go… this is not what we want.</p></div>		</li>
