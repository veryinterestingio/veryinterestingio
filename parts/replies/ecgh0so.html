<p>Modern astronomy techniques allow us to measure the motion of objects in the solar system very accurately. Combining this information with Newton's Law of Gravity allows us to measure the <strong><em>ratio</em></strong> of the masses for planetary-scale objects very accurately. However, to turn these numbers into proper <strong><em>masses</em></strong> we have to divide by Newton's Gravitational constant. The error in that constant is much larger than the error in the ratio of the masses for planetary objects.</p>
<p>Astronomers have gotten around this problem by skipping the conversion to mass, and just writing all masses as a ratio of earth's mass (or the sun's mass, for stars).</p>
<p>----------------------------------</p>
<p>So to get actual masses for objects (aka &quot;weighing the earth&quot;) we need to measure the gravitational constant. To do this <strong>we need to measure the gravitational force between two objects of known mass</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Thus, the earth is not actually used at all in &quot;weighing the earth.&quot;</strong> All experiments that &quot;weigh the earth&quot; could be done on the other side of the universe. These experiments are actually measuring G, the gravitational constant, which can be used to calculate the mass of earth given the very-well-measured gravitational acceleration due to gravity (g \~= 9.8 m/s/s).</p>
<p>Historically, the first measurement was done with a torsion balance by Cavendish. Basically, Cavendish placed two small balls of known weights on a fancy spring (called a torsion balance) and measured the force they exerted on two heavy balls, also of known weight. He could then use this value of G to calculate the mass of Earth, hence &quot;weighing the earth&quot;.</p>
<p>Modern methods remain fundamentally similar to Cavendish's original experiment. The gravitational attraction of a set of objects (typically balls) of known mass is measured, typically with springs or sometimes with electrical or magnetic balances. The primary improvements have been in reducing outside factors and better measurement of the masses, distances, and forces involved.</p></div>		</li>
