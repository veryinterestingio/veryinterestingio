<p>Edit: I'm a guy, so my point was that the meds could have caused a birth defect by damaging my sperm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really off topic, but I'm very curious. Of course you don't have to answer if it's too much.</p>
<p>How does it feel knowing someone else's organ is inside you?</p>
<p>I'm assuming (and hoping.) Everything is better for you health wise now. So initially the transplant must have been stressful, but also a huge relief.</p>
<p>Medicine and the human body are absolutely wild, and sort of scare me. The idea of just knowing I've got someone else's organ in me just sounds crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty hard to describe. Physically, it doesn't feel any different than having your own organ (once you've healed up from surgery). Emotionally, it's mostly got to do with a sense of responsibility to take care of the organ (after all, it could have gone to save someone else's life if it hadn't been given to me), and to make the most of the gift by making good use of your life. That can be a bit of a double edged sword, since it puts a lot of pressure on me, and I sometimes don't deal well with pressure. </p>
<p>For me though, it seemed weirder to think about prior to the transplant than it did once it actually happened.</p></div>		</li>
