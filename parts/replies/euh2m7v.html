<p>This is pretty fascinating. Maybe I read your response wrong, but it sounds like there is evidence that certain highly specific functions are more easily located in a specific place in the brain with less variation person to person than the larger, less specific/general functions? For some reason that just seems backwards, shouldn't the general functions be easier to find and the specific functions varying within them?</p>
<p>And I apologise if the papers you linked answered this... I tried to read them but they very quickly went over my head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think he is talking about <em>physical size</em> scales: if you don't look too close, the location is always the same, and the relative arrangement of brain areas is always the same: visual in the back, with more abstraction as you go forward on the sides, then sensory, then motor, on top, and then more abstract thinking in the front, with a relay hub in the center underneath surrounded by areas for spatial memories and formation of new memories, and basic life sustaining functions in the brain stem. But if you look closer, there are small differences in the exact locations, such as seen in the examples he gave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly right. And we can go smaller from there. Once you're inside a functional region, how similar is it across people? Is its local circuitry the same? Is its physical connectivity to other areas the same? Is its functional connectivity to other areas the same? Do the same kinds of cells exist in that area, in the same ratios, with the same response profiles? How do variations in any of the above relate to behavioral or cognitive differences? These are very hard questions. By and large, the technology to answer them just doesn't exist yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, that makes me wonder if our experiences of the same thing might differ more radically than we realize. Like listening to a piece of music might be way more impactful or intense for one person than another. Or we've long speculated that, &quot;your red may not be my red&quot; and that seems more plausible to me now.</p>
<p>Though perhaps the differences may not really change all that much. Still very fascinating though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes me wonder just what consciousness is. If the brain can be so physically different through probably an almost infinite range if you drill right down, then where is that 'switch' for consciousness, and what are the bare essential similarities it depends on?</p>
<p>My belief now is that consciousness is a side effect, an emergent behaviour that appears after several primary functions of our brain come online (video and audio processing, executive function, access to short and long term memories and more). Not the pinnacle of our brain functioning, but some side effect that gives us enough of an evolutionary edge that it sticks around.</p>
<p>Taken one step further (and backed up by research), our consciousness isn't even in control. It is an illusion we have. Research has shown that the brain can 'decide' to do something long before the person consciously decides to do it.</p>
<p>In a way, we are writing ourselves a fiction, convincing ourselves we are in control, writing the autobiography of our lives a few dozen milliseconds after reality.  If we don't understand or like something, it is easy for our brain to tell us a white lie and remember a more acceptable version or 'reality'.</p>
<p>Not to go down a rabbit hole, but now even gut biomes can make you want to eat, and not just through hunger signals.</p>
<p>Our conscious minds are just along for the ride, pretending to be relevant.</p>
<p>Ok, now I can't drop the subject. If somebody had all the right brain functions and reacted correctly to all stimuli, but somehow never became truly self aware... would we ever be able to know the difference? How do you 'prove' consciousness or self awareness?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Consciousness might be erroneous. Not actually exist how we think it exists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never understood that color philosophical discussion. The question isn't how you feel about red, what do you associate it with or even how your perception of it may differ. Red is a specific color with a specific frequency of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it's interpreted by brains that don't perceive frequencies the same way. See: the dress, or yanni/laurel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. However, perception of color is dependent on biochemicals and cell subtypes in the retina of the eye. For example, individuals with deficiencies in the red-specific photoreceptive pigment will have a different experience of red than one who is fully color-functional. Extending this line of thought, itâ€™s conceivable that two individuals can experience the world differently based on their ocular biology.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Red isn't a specific frequency, though we can refer to an arbitrarily bounded range of frequencies as red. Some cultures have historically not distinguished between colors in the same way as each other, e.g. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue%E2%80%93green_distinction_in_language" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue%E2%80%93green_distinction_in_language</a></p>
<p>Do people walk about discussing color as a range of frequencies? In reference to the biochemistry of the eye? It is understood in the absence of a formal education. &quot;Color&quot; as a concept is &quot;distinct&quot; from the physical world we relate it to. </p>
<p>This isn't an argument for &quot;qualia&quot;, it's just an acknowledgement that there's more nuance to the argument than one might initially see. I don't believe that color is a &quot;real thing&quot; outside of the concept expressed through language. (I.e. not in the Platonist sense) The folk understanding is pretty different than the one we have as scientists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great info, thanks. I'm fascinated at the 'amateur' level and love reading related articles and things like Oliver Sacks' essays. I'll be reading all the things linked in this thread.</p>
<p>On a personal level, I recently got a head injury a the neurologist was trying to map the effected areas through a series of tests. I didn't FEEL debilitated, but one question was to name as many words starting with the letter 'F' as I could in one minute.</p>
<p>I got 6. Total.  Then a massive migraine. This was a few months after my injury.  It really gives me more perspective on just how tricky the brain can be.</p></div>		</li>
