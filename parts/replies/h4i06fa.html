			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why you can still taste the mold if you try just removing the moldy part of the bread. It's tendrils have run through the whole piece of bread already. Grab a microscope sometime and take a look. It's interesting and appetite suppressing. Mold will root in before it blooms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shot in the dark here but... Do you happen to know of an affordable microscope for home/hobby use that is good enough quality to look at some serious things? Like, would I be limited to plankton and micro-organisms or could I identify skin cells and amoeba?</p>
<p>I often think it'd be fun to have a microscope to horse around with, but I'd have no idea where to start in buying one and I'm sure it'd be more expensive than I can justify. But I have a 1-year-old niece now and if she's into it I'm hoping to mix my nerdiness and some serious fun-uncle vibes - Legos, model rockets, museum trips, chemistry sets... - I feel like in a few years I might be able to use that as an excuse to get a microscope to play with. Or a telescope. We'll see if my niece is more of a space kid or a bug kid...</p></div>		</li>

<p>This looks like a reputable place which carries different brands and at different price points. <a href="https://www.microscope.com/compound-microscopes/home-hobby/hobbyist" target="_blank">https://www.microscope.com/compound-microscopes/home-hobby/hobbyist</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up digital microscopes. They plug into a usb port. $65-100 will get a decent one. Check reviews or tests and you will see a couple decent models repeat on each list.
For the price they are pretty good.  </p>
<p>10x mag is got for a lot of stuff around the house including bug’s and bread mold. 20x is really good for more detail. Beyond that you are looking at tiny cells and maybe pollen but now you might have to have better samples prepared. </p>
<p>So scopes at 100-200x are not useful unless you are a serious biology student.</p></div>		</li>
