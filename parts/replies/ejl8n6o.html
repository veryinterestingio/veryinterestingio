			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually results in some very weird things. There are some things that seem like they should be impossible in our reality, but mathematically, they have a non-zero probability of happening. Crazy thing is, is that they do actually happen. Strange mathematical artifacts that should only exist on a calculator seem to be really how reality exists. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simulation or hologram. I'm hoping hologram. But, if we ever do determine simulation (likely by creating one ourselves), we can be almost 100% sure we are not the first layer down from the real world. If it's possible to simulate the universe inside the universe, we are probably in a simulation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is assuming that it is equally likely to be born in each layer of the simulation stack. Couldn't you argue that much more people are born outside the simulations because the outside world is so much larger?</p>
<p>After all, the computer running the simulation must be larger than the world it simulates. Why? Because if the simulation could be larger, you could fit an arbitrary amount of data in a finite space by nesting simulations.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've never understood the reasoning behind this. On what basis could we say that we're not the first?</p></div>		</li>
