			<div class="markdown"><p>We can extrapolate from the fact that we have both Privately Held and Publicly Held (stock market) companies. Privately Held companies utilize private funding for capital (venture capital/family money/employee money). My guess would be that if we were to eliminate the stock market, we would have an even larger gap between the wealthy and the middle class in the US as the rich would have the ability to use their capital to open businesses and use/seek private equity in a way that the middle class cannot. The middle class would only have CD's, money markets, etc. to invest in and they are fairly low yield historically compared to equities (stocks).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some banks invest in the stock exchange, but a lot of the money in a bank is used by the bank to issue loans.  They can offer interest in exchange for you placing your money with them because the interest they give you is less than the interest of the loans they issue.  CD's can have a higher interest rate than normal accounts because the bank knows they can use that money to issue loans without having to worry about it being withdrawn early.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Money Market accounts are named so specifically because the &quot;money market&quot; is what they invest in. The MM is mainly ultra-short term corporate debt. Most companies don't hold large reserves of cash, instead issuing this short-term debt to meet cash obligations when needed, then paying it off very soon afterwards with incoming cash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All the stock market is is an exchange where people can go to trade (buy or sell) parts of a business that they own.</p>
<p>It is a place that people wanting to buy can meet up with people that want to sell something. It is no different from a farmers market (eBay, AutoTrader, Carmax, Craigslist) where individuals show up to sell their goods knowing that a lot of buyers will be there to buy. So what would happened if we took away farmers markets?</p>
<p>Well, it would be much more difficult for those people to sell their goods since people aren't going to drive around the state going to each farm in order to buy different things they want. It is the same thing with businesses. Take away the meeting place for people to sell a piece of their business and all of a sudden companies have much more trouble raising money (selling a portion of their business in an IPO), people are less willing to purchase a piece of a company knowing that it will be difficult to sell in the future, and lastly, there would be much less info out there about what fair value is for a company - once again depressing values. Public markets allow people from across the world to see the price of something and judge if that is a fair price or not. They can then use this knowledge to make decisions regarding their own businesses, where they should invest their money, etc. If you take away this vehicle for price discovery then people no longer know as well if they are getting a fair price or not. Once again, making people less willing to transact (how nice is it to be able to look up how much something costs from multiple sellers? It gives you confidence to buy that new phone, TV, wallet, shoes).</p>
<p>All of this ultimately leads to people being less willing to let go of their money and an overall less efficient economy. This lack of money changing hands ultimately equates to less business and economic activity.</p>

<p>To bring it back to the farmers markets and Craigslist example, how valuable is it that you can now find a buyer anywhere in your city for a used product? Before Craigslist you might just throw that used product away if it wasn't worth much or at best you take it down to the pawn shop and they give you 5 bucks for it and turn around and sell it for 25 to someone else. With a public market you cut out the pawn shop and get to keep those 20 extra dollars for yourself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huge transaction costs. There'd be a lot more wealthy attorneys. Stock markets are regulated, and when you buy a share of stock you are buying basically something that is known and safe--directors and officers of corporations owe fiduciary duties to you, they must publicly report periodically the current status of the business, and prices are set by the market (which, at least the standard economic model tells us, aggregates all possible information about the company). </p>
<p>If we didn't have stock markets and you wanted to invest in a company, you'd have to have a lawyer draw up a one-off contract every single time. You'd also have to do a ton of due diligence. You'd also have to force the company agree to be somewhat transparent with you. These transactions occur all the time right now--venture capital, people buying into closely-held companies, etc.--but they're much more costly to enter into than calling your broker to buy some shares.</p>
<p>From a really rough macroeconomic perspective, the economy would be smaller. In the simplest Neo-Keynsian Model, domestic gross domestic product is the sum of all consumption, plus investment, plus government spending, plus net exports. The investment component would get smaller. By how much? It's hard to say. Most money in the stock market is large institutional investors. It makes sense for them to incur the transaction costs to do one-off purchases of a company's equity. Maybe everything would just shift to a hedge fund model where small-time investors could buy into a fund, and the fund aggregates everyone's money to make the big purchases that would justify the transaction costs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A hedge fund is just a fund. Funds just pool capital together from smaller investors to take advantage of economies of scale for big investors. Hedge funds differ from other funds in that they have less regulation, they can have more leverage (borrowing money to gamble), and because of those two things, you're only allowed to buy into one if regulators think you're sophisticated to understand the risk you're undertaking. </p>
<p>I only said hedge fund because most people have a vague understanding of what those are. If I just said &quot;fund&quot; or &quot;investment fund,&quot; it'd have been more confusing.</p></div>		</li>
