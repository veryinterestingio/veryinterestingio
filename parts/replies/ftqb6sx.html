With enough care, a program that meets a specific need can be made to never require a restart (within reason; years at least), and the hardware it runs on can be made with error-checking components that have been proven to last multiple years.  Programmers should not give up hope that they can make their software stable enough to run for years, since it is possible with enough care.  There are many programs that are able to boast that level of stability.</p></div>		</li>

It's not always errors necessarily either, the user might have put the system in a state that they don't understand and don't know how to get out of, in which case a restart is easier than doing the leg work trying to figure out how to return to the desired state.</p></div>		</li>
