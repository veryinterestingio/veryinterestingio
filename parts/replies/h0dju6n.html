			<div class="markdown"><p>It took place in 2019 I participated for about 6 months before I couldn't any longer (I was having to travel about 2 hours for the study and they pay wasn't quite worth it lol) it was very effective for us. During the trial there are different phases. One of the phases is only using it as your contraceptive and it never failed on us. The only side effects I had was a very slight up tick in acne on the application site. You do have to be careful with it around women and children. Like I said it was like hand sanitizer in the way it drives it was also alcohol based so while it dries you need to make sure and try to keep it from them as it can mess with their own hormones.</p></div>		</li>
