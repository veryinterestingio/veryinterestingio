			<div class="markdown"><p>With Q tips, did you see much wax come out?  Sorry for the questions...</p>
<p>This past week or so I have been feeling like my ears are plugged up, like when you change altitude, but I haven't gone anywhere to cause that. I use q-tips pretty regularly, but they usually come out looking like maybe just a little wax on them, but maybe the wax is building up and not getting to where I can access with a q-tip?</p>
<p>Maybe i will give the drops a try...see if anything comes out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's a slow moving process, but eventually I realize that it sounds like I have ear plugs in.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Get yourself <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/jkxCZhuo1dGMNcCX8" target="_blank">an ear wax pick</a> and use it with care.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Great stuff to clean the ears.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had it done a few times at urgent care, they just have this little pressurized water jet and you hold your head over a little dish while they blast away, loud AF when the wax finally comes loose but it's worth it when you have deformed/twisted ear canals like mine</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to have this done too. How do you know if your ear canals are twisted? I saw an ad for an at-home version of this, and I’m tempted, but you’re right it was a lot of pressure and very loud and I’d be scared to do it myself.</p></div>		</li>
