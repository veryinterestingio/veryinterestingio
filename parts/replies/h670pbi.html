<p>And if I understand the idea of dark matter correctly, how might that infinite void be different from the emptiest areas within the confines of our universe?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a light horizon, a boundary created because space is expanding faster than light beyond that distance could ever reach us. From our relative positions space is expanding faster than light as the more space between us and any given point, the more that space expands. That light boundary represents the furthest point we can possibly know anything about unless we invent ftl sensors, which is decidedly unlikely. If there is an end to the universe we will never see it.</p>
<p>There's nothing special about this BTW. You would see a perfect sphere like this around you no matter where you are in the universe. It's not fixed feature of the universe centred on the Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if space is expanding would we be able to measure those effects within our star system or is that something that would only be affected in interstellar or galactic space?  Would the gravitational effects of the sun and other planetary bodies counteract whatever it is that would be happening from the expansion of space and our universe?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the universe started with an explosion, there must be a single particle that's currently the greatest distance from the epicenter, yes? Speaking of the whole universe, not just the visible portion, what if a spaceship matching velocities alongside that particle started accelerating outwards? Will it find an infinitely large void that matter hasn't yet reached, remaining constant throughout? Is there a limit to spacetime itself? Or does space expand at the speed of light, making it finite yet still inescapable even if you start at the edge?</p>
<p>If distance is infinite, and the big bang was finite, is the thing we consider &quot;the universe&quot; (all matter and energy from the big bang) an infinitesimally small amount of activity compared to all the quantum fluctuations at absolute zero beyond the explosion's leading edge? Or is the big bang responsible for creating space as well as matter, in which case, can &quot;outside&quot; it be described in any meaningful way?</p></div>		</li>

<p>No. The three main possible &quot;types&quot; of overall shapes that we think the universe can have are called flat, open and closed. A flat universe, i.e. zero overall curvature, essentially looks on large-enough scales like regular 3-dimensional space going infinitely in all directions. An open universe, i.e. negative curvature, would look on large scales something like a 3D version of a saddle or a pringle, again going off infinitely in all directions. A closed universe, i.e. positive curvature, would look like a 3D hypersphere, the surface of a 4D ball, and it would loop back on itself. None of these have a boundary or edge.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The light horizon is the <em>perceptible</em> edge -- in case that isn't self evident, it's the furthest out light has reached in the universe (from our vantage point).</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is not a definitive statement anyone can make. It is not necessary for their to be anything &quot;outside&quot; the universe, but there could be. Until we know how space time kicked off in the first place, we can't rule it out. Plenty of models depend on our universe emerging from or sitting on some other kind of topology or extra dimensions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could have a multiverse type of thing, which actually does have some validity, specifically in regards to the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_\(cosmology\)" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a>, which is about the extremely rapid expansion in the very early universe, and a multiverse would fit well in here. However, the multiverse in this instance would also be expanding, so you would still run into this issue, just on a grander scale.</p></div>		</li>
