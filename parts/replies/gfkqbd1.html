<p>&quot;The metre is the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299 792 458 of a second.&quot;</p>

<p>That was the definition until 2019. A much wordier but essentially the same definition was adopted last year, as part of a set of changes that fundamentally redefined the kilogram. The new definition of the meter is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The metre, symbol m, is the SI unit of length. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum c to be 299792458 when expressed in the unit m⋅s^(−1), where the second is defined in terms of the caesium frequency ΔνCs.</p>
