			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends. Like do you mean live like an illegal immigrant working under the table? Yes you can probably do that
The other extreme is of course things like Dr./Lawyer/basically any highly policed profession. Unique problems here is any kind of certification process is insane. Speaking from a lawyer's perspective I had to prove I went to the schools that I said I did, took the LSAT, graduated, had a massive background check done and my name is published. As in you can look up NY lawyer #51229332 (obviously fake number) and see that I am in good standing/not good standing/retired this has the problems that the 'middle ground' do as well</p>
<p>that being you are now applying to work without a social security number/green card or a fake one and hoping that there is gross incompetence at every step that lead to you getting a paycheck/bank account. Then even if you ended up getting a convincing enough forgery (such as a missing person and assuming their identity while being able to pass as them to an outsider) you'd once again run into countless problems throughout life. Like something simple like going to get your wisdom teeth removed may be enough to blow your cover.</p>
<p>Essentially you are relying on massive government bureaucracy with countless 'steps' to be completely incompetent at all times along with private companies</p>
<p>if it sounds like I wrote alot of words to say
tldr: No, that is intentional</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there were letters of introduction if you go back far enough. So, you would know this was Fred from a decent family because you had a letter of introduction from someone you both knew and trusted. Or that is at least what I get from murder mysteries and period pieces I've watched/read.  Not sure how hard these were to forge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, and not as challenging as you'd think. If you have a single copy of the wax seal (whether in tact or not) you could forge it, keep in mind people weren't exactly forensics experts and there would be plenty of excuses for why it isn't perfect.</p>
<p>...but of course that is if your plan is to go somewhere else and be important. If you wanted to just disappear and be a 'random peasant' you didn't have that kind of problem</p></div>		</li>
