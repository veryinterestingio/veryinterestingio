			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct.</p>
<p>It would collapse in on itself well before it got anywhere near the size to be observable on a galactic scale.</p>
<p>However, it would be possible that something relatively dissociated and sparse enough might be able to be that big. Think of a nebula.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s a matter of density. There is a critical density at which a body will collapse under its own gravity. If the celestial object is a <em>very</em> sparse gas cloud, it could theoretically avoid collapsing at the size of our galaxy. The issue is that then any passing body is going to disturb it and strip gas from it, making it smaller (also local density gradients will cause some denser pockets that will collapse to form stars)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Except for the case that it emits large amounts of energy to keep itself from collapsing similarly to stars that emit energy derived from fusion before it collapses into a black hole. Look up quasars which do just that. </p></div>		</li>
