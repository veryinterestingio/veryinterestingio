			<div class="markdown"><p>While desalination is generally pretty terrible it is not as bad as you are implying since the cooling water vapors will be used to preheat the liquid water. Heat exchangers can have efficiencies of over 90%, so it it possible that the process would take less than 10% of the energy you implied.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm actually a huge fan of desal.  I live in San Diego and am absolutely thrilled that the Carlsbad station is online.  I think we have a real shot of meeting our water needs for a reasonable cost by scaling more, and the environmental impacts are probably less than what we inflict with our current infrastructure. There are situations where water is already very expensive, and very scarce, and people are packed very close together, where it makes sense.  Especially as you get more and more of that energy from renewable sources.</p>
<p>The above calculations are actually a massive oversimplification.  Sunlight does not hit a cubic meter of water instantly from every direction.  Seawater is not always a balmy 65F.  Not every daytime is sunny and &gt;12 hours long.  Electricity does not evenly distribute as heat into water evenly or efficiently, even assuming a 100% efficient heat exchanger.  It does not factor in the losses from transmission and distribution of the energy. And so on and so forth down the line.</p>
<p>But the point is that most of the systematic errors I've made are on the conservative side.  I.e. they intentionally undershoot.  Even if I'm off by a factor of 10x (remove a zero from the cost) we're still orders of magnitude away from affordable to replace all of our water usage with boiled seawater.  You'd just never do it.  Reverse osmosis is vastly more efficient -- even if you had magical fusion power that gave you unlimited free energy forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are other approaches to desal such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_thermal_energy_conversion" target="_blank">OTEC</a> where a temperature gradient and vacuum chamber can be used to offset some of the energy requirements of straight distillation.</p>
<p>There are additional benefits from tapping such a &quot;well&quot; into deeper waters, you have a massive sink of water at 7C for cheap AC to surrounding areas and the area where the deep water is dumped back into the sea is excellent for fish farms.</p>
<p>Desalination is much more interesting when there are other marketable products to offset the cost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's only needed to heat the water into 100Â°C steam. I doubt they would want to heat the steam further up to several hundreds degrees.</p>
<p>And turbines use a closed water system with pure water. Any amount of salt would damage the turbine further.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The article is in Spanish. But it's  quite possible. </p>
<p>The cost is around  500 million dollars,  for 1000 lt of water per second : ) </p>
<p>It's  for industry,  so it's  not fully clean though . It produce 100 gigawatts of cleanenergy. </p>
<p>Is important  to note, the plant is set on the driest dessert on earth...that might help a little</p></div>		</li>
