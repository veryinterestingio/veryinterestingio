			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I have nerve damage in my left ear.  For years, the hearing mechanism between my ear and brain was failing and I had a very hard time hearing anything in a crowded room.  Very disorienting and often caused symptoms such as vertigo, tinnitus and anxiety.  Eventually, the nerve finally just stopped working all together.  </p>
<p>For a long time I couldn’t describe the situation well enough for anyone to understand.  Finally, one day I drew some pictures for my family, I envisioned my hearing as two sign waves going from my ear to my brain.  When I was younger, the sign waves were synchronized, and my brain could decipher the message quite well.  For some reason, thirty years ago, the sign wave in the left ear started to degrade.  It went from nice smooth wave on same frequency as the right to one that can change shape constantly if it’s own free will or due to external factors.</p>
<p>Sometimes it gets elongated, other times there is a lot of interference and the wave jumps and falls along its axis to varying heights and depths.  The whole time, there’s my brain, trying to clean up the signal to match it up with the signal it’s getting from the right.  The old brain kept up pretty good for a long time.  Then, I think the brain sat down one day and said, “listen, we are tired of your shit left ear; get it together, or we are just going to put you in our secondary system list and only pay attention to you when we want to.”</p>
<p>That began the years where most of the time, my left ear was working overtime trying to get the brains attention, so it started hearing stuff that didn’t even happen.  Most of the time, the brain had no idea what the hell left side was talking about.  </p>
<p>The right ear just kept plugging along.  One day an audiologist said, “hey, let’s put a digital hearing aid in your good ear, to help it make up for all the crap your left ear is doing.”  That helped for a couple of years, but it seemed like my right ear started getting lazy.  Like it knew the digital hearing aid would clean up its signal back to a smooth wave, so it didn’t have to work as hard.  In the meantime, the left ear says, “well, eff you guys, I’m just going to retire, because you got that fancy hearing aid to do all the work,” and he just went off to live in Hawaii or something.</p>
<p>Once the nerve mechanism in left ear started its retirement in Hawaii, the hearing aid in my right ear was almost too much, so I took it out.  I found that because there was nothing coming from the left ear, the right ear said, “hey, I got this.  We don’t need no stink in’ hearing aid.”  My hearing seemed to improve.  </p>
<p>What I am left with however is a loss of what I call hearing perception; it’s like depth perception with my eyes.  Hearing perception tells me where the sound is coming from.  Since only one ear is working, I can’t determine where sounds that aren’t within a few feet of me are coming from.</p>
<p>So, if someone shouts my name, I hear it.  My name acts like that pure digital wave pulse for one moment in time.  The my brain recognizes the on or off signal immediately.  But I have no Frik’n clue where it came from.  So, it’s like my brain acts like one of those roosters on top of a barn, swinging in the wind.  It swings my head around and back and forth until I visually see someone that looks like they are addressing me, or a person near me points out the person who yelled.  </p>
<p>TLDR: My life actually improved a lot when the signals from the left ear just stopped and I went virtually deaf in my right ear.</p>
<p>Edit:  medical docs determined about 13 years ago, I had Superior Semicircular Canal Dehiscence.  Basically a small eroded hole in the bone at the top of my ear system.  So what is supposed to be a closed pressure system, now had a leak. (Doc described it very simply like a closed radiator system in a car, When car gets hot, coolant is drawn into radiator to cool it off.  But even if there is just a small pinhole in radiator the system is no longer closed, so the pressure and coolant bleed off, causing radiator system to overheat, making entire vehicle to shut down).  The little pinhole in my ear bone was letting the pressure bleed off, hence causing balance and vertigo issues.</p>
<p>About three years ago, a nurse practitioner figured out what may have caused the pinhole; Hashimoto’s Disease, an auto immune disorder.  Thyroid antibodies were attacking my body, and 30 years ago they decided to pick on my left ear.  They ate away at the defect.  Once I got my thyroid antibodies count under control from thousands and thousands to down to a normal range under a hundred or so, the vertigo and balance issue stopped.  I am so amazed how much this changed my quality of life.</p></div>		</li>
