			<div class="markdown"><p>The critical point of nitrogen is at 126 K, 3.4 MPa. Oxygen and argon have ~150 K, ~5 MPa, which is not too different.</p>
<p>In the above sea level atmosphere the scale height is very roughly 8 km, if it's not too different below sea level we expect to reach 3.4 MPa after ~8km*ln(34) = 28 km. That's a very rough estimate, but it's clearly a very small fraction of Earth's diameter. Oxygen and argon shouldn't change that much.</p>
<p>Going beyond that... <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/multimedia/pub/174975.php?from=399275" target="_blank">this phase diagram</a> suggests a pure nitrogen borehole would stay a fluid, but with such a large depth we might need to consider the separation of heavier gases towards the bottom, and then things get complicated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK thanks,  this is what tripped me up actually.</p>
<p>G(z) can be integrated over all of the mass from r=0 up to the r you are evaluating, but nowhere does it seem to consider the total amount of gas, or the &quot;height of the column of air above you&quot; as they like to say.  That's what confused me.    I mean, what tells you what the density is initially?   What if the atmosphere was partially ablated,  how does this equation know there is enough total air to fill the density?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say that's taken care of by P_0, which incorporates everything we need to know about the atmosphere at sea level and above, right? We rely on that reference point.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The barometric relation is dP/dz = -œÅGz</p>

<p>I think you have an extra z on the right-hand side. See the <a href="https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Hydrostatic_equation" target="_blank">hydrostatic equation</a>.</p>

<p>This should probably be the adiabatic lapse rate, dT/dz = -g / C_p.</p></div>		</li>
