<blockquote>
<p>&quot;At the center of your brain, a clump of nerves—called the suprachiasmatic nucleus—oversees your body’s clock: the circadian rhythm. It determines when you feel sleepy and when you feel bright-eyed. It controls your blood pressure, your body temperature, and your sense of time. It turns your body into a finely tuned machine.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting facts: our <a href="http://www.annals.edu.sg/pdf/37VolNo8Aug2008/V37N8p662.pdf" target="_blank">circadian clock</a> that is conserved from at very least cyanobacteria 2 billion years ago; their clock allowed them to replicate their DNA during the night to avoid unnecessary damage from UV radiation. It functions with a series of feedback loops involving the expression of a range of genes such as Per1/2/3, Clock, Bmal1, Cry1/2 and it is tuned by UV light hitting the retina. The cycle is intimately linked to an endless list of essential physiological functions including the cell cycle and repair systems.</p>
<p>Studies have demonstrated that time of injury <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12934012" target="_blank">affects speed of recovery</a>, that disrupted circadian rhythm leads to a higher risk of <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/311/7006/649" target="_blank">cancer</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25211500" target="_blank">mental health diseases</a>.</p>
<p>If you can, a regular sleep pattern can be very beneficial for health!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This has nothing to do with sleep but, do drugs like alcohol or THC affect the circadian clock? I think many people will agree that these two, specially THC, will make you feel time at a different pace than usual, along with turning your body into a very badly tuned machine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the article I linked in another comment -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s evidence you can will yourself to wake on time, too. Sleep scientists at Germany’s University of Lubeck asked 15 volunteers to sleep in their lab for three nights. One night, the group was told they’d be woken at 6 a.m., while on other nights the group was told they’d be woken at 9 a.m. But the researchers lied—they woke the volunteers at 6 a.m anyway. And the results were startling. The days when sleepers were told they’d wake up early, their stress hormones increased at 4:30 a.m., as if they were anticipating an early morning. When the sleepers were told they’d wake up at 9 a.m., their stress hormones didn’t increase—and they woke up groggier. “Our bodies, in other words, note the time we hope to begin our day and gradually prepare us for consciousness,” writes Jeff Howe at Psychology Today.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the case for me. I often am half awake for about 15 mins before the alarm clock rings. I always wake up at the same hours, even on the week-end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Me too, but science aside, I’m pretty sure the reason why behind me waking up earlier than the alarm is because, I F@CKING HATE THE ALARM SOUND!!! ??‍♀️</p>
<p>Yeah, I hate it so I’d rather wake up before it starts to ring so I can turn it off (hopefully not to go back to sleep hehe)</p>
<p>I sort of just use alarms to remind me I have to wake up, but not to wake me up.  Normally I use alarms if I need to be awake on a certain time (like early in the morning to finish packing  luggages, prepare food for parties) so for me my brain is already in that very intense, very busy state but my body is tired or That I have to sleep hence I HAVE to sleep at some point and be awake at a particular time to go on with what I left off before sleeping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s actually scientifically explained that your body/mind hates the alarm sound and being woken up abruptly. It’s actually even explained in the parent comment.</p></div>		</li>
