<p>How dare you! Bob is a war veteran who volunteers on weekends and works the night shift at the vet. He has to walk 3 miles uphill both ways in the snow year round on his bad leg to get his 2:00 doughnut! How could you be so callous?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Woah woah woah. Why not just set a donut aside for Bob? You know he's coming at 2. He's a loyal customer and he's never been disrespectful. Hell, Bob puts a tenner in the tip jar once a week. </p>
<p>All my regulars are getting their donuts, especially Bob.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You don't know what he did in those jungles. The only thing that silences the screams of those innocents now is the daily donut. One could say he deserves an increase in price after what he did, but some might think he is a different man now. Reality, after all, is quite complex. Perhaps there is some beauty in letting even the worst of us have the donut. But they'll have to pay the price. A cent for every life lost in that fit of rage. A cent for every dream that never came true.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To hell with Bob,</p>

<p>Bob works the late shift as a custodian at the local domestic violence shelter. Every day Bob deals with the very worst humanity has to offer and he does his very best to be sure that these poor people have a nice, clean sanctuary where they can recover. </p>
<p>It isn't a glamorous job but Bob does it proudly because he feels like he can really make a difference in someone's life. He's unfailingly cheerful because sometimes these people just need a smile and a friendly nod. He buys candy in bulk and even though it's not really allowed, all of the kids at the shelter know that they can hit ol' Bob up for a full sized Snickers or a Tear N Share bag of M&amp;Ms. He even saves his bonuses throughout the year so he can help with the Christmas fund: no one's going without on Bob's watch. No sir.</p>
<p>His job wears on him though. He would never admit it to anyone but he gets so burned out seeing the results of the evil that humans inflict on each other. He really doesn't have much of a life outside of work; his wife passed a few years back and children were just never in the cards so he's pretty much alone. His neighbor got him a cat and damned if he doesn't love that goofy little furball like the Dickens. Still living alone in a small apartment, dealing with broken people six days a week is a tough life. It's really the little things that get him through. The way the sun reflects off of the river when he feeds cut grapes to the ducks at the local park. The slight scratchy sound when he drops the needle on to a John Coltrane album. The smile on a hurting child's face when Bob slips him a box of Mike &amp; Ike's. Dozens of little moments that are inconsequential when taken alone, but form the tapestry of a life when woven together. </p>
<p>He's come to think of his trip to Taxfraud777 Donuts as his favorite time of day. He pops in on the way to work for a strong cup of black coffee and chocolate frosted donut with sprinkles. He always preferred plain old glazed, but his beloved Dorothy always got as giddy as a school girl whenever he brought her a chocolate, sprinkled donut and he can still see her face light up each time he orders. He enjoys stopping at the park on the way to the shelter and slowly savoring his treat, eyes closed, memory of Dorothy's face firmly locked in his mind.</p>
<p>Sometimes Taxfraud777's is out of donuts and that's ok. It makes his day a little harder, a little colder but hey he'll get through. Ol' Bob would never let anyone see him cry, even if he's breaking inside.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The additional supplier affords consumers another option which drives the prices down slightly </p>
<p>Other suppliers enter markets when they see future profits to be made…sure they have to get up and running but if they do it right they enter the market and ultimately drive prices down making more donuts available</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good explanation, but also, when you start having to get up at 3:00 to make donuts, you're probably also going to raise the price a bit, because it's a pain to get up that early.  And if you're not working alone, you're going to have to pay somebody overtime or hire another worker to cover the early shift.  That added expense will also have to be covered in the price of the donuts.</p></div>		</li>
