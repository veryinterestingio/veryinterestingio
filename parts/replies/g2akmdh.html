			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be in the US, yes?  Other countries administer these things differently.  In Canada, some chiropractors were espousing anti vaccine / weird covid curing bs  vocally.</p>
<p>The chiropractic college pulled their license.  No more being a chiropractor, but your welcome to be crazy as a non professional.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plenty of chiropractors here push things like that.
There are even pediatricians who enable anti-Vax parents but they are careful to avoid making any too specific statements or claims to avoid any licensing trouble.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, American chiropractors go to some length to give the impression that they too are some sort of doctor. They try to use clinical sounding language, they'll pull out spinal x-rays and stuff, they try to make their offices look like doctor's offices as opposed to anything that looks kinda hippy dippy. They wear scrubs.</p>
<p>It's convincing enough to the general public, and usually less intimidating than the normal medical system. Physical Therapists are the real-deal equivalent to chiropractors, but they don't have 500 Youtube channels. The public doesn't really know to go to them with an achey back.</p>
<p>But because chiros try so hard to assume a sort of visual equivalency with the rest of medicine it doesn't surprise me that they might get their license pulled by their chiropractic college because they did something that looks bad. It's not an AMA license though, so it's just more theater.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you have any evidence to support that regulatory oversight is looser with chiropractic than other healthcare providers?</p></div>		</li>

<p>“They graduate as doctors of chiropractic degrees, but they are not medical doctors.”</p>
<p>They are not governed by the same certifications as medical doctors because they are not medical doctors.  They are doctors in the same way someone with a PhD in Art is a doctor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saying that chiropractors are not medical doctors in no way demonstrates that they have looser regulations. This is a <a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/false-cause" target="_blank">false cause</a> fallacy. Would you feel similarly about dentists, optometrists and podiatrists? By your definition they would have looser regulations as well because they are non-MD doctors.</p>
<p>a PhD is an academic doctorate, an MD, DC, DO, OD, DDS, etc. are professional doctorates. </p>
<p>To demonstrate a specific example of where you are wrong: Illinois.</p>
<p>In Illinois Chiropractors are part of the medical practice act, which governs MD's, DO's, and DC's. The medical review board that reviews all three professions is the same and by state law must consist of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Five members shall be physicians licensed to practice medicine in all of its branches in Illinois possessing the degree of doctor of medicine. One member shall be a physician licensed to practice medicine in all its branches in Illinois possessing the degree of doctor of osteopathy or osteopathic medicine. One member shall be a chiropractic physician licensed to practice in Illinois and possessing the degree of doctor of chiropractic. Four members shall be members of the public, who shall not be engaged in any way, directly or indirectly, as providers of health care.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(from Ch. 111, par. 4400-7, subsection A)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=1309&ChapterID=24" target="_blank">https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=1309&ChapterID=24</a></p>
<p>So the review board that regulates chiropractors in Illinois consists of a 5 MD's, 1 DO, 1 DC, and 4 members of the general public.</p>
<p>So the review board that regulates medical doctors in Illinois consists of a 5 MD's, 1 DO, 1 DC, and 4 members of the general public.</p>
<p>It is the same board, same regulations.</p>
<p>So I'll ask you again, do you have any evidence to support your claim? The argument you have presented thus far is fallacious and I have presented evidence to the contrary.</p></div>		</li>
