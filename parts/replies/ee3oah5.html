<p>Sure, but I don't think that's the simplest explanation of what OP's talking about. You can actually give a much clearer answer with a mostly classical approach.</p>
<p>You can &quot;explain&quot; literally anything with &quot;Quantum mechanics!&quot; because, yeah, everything is quantum mechanics, but that doesn't mean there isn't a simpler explanation that's much more helpful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but you're not actually helping to explain why they have different properties.</p>
<p>It's like if someone asked why one book made the reader happy and one book made them sad, and you said, &quot;There are <em>millions</em> of letters in a book. There are so many combinations!&quot; It would be more useful to say something like, &quot;You felt sad because <em>this</em> character died, and you felt happy because <em>this</em> character redeemed themself.&quot; You don't need to talk about the permutation space of a million characters, and in fact it's better not to.</p></div>		</li>

It's not great, I only spent a few minutes on what's really a very broad question, but I think it's better than, &quot;Quantum mechanics!&quot;</p></div>		</li>
