			<div class="markdown"><p>You could, but the deeper answer to this question involves the physics behind light, and it turns out that light from the sun can pretty much be entirely characterized by its frequency (or wavelength), which <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0007/9711/4434/files/spectrum_grande.png?v=1544035639" target="_blank">start from zero and go off to infinity</a>. Thus the more natural/physical representation of light is a line of frequency, where a subsection is the visible light we all know and love.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but physics doesn't treat light rays like that - they increase in frequency from red to orange to yellow and so on up the purple.</p></div>		</li>
