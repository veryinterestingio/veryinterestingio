<p>Pawns now move two spaces on their first move</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I was taught chess by my parents, they said you could also move two pawns 1 space each on their first move. They reasoned it's just the same as moving one pawn &quot;twice&quot;.</p>
<p>This rule then became popular among my friends until our school chess coach put a stop to it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Except Death in Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Death looked long and hard at the board. The abbot waited to see what long-term, devious strategies were being evolved. Then his opponent tapped a piece with a bony finger. <strong>REMIND ME AGAIN</strong>, he said, <strong>HOW THE LITTLE HORSE-SHAPED ONES MOVE</strong>.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, the Chinese chess horse and the chess knight do <em>not</em> move identically, even though the destination square is the same relative to the starting one.</p>
<p>The chess knight jumps when moving, so it can &quot;hop over&quot; a piece in its longer movement direction (for instance, moving a knight from B1 to C3 on the first move, &quot;hopping over&quot; the pawn in front of it, if I recall the chess board correctly).</p>
<p>In contrast, the Chinese chess horse cannot jump. Rather, it &quot;slides&quot; one space in its longer movement direction, and then &quot;slides&quot; one space diagonally. If there is a piece in front of the horse when it &quot;slides&quot; horizontally or vertically, the horse is actually blocked from that move, and cannot proceed forward. Using the same board spaces, if a pawn is on space B2, and the horse is on space B1, the horse's move from B1 to C3 is illegal (because B2 is blocked by the pawn).</p>
<p>Now, whether the horse has always had this &quot;sliding&quot; behavior in the history of Chinese chess, I have no idea, but I thought I'd put it out there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the horse in Xiangqi moves one square orthogonally followed by one square diagonally.</p>
<p>Which is the same on an empty board, but can be different in play as it doesn't ignore intervening pieces like a western chess knight.</p></div>		</li>
