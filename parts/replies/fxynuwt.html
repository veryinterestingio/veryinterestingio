			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish I could somehow promote this! The simple answer is that one person can't be 50% fat and 60% water! Water proportion goes down as fat proportion goes up! Both would go down if somebody had adamantium fused to their bones!</p>
<p>The median young adult woman in the US is 32% body fat and 55% water (by mass)!<br />
The median young adult man in the US is 23% body fat and 60% water (by mass)!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So to explain it like the OP is 5... a <em>person</em> can be 50% body fat, while <em>people</em> tend to be 60% water. This is sort of like how a person can be 8 feet tall even though most people are under six feet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, that would be even simpler. Your average adult young man is about 60% water. A tiny bit less for women. </p>
<p>Someone who is 50% fat is not average. Theyâ€™re probably 400+ pounds. They do not have 60% water. They have less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tiny correction...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those &quot;measure&quot; your bodyfat percentage by seeing how well your body conducts water</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That would be by measuring how well it conducts electricity through the water in your tissues.</p></div>		</li>
