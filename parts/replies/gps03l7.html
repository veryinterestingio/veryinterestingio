			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, that is a lot of lucid dreams! The evidence is still unclear as to whether lucid dreaming itself can disrupt sleep quality. However, it is known that sleep disruption can lead to lucid dreaming. For instance, when people wake up in the middle of the night and stay awake for a period of time, they are much more likely to lucid dream upon falling back asleep. People are also more likely to lucid dream while pressing the snooze button. More research is needed on whether too many lucid dreams can lead to tiredness independently of sleep disruption. Thank you for sharing your experience! </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well. I can’t believe my question got answered thanks.  I did have a comment about the video and problem solving.   Many many times I have lucid dreams where I have work meetings and “we” come up with solutions to problem that I then have applied in real life. It was creepy at first now it’s really interesting.    Many times I am in a meeting and have to do a dream check lol.</p></div>		</li>
