			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker_Solar_Probe" target="_blank">Parker Solar Probe</a> will use multiple gravity assists from Venus to get very close to the sun.</p>
<p>But it's still more difficult to send a probe to the sun than out of the solar system, because you can use gravity assists to get out of the solar system as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. That's more-or-less what the Ulysses mission did, though they didn't actually crash it into the Sun.</p>

<p>So if you can get a probe to Jupiter, you can send it anywhere -- inward or outward.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and this is what is often done. But itâ€™s slow and takes a while to loop enough times with interceptions to slow down.</p>
<p>If you try to get something less than the orbit of Mercury though, well once you slingshot off Mercury there is no planet closer to the sun to further slingshot off of. Sending something AT the sun is a little easier though, you just need a highly eccentric orbit, one that comes close to the sun but then goes further out.</p></div>		</li>
