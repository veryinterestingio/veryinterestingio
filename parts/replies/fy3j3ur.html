<p>Warehouse work has you &quot;put your back into it&quot;, something you're told not to do when training.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Athletes and gym-goers suffer from overtraining if they train too often on poorly designed programs, regardless of form. Warehouse work is like the ultimate poorly designed program: Do the same repetitive motions hundreds of times a day with not enough recovery time between workouts.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They don't really teach that stuff. And nobody is making sure you do it correct. I've seen plenty of guys lifting wrong. </p>
<p>Lifting in the gym is almost a requisite for knowing how to lift. getting used to the motions. It makes warehouse work safer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Overtraining is a very common problem in athletics. In addition, Repetitive motion is the core of weight lifting. That's why they call the amount of lifts you do in a set reps. That being said, I understand your point, but you teach at the level your student is at. OP is asking why working out is different from hypertension, so I'm guessing they aren't well versed in exercise physiology.</p></div>		</li>
