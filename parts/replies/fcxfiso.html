			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here for this. I’m quite positive these companies would employ chemists, likely many analytical chemists to make absolutely sure there no unacceptable contamination (heavy metals, various toxins, etc), but I wouldn’t really say chemists “make” vaccines. They’re necessary to meet modern standards, but it’s really biologists, microbiologists, and biochemists, etc, that you’d say <em>made</em> the vaccine. </p>
<p>It’d be kinda like having a bunch of machinists, engineers, and mechanics making a tank. They’d need a welder, but I wouldn’t really say the welders made the tank. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. I have a chemistry degree and have no idea how vaccines are made beyond a hunch.</p></div>		</li>
