			<div class="markdown"><p>Pigeons are a domesticated species; the ones you see out in the open are actually feral. They have no native habitat in the wild. This is why they primarily dwell near human sources of food.</p>
<p>However, they were bred from wild rock doves who do dwell on sea-cliffs, like you said.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but they are distinct from the wild rock doves from which they were bred. One is domesticated, the other is not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They didn't live in the famous cave painting caves, and down through the ages only a fairly small fraction of people lived in caves......but many caves were legit lived in by people and still have the remains of hearths etc.  Early people didn't require them but they didn't pass them up if they were convenient</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where did they actually sleep then? There was fairly long period of time between when we left the trees and when we gained the intelligence necessary to build our own living spaces, right? And sleeping in the open seems dangerous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Below a tree? Until the young stone age merely about 10.000 years ago, humans were nomadic. They didn't have a home, they had to keep moving around to not over exploit resources in one area.</p>
<p>BTW: it doesn't mean that nobody ever slept in a cave, but it was merely an occasional thing. Caves are rare, rarely have a better climate than outside (cold, damp) and often were home to some dangerous wild life.</p></div>		</li>
