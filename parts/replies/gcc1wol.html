<p>It was expected earlier, however. It doesn't take that much imagination once you realize all the planets orbit the Sun. From the lack of observable parallax people knew stars had to be very far away. How does the Sun look like from very far away? Just like a star.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it was expected in the classical greek era that everything was build out of smallest parts called atoms. But we can't really say that we KNEW that was the case until much much much much later. We were even so dumm to call atoms atoms, while we found even smaller particles afterwards (which, in fairness, should be renamed atoms as they are the smallest building blocks we know of)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In regards to atoms, they are the smallest pieces of matter that is still an actual element. Any smaller and you don't have anything at all except a subatomic particle soup that will rearrange itself into mostly hydrogen at the soonest possible opportunity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Science doesn't rename stuff, lest you want people to be stuck with heavily annotated copies of old manuscripts to make them readable again.</p>
<p>It causes us to be stuck with all sorts of awkwardness like conventional electrical direction because they fairly assumed electrons to be positrons, or elemental spin when such particles can't really spin in a classical sense, but still cause similar effects.</p>

<p>After all, it's hardly a century ago that we figured out ways to split the unsplittable!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes this needs to be stressed. Pre-telescope people really didn't know what they might look actually, just that they were different from stars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely need to underline that people did not know that stars are distant suns and planets are made differently (they had no idea WHAT the things were apart from lights they could see up above).  They just knew that planets did not behave the same way in the sky as stars, so named them as special because of that distinct behavior.</p></div>		</li>
