			<div class="markdown"><p>It is also common for tap water to have chlorine added to it as an antimicrobial. It's kinda the opposite of harmful since the concentration is too low to do anything to us but it murders anything that could make someone sick from drinking it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just the air from the atmosphere that dissolves into the water. It's mostly nitrogen and oxygen with a small amount of CO2 and trace gasses. It's no more harmful than swallowing some air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, but it would be substantially more clear than ice made from water directly from the tap.</p>
<p>Related: if you were curious how they make that crystal clear ice for fancy bars and restaurants, it mostly involves controlling how the ice freezes, rather than the water used. </p>
<p>Special trays are used that cause the ice block to freeze from one end to the other linearly. As the water crystallizes, impurities (including air) are excluded from the crystal. If the block is allowed to freeze from the outside in, this results in a little cloud of impurities at the center of the block. If it’s frozen from one end to the other linearly, all the cloudy impurities collect along one face of the block, where they can easily be shaved off, leaving just clear crystal ice.</p></div>		</li>
