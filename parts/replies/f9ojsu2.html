<p>Temporary Hair Dyes: Temporary dyes simply coat the surface of the cuticle and hence can be washed off easily</p>
<p>Semi-Permanent Dyes: The dyes that need to be semi-permanent need to open up the cuticle* and enter the cortex in order to be semi-permanent. The melanin in the hair still is present and the semi-permanent dye can still be removed after thorough washing after the cuticle is opened.</p>
<p>Permanent Dyes: You need to be really sure before you use these... Basically the Permanent Dyes remove the melanin and add the dye of choice to the cortex. The melanin is completely removed by harsh chemicals such as Ammonia and Hydrogen Peroxide** etc. Hence the process is completely permanent.</p>
<p>*The cuticle is usually opened by alkaline substances as hair has an isoelectric point of pH 3.67. Therefore, the cuticle layers repel each other due to like charges and open up the layer thereby exposing the cortex.</p>
<p>** The hydrogen peroxide breaks down the disulfide bridges (the strongest linkage in tertiary proteins (keratin)). This causes the release of sulfur causing the characteristic odour found during permanent hair dyeing. The dye then binds to the keratin making the dye stay permanently in the cortex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Developer has more than just hydrogen peroxide making hair color work.
Using otc hydrogen peroxide can slightly lighten natural hair by over oxidizing the melanin. But it would be like half a level and make yoir hair feel brittle. Back in the 70s and 80s there was a product called &quot;sun-in&quot; that was marketed to lighten blonde hair. It was basically hydrogen peroxide and caused lots of issues due to over use and used actual hair color or bleach were used over it, the reactions were not pretty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually it depends... Simply applying Henna without any pre-treatment means its Temporary.</p>
<p>Some professional hair dyes also contain Henna and can be classified as Semi Permanent if the cuticle is opened before the dye is applied</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hydrogen peroxide swells the hair shaft and opens the cuticle, while oxidizing the ammonia in the color (dye). When coloring, this can lighten natural pigment/melanin. The color has dye molecules that contain ammonia and are very small they enter the cortex where they oxidize with the hydrogen peroxide in the developer and grow larger. That is what keeps them from falling back out of the hair shaft, making it permanent. When using lightener (bleach) it uses different chemicals to lighten pigment molecules, both natural and artificial. No melanin is removed, it is lightened. That's why you see dark hair colors turning orange before blonde.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Almost but it's mostly that the hair shaft is swelling/oxidizing, causing the cuticle to open. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>hair has an isoelectric point of pH 3.67.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our hair and skin is cover by an acidic layer called the acid mantel. The pH of the acid mantel is between 4.5 - 5.5. </p>
<blockquote>

<p>Disulfide bonds, not bridges. These are not involved in color, they are however in perms and relaxers. And keratin in a protein, not a bond, and again is not invloved in chemical processes. (Except that it can break down over time from poor care or products) That smell is from the ammonia, and does not smell like sulfur. It stinks for sure, but not like rotten eggs. Hair dye molecules grow larger from oxidation and stay in the cortex making them permanent. Perms and relaxers break disulfide bonds using ammonium thyoglocolate or soduim hydroxide causing the sulfer smell. The perm rod forces the hair to curl (flat iron forces it to be straight in the case of relaxers) then a neutralizing agent reforms the disulfide bond into the new shape, curl or stright. These are very fragile post service which is why you cannot wet/wash your hair for 48 hours post perm. Legally Blonde was actually correct on that one. Fun fact, ammonium thyo and sodium hydroxide mixed together melt hair, which is why you cannot get a perm after having a relaxer. Unless both used the same base chemical. </p>
