<p>Nah lol, but I have been told repeatedly that lefties are better at sport because we don't play the same as the average opponent. </p>
<p>So you guys, like me, spend most of your time playing against righties. But then you and I play, I'm still playing against a rightie, but now the game has changed for you. </p>
<p>This applies mainly to things like racquet sports, boxing and fencing like sports I guess, can't imagine it would make much difference in stuff like golf</p></div>		</li>

<p>If a course is designed to be challenging towards righties (a lot of right handers have a natural left to right slice) because the designer is a righty it may be a easier play for lefties. Obviously this doesn't apply to &quot;professional&quot; courses as much.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm a lefty in hockey and golf but a right-handed writer, for example. I'm a switch hitter in baseball though so maybe there's something to it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Masters Tournament is probably the only men's major that tends to favor left-handed golfers because Augusta National has so many holes that bend to the left. Since the other majors rotate courses you won't get that kind of bias as often, if at all. Granted there are so few left-handed players that the overall record is still dominated by right-handed players, but considering Mike Weir (2003), Phil Mickelson (2004, 2006, 2010), and Bubba Watson (2012, 2014) have combined to win it six times since 2003, it's a pretty impressive outlier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least in baseball being a left handed thrower is both a boon and a curse depending on what you're good at.</p>
<p>Most fielders are right handed, due to the counter-clockwise nature of play you throw to your left more often than you throw to your right, so throwing with your right hand is easier (you throw with your moment across your body, you don't need to spin around.)</p>
<p>That means that Catchers, Third, Second basemen and Shortstop are exclusively right handed, there's only historical anomalies out there, but you're simply not going to see any coach putting a left handed thrower in those positions because making plays is harder or cost more time.</p>
<p>The only positions that throw left handed in baseball are outfielders (the distances away from the infield mean you throw forward, so arm-dominance doesn't matter), and first base (first baseman is the only spot that throws to their right more often than to his left.)</p>
<p>And then of course there's the pitcher, and that's where lefties really shine. Most players that are left handed and can throw accurately are often trained to be pitchers from a young age.</p>
<p>Why? Because left handers are rare, an anomaly. Whilst a right handed batter has a more natural advantage against lefties (breaking balls thrown by lefties move towards a righty), many young players can go their entire youth maybe seeing a handful of left handed pitchers. That makes them confusing to face, and as such a bit of a 'cheat code'.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean that Lefties are naturally 'better' than righties, there are a lot more legendary righties than lefties. But they definitely are a valued commodity, because a good left handed thrower is hard to deal with for most players.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lefty pitchers are aligned in a way that makes it easier to pick off runners at first base. </p>
<p>There's also the fact that right-handed batters have to take between 1 and 2 extra steps to cross the plate in order to get to first base, and when they swing the bat, they're pivoting away from that direction. Lefties pivot toward first base when they swing, and their box is closer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A surprising number of recent US presidents have been left handed</p>
<ul>
<li>Gerald Ford (admittedly, he came into office because Nixon resigned)</li>
<li>Ronald Reagan</li>
<li>George H.W. Bush (in 1988, the father of George W. Bush)</li>
<li>Bill Clinton</li>
<li>Barack Obama</li>
</ul>
<p>It's been said that being left-handed was considered &quot;bad&quot;, so many children were discouraged from using their left hand, so some people that seemed right-handed may have been more naturally left-handed.</p>
<p>There has been a weird reverse case in sports.  Rafael Nadal, a top pro tennis player, is naturally a right hander, but his uncle (who coached him) trained him to hit left handed.  Because he is right handed, he is right eye dominant, which means that his right eye is forward when he hits a lefty forehand.  This is said to provide an advantage.</p></div>		</li>

<p>45 US presidents total. 5 lefties.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now in American football there a similar story. A rookie QB (and promising star) Tua Tagovailoa it's a natural rightie but trained to play with the left hand.</p>
<p>The usefulness of this in not as clear, with the biggest advantage would be that lefts are better aware of the most dominant rusher of the other teams defenses, that usually would align at his left ( and be at the blind side of most Qbs).</p>
<p>But this also could create other problems, particularly at team constructing, since normally right tackles are not as well considered as important as left tackles, but to him, a right tackles would protect his blind side.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This never made a lot of sense to me. Since RT isn't as important as LT, they are cheaper. A team with a lefty QB can shell out for the top RT on the market and save more relatively speaking on LT. It seems like a market inefficiency to me that can be exploited with a lefty franchise QB.</p>
<p>Although that does have potential issues with a righty backup QB, and I've heard some WRs don't like/aren't used to catching spirals from lefties (but a lot of the time they're also drama queens, so who knows).</p></div>		</li>
