			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct, Viewed from eye level, the ground three miles away from you is at the horizon. However, the sun is not located on the surface of earth [citation needed].</p>
<p>If light always went straight, just viewing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon#Objects_above_the_horizon" target="_blank">sun along this line tangent to the earth</a> would probably only account for [larger than 3, but more reasonable number than thousands of miles], but as light passes through mediums of different refractive indexes (which can change with density and temperature) it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction" target="_blank">changes direction</a>. A continuously changing refractive index coming from a medium with a gradual temperature, composition, and/or density change can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_refraction" target="_blank">actually curve the light</a>. The diagram on this last source suggests to me that the actual change in the length of the path probably doesn't change the math much.</p>
<p>To put it another way, just because you can see something doesn't mean it's only three miles away, particularly when that thing isn't the size of a loaf of bread and sitting on the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes at sea level but you can see for hundreds of miles through the atmosphere. For example the ISS is about 250 miles up in orbit at the outer level of our atmosphere. At just 2 degrees above the horizon that is about 1,300 miles. So you are easily looking through about 1,000 miles of atmosphere when viewing a sunset. Also the atmosphere is more effective at scattering UV light than visual light. Which helps a lot in reducing the damage done by UV to the skin/eyes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right idea but wrong explanation. The distance to the horizon is irrelevant. That depends on your <em>height</em> above the Earth's surface. In the limit of a perfectly spherical Earth as your height approaches zero so too does the distance to the horizon. You are correct that the atmosphere is a thin shell compared to the radius of the Earth. And the thickness of that shell is much greater when measured straight &quot;forward&quot; rather than straight up. (For the mathematically inclined, if the Earth radius is R and the shell thickness is t, then the thickness measured forward is around square root(R * t), which for ballpark numbers of 4000 miles and 10 miles respectively makes the forward distance about 200 miles.)</p></div>		</li>

Note that this relies on a power series expansion in t/R valid only because t &lt;&lt; R. And you'll see there's a factor of sqrt(2) that pops up too but I left that out above since these are just ball park numbers anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, air gets thinner as you go up, so 4000 miles of total air != 400*10 miles of air looking straight up. The ratio ends up being over 35 when the sun is setting (look up 'air mass'). I know you didn't make any claims about this, I'm only commenting to inform other users.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. And to be clear, 4000 miles is the approximate Earth radius not atmospheric thickness. The latter I took as 10 miles as a rough guess on the thickness of atmosphere <em>with appreciable density</em>. The figure of 35 is interesting to know. Thanks for sharing. (And if you put in the missing square root of two from my comment below, my rough approximation comes up with a factor of 30x more air at sunset vs. noon, so not too far off!)</p></div>		</li>
