			<div class="markdown"><p>Captain: Specialist why is the 2LT bleeding out?</p>
<p>Specialist: Sir, The 2LT attempted to give me a field promotion and I refused, sir.</p>
<p>Captain: What does that have to do with him bleeding out?</p>
<p>Specialist: Well you see sir, when I refused and so he shot me for insubordination.</p>
<p>Captain: but he is the one who was shot?</p>
<p>Specialist: Well you see, he was holding the gun backwards, and given his rank, I felt it was uncalled for to correct him.</p></div>		</li>

<p>STEINBRENNER: Stop it George, he's out, you're in.</p>
<p>STEINBRENNER: A lot more work you know.</p>
<p>GEORGE: I know.</p>
<p>STEINBRENNER: A lot more responsibility. Long long hours.</p>
<p>GEORGE: I know.</p>
<p>STEINBRENNER: Not much more money. But you'll finally get the recognition you deserve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically brevet lieutenants still exsist. When military academies send their cadets out to somewhere with vague risk of actual military things happening, they sent us on brevet lieutenant orders, which basically meant if we got captured as a POW we would be treated as officers.</p></div>		</li>
