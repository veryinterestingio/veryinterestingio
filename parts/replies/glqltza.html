			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally agreed. I think some people also don’t realize that zero current will flow in/out of the battery as soon as it’s fully charged. So leaving it in the laptop at 100% isn’t really different from charging to 100% and then taking it out of the laptop (aside from temperature).</p>
<p>Actually the worst thing you can do to a battery is fully discharging it (to the point where the deep discharge protection turns it off). Even worse is fully discharging and then leaving it around so it can drain even further due to self-discharge. It’s bad for Li-Ion and completely kills most lead acid batteries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you saying that the current bypasses the battery when it's charged, as opposed to the laptop still being powered by the battery under a trickle charge? Because I'm not convinced that's what happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simple chargers will keep the battery at a fixed voltage (usually 4.2V per cell for Li-Ion). It’s not great but negligible current will flow into the battery. I think more intelligent chargers turn themselves off and have some hysteresis built in where they only start charging again once it drops below 95% or so.</p>
<p>As long as the AC adapter can provide enough power no current will flow out of or through the battery.</p>
<p>I think some laptops used to come with inadequate AC adapters which couldn’t provide enough power when the laptop was working at a 100% load so it started draining the battery. But that’s obviously bad design and also meant that you couldn’t run at 100% forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What' the best case when you do need to use your laptop unplugged, which is the most common case? Limit max capacity to 70%, use unplugged, and only charge at 30%? Also, is there a difference at all to setting an actual limit to 70% in the BIOS and just manually limiting it by unplugging it yourself when it hits 70%?</p>
<p>Lastly, the above answers the question, but how impactful is the end result--if you're only saving say 15 minutes of total battery life after 4 years compared to your average user who is not mindful of this, it doesn't seem worth the trade-off of time and effort.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think it's more than 15 minutes, considering it's 96% vs 80% after 1 year at 25 C:

			<div class="markdown"><p>Limit the max to 70%, and when you need to use the battery, unplug it, use it, and plug it back in as soon as you are able.</p>
<p>The results can be huge.  Cycling your battery 10 times a day trying to keep it between 30-70% adds up to nearly 4000 cycles per year.  That will kill your battery dead within 6 months, probably less.  Floating your battery at 100% all the time will reduce its capacity by ~10% per year (going off of memory here, I currently can't find the source where I got that info).  Floating your battery at 70% all the time will reduce its capacity by more like 1-2% per year.</p>
<p>There's a temperature effect in there as well, essentially hotter = more aging.  Charging/discharging heats up the battery, reducing its longevity even more compared to the ideal case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might be from Battery University, since it does talk about discharge cycles:<br />

<p>What do you think about phones and other portable devices (I have a mp3 player, headphone amplifier, bluetooth transmitter and bluetooth receiver)?  </p>
<p>Like if you think about a phone, people charge it overnight, and then they use it until they come home. Doesn't that put stress on the battery? I guess maybe it doesn't matter because people upgrade their phones. Like I have a plan with T-Mobile that lets me upgrade phones after I've paid a certain amount on my current phone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You shouldn't ever remove the battery actually, as the battery provides protection against voltage spikes and drops. If you check your laptop manual, it probably says to never use it with your battery removed for this reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had two laptops. One i had plug in all the time, the other i unplug when i sleep and keep it plug in when in use. Both the way i see it, the battery is dead. I never actually checked the settings but it just feels like battery life is like 3 hours.</p></div>		</li>
