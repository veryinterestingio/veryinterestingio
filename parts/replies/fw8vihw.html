			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm self employed, and have been for most of my career, at a job currently where I basically set my own hours any way I like.</p>
<p>And somehow I was so traumatized by the 10 years I worked in an office that still to this day I experience a sudden mood boost at around 7 PM as though thinking that now I can do whatever I want, despite probably having just spent the whole day doing whatever I wanted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I agree that most people perform jobs that are completely unnecessary, wouldn't people still need to grow / make / send food? Fix houses? Make essentials? It takes a lot of workers to make that happen. how do we decide who works and who doesn't?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have not worked in an office and only worked from home but still experience the weird night mood boost. It's probably more to do with being a night person and like the guy said above, an anxiety thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's definitely an anxiety aspect for me. I think just the realization that nobody is going to be making demands on me for the next few hours is what triggers it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LOL this is actually ridiculously accurate. I had to write an exam for a certification and due to COVID19 they allowed you to write it online at home provided you had a webcam on the entire time. I didn’t want to sound weird, and thought we were restricted to the old hours, and asked to write the exam at like 1pm (during quarantine I was sleeping at like 5am and waking up at 1pm, but figured I could just wake up an hour earlier or something and prep). Boy I did not do amazing. I ended up speaking to my manager about it and he told me that I can re-attempt and that I can technically choose anytime I wanted, so I picked 3am, and passed LOL</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same reason I always used to prefer night time. A big reason procrastination is awesome too, you get to ignore the thing with big expectations and the other thing without any pressure tied to it seems that much better. Anxiety controlling my life, woo!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except the thing keeping you up at night is actually controlling your life instead of you having control of it. Procrastinate too much and you'll ruin an otherwise happy life. The day is vast and bright.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to think this until someone told me I probably just have a different sleep cycle. I can’t for the life of me sleep more than 4-5 hours (unless I get pretty drunk).</p>
<p>Sorry for the crappy link but these infographics explain them quite well (more on Wikipedia) <a href="https://www.dreams.co.uk/sleep-matters-club/4-alternative-sleeping-cycles-infographic/" target="_blank">https://www.dreams.co.uk/sleep-matters-club/4-alternative-sleeping-cycles-infographic/</a></p></div>		</li>
