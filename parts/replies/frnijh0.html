			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the reference frame.  If the reference frame is the train then you are moving backwards. If the reference frame is the ground then you are moving forward but decelerating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Might confuse my derivatives but isn't this the same as saying</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You don't decelerate. You experience negative jerk. You're velocity is still positive. Just smaller.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The movement was obviously implied to be in relation to the train. Assuming the ground/Earth as reference when that wasn't stated seems intentional to create an opportunity for petty corrections that aren't even technically true because an equally true reference frame was outright dismissed trice (&quot;No. Not quite. You donâ€™t&quot;).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I corrected myself in another comment. Relative to the train, you move backwards, but obviously relative to the ground, you still move forwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;If you're moving, you keep moving until an external force stops you.&quot; But you don't necessarily keep moving at the same velocity do you? So e.g. if the train is accelerating whilst I'm jumping (in the train), I won't anymore be as fast as the train anymore and might not land exactly where I jumped from.</p>
<p>Could that happen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are in the train, and it is accelerating,  when you jump you will stay at the same velocity the train was at when you left the ground. So in theory, you would land slightly further back as the train will have moved further while you were in the air. In practice for the time you would be in the air, this distance would not really be noticeable.</p>
<p>However, if you have ever been in a car when it accelerates quickly, you can feel your seat pushing you forward. So you can imagine that if you jumped out of your seat, you might end up in the back of the car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, of course.</p>
<p>Newton's 1st law specifically states that, in an inertial frame of reference, an object retains its velocity (including V=0, i.e., rest) unless acted upon by a force.</p>
<p>It wouldn't make much of a difference since I don't think a train at full speed would accelerate at a significant rate.</p>
<p>If a human being were represented as a line, then yes, you wouldn't land <em>exactly</em> where you came from. Realistically, I doubt it'd be discernible from human error during the jump itself.</p></div>		</li>
