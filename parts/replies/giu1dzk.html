			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Every other answer above this one boils down to a circular &quot;it's like this because it is.&quot;</p>
<p>It still doesn't make much sense though. Sony and Samsung both want to develop long term relationships with their TV buying customers, yet I can buy both at the same electronics store. The real question which I think is still unanswered is why do cars work this way when other things don't? And the real reason might just be inertia and history, I dunno.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably harder to justify specialisation. Electronics stores are able to provide all types of gadgets from all types of brands. Car dealerships can't reasonably have all types of cars from all brands. Either specialise on a type of car, a brand, or mix and match them. That's my guess at least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not so much, as legally they're not allowed to sell more than one brand. </p>
<p>So it does benefit them in the way he stated, but isn't the reason for it existing. The reason for it existing is old pro-consumer regulation as dealers would sell all kinds of brands but not support them hardly at all, and willingly sell you cars that local mechanics won't repair if they require specific tools and the likes. </p>
<p>There was a lot more shady shit going on at that time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Supposing what you stated is true, the fact remains, that the previous poster actually gave a motivation for the existing regulations and others didn't. Seeing as other forms of regulation are easy to come up with that avoid both the problems you and they mentioned, it is reasonable to assume that they are also correct, as we are otherwise missing an explanation for the regulatory shortcomings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>same, except i've had a few more cars than that. a pontiac, a mitsubishi, a subaru, a mini, and a toyota</p>
<p>not that i go out with the intention of doing something different just to be contrarian, i just don't feel a whole lot of brand loyalty (even though my last 3 cars in particular have been complaint-free experiences) and have been through a lot of moves changes in my life, and i've pretty much just bought the appropriate car at the time</p></div>		</li>
