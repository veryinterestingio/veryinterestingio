			<div class="markdown"><p>In February I had a circumcision.  Morning wood was one of the things I worried about most while anticipating the operation, because, you know, if you've got stitches holding the end of your penis together and you get a hardon... what's that going to be like???</p>
<p>It turned out my worries were totally well founded.  Several times a night I'd wake up dreaming that my penis was inserted into a thistle bush.</p>
<p>It seems that this is why they give you a pack of painkillers when you leave hospital.</p>
<p>On the plus side they numb your penis the fuck up when they're operating on it and when I came out of hospital I was blessed with an impressively large penis.  Unfortunately my request that they take away the pain but leave the swelling went unanswered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the 5 year olds in the audience without medical degrees:</p>
<p>Erections are stimulated by the <del>parasympathetic nervous system</del> <strong>part of your nervous system that governs your feelings of arousal while at rest</strong> causing <del>Nitric oxide release</del> <strong>stuff to be released</strong> within the <del>corpora</del> <strong>body</strong>. This pro-erection process is counter-balanced by an anti-erection effect from the <del>sympathetic nervous system</del> <strong>part of your nervous system that governs your feelings of arousal while awake</strong>. Normally, they cancel each other out. The <del>Sympathetic nervous system</del> <strong>awake part of your nervous system's</strong> activity dips in the small hours whilst you are asleep and the <del>parasympathetic</del> <strong>&quot;we're at rest, let's get a boner!&quot;</strong> effect 'wins'. Coupled with a normal <del>diurnal</del> <strong>daytime</strong> rise in <del>testosterone levels</del> <strong>man juice</strong>; you get a <del>stonking boner</del> <strong>stonking boner</strong>. </p>
