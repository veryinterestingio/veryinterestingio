			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm putting my vote in for that they don't have more, they are just easier to see because curly hair tends to do whatever it wants. With straight hair it's easy for the fine baby hairs to blend in with the rest since they are easier to manage and smooth in the same direction (especially when hair is pulled back). Curly hair goes wherever it wants and short curls, like with baby hair, stand out more around the face since they can't as easily be grouped and smoothed with the rest of the hair (again, especially when hair is pulled back). At least, as someone with wavy/curly hair, that's been my experience.</p></div>		</li>
