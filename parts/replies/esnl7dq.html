			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to be really careful with these studies of “epigenetic inheritance.” It is really easy to come up with these types of correlations and links that make buzzfeed type news articles with really no data. For example, there have been a number of studies in mice that show that certain environmental stimuli/stress can be passed on through generations. Typically these effects are really subtle, yet the media runs wild with the story. In a lot of these cases the studies can’t be replicate in different related animals (rats), or even in different mouse lines commonly used in labs. There is still a ton to learn about epigenetics, and while I do believe that epigenetic inheritance at some level contributes to who we are, the present studies should be talked about with caution.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically what I'm getting from all of this, is that humans' DNA is so complicated that we actually have some parts of our DNA that conflict/contradict other parts of our DNA?</p>
<p>So, throughout our species' history, we likely developed some traits that helped us survive in one particular situation, but maybe not in some others. Instead of &quot;re-writing&quot; that particular piece of DNA in order to adapt to that one particular situation, we basically had the trait that helped us survive added to our DNA along with the other DNA that allowed us to survive previously. Then, depending on the stressors we experience, that determines whether our body expresses the original DNA or if we express that adaptation that was made for that instance? And this likely repeated for several different types of situations/stressors/traits?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, there-about. But it's important to remember that evolution is not an intentional designer but more like an opportunistic scavenger: &quot;good enough for now&quot; is the underlying motto of biologic life. So even the same genes can do different things depending on how active they are.</p>
<p>A fun example of this &quot;double-duty&quot;: NF-kB, a protein that creates a bunch of harmful inflammation in diseases and is often the target of researched treatments...is also 100% necessary for promoting cell survival, at lower levels of activity. Turns out a LITTLE stress acts as a warning, prompting cells in the body to &quot;tough up&quot; (conceptually, like a vaccine) but TOO MUCH and things start to get disease-y.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But there are population studies that show real changes in humans due to environmental factors that get passed to their offspring, like that one town in Sweden that experienced a famine, and the people that were 9 at the time grew up and had children and grandchildren that had lower rates of heart disease than the surrounding towns that didn't experience a famine.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that those types of correlations exist, and they may in fact be due to epigenetic inheritance. However right know we have no idea if that is the case. For example, perhaps the individuals who were 9 at the time picked up lifestyle habits (e.g lean styles of eating) that they then passed on to their children while raising them. And the cycle repeats in the next generation. In my opinion that scenario is far more likely than a molecular memory being maintained, but more studies need to be done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe I heard about an issue with famine in the Polish population that resulted in a lot of fatter people.  As I understood it, the pregnant women during the time of the famine that were beyond a certain point in their pregnancies, so as to not cause a miscarriage, were not able to eat as much as they should and the result was that their children's bodies were prone to storing calories as fat.  I'm not 100% sure if this would be considered epigenetic or not but it seems to fall in line with my understanding of epigenetics, which is probably fundamentally flawed from my lack of education on the matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only those who were 9?</p>
<p>This is such a weirdly specific scenario I would actually bet dollars to donuts that there is no link at all, and the correlation in the data is completely by chance. Which, p-values being what they are, isn't really farfetched.</p>
<p>Do we see anything similar when we study the 9 year olds of other famines? What makes Sweden unique?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tried to come up with an analogy but it was weird so I'll just try to explain it in simpler, but non-analogy-y terms. </p>
<p>Think about the human body for a second. Think about how many different functions your body has to do every second of every day, and how well it performs in a healthy person. Think about how different a heart cell is from a liver cell, and how different each of those are from a bone cell. How can each type of cell - and there are <em>zillions</em> of types in your body - be made from the same starting material (your DNA)? </p>
<p>As I understand it, the answer is that each cell contains information (blueprints if you will, aka your DNA) to become <em>any</em> type of cell in your body, but almost all that information is repressed so that only one cellular identity is reached. It's what makes your liver cells liver cells and not lung cells, and why you don't have fragments of bone growing out of your skin or heart or kidneys. </p>
<p>The same idea applies to cells in response to an environmental challenge. If everything in your environment's hunky dory, things should stay on a pretty even keel, but when bad things happen (famine, psychological stress, etc.) things can get messed up in a hurry, and that probably happens primarily through epigenetics, as mentioned in this thread. Epigenetics is essentially &quot;turning genes on or off&quot; but it does nothing to change the gene itself, just how much or how little it is transcribed (produced). Through this process, genes can be intricately regulated without ever affecting the DNA sequence itself, so you're not changing the DNA template, you're changing what comes out of that DNA template, so to speak. </p>
<p>In the case of famine, there have been studies looking at famine-experienced people and their offspring. If I remember right, and it's been a few years since I saw this, but the offspring of famine-experienced people were wayyyy more likely to become obese throughout their lives, even though they ate the same food and did the same things as the previous generation. This falls in line with common sense that if a person experiences starvation, its body will kick up its &quot;starvation response&quot; (via epigenetics) so that it will be better equipped to handle starvation in the future. That trait got passed on to the kids in the next generation, even though there was no need for it because the famine had passed. Thus, the kids' generation ate normally and their bodies weren't properly adapted to handle that, and they got fat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our body has many responses to stressful scenarios, some behavioral and some physiological. I don't know the exact details about the epigenetic effects in the Jewish population that survived the holocaust but I can tell you about the results of two studies (I'm sorry I don't remember the papers but a person named Yehuda researched heavily on this topic :
Edit: clarifying my stance on (1) below:
(I don't want to imply that abuse is solely genetic or epigenetic, I just wanted to share this observation in the survivors which is primarily learned behavior)</p>
<p>1) Some people who survived holocaust developed PTSD and they had developed personality changes which resulted in them being physically abusive towards their children. Unfortunately, this behaviour was passed on to their children mainly in men where multiple generations of the survivors were physically abusive towards their children.
E: Also forgot to add that the offsprings of the survivors were more susceptible to PTSD as well.
2) This is a more interesting study, here researchers had exposed pregnant mice to stressors. So during stress the body releases chemicals called corticosteroids, in mice it's corticosterone (humans: cortisol) which help you fight or run (flight) and recover from injuries, etc. So these pregnant mice had high corticosterone (CORT) in their blood regularly and the embryos were exposed to this high levels and their bodies adapted as if these were normal baseline levels. After being born these baby mice had high CORT in normal baseline conditions. This meant that the mice had problems with their immune systems and they couldn't cope with stressful situations well, etc.</p>
<p>Bonus study info about epigenetics (really cool):
So these researchers exposed some mice to this chemical, some kind of ketone or alcohol or something which activated a very specific olfactory (smell) receptor (OR 151 of I remember). And everytime they exposed the mice to that smell they would electrocute the floor of this mouse cage. This is known as fear conditioning where you condition a mouse to fear a specific stimulus in this case the smell. And the these mice were bred and it was found that the offsprings of these mice had &quot;Hypomethylated&quot; (easily readable/ less coiled sort-of) genes for that specific olfactory receptor. This meant that the offsprings had more number of these specific olfactory receptors to identify the smell of this particular chemical to avoid being shocked.</p>
<p>It may sound kinda cruel but honestly scientifically speaking this is super awesome and innovative.</p>
<p>I am sorry if there are any typos (I'm using my mobile) and sorry I can't post references it was over a year ago when I read all these papers. Hope this helped a little.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your DNA is coiled around little protein balls called histones. Every time your DNA is used to make a protein (that's all it does BTW; tell your body how to make proteins) it gets uncoiled and recoiled. Genes that are rarely used slowly tighten up over time, and this causes them to need more stimulus to be expressed. Only after being repeatedly stimulated over a long time will they stay loose again.</p>
<p>This tight coiling can be passed on to the next generation. We call this epigenetics, or &quot;above genetics&quot; because it affects how your genes are expressed but not the actual content of your genome.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;survival of the fittest&quot; always applies. Fitness is determined by survival. Or really, survival to reproduction as that is all that is relevant for evolution. It doesn't matter how strong, healthy, smart or pretty you are, if you don't survive you aren't fittest.</p></div>		</li>
