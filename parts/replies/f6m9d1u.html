			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup.  So it would be completely blind.  Light canâ€™t penetrate more than a kilometer or so through crystal-clear water, never mind the substances that make up the cornea and vitreous humor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not very far, as almost every star would immediately collapse into a black hole at those densities, and the resulting radiation from all those simultaneous supernovae would probably cook the eyeball. Also if you shrunk the Earth to the size of an eyeball, it would be very difficult for everyone to stand on at once.</p>
<p>Hope this answers your question</p></div>		</li>

On a good night from a dark site, you can see galaxies millions of light years away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, if you scaled the universe down, you'd still have the same problem, since photons are now scaled down.</p>
<p>And presumably travelling slower.</p>
<p>Unless you mean like, selectively scale down only parts of the universe, but that seems arbitrary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that the opacity of the cornea would be a small problem compared to gravity causing the relatively delicate structures of the earth sized eyeball to collapse upon themselves into a tiny dense mass at the bottom of a deep ocean if we're considering this as a literal scaled up eye.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The interior of the eye is a gel-like substance, so it is pretty incompressible. You could think of the eye as a giant ball of water, and since water is much less dense than the earth, then it would hold its structure pretty well (and if my calculations are correct, the gravity at the surface of this 'eyeball earth' would be about one five-hundredth of earth's gravity).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this is ask science and scientific minds often ignore the obvious thing and go for the intricate details of the matter, but OP's question seems fairly obvious to me.  He's obviously asking us to scale human visual fidelity to astronomical scales without worrying about the physics of how things are working internally.  I may be totally wrong about my interpretation of the question and found your answer to be illuminating none-the-less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that I added my answer some 12 hours after what I thought was the main activity â€” some 200+ comments talking about long-baseline arrays and other telescope technology related to OPâ€™s question.  I seriously thought this discussion was dead, and I was just throwing in another note. ðŸ™‚</p></div>		</li>
