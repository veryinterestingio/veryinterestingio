<p>My friend in HS made a really goofy monkey face when playing the guitar, sometimes. Once we had sparked a joint and were ribbing each other, i brought that up, and he and another bud started laughing and then showed me a picture of myself, making the most ridiculous biting-lower-lip &quot;Dat ass&quot; face one could possibly make, bending a string an octave up. </p>
<p>Everyone makes some silly fuckin' faces playing instruments. I dare anyone who isn't a professional musician to not stick their tongue out the side of of their mouth while playing a difficult chord, hahahaha </p></div>		</li>
