			<div class="markdown"><p>His publication started a lot of activity, especially with the polymath8 project, on optimizing his work. He didn't bothered all too much about making his paper as optimal as possible given that the big step was to actually get a bound and given the notoriety of the problem a lot of people did some work on it. At the start some people were posting every day, or close to it, with small improvements on what he did.</p>
<p>The first version of the project ended up with a bound at 4,680 and a second version, with some new techniques, ended up up with a bound of 246. They also proved that this approach is insufficient to solve the conjecture as the best you could hope for would be a bound of 6.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A related topic is a curious concept called &quot;Ulam's Spiral&quot;. If you start writing all natural numbers in a spiral, and then color the squares that contain primes, like [this]( <a href="http://www.betweenartandscience.com/images/medium/square-spiral-illustration.png" target="_blank">http://www.betweenartandscience.com/images/medium/square-spiral-illustration.png</a>), you end up with a weird pattern where primes tend to form diagonal lines, but overall it mostly seems random: <a href="http://www.betweenartandscience.com/images/ulam_65Klikemaniac.gif" target="_blank">http://www.betweenartandscience.com/images/ulam_65Klikemaniac.gif</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had forgotten about that. I think I have heard about primes being talked about as quasi random. So the likely hood of primes around 5*7*11*!3*n is zero as the primer positions (6n plus and minus 1) around that number will be taken up by 5,7,11,13. So quasi random seems fitting to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, theres a rather simple proof to show that there are infinitely many prime numbers.</p>
<p>You actually do it by assuming the opposite. If there's a finite number of them, we can make a new prime number that's not in our finite set of primes. Since you can always make more, there must be infinitely many. </p>
<p>It's like asking you the biggest counting number. We can always just add one and get s bigger number, so there's no biggest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Various ways.</p>
<p>You could find an algorithm that explicitly gives you a next one given any of them. This is how we prove that there are infinitely many natural numbers: If n is natural, then so is n+1, so the only possibilities are 0 or infinitely many, and we know 1 is natural =&gt; infinite.</p>
<p>Another common way would be by contradiction: assume only finitely many, do a bunch of (possibly arcane) manipulations and derive a wrong result, e.g. &quot;0=1&quot;. Then you know the assumption was wrong. </p>
<p>The classic proof that there are infinitely many primes can be framed in both of these ways, which is neat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But for example how would you go about proving math problems like some of the ones mentioned in this thread? Like that number of 7s in Pi thing.
Doesn’t Pi go on forever meaning that there’s an infinite amount of 7s in Pi?</p></div>		</li>
