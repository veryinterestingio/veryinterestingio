			<div class="markdown"><p>The island may not even exist, and if it does, the name is a bit misleading to the layperson. The elements in an island of stability may be more stable relative to the elements around them, but it's likely we're still only talking a matter of seconds or milliseconds to decay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have threads about that in the FAQ. We have already produced the element with Z = 114, but only isotopes with too few neutrons to reach the island (N ~ 184).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, currently they have no use. However, each super-heavy element teaches us more and more about nuclear physics, unlock new mysteries, and we develop a lot of new technologies and theories to be able to synthesize them.  </p>
<p>These are all basic research, which currently has no use, but they give us a lot of insight how nature works, which, on the long run, could result in a lot of &quot;useful&quot; discovery. We have a lot of theories about the nuclear forces and rules which govern how and when atomic nuclei are stable - trying to synthesize superheavy elements are a great way to confirm their theories or falsify them if the new nuclei work differently than the theory predicted. This is the same basic research what we do in the LHC. Confirming and destroying theories as they generate more and more data, and opening new frontiers where theoretical physics can move on. It is useful right now? No. Just like electricity was a &quot;game&quot; back then when they discovered it, but every research brought us closer to what we have: where electricity is transformed and changed our whole world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly it, by observing how they behave and decay, we gain a better understanding of nuclear physics and chemistry. That alone is a big deal</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, in addition to what others have said about just understanding how atoms work, if the island of stability exists, yhere may be significantly stable things (more than minutes or days) there.  Who knows what we could learn about a completely new element that we can actually use.</p></div>		</li>
