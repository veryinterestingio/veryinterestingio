<p>So basically going up gradually doesnâ€™t get you the speed, and overall just end up burning up more fuel then just going straight up?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The trajectory vertical launches take are calculated to follow the optimal path in terms of fuel efficiency.
While the rocket is slow, it accelerates towards thinner air first and as it gets faster it does what is called a gravitational turn, e.g. it &quot;tips&quot; over towards its final orientation and gathers horizontal speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh okay gotcha.</p>
<p>Would you mind explaining the gravitational turn a bit more please?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the same way that hovering in place would use a lot of fuel with no benefit, going slower than you can also reduces fuel efficiency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you really want to try and get some questions answered hands-on like 'what happens if you just keep pointing the rocket straight up' and 'do we go straight down in order to return from orbit?' and 'Why cant we just return from space slowly in order to make it safer?'  I recommend trying out simulation games such as SimpleRockets 2 or the big one Kerbal Space Program.</p>
<p>These are things I always wondered about until I tried these games/sims.  You sometimes see these things done in fiction but the reasons they aren't done in real life are usually not explained.  Of course even these are not 100% accurate simulations but they are close enough to reality to illustrate why certain things do or don't work in real life.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Please note 1) I also recommend youtube 'how to' videos for doing things 'the right way' since NONE of this is intuitive even if you are a person who has studied college-level science and 2) these are best used as simulations and are -vastly- underdeveloped in terms of gameplay, dont expect a proper game experience</p></div>		</li>
