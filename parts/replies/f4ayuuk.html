			<div class="markdown"><p>There is very little evidence for consistent or widespread agriculture during the Younger Dryas. At the beginning of the Younger Dryas we actually see a downturn in the number of settlements in the Natufian period.</p>
<p>Significant evidence of agriculture doesn’t appear until the Neolithic Pre-Pottery B, at approximately 10,800 years ago, which is actually consistent with a period of warming in the Holocene.</p>
<p>The adoption of agriculture is a highly complex process and can’t really be attributed to a single climatic event (agriculture was invented independently multiple times and these do not always align with any significant climate event), or any single event really. There are likely many factors, including climatic events and availability of resources, population pressure, and social, ritual, and symbolic reasons that we can only guess at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With the discovery of Gobekli Tepe, we now know that permanent agricultural settlements date as far back as 14,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Edit: possibly only 12,000 years old, but that still puts it around the time of the Younger Dryas event.</p></div>		</li>
