			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two human influenza A strains today, and both originate from the 1918 strain. </p>
<p>There are also two influenza B strains, and those have nothing to do with the 1918 strain. </p>
<p>There are occasional animal influenza A viruses that jump into humans but don’t establish long term transmission, and most of those are also unrelated to 1918 - they are mostly avian viruses.  There are occasional swine viruses that jump into humans and many of those (in North America) have some relationship to 1918, though it may be complicated. </p>
<p>To be pedantic, all influenza viruses are related if you go far enough back (thousands of years to the common ancestor of influenza A and B, further for C, even further for influenza D, and I don’t know how far to find the common ancestor of the just-identified viruses of amphibians).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't really &quot;fit in&quot; with the flu viruses. Covid-19 is a relative of the coronavirus that caused the SARS outbreak of the early 2000s. Influenza viruses and Coronaviruses are not super closely related outside of being viruses.</p></div>		</li>
