			<div class="markdown"><p>A few months ago I was reading up on different biological processes and came across a video about how the heart develops in a fetus. It's unbelievable. Basically the body develops blood vessels, and then at a certain point the vessels just tangle themselves into a knot and that knot becomes your heart. It is absolutely incredible how this stuff works. </p>
<p>It's one of those things I'd love to understand better, but I probably won't. The best I can do is just sit in awe.</p></div>		</li>
