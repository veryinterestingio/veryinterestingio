			<div class="markdown"><p>Very far.  We've had fiber to the desktop as an option for decades, but there's almost no users of that; it's really only seen in niche areas.  The entire fiber plant is largely costly and easy to break, and most people never need the speed or other advantages offered by it.</p>
<p>To the server, on the other hand, is getting to be much more common.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fiber also really isn't flexible enough, physically, to be useful in the same situations as ethernet. We're never going to see fiber in laptops, for example, because if you need to move the laptop around you risk bending the cable either to the point light can't refract properly through it (and losing signal) or it breaks (and you lose signal). That's also a problem for desktops for most people, since you don't want to put the cable in a situation where it might have to move often (and potentially bend more than it should every time it moves). Fiber in servers is fine because the environment is well suited for having cables that can't move around much, and when they do move they move predictably.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't really believe that the minimum bend radius was a thing (that I would ever encountered) until I had to troubleshoot a crappy Internet connection: finally tracked it down to the face of the switch being too close to the rack door - when closed, the fiber was forced into a tighter curve.</p>
<p>90-degree SC (or SFPs) would be really cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it will be decades because you can go all the way up to 10gig (maybe more?) with copper on existing standards. The average person won’t need anywhere near that.</p>
<p>I’m still using 100mbps in key parts of my network and it’s more than adequate for what I do I would imagine most people are probably the same. The nerd in me wants to upgrade but I can’t justify spending the money.</p>
<p>In order for people to need &gt; 10gig at home there would need to be some new use case and internet speeds to match, even streaming video at 4K only takes ~25 mbps.</p></div>		</li>

<p>An 8 port 1gig switch is $20. No reason for your network to have any part of it restricted to 10/100.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But my point is it will make no difference 99% of the time since my internet is not that fast (which ties into my point that it will be a long time before we need &gt; 10G).</p>
<p>The only advantage would be faster access to the NAS which I seldom use. It’s dumb that the airport express doesn’t have gigabit, even at the time it should have given that its dual N.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>internet speeds of sub 100mbps are still common in many places. 100mb internally isnt a major bottleneck until the external connection breaches that for me for example, although i use full 1g everywhere on my equipment for internal use. Hell, 802.11 b/g can still be used quite well for me if i wanted. after all, with modern compression methods, a doubling or tripling of effective bandwidth is 600 mbps compared to what used to be.....</p></div>		</li>
