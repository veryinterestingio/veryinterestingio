			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah.  There’s a very large and direct bidirectional nerve path between the digestive tract and the brain.</p>
<p>They’ve even done studies that indictate that people with mid/high spinal cord injuries actually have less intense emotions, presumably because the feedback of the “gut feeling” isn’t there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this response is Psych 101, we have our autonomic nervous system which regulates many bodily functions. So, think of fight or flight response in an evolutionary context. In order to survive, your body would need to be ready to fight. Digestion is inhibited when the sympathetic kicks into gear from threatening stimuli. This is your body telling your intestines we got no time for food digestion right now, someones trying to fight me, we'll eat and sleep when I kill this mofo or after I run away from them really fast. So it is psychological, sure.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, if you put it that way. The problem is that a lot of people understand the words &quot;it is psychological&quot; as it is not actually happening but it is in their head. All of our actions are controlled and triggered by the brain. Consciously or subconsciously. But a lot of therapist/doctors would also say it is &quot;in your head&quot; which is awful. </p>
<p>Strong reaction like fear or excitement will cause a lot of changes in our system, and therefore it is not &quot;in our head&quot;. Different discussion is what triggers these reactions: for some is bungee jumping and for some is being close to the person they like.</p></div>		</li>
