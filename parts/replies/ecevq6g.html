			<div class="markdown"><p>Prop 13 had great marketing, and a lot of money behind it. That marketing really pushed the tale of elderly people getting pushed out of their homes due to rising property taxes. They used that point to pass a law that kept taxes low on non-primary properties as well as commercial properties. It took one sliver of the end results of Prop 13 and falsely presented it as the primary reason and desired result behind the law. Pretty well done actually. </p>
<p>Another impact of Prop 13 is that it keeps older people in larger homes, rather than allowing a natural migration to smaller housing after their children leave. Instead, moving to a smaller home creates a new tax burden greater than the benefits gained by living in a smaller and less expensive property. This further constricts the housing supply. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Re: prop 13–
And the parents can give the houses to their kids, heck, even the grandparents can give the house to their grandchildren, and they’re still locked into those low low property taxes. So grandma gives her home to her grandchild, let’s call her Kelsey, who’s earning $180k, but Kelsey is probably paying about $50/yr in property tax, while her next door neighbor pays $8000/yr.  (On top of that, Kelsey can then rent out the house at its current market value.)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I find the commercial property loophole even more egregious.  Why did they need to worry about their property tax to begin with?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating.  Thank you for the answer!  As someone eyeing moving to California in the next year, I believe we will be renting until this bubble pops and prices plummet to a local minimum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is it.</p>
<p>More broadly, bad zoning has kept housing supply growth much lower than population growth.</p>
<p>If you look at neighbourhoods built in the 1920s, you'll see small single family houses next to three story duplexes, next to small apartment buildings. Since then, there's been a tendency to only allow the least dense of these (single family), while restricting apartments to a few tall buildings downtown.</p>
<p>Lots of reasons for this. Fear of change. Racism or classism. A misguided sense that it will keep land values higher. </p></div>		</li>
