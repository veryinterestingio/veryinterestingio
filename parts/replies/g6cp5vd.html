			<div class="markdown"><p>It cooks faster on the outside, but not really well on the inside. Internally, temperature can only spread so fast through something. If you cook a steak at really high heat, you will end up with a burned outside and undercooked center.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife and I have a sous vide. It's nice to just throw stuff in a waterproof bag for a few hours and walk away. The main issue is after the food is cooked, it doesn't always look as good as it does from the stove. We have a kitchen blowtorch to help sear meat and such when it's needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many thanks. It sounds like it has an almost clinical process to the cooking - not immediately appetising, but worth a try</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Along with sous vide, BBQ/smoking food is another low and slow method. There is a ton of cooking that happens outside the range in question here but rarely do people want to wait a few hours or more to eat.</p>
<p>Edit: and a lot above 400 as well, almost all steak is done at higher, browning of meats is usually under high/medium high heat, anything brick oven is higher (think pizza), etc.</p></div>		</li>
