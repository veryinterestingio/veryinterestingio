			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also a larger temperature from common ambient we still consider the drink hot vs cool. If the ambient temperature is 25C  you body temperature is 37C so water 5C below ambient at 20C  might feel cold but water 5 degrees above at 30C  would not be considers warm but only lukewarm. </p>
<p>Coffee is often served at 70C so that is might be 45 degrees above ambient. Water cant be colder then 0 and a refrigerator stop at around 5C os it is only about 20 below ambient.   A temperature of 20 degrees above  at 45C is likely not hot enough to be considered a hot drink and that is the same difference as the min for a cold drink.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer. HOT has to be much hotter than COLD has to be colder than the ambient temperature. The rate of thermal exchange (assuming the same liquid in the same flask) will be identical.  </p>
<p>Essentially you are the variable here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thermal flow by conduction proportional to the difference in temperature. So a warm liquid that have a higher temperature difference then a cold will loose a degree in temperature faster then the cold will heat up. So 25C to 0C would have 1/3 of the thermal flow from 100C to 25C</p>
<p>In a thermos you have vacuum as a part of the isolation and then the only transfer of energy trough it is by radiation. The you have Stefan–Boltzmann law where black body radiation is the absolute temperature to the power of four. So the radiation from  the 25C  side to the  0C is 1.41 times as high but for 100C to 25C the radiation is 6.3 times higher. So the different for radiation coolie it twice the differens in conductive initially</p>
<p>So the hot water will drop a degree a lot faster then the cool will increase a degree.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rate of thermal exchange is not the same in both cases. The heat flux will be higher with a higher temperature difference. Q=mCpdT (simplest formula for heat flux) where dT is the temperature difference. A hot drink does actually change temperature faster if it is further from ambient temperature.</p>
<p>Edit: this is the reason you should wait a few minutes to put milk in your coffee if you like it cooler.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: I once got some liquid propane poured on me. Propane boils at -40c (and f) at 1 atmosphere. </p>
<p>It was just as bad as pouring boiling water on my hand and did about the same damage (hand was bright red for several days and just stung like crazy). -40c is 77C below body temp. Boiling water is 63C above body temp.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>also, ice.  Most of our experiential observations of this phenomenon are not based on a still glass of chilled water.  We put ice in the beverage, which requires an absurd amount of energy to change phases to liquid.</p>
<p>A hot beverage has no such opportunity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, you can add paraffin wax to hot drinks to get the same latent drink effect as the paraffin changes phases from liquid back to solid.  Of course it helps if you surround your paraffin in stainless steel so you don't contaminate your drink.  I signed up for the <a href="https://www.joulies.com/" target="_blank">Coffee Joulies</a> kickstarter based on this a few years back.</p>
<p>Edit: Now the site says it is an advanced phase change material.   I certainly assumed it was some food grade wax when I purchased as there would have been less hoops to go through with the FDA.</p></div>		</li>

<p>edit: Definitely a wax of some kind. I've had it leak. I think it's beeswax or paraffin, like you guessed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it this way.</p>
<p>Drinks are going to be above 0 degC, obviously. There's a fairly limited range in which you would consider a drink 'cold' before it is simply 'cool'.</p>
<p>Hot drinks could be all the way up to almost 100 degC. A bigger difference. You'd probably call a drink hot once it's 40 degC and above.</p>
<p>Temperature is related to how much energy a thing contains (vibrations or the molecules). Less energy = less heat = less temperature (generally). If you have two objects at the same temperature, but one is bigger than the other, the bigger object contains more heat energy. </p>
<p>Think of heat energy as a sideways distance between two objects, and temperature as the vertical distance between two objects. If they are on flat ground (same temperature), then there is no heat exchanged (no temperature change). If there is a small temperature difference (shallow slope) then there will be heat exchange, but only slowly (ball rolling down a shallow hill). If there is a big temeprature difference, then heat will be exchanged quickly (ball rolling down steep hill).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is in newtons law of cooling i think....
According to that the gradient depends on the surrounding temperature...
Larger the difference between the surrounding temperature and the temperature in the flask, faster is the rate of cooling</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rate of cooling decreases as the temperature decreases though. Imagine you have a cold drink starting at 0 vs one starting at 5, the one starting at 0 will stay cold longer than the other, even though it started with a faster rate of warming.</p></div>		</li>
