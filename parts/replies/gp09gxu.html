			<div class="markdown"><p>It is.  Orville Redenbacher called them old maids in at least some of his commercials.  I'm old, and that's what we called them when I was a kid.  </p>
<p>Not sure why it isn't getting used much any more, because microwave popcorn doesn't always pop 100%.  Then again, I only use my Whirley Pop popper, so maybe those bags pop all kernels nowadays.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly the trick to proper movie popcorn - the (ideally canola) oil should be just starting-smoking hot. We used to refer to it as 'surprising' the kernels - boiling the water content before the cooking and internal steam had a chance to weaken the shell. The stronger the shell, and more abrupt the rupture, the fluffier the popped kernels.</p>
<p>If you want caramel corn style 'brains' - the rounder kernels smoother kernels, it's a matter of heating the oil slowly with the kernels already in it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect. There are two types of popcorn: mushroom and butterfly. Butterfly is what is in microwave popcorn. Mushroom is what you see at county fairs when people make kettle corn. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah canola definitely taste better but I use olive oil because it's a little bit healthier the only trick with that is that you got to keep it below 350 because you don't want it smoking. I would definitely get better results with Canola though and maybe I'll try it sometime. for those uninitiated the canola oil would work better because you can get it to a hotter temperature without it smoking. This would make for better fluffier popcorn</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, olive oil is awesome, but I wouldn't recommend it anywhere that has to get truly hot, meaning it's not great for popcorn. It has such a low smoke temperature that it denatures and you lose a lot of the flavour (and I presume a lot of the reasons that it's 'better' for you).</p></div>		</li>
