I smash the two together so hard that they are essentially fused into one object, does that generate one of the gravitational hiccups, even a very small one?  Or does it have to be something more massive like neutron stars?  I've always seen gravity described like it's objects on a 2D rubber sheet, and the larger objects make a larger deformation in that sheet, are gravity waves something that are emitted whenever the mass of an object changes, or am I missing the ball here?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. Gravity is the weakest of the four forces but the one with the longest range.</p>
<p>It's also interesting that you can, for example, shield yourself from EM but not from gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be like turning on a tiny nightlight outdoors in arizona at noon and in direct sunlight.   You might not even tell it's lit up.   Or even your phone outside in direct sunlight when you cannot see the screen.  The phone is emitting light, but due to the fact it is surrounded by massively more powerful light, it is undetectable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Really, it's just an extremely small disturbance in the curvature of spacetime -- one which will slightly squish you one way, and slightly pull you apart the other way.  <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/GravitationalWave_PlusPolarization.gif" target="_blank">Wikipedia has a good animation</a>.  Keep in mind though that even for distant black holes merging, the scale of this disruption is incredibly tiny -- fractions of the size of an atom.  You wouldn't notice it in the slightest; it takes precisely-controlled, kilometers-long lasers reflected back and forth via mirrors just to detect the strongest of these disruptions.</p>

<p>Yes, but it would be so small that it would be undetectable with current technology.</p>

<p>The rubber sheet analogy, while easy to visualize, is actually very inaccurate and is unfortunately a poor way to understand gravity.</p>
<p>One visualization along these lines of how a gravitational wave is produced by two co-rotating masses would be <a href="https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*udb70Lr_QSwNm_z1InG2sA.gif" target="_blank">like this</a>.  It's really not the best, but it gives you a sort of idea of what's happening.  If you had something like two heavy balls on a large enough trampoline, you could reproduce waves in the curvature of the trampoline similar to gravitational waves.</p>
<p>Hope that helps,</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude that animation was awesome. I see gravity visualize like this all the time, but wouldn't it be in a more 3D scale? I assume it's just easier to see if the waves were on a plane, but wouldn't those waves more realistically shoot out everywhere in all axis? Or is the way the two masses are rotating around each other making it go off in that sorta of flat wave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What generates the wave? Is it the the rotation around the common axis? Or is it the merging? Do we detect the waves using the doppler effect?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, expanding on what rtmoose said, there was an event where two black holes that were ~30 <em>solar</em> masses each colliding together... the effect it had on earth was a mirror moving a <em>fraction</em> of a proton radius. </p>
<p>One way we put it is that spacetime is <em>very</em> stiff. So it takes inordinate amounts of energy to make it warp and vibrate. </p>
<p>To demonstrate the weakness of gravity, you can literally jump up <em>against</em> gravity with very minimal energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It blew my mind when I realized how weak gravity is. </p>
<p>Your refrigerator magnet defeats gravity. That's how weak it is. And that's the force of a PLANET pulling down on the magnet. Yet it sticks to the fridge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard this before, but it doesn't blow me away. I mean, I put a thin piece of cardboard between the magnet and my fridge and *clink*..gravity wins, pulling the magnet down to the floor. And it's not like fridge magnets from across the globe are all flinging themselves to my refrigerator. The things have to be an inch away to have any pull. Two inches away? Gravity wins again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, gravitational waves undergo Doppler shifts. This is why the gravitational waves from the early universe are hard to detect (they are redshifted by the same process that redshifts the CMB).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't the thing that redshifts the CMB not due to the expansion of space? Can that
still be qualified as the Doppler effect?</p>
<p>If so, I have a tough time agreeing with that, in my mind the Doppler effect is due to differences in velocity, not due to the expansion of the medium in between. For example, it's theoretically possible for an object to be moving <em>towards us</em> but still have their waves redshifted by expanding space.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Would expansion of the universe not affect this? If the observable universe if a strict subset of the whole universe because the light outside the observable universe will never reach us, wouldn't that imply that its gravity also doesn't attract us?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The range of gravity is infinite <em>in principle</em>. However, all information propagation in the universe can happen no faster than the speed of light (which really should be called the speed of causality) and that includes the influence of gravity.  If there's a portion of the universe receding from us faster than the speed of light, then its influence can never reach us.</p></div>		</li>
