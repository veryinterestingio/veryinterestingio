			<div class="markdown"><p>Dear Lord, my nephew refers to both his mom and milk as 'mama.' She thought it was funny that combining the terms to him basically means 'boob.' I never stopped to think that the way the a baby nurses is basically just mouthing 'mama.'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For my daughter, mama is also a verb that means &quot;to be picked up&quot;. Whenever she wanted to be picked up my wife would say &quot;do you want mama&quot; so whenever she wants anybody to pick her up she'll run up to them and shout &quot;mama!&quot; with her arms out</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My son will be 2 in a few days and he still calls food “mama” sometimes. Like if he’s hungry and we sit him in his high chair he’ll get excited and say “mama!” He mostly calls me Mommy now though, occasionally Mom. Lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm fairly certain &quot;dada&quot; and &quot;dad&quot;  for father are for the same reason. My son was saying &quot;dad&quot;, &quot;dada&quot; and &quot;dadadadadadada&quot; for months before he started to use it as a name for me. </p>
<p>Don't know if it matters or what it means but he also is saying an approximation of his own name (he says &quot;dack&quot; instead of jack). This and dad are his two first words. I'm pretty sure he's going to learn to say &quot;more&quot; and &quot;no&quot; before he gets around to saying &quot;mama&quot; (tbh that's her own fault because those are the two words she says or asks of him the most. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My kid (17 months) says “dada” for both mama and dada lol. I know it’s intentional because I will say “can you say, Mama?” And she’ll say “dada” in reply. It’s hilarious. My husband jokingly acts all smug that she only says “dada” but I know she means mama! She’s just bad at pronouncing it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad to hear of another baby who doesn't say mama! My 15 month old says &quot;daddy&quot; perfectly but can't say &quot;mama&quot;. When we ask her to say mama she says the word for her grandpa (&quot;papou!&quot;). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My boys both started with dada for everything. Mom was very upset. LoL. My daughter currently uses mama for everything. She's at 17 months now and send to understand everything we say. Will do most things you all get to do, or runs and hides for the others. But the babbling is the greatest. I want to record it and use it for my ringtone later in life when she gets a phone</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My toddler did this, but I think it’s because her mom praised her every time she said it. Even if I was trying to get her to say other words. So I have a video of her saying mamamamamama when I’m asking for dada haha</p></div>		</li>
