			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, you could use toxin or poison in an ELI5.</p>
<p>Some of the products that bacteria produce are poisonous to us and can make us extremely ill very fast. Heating the poison up does nothing.</p>
<p>If you don't cook a frozen turkey properly, you warm the inside, allow bacteria to grow rapidly at a warm temperature for an extended period of time, they produce dangerous levels of poison and then, even if you cook the turkey until it is hot throughout, it can still make you extremely ill. By contrast, if you were to defrost the turkey in the fridge, at no point during defrosting does it reach an ideal temperature for bacterial reproduction. Then, when you cook it in the oven, it cooks more evenly throughout without giving the bacteria a chance to poison the food.</p></div>		</li>

I told them because of the poop as poop may have all sort of chemicals which may make our stomach go bad. I was making it up as I was going along. But til it could be true.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is cauliflower with visible larva a common occurrence where you live? I suddenly feel very spoiled and sheltered by the food distribution system infrastructure where I live.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It used to be. Now instead of the larva, it's full of banned pesticides and stuff. So we wish one or two larvas to be found so that we can be sure it didn't have as many pesticides in it lol.</p></div>		</li>
