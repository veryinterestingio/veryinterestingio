<p>Here’s the quick quote about the biggest study discussed..</p>
<p>The first study, published June 16 on the preprint server medRxiv, screened for antibodies in almost 1,500 coronavirus patients in Wuhan, China. The researchers compared their levels to three other groups: nearly 20,000 members of the general population; more than 1,600 patients hospitalized for reasons other than COVID-19; and more than 3,800 medical workers, whom the authors assumed had “inevitably” been exposed to the virus in its early days, meaning they should have developed antibodies.</p>
<p>They found that while almost 90 percent of COVID-19 patients had antibodies, roughly 1 percent to 5 percent of individuals in the others groups had them as well. The authors conclude in their paper that the remaining 10 percent of infected patients with no detectable antibodies, combined with the lack of antibodies in healthcare workers, suggest that “after SARS-CoV-2 infection, people are unlikely to produce long-lasting protective antibodies against this virus.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's what a don't get about these studies. Your body doesn't keep antibodies for long from any infection. They keep memory cells which allow more antibodies to be created in case of reinfection, making it so the virus is taken care of before symptoms even arise. I don't know how they're assuming covid immunity lasts any amount of time without confirmed long term reinfection rates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct, it's meaningless.  </p>
<p>It reminds me of the countless reports of detected viral RNA snippets after infection has resolved and speculation about &quot;reinfection&quot; and worse.</p>
<p>People need to be extra-careful with unpublished, non-peer-reviewed studies like the one cited above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Antibodies have a half-life of 21 days and all the B-cells don't immediately die overnight, and either way antibodies levels for many other infections are typically sustained for months to years. Maybe seasonal coronaviruses are more like 6-12 months, but SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV antibodies lasted 2-3 and 3-5 years before beginning to decline. The study that inferred short-term immunity from HCWs found robust antibody responses in confirmed patients and the rest was literally misinformation. You can split hairs on semantics and I'm not saying it was a political thing, but it was essentially a lie. The other nature paper finding this did not measure titres instead opting for a non-standard method and its findings in a small group conflict with larger studies measuring titres.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These studies don't show that immunity only lasts 3 months. They show that your body only actively makes antibodies against COVID for a few months. I would look into those studies themselves - there are several problems: </p>
<p>1) In the media, there is confusion between having high antibody titers and protective immunity. There are several steps between having immunity and having a high level of antibodies in the blood. After your active infection period, there isn't a huge reason to continually spend resources to make antibodies by the plasma cells. Unless you are continually exposed and need the standing antibodies to fight off the virus each time it enters your body. But if you don't, then those plasma cells don't necessarily have to stick around. The T-cell dependent B cell response also produces memory B cells, which are your immunologic memory to the infection and, even if there are a few antibodies to COVID in your blood, will reactivate upon reexposure, proliferate, and differentiate into plasma cells that begin to mass-produce antibodies again. So some immune responses actually cause few antibody-producing cells to stick around but you might only need those few to provide some immunity as your system revs up again. We don't know what the minimum titer level is for COVID yet. It's actually quite common for other viruses too that when we check titers, they're sometimes low and we'll give boosters. It doesn't mean that you're not immune.</p>
<p>2) Immunity isn't only provided by antibodies, especially for viruses. The cytotoxic T cell response is also important, which kills cells that are infected by virus. This prevents viral replication and transmission to other cells. This is not measured by antibody titers. It's unclear how long this response persists or to what extent it helps defend against getting COVID again. </p>
<p>3) So basically, you have 10% of COVID patients who probably have low titers. But what was the sensitivity of the test for detecting titers? Since we don't know what level is protective at this stage, it's incredibly difficult to make any sense of this data. The key question now is, so what? Does that mean that these patients won't mass-produce neutralizing antibodies upon rechallenge? </p>
<p>4) I would want to know more about those COVID patients they tested who didn't have detectable titers. Did they have any immunodeficiency syndromes or immuno-insufficiencies such as malignancies where you wouldn't expect them to have a robust response to begin with? </p>
<p>5) And finally, I find it highly misleading for them to simply &quot;assume&quot; that all healthcare workers should have been exposed. There are many factors between taking care of someone with COVID to actually producing antibodies against it yourself. That is, the virus actually has to get into your body, which isn't a sure thing even without any PPE. So that number is highly suspect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a question and I don't really know how to word it. Let's say I already had the virus and developed immunity. If I was exposed again and my body fought it off without any symptoms of infection, would I be contagious at that time?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p></div>		</li>
