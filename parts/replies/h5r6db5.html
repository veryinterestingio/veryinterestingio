			<div class="markdown"><p>The presence of bacteria is not the same as an infection. Just like we have helpful bacteria in our gut, we have helpful bacteria on our skin. These bacteria do a whole bunch of different things, but one of the main things they do is just take up space, meaning harmful bacteria have to compete with them for resources.</p>
<p>Harmful bacteria are those that release subtances that harm or irritate our skin, or those that try and actually attack the skin itself instead of happily living off dead skin/oils etc. When this happens, the area around the pore gets inflamed - which is just blood vessels swelling so more of our immune system can come and defend us. This is what makes pimples swollen and red.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bacteria is also just one part of the equation. I doubt superglue even has molecules small enough to actually penetrate the skin, which is what needs to happen to “clog” pores. This is why something like Vaseline isn’t considered comedogenic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll say, fighting off folliculitis infections the longest I've gone without them was when I was cuddled up all over the bacteria of a bed partner. Not sure why my own body can't seem to balance it out right properly, but a little post-sexytimes cuddling seemed like the best medicine.</p></div>		</li>
