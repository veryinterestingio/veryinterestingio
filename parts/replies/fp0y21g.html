			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish my subconscious could be conscious for one day and write a long ass report about all the stuff I missed to my conscious mind throughout the years </p>
<p>Reminds me of when the left and right brains gave different answers to people who had the wires crossed or something like that?</p>
<p>e: Also this video visualises exactly what I meant <a href="https://youtu.be/ZMLzP1VCANo" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/ZMLzP1VCANo</a> and may have been the same one I watched back in highschool</p>
<p>thanks for the recommendations of narcotics guys but it's illegal so no thank youuuu maybe once it's legal I appreciate it tho!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/12/12/magic-mushrooms-are-narcotics-police.html" target="_blank">Magic mushrooms count as narcotics guys </a></p>
<p>Also if any of you ever come to Indonesia don't smuggle or deal narcotics. You get the death punishment. Consumption is up to 20 years of jail time and a bunch of fees. Still a hard pass from me. Fear regime worked on me, pardon my prior comments about direct death for consumption, that's wrong but also has been hammered into me since I was a kid haha </p>
<p>This is your friendly public announcement, I've replied to dozens of your comments suggesting it more than once even after this edit staph it</p>
<p>Also yeah regarding og comment I meant about subconscious and conscious communicating - my memory of highschool is real bad I meant when right and left is severed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/galfov/-/fp1ossa" target="_blank">AiSard's comment got it </a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you mean for the people who've had the connection between the two sides of their brain severed?</p>
<p>Their two hands would write down different answers to personal question, and had no awareness of what the other eye could see etc. Freaky stuff.</p>
<p>I remember going down a deep dive after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfYbgdo8e-8" target="_blank">CGPGrey</a> covered it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You will probably find it's incredibly racist and focused on simple pleasures (sex, food, drugs) </p>
<p>The subconscious is an incredible association machine. It will see pattern and connection not too dissimilar to machine learning. While those bellow mentioning LSD it's only partly true, as LSD shuts down some parts of your brain forcing  information processing to go through parts that it usually does not go to. If you want to see something trippy look up googles deep dream images and compare it to LSD visuals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah yes when the two hemispheres of the brains are separated, through each eye you can deliver separate messages the other half of the brain doesn't know about. So for instance you can instruct someone &quot;go get a glass of water&quot; through one eye and then ask the other eye why they got up to get it and instead of saying &quot;I have no idea&quot; they'll say &quot;i was thirsty.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
