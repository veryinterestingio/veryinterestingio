			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, that's basically it.  They will keep making honey as long as there is nectar available for them to use.</p>
<p>I think bees can actually produce too much honey (certainly in the slatted moveable-type hives that beekeepers use), and this can lead to other issues within the hive.  Not a beekeeper, so maybe someone can confirm and elaborate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bee keeper checking in... This is called &quot;honey bound&quot; and can be deadly to a hive since they may try to swarm due to lack of space in the hive. Swarming is meant to occur in spring/summer only. If they swarm too late in the season the swarm can die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not like beekeepers let their bees die in the winter. That would be devastating for the business. They leave enough honey for the bees to survive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We also feed them to ensure they can last the winter.</p>
<p>Keeping even one hive is no joke, you've got hive beetles, varoa mites, chalk brood, wax moths, ants, mice, birds, and viral infections to contend with all the while trying to balance honey harvest with winter survival. Certainly not an activity for the wonton hipster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wild hives have to stockpile. Kept hives have humans to make sure they are safe. Beekeepers know exactly when to take, and how much. If the hive runs low, they arevfed pollen, sugar syrups, or other things to make sure they are safe.</p></div>		</li>
