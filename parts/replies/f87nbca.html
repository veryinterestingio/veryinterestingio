			<div class="markdown"><p>A good way to visualize this is to cut the earth into 8ths.  Cut it in half at the equator, then cut the northern and southern hemispheres in half, then cut each quarter in half again.    The surface area of each of those 8 pieces will be 1/8 the surface area of earth, and each one will have three 90* angles on the surface.  You could trace that piece out by leaving the north pole, making a 90* turn when you hit the equator, flying 1/4 the circumference of the the earth then making another 90* turn back to the north pole.  When you arrive at the north pole you will make a 90* angle from your departing line.</p></div>		</li>

<ul>
<li>Start at the equator facing north</li>
<li>Walk until you’re at the North Pole</li>
<li>Turn 90° left. You’re facing south now, so walk until you’re back on the equator. You’ll be 1/4 of the way around the globe.</li>
<li>Turn 90° left again and walk back to the starting point.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can translate that triangle all around if you want to.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Aren't you always facing south at the North Pole?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always feel like these examples don't emphasize those locations strongly enough, the equator and one of the poles. Eights of a globe is harder to translate than quarters of a circle. If you look down on a globe, the pole is the center and the equator is a circle. Walk the equator 1/4 of the way, turn 90deg, walk to the pole. At the pole, turn 90deg and walk a chord back out to the circle.</p>
<p>1/8 of a globe is like cutting an orange in half, then laying it flat, and &quot;X&quot; cutting it into quarters. That's what an eight looks like in this context, not a full orange slice from pole to pole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. The geometry is always non euclidian, euclidian geometry is just <em>close enough</em> to be useful at certain scales for certain applications that concern measurements of parts of the earth.</p>
<p>So the answer to the question is, functionally, &quot;when the degree to which it is wrong becomes practically relevant.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>So what we think of as a straight line, isn't straight in spherical geometry! </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, essentially.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Assume for the simplicity of explanation that the Earth is a perfect sphere. Now imagine drawing a genuinely straight line between two points on Earth (let's call them A &amp; B). This would have to be a tunnel through the planet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When we're constrained to travel on the surface on the Earth, we cannot possibly travel in a conventional straight line. What we can do is the spherical equivalent which is the path of minimum distance between those A &amp; B, which is along the &quot;great circle&quot; through A &amp; B. This is the circle whose centre is at the centre of the Earth that passes through A &amp; B.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great circles differ from straight lines in one important way. If two straight lines start off parallel, they remain parallel for ever but can never cross. This isn't true of great circles; for example the great circle through London and the North Pole will be parallel to the great circle through Moscow and the North Pole at the equator, but they will intersect at the North Pole.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's this difference that makes spherical geometry non-Euclidian. A Euclidian geometry is one where parallel lines always the same distance apart, which was one of the key axioms proposed by Euclid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A sphere is just the simplest example of a non-Euclidian geometry. There's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry" target="_blank">all sorts of other cases</a> as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The generalised version of a straight line that works in a non-Euclidian geometry is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic" target="_blank">geodesic</a>. </p>
</li>
<li>There's an even simpler example of the difference between great circles and straight lines than your three 90 degree turns example. If you simply keep sailing along a great circle you'll eventually end up back where you started. That would never happen on a plane.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the surface of the Earth is spherical, so what do you even mean by &quot;straight lines to us&quot;? If you mean a straight line on a map of the local area, then that line is straight only as it appears on the map. But the actual path on Earth is always curved.</p>
<p>Straight line segments in Euclidean geometry are those paths that pass through two given points and have <em>minimum distance</em>. In non-Euclidean geometry, we generally call such paths &quot;geodesics&quot;. On a sphere, that path that passes through two given points and has minimum distance is an arc of a great circle.</p></div>		</li>
