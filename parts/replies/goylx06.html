			<div class="markdown"><p>doesnt really explain the status quo though. there is much more music produced overall and still you can get everything everywhere, while it's rare to get the same movie on two or more platforms. it gets much more obvious once you go to tv serials. they are dirt cheap to produce (except some very few ridiculous actor wages) and yet they are possibly even more exclusive when it comes to older shows.</p>
<p>really, though, this doesnt bother me at all because i pirate my movies if they cant get them to me in a handy way, just like i used to borrow my friends' video cassettes back in the day because it was hard to buy anything older than a few months or years (if you're lucky and eg a high budget movie bombed)</p>
<p>ps: and before anyone comes nagging, no, piracy is the exact same thing as borrowing something from a friend when it comes to intellectual property. you see something that has almost no material value, only intellectual, without paying the author for it. but it's ok if you do it physically and evil when you do it with computers because boomers cant understand them and everything new is spooky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean theoretically it is the same thing as borrowing from a friend just like you describe it. But there definitely is some real difference between them. The effort it takes to download something is so much less than borrowing from a friend and the selection becomes gigantic as you can borrow from anyone around the world. There is a real difference between someone in every social circle needing to buy a legitimate copy or only one person in the world. </p>
<p>Now that doesn't mean I am fully opposed to pirating, I just can't buy your argument and to me it is an easy way of excusing yourself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's absolutely the same thing. how many facebook friends do you have? how many other internet friends do you have? surely most people have hundreds.</p>
<p>now let's assume there is no such thing as large scale file sharing, only emails can be written. you can absolutely scan your book with an efficient machine and send it to your facebook friends hundreds of times. i myself am a big time pirate and have never shared the same file more than 20 times. we could absolutely share the same book dozens and hundreds of times physically aswell, that's literally what libraries do.</p>
<p>so no, it's totally the same, just performed more efficiently. saying piracy isnt the same as lending your book is like saying writing a book with a type writer, your computer, by hand on paper or even with a bird's feather and old timey ink arent the same. it 100% is, one is just more efficient than the other.</p>
<p>and in case you're a secret amish person or ludite that has a problem with efficiency (which is a real thing and i'm not shaming you here, just pointing out the flaws of this idea), then you'd have to do this with all kinds of things in life:</p>
<p>eg tractors for farming vs scythes vs sickles vs picking everything by hand</p>
<p>or doing maths by using computers vs simple calculators vs abacus vs using your fingers vs using only your mind</p>
<p>or trading via container ships vs cargo planes vs lorries vs horse waggons vs hand carts vs wheelbarrows vs baskets vs carrying your stuff from town to town in your bare hands</p>
<p>or sending a message via wifi to the ISS vs telephone/tv cable vs radio vs letter sent by modern post in trucks vs waggons drawn by horses vs a single messenger on horseback vs you having to walk all the way.</p>
<p>as you can see i can go on for a long ass time and it's clearly not about the technology behind it but how you use it. i dont think it's perfectly fine if you believe that piracy should be banned and long prison sentences should be used against people caught doing it, but then you need to do the same thing with ALL intellectual property. if you give all your old dvd's to your little cousin, you're done. if you borrow someone's game for a while, you'll get into trouble. libraries would be outragously expensive to use, when they're usually free nowadays and supported by the state, actually, so quite the opposite of illegal. if you copy someone else's homework, you'll get into REAL trouble, not just your teacher. if you do the same thing with your doctor's work, or even just master's or bachelor, you're looking at prison sentences in no time and highly influential people get caught all the time.</p>
<p>trust me, the two are the same and you dont want either to be illegal. the exchange of ideas is what got us to where we are now, the censorship of ideas is what caused the dark age and countless wars.</p></div>		</li>
