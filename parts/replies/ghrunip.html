			<div class="markdown"><p>But how are eyes able to see such colors? I thought we “simulate” colors with RGB by stimulating the receptors in the eye in the same way an actual color would do. So if a Prussian Blue has (made up numbers) 70% stimulation of S cones and 10% of L and M each, why can’t we do the same with RGB LEDs?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>RGB LEDs aren't pure enough to begin with, blue is emitting too much non blue. And your L M and S cones don't fit perfectly with RGB as they are overlapping and disformed curves. The S is also way different than the L and M, that almost overlap. Our eyes just aren't as simple as RGB, although RGB is a very good approximation for most things we see. There's no way to excite certain combinations of the cones with an RBG display, which is exactly what the diagram is showing. There is no way to get the combination that rainbow green or rainbow violet trigger with an RGB display. Those areas outside the colour gamut are just excitation combinations that aren't possible, although the diagram isn't that helpful being shown on an RGB display. </p>
<p>With printing, cyan yellow magenta is the base. But it makes a shitty black, so we actually use CYMB. Four primary colours. High quality printing though might use even more inks. With various inks, you could reach the same extreme chromas. </p>
<p>The same could be said for a display. We could use RGBCYM and put a pentagon with way more coverage in that colours space. However, we're now looking at 6 bytes per pixel rather than 3. More if you want to increase the bit depth from 8 to 10 like some HDR displays do as well. We're over doubling the demands of an image now, for marginal gains of slightly better colours. Most all images will still be RGB too, so you're not going to get full use of it most of the time. I imagine at some point we might increase the number of primary colours in digital images, digital cameras, and displays. Perhaps after we're done with the 4K and 8K and hit a complete wall of resolution so start throwing display manufacturing costs, memory and bandwidth, and processing power elsewhere. </p>
<p>We could also get higher quality RGB pixels. One that are more pure, higher chroma and push them more to the edges, increase the triangle size and making some better pure colours. This actually occurs, some TVs do this which is why they look better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So this is the spectrum of the color (Prussian Blue) we try to reproduce:

<p>This is what our cones are sensitive to:

<p>This is an RGB LED’s spectrum:

<p>Is the problem simply that a blue LED (at ~460nm wavelength) excites the M and L cones too much? Why are we not using a shorter wavelength?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that partial reason is that your eyes don't perceive rgb, but rather blue, green and yellow. Plus, cone cells' response might also differ depending on amount of photons received, and display.. well, rgb.
Correct me if i am wrong, please.</p></div>		</li>
