<p>As per the fake passports, Canada used to accept <em>baptismal certificates</em> as proof of citizenship.  If you’ve ever seen them they aren’t that fancy and have little to no security features.</p>
<p>I think it was Ahmed Ressam who did that.</p>

<p>Yup.  Stole a blank certificate and wrote in his name.  Boom.  Brand new identity and a Canadian passport that gets him into most countries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't really need to go as far as stealing a blank. Blanks are bad. You need to match the color of ink, you have to know the name of person who filled them in, match his hand. Then they are uncoverable easily, since they are not backed by any paper trail. Everything that is ever issued comes with a record in a paper book. Papers books are nice because you can't really add a new backdated record in between records 203 and 204.</p>
<p>What one needs is legit issued birth certificate with somebody's name and then impersonate them. It would be backed by a paper trail in the place of issue, it would have all security features, right color of ink, numbers and everything. Birth certificates establish the existence of identity but are not bound to what the person bearing this identity looks like.</p>
<p>So when you have birth certificate -- the next step is to use it in a place or in a way that doesn't cross-reference the principal document establishing identity with identifying documents, like driver licenses, security numbers and passports. You just need someone to put a stamp on a piece of plastic with your photo and that identity. Boom.</p>
<p>That won't fly in most cases if the person is alive and well and has issued an id for himself and there is a way to crossreference two issued ids with each other. But if the person moved states, countries or just died -- you hit a jack pot.</p>
<p>Also having principal document is sometimes one step too far as well. In some cases all that you need is two sworn witnesses and a story involving some kind of unfortunate place, like Syria, occupied territories in the East or Crimea or whatever else. Or sometimes just a story.</p></div>		</li>
