			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to be pedantic, but the R0 does not change as it is the replication rate absent of any intervention or immunity in the population.  R0 is of a measure of a pathogen's intrinsic contagiousness.  Re or Rt is the &quot;live&quot; reproduction rate.</p>
<p>Generally, Re = R0 (1 - Pi) where Pi is equal to the percentage of the population which is immune.  So, using the 90% efficacy you could theoretically back into the Re of &lt;1 which would indicate that the infections numbers should decline.  This again is absent any interventions though.</p>
<p>Using a R0 estimate of 2.65 and the 90% efficacy, you would need to have over 69.2% or greater of the population be immune to reduce the Re to less than one.  </p>
<p>This basic analysis ignores interventions like social distancing, masks, etc and also ignores mutations and if the pathogen can reinfect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, R0 is more complicated than that. The number of people each person infects is affected by immunity, people's behavior, and public health measures. For example, if you can quickly identify and isolate people with the infection, you can also reduce the R0. This is why masking, testing, and contact tracing will still be important once a vaccine is deployed, even if it has widespread adoption.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>R0 is actually less complicated. R0 is a value intrinsic to the pathogen itself, it never changes (the 0 indicates the beginning of the timeline or t = 0). </p>
<p>R on the other hand will change, over time as more people become affected/immune and as interventions like distancing, masks and vaccines are implemented.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless the vaccine is a choice? Or are there not enough anti-vax people to influence the percentages?</p>
<p>Edit: downvoted for asking a question.. </p>
<p>I think i was misunderstood. I meant that if enough people didn't take the vaccin, would the 90% still be high enough? On a population basis. Say 70% takes the vaccin, with 90% effectiveness, only 63% would be effectively vaccinated. Would that be enough? </p>
<p>In essence, could anti-vaxxers screw this up for the rest?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems if the vaccine is a choice, it won't only be the anti-vaxxers who won't get it. Take the annual flu vaccine for example. Plenty of pro-vaxxers don't bother getting it. </p>
<p>To measure the impact of any vaccine on a population, one would have to consider the policy under which it's administered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure I'm following...but yeah of course on the whole population scale, the efficacy of a vaccine is only as good as the vaccination coverage. All the recent measles outbreaks have been caused by a decrease in the coverage because of communities of unvaccinated people. If I remember correctly, the herd immunity for measles is reached at around 90%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 85-95% rate is about the community that take the vaccine. Not everyone who gets the vaccine will actually develop immunity (just like you can get a virus and not develop immunity). Each vaccine also has a population uptake requirement to reduce the spread significantly. When that uptake drops below the threshold, infections can spike as has been seen as a result of the anti-vax movement with Measles in the US</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 85-95% is the average efficacy of the vaccine, based on large sample studies. It means for any person taking it, there are between 85-95% chances the vaccine will provide adequate protection. That of course translates to the population scale.</p></div>		</li>
