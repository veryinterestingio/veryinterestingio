			<div class="markdown"><p>Because there is not a single perfect technique, we use multiple approaches. Some of them are complementary, which is good as it allows us to cross-validate our observations when. For example, we need to quantify how many CD8 T cells reside in a given part of the small intestine. One approach consists of surgically resecting the intestine area, meshing all cells into a mixture until we obtain a single cell suspension, then we pass them through a machine that recognizes and counts our cells of interest via antibody-mediated labeling. This is known as fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). This approach provides a pretty accurate answer, but it has the caveat that it does not account for the potential loss of cells due to manipulating the tissue. Thus, a complementary approach consists of sectioning the intestine into very thin slices (which preserves the architecture of the tissue), which can be mounted on glass slides to perform histology, allowing us to see the cells of interest in their native environment (looking at them through a microscope). The caveat to this second approach (histology) is that it is less quantitative and only allows to survey a relatively small area. In addition to these techniques, we also isolate CD8 T cells from tissues and grow them on a petri-dish, where we can manipulate them in many different ways, and test their function on the petri dish, or transfer them back into an animal for further experiments.</p></div>		</li>
