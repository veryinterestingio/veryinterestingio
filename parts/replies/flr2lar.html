			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Stress causes different hormones to be released than exercise does. Cortisol is released with stress, and through some complex interactions can put you at risk for heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, weakened immune response, and since it messes with your fight out flight response can also lead to either depression, or aggression.</p>
<p>Exercise on the other hand releases endorphins, which are feel good chemicals that act kind of like natural pain killers, and can feel euphoric even. Along with the positive chemicals exercise can reduce stress, and feelings of anxiety/depression, boost self esteem, help us sleep better, and physically you are also strengthening your heart, lowering your blood pressure, increase your energy levels, improves muscle and bone structure, helps you lose fat, and improves you self image as you look fitter and healthier.</p>
<p>Basically one will kill you. The other will help you feel better, and likely live longer, and have an improved quality of life.</p></div>		</li>
