			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you over rest? I.e. I’m 20 y/o and have been lifting for roughly a year. I started at 180 and I’ve plateau at 205 (I’m 6’6 btw, so I’m not jacked just averaged size) and I’m on winter break and sleep like 12 hours a day haha. I eat a lot and sleep a lot but just can’t gain anymore weight. Can excess sleeping be detrimental </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No you might need to eat more. Way more. And take a look at how you do the exercises, work on doing to exercise better and more controllable.</p>
<p>Finally training in the beginning gives a huge increase in strength which tapers off later on. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With your age, weight and height, (and assuming you exercise 6 days a week) you need over 3500 calories <em>just to maintain</em> weight. I can almost guarantee that you're not eating enough and that you'd start gaining again if you accurately tracked your macros and upped the calories you take in.
When it comes to sleep, the average person needs 7-8 hours for optimal health, but some people only need 5 hours, while others need 9-10. If sleeping 12 hours makes you feel more rested in the morning and more energized during the day, I'd listen to your body. But it might be worth it to try cutting it down to 8-9 for a month to see where you're at in that regard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't true, the body uses the same amount of energy roughly overall. The brain actually uses <em>more</em> during sleep, while the muscles use less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, yes and no, the body overall uses 10% less energy during sleep, but you're right that the brain uses more energy, particularly during REM sleep (my bad) many muscles are paralyzed and hence use less energy.</p>
<p>In short, my understanding was wrong, thanks for the correction</p></div>		</li>

<p><em>Technically</em> Growth Hormone is not anabolic to muscle tissue (though it does increase LBM via connective tissue growth as well as total body water retention).</p>
<p>Granted, if you meant &quot;hormones&quot; in general then you're right: adequate sleep promotes the release of testosterone, and IGF-1. It also promotes increased muscle protein synthesis as well as reduces cortisol production (which is catabolic to muscle tissue).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To some degree, yes.</p>
<p>Any time you subject yourself to training you're going to experience an acute stress response and a little bit of cortisol which can actually promote gains.</p>
<p>It's the chronic stress response that will lead to a large amount of constant cortisol that is probably going to kill your gains the most.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would be interested to know if there are any students on point. My preception tells me that since sleep apnea causes frequent disturbances of the sleep cycle, that it would interfer with the normal secretion of HGH. Of course, the body being the marvelous machine that it is and sleep apea being so common, it may have evolved to compensate for this ongoing disturbance in the sleep cycle and disruption of secretion of hormones. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes so much more sense. I barely sleep and in high school, I was in the gym 5 days a week plus sports practices and ate 5 meals a day plus 2 protein shakes. Still didn’t gain weight/add muscle bulk. I got stronger but couldn’t gain mass. I only slept maybe 4 hours a night on average. My sleep issues gave me no time to recover and build. </p></div>		</li>
