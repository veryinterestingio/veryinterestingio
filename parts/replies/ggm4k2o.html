<p>“The NERVTAG scientists say there is currently insufficient data to say what the mechanism of increased transmissibility is or whether the variant is more deadly.”

			<div class="markdown"><p>They actually can’t even say it’s more spreadable yet until we have more data.</p>
<p>There was a mutation in Spain earlier in the pandemic which they thought was more spreadable but months down the line they realised it wasn’t.</p>
<p>Just because more people have it now doesn’t make it more spreadable, it could simply be luck that it is widespread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, interesting</p>
<p>So, this means this</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Van Kerkhove, that 70 per cent increase translates to the  reproduction number — the number of people that one infected individual  transmits to another — which has increased from 1.1 to 1.5.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is not statistically significant yet? Or do you mean that these measurements are based on observing some statistics about the numbers of people infected with each variant (where virus competes with a similar virus) and that makes it inaccurate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I listened to a subject matter expert from Fred Hutch Research Institute in Seattle talk about it today. He said that why they think the UK strain is more transmissible is that it showed up first in Sept in London, and now by Dec is the predominant strain they’re seeing in London. They don’t know how it’s more transmissible except that people have on avg higher viral loads than the other strains.</p></div>		</li>
