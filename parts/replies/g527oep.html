			<div class="markdown"><p>The best way imo is how we used to do it at the old sushi bar I worked. You take Sara Lee pound cake and cut it into 1/4-1/2 inch thick slices. Then take two slices in your hand side by side plop a scoop of ice cream in the middle, throw a third on top and form the pound cake around the ice cream to make a ball. Wrap it plastic wrap and freeze to firm. Dip in tempura batter and panko bread crumbs then deep fry. Serve with whipped cream and chocolate syrup and a maraschino cherry. ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You forgot the step where they typically freeze the ice cream in sub-zero temperatures to increase how far off it is from melting. It's faster to go from 30° to around 34° than it is to go from 0° to 34°. So the colder the ice cream, the longer it takes to melt.</p>
<p>Usually they freeze the ice cream with the cereal flakes already stuck to it when the ice cream was soft so that when they freeze it, and the ice cream becomes more solid, it locks in the cereal flake coating like a block of ice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I only used 0° as an example of temperature differential.
Prior to saying 0° I said that ice cream used in fried ice cream is generally frozen to sub-zero temperatures. Commercial freezers can get down below - 10° if not colder. I've seen some places use dry ice, or nitrogen to flash freeze the outer layer as well.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ooooh, you are talking Fahrenheit? I was wondering how you want to freeze water above zero °C :D</p></div>		</li>

<p>Any normal commercial freezer does that. Even home freezers generally do that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm aware that normal commercial freezers do that... And where do you buy fried ice cream from? A restaurant with a commercial freezer, lol. Not many home freezers get down in the -10° to -15° range unless it's a separate freezer and not combined with a fridge. Unless of course you have a hefty wallet for something like a Sub Zero fridge/freezer combo.</p>
<p>I think what you are saying is supporting the point I'm making unintentionally. We're on the same page unless I'm completely missing what you're trying to say.</p></div>		</li>
