			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth saying that a typical wind turbine does not produce 6MW, half that is more conventional. The only wind turbines that are capable of producing 6-7MW are large offshore turbines that are 150m tall; so you're looking at a quite a big field there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume if someone is going to invest in building wind turbines, that a site study had been conducted to measure average windspeed and frequency of gusts over time. That way you can optimally place the turbine in the best spot to maximize power generation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question; does Krafla only produce electricity? I'm wondering if it is also a hot water heating installation. You are right that 60MW is a bit measily, so wondering if that is just electricity production and the heating is in addition to that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: It may have more wells, I found one source saying Hellisheidi has 30 wells, but I found other articles claiming 50 and a engineering PDF claiming 57. It's remarkably hard to find such data.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not 100% sure but I don't recall that it has, nor is it mentioned anywhere, nor does it seem likely given its location and the very low population density in the area around that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, doesn't seem to have a heating installation. But it's quite an old plant and quite a few of the wells are regenerating (dormant). Looking online it looks that 60MW is a target energy production number to not exhaust the wells quickly, but theoretically it could produce much more than 60MW - it just doesn't have to.</p>
<p>Looking at the Hellishei√∞i Power Station; that produces 300MW electricity and only has 17 extra wells (50 vs. 33) in addition to 133MWth of heat. It's not a small area at 13.000m2, but that's also not that big.</p>
<p>I don't think these things are a question of &quot;How many wells, how much area&quot; it just so happens that Krafka is quite large for the limited energy it produces, but the answer to why that is is more due to &quot;Because they have the space&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have a plant in The Netherlands in the middle of all greenhouses nowhere volcanos or anything related and it produces 20MW, I think they drilled one hole to 4km and then had to go back to 2.5km.</p>
<p>The Earth gets warm when you go down regardless of location, all you need is a permeable layer which water can flow through.</p></div>		</li>
