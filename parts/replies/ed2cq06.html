			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeh you would still have issues with frozen blood not being able to make it through the body. </p>
<p>The last I heard and looked into this, scientists were looking at certain species of frogs who freeze during winter months and then thaw backwards when spring comes. (They thaw from the inside out). Not sure how they would implement this sort of evolutionary trait into humans</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why I'm thinking. The one problem with that is that nanobots wouldn't be able to travel through blood frozen in the arteries. First off we'd have to create a technology that prevented blood from freezing WITHOUT preventing any organs from freezing, and then we'd have to create nanobots that could create enough cumulative heat to evenly heat the body back up. And evenly heating the body back up needs to be fast, since a cold but not frozen body would perhaps be more dangerous at that point in time.</p></div>		</li>
