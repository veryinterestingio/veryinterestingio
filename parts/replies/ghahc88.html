<p>The sun loses mass at a rate of over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun" target="_blank">4 million tons per second</a> -- this mass is converted to energy, aka sunlight. At that rate it has fuel for \~5 billion more years of hydrogen fusion.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I find the most fascinating, is the fact that due to the density of the sun and everything happening, photons of light can take about 100,000 years to get from the core of the sun to the surface at which point they speed off at the speed of light.</p>
<p>That means, during the daytime, the light that is bombarding you, was likely formed within the sun 100,000 years ago.  The sheer size, and time scale of things boggles my mind sometime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having just sat through Crash Course Astronomy, I am now a clear unquestioned expert on everything.</p>
<p>Just wanted to point out with your point #3 that the lifetime of stars decreases with their size. With greater mass comes greater gravity, which increases the rate of fusion. The first logical assumption to have is that more fuel means it can burn for a longer time, and this would be true if not for the fact that the rate of fusion increases faster than the additional fuel could &quot;keep up&quot;.</p>
<p>The Sun is smallish for a star, and has an expected lifetime of 10 billion years. Giant or Supergiant stars have lifetimes of like 4-7 billion years because they fuse hydrogen so much faster, overcoming the additional fuel present. </p>
<p>To be clear: your point #3 is not wrong, I just wanted to share an interesting trivia fact and wave around my epeen unnecessarily.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Isn't it bigger = higher pressure = faster? Isn't the higher pressure more important than the temperature, to increase the rate of fusion?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The exception being white dwarfs. White dwarfs surface temperature can reach nearly 200k degrees, and it will burn for estimates of 100 billion billion years. Unless you just mean main sequence stars, of which white dwarfs are not considered.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Supergiants have a <em>much</em> shorter lifespan, between 30 million years and a few hundred thousand years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lifetime on the main sequence</p>
<p>Using stellar models, one can predict the lifetime on the main sequence for stars of various masses; in other words, the length of time during which they can continue to fuse hydrogen into helium. The results may surprise you -- the most massive stars live the shortest lives:</p>
<h2>initial mass (solar)       lifetime (Myr)</h2>
<pre><code>    0.5                    56000
    1.0                    12000
    2.0                      900
    5.0                       90</code></pre>
<p>One can fit a very rough formula to this relationship:</p>
<pre><code>                                    -2.5
 lifetime           (     mass     )</code></pre>
<p>---------------  =   ( ------------ )
solar lifetime       (  solar mass  )</p>
