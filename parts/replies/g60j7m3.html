			<div class="markdown"><p>Tough question... electric heaters have been 100% from the day one but i almost feel like that is a cop-out: when ever there is current and resistance, there is heat. From that perspective, your phone is 100% efficient at generating heat (edit. ok, it has a display and speaker, the output of those are not just heat but if we say it produces 80% of heat, we are not far).</p>
<p>Also things that have improved but are generally the same are microphones and speakers; transducers that work with voicecoils. We have not moved far from the 1980s, we have better tolerances, better materials, better manufacturing methods, simulation and CAD, and of course signal processing has taken huge leaps to a point where it is beneficial to design so that we know we can fix some of the old problems like baffle step compensation (in short, it is hard to get the tweeter and woofer to be on the same plane and this can cause problems with other parts of the design but if we can delay one of those just a bit, it is almost like it is on the same plane without compromising it's position, and what is best.. we can do this retroactively, so that we don't know what time delay has to be used but can adjust until we find the sweet spot, then work backwards to find the variables for those exact components, we can also change the components later to cheaper models if suitable replacement comes available). But i digress...</p>
<p>I don't know many but resistive heating and transducers using voicecoils have not changed much and there isn't even research really to replace them. We have tried and always failed so no one is really even trying anymore. WIth mics, the movement range is smaller so we do have several, piezo, electret and condenser mics, the latter two are especially good alternatives. Your phone mic is electret but its speaker has a voicecoil. But apart from piezo, which is usually crap, the electret and condenser mics need a power supply, voicecoil or dynamic mic generates electricity on its own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! And as a fun fact they don't actually point towards/heat up water like you might expect, at least the newer ones don't. The towers contain a mixture of molten salts which has a <em>much</em> higher heat capacity than water. This allows for steam generation to continue during periods of shade/night time to a certain extent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, their problems are keeping the mirrors clean and focusing them to a single spot.  Thousands of moving parts are needed that can move the panel at great accuracy, which makes it less attractive choice. Molten salts are often used as an intermediary and as a reserve. It is less susceptible to fast fluctuations as the heated mass can generate steam for quite a long time, there is a sort of internal battery that comes with the concept. Solar panels on the other hand don't need to track the sun and even in the cases that they do, the movements can be way less accurate. We are trying to hit a specific spot hundreds of meters away when we reflect with mirrors, with solar panels we can be 5 degrees off and not lose much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Focused solar-thermal also has a minor issue in that if something (say, a bird) accidentally moves into the focus point, it bursts into flame from the intense heat. Not necessarily a critical issue, lots of other humans structures kill birds, but it can be a problem if there's a population of endangered condors nearby or something.</p>
<p>There's an alternate solar-thermal version, where you have parabolic-trough mirrors focusing sunlight onto a pipe down the middle, but I think that one doesn't reach as high temperatures as concentrated solar thermal, so the efficiency is lower. Plus then you need to have all those pipes running through the mirrors. The sun-tracking requirements are easier, though.</p></div>		</li>
