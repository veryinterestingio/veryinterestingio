			<div class="markdown"><p>Some are metal that are actual lug nuts that hold the wheel on, but are hella expensive and require special sockets to remove them. But most are plastic press-on lug caps. Usually the actual metal ones are on medium duty or light duty trucks, not the big rigs.</p></div>		</li>
