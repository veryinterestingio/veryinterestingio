			<div class="markdown"><p>There is background magnetism within the ocean that aquatic animals use for various different purposes (e.g., navigation, prey detection).  The electromagnetic fields (EMF) generated by cables do not propagate far through the water, particularly as cables are shielded and armored for their own protection and are often buried dependent on the water depth and seabed type.  Various studies have looked at EMF, concentrating on growth development, navigation, and avoidance, but have not found significant effects to date.</p>
