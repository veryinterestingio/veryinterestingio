			<div class="markdown"><p>it's not usually an opinion difference, it's stuff like yesterday I had a landscaper build me a raised flower bed, and it's beautiful, but they left all the bags and stuff for the dirt laying in the yard, and instead of asking them to pick it up I thanked them and cleaned it up after they left.  I was still happy with their work, I just thought that clean up would be part of the job.  maybe it is opinion, idk.</p></div>		</li>
