<p>Health food or not, at some point you will encounter fortified foods. It’s not just junk with added calcium. I suppose if you want to purposely miss your vitamins, it’s possible, but the entire point is to get vitamins in people who would otherwise not take the time/money to eat healthy. People like you who are worried about nutrients are not the people they’re trying to save from ridiculously preventable deaths.</p>
<p>It’s not fortified = healthy food, it’s fortified = people not dying of malnutrition out of pure stupidity/poverty.</p></div>		</li>
