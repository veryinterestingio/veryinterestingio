			<div class="markdown"><p>A black hole can be any size and any mass, and there are even hypotheses that suggest there are micro-black holes passing through us right now (this is one possible explanation for dark matter).</p>
<p>The only thing that decides whether something will collapse into a black hole is whether the object is contained within its Schwarzschild radius. The Schwarzschild radius of any given object is proportional to its mass. So the less massive an object, the smaller the radius the object must collapse into in order to become a black hole. The Schwarzschild radius also happens to be the radius of the event horizon, and this isn't a coincidence.</p>
<p>Basically, the way it works is that the surface gravity of said object becomes so high that, as the other response said, space is warped to the point where all directions at the surface point inward. This is why nothing can leave once it crosses the event horizon.</p>
<p>As a black hole loses mass, its Schwarzschild radius <em>does</em> decrease, but the singularity (which supposedly has a volume of 0) will always be smaller than that radius, and thus, whatever 'object' lay at the core of a black hole can never touch the event horizon, let alone escape from it. It will just become a smaller and smaller black hole. It may evaporate entirely, or it may leave behind a micro-black hole (smaller than an atom), but we're not sure of that yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mean once the mass has become less than the Chandrasekar limit?      The limit is when a massive object can no longer support its own weight against collapse, but black holes could exist that were created by some other process (perhaps since primordial times) that are less massive than this limit. Once the collapse has occurred the matter within it is in a region of spacetime where all trajectories are &quot;inward&quot;. There is no path it can take to expand back out.  The evaporation is taking place at the surface and by some mechanism that is unknown to me, steals energy from across the border.</p>
<p>However, something I have also wondered, related to your question, is what about a neutron star?   If a collision or an explosion takes a swipe at a neutron star and frees some of the neutron matter, it does expand back to normal atom size matter.  This process is actually responsible for creating much of the elements heavier than Fe.  The energy in this process is ridiculously high, but I wonder how much energy is released just from the expansion of neutron matter back to atom sized matter?</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are two ways to estimate the rough order of magnitude: pV and ~1 MeV/nucleon. The first one as a rough analogy to a classical gas (how much work do you get from an expanding volume) and the second one from nuclear reactions that will happen along the way. The deeper regions of a neutron star have a pressure of the order of ~10^34 Pa and a density of ~10^17 kg/m^(3). If we take a cubic meter of it then pV = 10^34 J and 1 MeV/nucleon is 10^17 kg * 1 MeV/u = 10^31 J. Give or take two orders of magnitude because I ignored numerical prefactors and it would depend on the neutron star and where we get the stuff from. If you take material from very close to the surface the numbers will be far smaller.</p>
<p>For comparison: 10^34 J is about the energy the Sun releases in a year, and 40 times the gravitational binding energy of Earth.</p>

<p>Oh the irony! ^^Yes ^^I ^^know ^^that's ^^a ^^different ^^type ^^of ^^surface.</p>
<p>There is no nice analogy, or at least I have never seen one. It's just black hole -&gt; black hole + radiation, a bit like a decay process for particles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The radius of a black hole scales with its mass. For example, Sag A^(*) at the center of our galaxy the Milky Way has a mass of 4.3 million suns and a radius about 32 times as big as the Sun. If there was a black hole with the mass of the Earth, it would have a radius of 9mm! So you see, they don't evaporate like water into a cloud. As a black hole evaporates, it gets smaller both in terms of mass and radius. Here is a link to the wiki page on the Schwarzschild radius, which is what you use to calculate the size of a black hole based on its mass and some constants of nature.</p>
