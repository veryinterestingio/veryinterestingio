			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much yeah! Some work by killing bacteria by disturbing their processes in such a way that they kill themselves because they want to grow harder than their systems are capable of because of antibiotics. But if you combine this with a static antibiotic this effect is reduced so you can't simply combine all antibiotics to create a superpill</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Antibiotic stewardship is also very important. Some docs like to throw ABX at everything even when it isn't bacterial or use the wrong antibiotics for the organism. You can always ask if this is the right situation for antibiotics or if they are the right antibiotics for that case.</p>
<p>I recently attended a microbiology symposium and one of the speakers was talking about a case where the PT had two different bacteria. The ABX for one wouldn't touch the other and he bounced between infections for over ten years. It's a 3 hr video on YouTube. If anyone is interested I can add the link.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ironically, new research is showing that the “finish your dose” leads to using too much antibiotics.  Currently the default is 10 days however research is pointing to many treatments being complete at 5 days.   However for now, the jury is still out and you should finish your antibiotics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish I could find the video but it basically starts as a sample on each side of the screen with various strengths of antibiotics in strips getting stronger into the middle.</p>
<p>At first the sides really seem to struggle and die off immediately (this is the ideal situation) but slowly you see a few strands breaking through the first barrier (think something like normal strength antibiotics) until they hit the 10x barrier. . . and again they slow down until they pierce it. This goes on and on until the middle one is a completely ridiculous strength that would absolutely kill a human being (I think something like 1k times the starting dose) and they break through, effectively becoming completely immune.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>While in reality it takes much more time than the video would suggest this ends up being the WORST possible situation, as in medical science basically lost at this point and must figure out a new plan of attack (say nanobots for example)</p>
<p>Ultimately humanity is slowly losing the battle, this is natural (as shown in the video I cannot find and hope someone knows/can locate) but instead of going to much larger 'strips' where it goes from say 1 to 10 to 50 to 100 to 1k where it really delays it, people who decide to quit early end up allowing a '1.3' ish dose to be present and severely speed up the evolution by turning the kill line into something that slightly stronger strands can use to advance (it is 'survival of the fittest' in the most simplistic fashion)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>edit: or here for a simple way to explain it. Imagine you can bench press 50 lbs. Now imagine tomorrow I put 52 lbs on the bar and told you to lift it. Chances are you would struggle a bit but manage. Next week we go to 54. Again you'd be fine. We do this for a month and you are up to 60. Congrats. But now instead of that tomorrow I drop 60 on and try as you might you cannot lift it. This is basically what we are doing to the bacteria, rather than giving it time to adapt we are hopefully crushing it immediately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The real concern is inadequate treatment of infection. Really, recent data has shown that shorter courses are still quite effective as many regimens were developed before adequate understanding of drug pk. This is why for example pneumonia treatment guidelines have reduced the duration to 5 days when it used to be the standard 2 wks. </p>
<p>That being said, u should follow ur doctors recommendations as they should be far more knowledgeable about current guidelines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am disappointed that nobody has mentioned <strong>biofilms</strong> yet. It perfectly explains why OP's edit was necessary.</p>
<p>Upwards of 80% of bacterial infections exist as <a href="https://www.cs.montana.edu/webworks/projects/stevesbook/artifacts/images/pictures/biofilmLifeCycle.jpg" target="_blank">biofilms</a> within the body. These are gel-like structures that increase the bacteria's ability to survive their surrounding environment. They are made mostly of exopolysaccharides (sugars that are released, like snot). Often they involve heterogeneous populations of bacteria that assist each other metabolically. One species will break down a nutrient, and their byproduct will be taken up and used as food by another species. It essentially allows single celled organisms to form a functionally multi-cellular unit. </p>
<p>Due to the principals of diffusion, the center of the biofilm has a lower concentration of nutrients than the outer edge (in addition to lower O2 concentration, higher waste concentration, etc). This is because it's difficult for nutrients to diffuse through the polymer gel, and most of the nutrients are eaten up by bacteria on the outer edge before reaching the center. </p>
<p>This causes the bacteria within the center of the biofilm to reduce their metabolic activity, or even become dormant. <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DoMPkDeW0AEglL5.jpg" target="_blank">This picture</a> from Nature reviews perfectly illustrates this point. </p>
<p>As you can imagine, this also has implications for delivery of antibiotics. The same principals of diffusion apply to the antibiotic compounds, where it is difficult for the antibiotic to reach the dormant bacteria lying in the center of the biofilm. If you kill off the bacteria in the outer edge of the biofilm, but leave the dormant bacteria in the center, they're going to become metabolically active once again and begin replicating.</p>
<p>In order to enhance diffusion and &quot;push&quot; the antibiotic into the center of the biofilm, a large enough concentration of antibiotic must be present in the surrounding environment. This requires that you take all your antibiotics over the prescribed course in order to maintain a high enough concentration of the drug to fully penetrate the biofilm. Without going to far into pharmacodynamics, your liver breaks down antibiotic compounds as they circulate through your blood. This means that you must keep taking the antibiotic to keep the concentration in your blood high enough. </p>
<p>Now why do these bacteria in the center survive? Is it because they have a mutation which elicits antibiotic resistance? </p>
<p>Not necessarily. Nearly all antibiotics rely on bacteria being metabolically active in order to facilitate its effects. When bacteria are phenotypically dormant due to their environment, they are less susceptible, as the targets of the antibiotic are inactive. The same way turning off your computer makes it less susceptible to viruses.</p>
<p>This is separate from the traditional sense of &quot;antibiotic resistance&quot;, where a genetic mutation causes the antibiotic to stop working by altering a target (or via some other modification). In this case, it's not genetic, but almost 'behavioral'. The bacteria are altruistically ceasing their own replicative capacity temporarily in order to ensure the survival of the colony. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusive_fitness" target="_blank">Inclusive fitness</a> at its finest.</p>
<p>Of course, biofilms create opportunities for other types of antibiotic resistance to form. Since there are so many bacteria in close proximity, it facilitates the transfer of resistance genes throughout the colony via horizontal gene transfer. In addition, one species of bacteria may have the capacity to inactivate an antibiotic, allowing other susceptible species to survive.</p>
<p>So what does this mean from a practical standpoint? <strong>Not taking your antibiotics for the full course is unlikely to create an antibiotic resistant strain of bacteria. It increases the possibility, but it's unlikely. The largest reason why you are to finish your full course is to prevent the dormant bacteria from replicating and making you sick all over again.</strong></p>
<p>TL;DR: See this <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DoMPkDeW0AEglL5.jpg" target="_blank">image</a> and this <a href="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13756-019-0533-3/MediaObjects/13756_2019_533_Fig1_HTML.png?as=webp" target="_blank">image</a>.</p>
<p>Essentially, biofilms were an incredibly underappreciated phenomena that have become the forefront of research in infection control and medical microbiology.</p></div>		</li>
