			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read that fasting can boost levels of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain-derived_neurotrophic_factor" target="_blank">brain-derived neurotrophic factor</a> (BDNF) which promotes maintenance and growth of neurons and is important for long-term memory.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read some studies quite a while ago (can't find them anymore) which showed that fasting has some influence on women on a hormonal level and somehow increases the risk of diabetes type 2 and related conditions. I can't find it anymore though. </p>
<p>Thus I wonder if fasting has in general the same influence on men and women.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question. Some studies have shown that intermittent fasting does not affect women the same as men. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/86/1/7/4633143" target="_blank">https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/86/1/7/4633143</a>
Also important to note many IF studies have involved animals, not humans.</p></div>		</li>
