			<div class="markdown"><p>There isn’t a stability impact of push vs pull for aircraft or watercraft (at least in the way you’re describing it)</p>
<p>That’s applying false intuition about your interactions with objects to vehicles which propel themselves, this is similar to the rocket pendulum fallacy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the purposes of a five year old, my description is sufficient.  For a highschool aged kid, sure.  My caveat acknowledges I targeted the very young.  The way I described it is also something I can easily demonstrate with a toy boat, a foam airplane model, and some string.</p>
<p>Feel free to describe it however you want in r/ELIAHS</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you’re not just simplifying it, you’re incorrect.</p>
<p>If you use string you change the dynamics, that’s EXACTLY what im talking about when I say that you’re misapplying your intuition: propellers don’t work like strings do</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the prop was mounted on the front of a steel motorboat, I picture it trying to pull the boat underwater.  Would that be a thing?  (Not necessarily right under, but definitely pulling it down closer than where it naturally sits)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming center of gravity was factored into the boats design and the prop isn't pointed downward I don't see why it would pull it down.  You'd have a boat with greater high-speed stability and worse low speed steering properties (if you value a short steering radius).  I've assumed your steel motorboat uses an outboard motor.  If it's a proper boat that requires a rudder to change the direction of thrust then I've assumed the rudder is still in the aft of the ship.</p>
<p>If nothing about the ship design changed, yes it would pull nose down.  I don't think it would be enough to tumble over itself except in the worst seastate.  It might even have greater stability due to the worse efficiency of speed.  I'd love to see some models.</p></div>		</li>
