			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s also keloid scars where they don’t stop growing at the right time, mostly black people get them. You can see where someone got their ear pierced and it is all swole up from the scarring, or in less extreme cases just from General wounds. My dad has them on his shoulders from motorcycle wrecks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few years ago when I went kayaking in a shitty cheap rental, I sliced off a good chunk of skin on the side my finger trying to climb back in after capsizing. The resulting flap was almost an inch long but not deep enough to draw blood. Hurt like a bitch tho. The skin has since grown back and you can’t even tell that there was ever a cut on my finger. Crazy stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What’s nuts about having a flap of skin partially scraped off is that as long as part of it is still attached to a good blood supply and that flap isn’t damaged, you can smooth the flap of skin over the open wound and your body will re-attach the healthy tissue underneath and then fill in whatever open wound is on the edge. Truly amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have &quot;experimental evidence&quot; of this. I <a href="https://i.imgur.com/n8KXmMU.jpg" target="_blank">tore some skin</a> (warning: photo of injury, but it's not very serious) off my left middle finger, and made <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/8lhsan/minor_skin_avulsion_on_finger_need/" target="_blank">a thread on /r/AskDocs</a> asking for advice about whether or not to keep the flap.</p>
<p>I did keep it, and held it down with band aids/bandage. At times times it seemed like it was dead, as it went through multiple colors (blue, red, some yellow, but mostly white) and it took a long time to reattach, but it eventually <em>did</em> reattach, despite the small bridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/a7ypUGN.jpg" target="_blank">This is my finger now after a year</a>. There's a visible scar, for sure, but it is the actual flap, as it still has fingerprint lines, which scar tissue wouldn't have. Obviously this is only a minor injury, but it clearly supports the point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I mean when you think about it it really makes sense. We kind of have a strange intuition that it's no longer a part of us when it disconnects, but they're the exact same cells they were a second ago, connected or not. Nothing really changed that much. They're still some random semi-living things, semi-standalone things that make up the whole that is you but aren't really you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently cut the base of my thumb (where thumb meets palm) on a plate that broke in my hand. I had 5 stitches that have since been removed (on week 4 now), and I still can't feel the part of my thumb from the cut to my fingernail (going over the left side of my knuckle). I'm concerned about the nerve damage and have read that if a nerve has been completely severed that it's recommended to have it repaired surgically. I'm wondering if this is due to the scar tissue blocking the nerve ends from reconnecting on their own?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anything involving recovery with stitches unfortunately goes above my training. I can provide some anecdotal experience though.</p>
<p>I had a cousin who got a similar wound from a table saw with a similar repair on his palm. It got stitched and there was nerve damage present; his doctors recommended stimulating the nerves frequently to encourage appropriate nerve recovery (for him it was doing things like petting his dog and using warm and cold compresses). He eventually got all sensation back but it took time and it still gets tingly every now and then.</p>
<p>What I’d suggest is talking to your doctor about it, if the doctor doesn’t have specific recommendations it couldn’t hurt to request a consult with a specialist like a physical therapist or a surgeon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a similar thumb cut and also have nerve damage. I was told it may reconnect over time though it's been over ten years and it still feels like I have a bandaid on half my thumb. Top layer is still numb but not too bad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did something similar couple years ago, had the same problem as to losing feeling in tip of my thumb. Feeling came back in my thumb but it took about 6 months. </p>
<p>I've also cut my pointer finger pretty bad (10ish years ago) and required 9 stitches. Almost lost a good chuck of my finger and permanently loss feeling in area about half an inch. Honesty, surgery would not be worth it to have feeling back and really doesn't bother me.</p></div>		</li>
