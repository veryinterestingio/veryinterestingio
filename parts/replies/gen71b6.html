			<div class="markdown"><p>Though, if fly neurons are deterministic such that they're just reacting to stimuli, then there's no reason to say that we're not doing the same thing just because we have more neurons that are more thoroughly interconnected. Arguably critical thinking is just a reaction to stimuli too, we just respond to stimuli cumulatively sometimes.</p></div>		</li>
