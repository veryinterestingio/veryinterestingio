<p>This is what he got his Nobel for by the way. He did not get a Nobel for his work on the Theory of Relativity, which definitely would have merited one, because he had a rival who  used his influence not to grant Einstein a Nobel for the idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;In 1905 a Swiss patent examiner 3rd class, a request to be promoted to patent examiner 2nd class recently being refused, wrote three papers. The first on Brownian motion proved the existence of atoms which up until that point had been very much in doubt. The second on the photoelectric effect won a Nobel prize. The third merely changed the world.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In his first two papers he unified statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. It ended up retreading what had already been published by Gibb's two years earlier in English (unknown to Einstein), but his version was arguably more elegant.</p>
<p>Planck had earlier used the  mathematical idea of a discrete sum to solve the problem of the Ultraviolet Catastrophe and that light energy could only be released in discrete amounts. Einstein built off this and proposed that light comes in discrete quantized packets. This was a big step in moving quanta from a hypothetical towards something taken more as 'real'.</p>
<p>He explained Brownian motion by unifying classical-mechanics and thermodynamic approaches to thinking about atoms. Along with his work on avogadro's number this was an important step historically in convincing other physicists that atoms were real, rather than useful constructs. He developed this over the years into a complete theory of fluctuation phenomonena including critical opalescence. This was also probably Nobel worthy work.</p>
<p>Another unification he did was classical mechanics and electrodynamics to make special relativity. This shows that magnetic and electric fields are the same thing and transform into each other as you move. He got rid of absolute time and space making them relative to the observer. Some of the basic calculations he did here were velocity addition, transverse doppler effect, and moving clocks. He developed this mostly off of the assumption (I'm not sure if this was based off the Michaelson Morley experiments / prior knowledge, and/or maybe some thought experiments)</p>
<p>Further expanded on that to come up with mass-energy equivalence. I'm not sure if this was a big leap intellectually or not, as his derivation was disputed at the time, but it had huge consequences (explained where energy was coming from in radiation, stars). His derivation was again based off of thought experiments he did.</p>
<p>General Relativity was talked about above.</p>
<p>Another thing he did which isn't well known to the public but is a common topic in  physics undergrad quantum or thermodynamic physics classes is his theory of solids (crystals) and heat capacity. This was another case where he made early contributions to quantum mechanics which showed it had correct experimental results.</p>
<p>More foundational work was he came up with the theory of stimulated emission, which is the principle behind lasers.</p>
<p>Bose-Einstein Condensates are a theoretical quantum state of matter not produced experimentally until 1996. Here he did some fundamental things important in quantum statistics such as treating all of the particles as identical.</p>
<p>When modern quantum theory was being developed in the 1920s, he didn't make as many of the new derivations, but he was extremely influential philosophically and was often the first to understand or realize the importance of certain papers (de Broglie waves). His main contribution here, aside from being a foil to Bohr, was his paper with Podolsky and Rosen on what is known as the EPR paradox. It's a thought experiment that has important implications for the interpretations of quantum mechanics and, though they didn't name it, talks about the phenomenon of quantum entanglement for the first time.</p>
<p>He and Leo Szilard also invented a refrigerator which was the first refrigerator without moving parts, but it was way to loud to be practical.</p>
<p>There were several ways his thinking was different from other physicists at the time which helped him make so many discoveries. One --- he was always at the forefront of multiple fields. He would look at problems with multiple lenses (thermodynamics, the new quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, classical mechanics, electrodynamics, which were all somewhat disjoint tools) and then was able to find the new physics which reconciled them. Two --- his use of thought experiments was excellent. Three, his interest in creating beautiful mathematical theories and taking the math as a description of the universe often lead him to different places than thinking of the math as descriptions of theoretical results. I'm more skeptical of this last one as a real difference between him and his compatriots, though he was more interested in philosophy than many of them.</p>
<p>Basically, I was surprised to find that at the beginning (or end!) of practically every undergrad class I took, including completely unexpected ones like biophysics, we covered stuff he did. The more I read about him the more I'm fascinated at his impact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The elegance of the Einstein Field Equation for General Relativity is so understated compared to the Mass-energy equivalence equation.  In my mind, people should be trained to understand the absolute genius that the first equation resolves to instead of the second which was essentially used to describe nuclear weapons.  It'd be nice if more people were given a layman's overview of the first equation instead of a 4th grade reiteration of the second. </p>
<p>Still, the man was crazy smart.  Had a weirdly shaped brain as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Einstein and Hilbert also came up with the Einstein field equations more or less simultaneously</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the last year in which Einstein was completing the construction of his theory, he found himself competing with David Hilbert, one of the greatest mathematician of all time. Einstein had given a lecture, attended by Hilberg, in Göttingen. Hilbert immediately understood that Einstein was in the process of making a major discovery, grasped the idea, and tried to overtake Einstein - and be the first to write the correct equations of the new theory Einstein was slowly building. </p>
<p>The sprint to the finish line between the two giants was a nail-biting affair, eventually decided by a matter of just a few days. Einstein in Berlin ended up giving almost a public lecture a week, each time presenting a different equation, anxious that Hilbert would get the solution before him. The equation was incorrect every time. Until, that is, by a hair's-breadth - just marginally ahead of Hilbert - Einstein found the right one. He had won the race. </p>
<p>Hilbert, a gentleman, never questioned Einstein's victory, even though he was working on very similar equations at the time. In fact he left a gentle and beautiful phrase, which captures perfectly Einstein's difficult relationship with mathematics. And which captures, perhaps, the difficult relationship that exists generally between the whole of physics and mathematics. The math that was necessary to formulate the theory was geometry in four dimensions, and Hilbert writes: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any youngster on the streets of Göttingen understands geometry in four dimensions better than Einstein. And yet, it was Einstein who completed the task. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Göttingen, where Hilbert worked, was at this time the seat of the most important school of geometry)</p>
<p>In the end, a degree of tension between Hilbert and Einstein did develop. A few days before Einstein made his successful equation public, Hilbert had sent an article to a periodical that showed just how close he had come to the same solution - and even today historians of science are faced with doubts when trying to evaluate the respective contributions of these two giants. At some point their relations cooled; Einstein feared that Hilbert, more senior and powerful, would seek to attribute to himself too much of the merit for the construction of the theory. But Hilbert never claimed to be the first to discover general relativity, and in a world such as that of science - where too often, too frequently, disputes over precedence becomes poisonous - the two gave a truly wonderful example of wisdom, clearing the field of all negative tension. </p>
<p>Einstein writes a marvelous letter to Hilbert, summarizing the profound sense of the shared course they had taken: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>There was a moment in which something like an irritation came between us, the origin of which I no longer want to analyze. I have fought against the bitterness which it provoked in me, and have succeeded completely in doing so. I again think of you with unclouded friendship, and I ask you to do the same for me. It is really a pity if companions such as we are, who have managed to forge a path aside from the pettiness of this world, could find anything other than joy in each other's company.</em></p>
