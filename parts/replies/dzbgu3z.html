<p>does soap become more effective at cleaning and disinfecting things when bubbly than straight soap not mixed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a good question. I don’t have a definite answer for you, this is where I have to speculate a bit. </p>
<p>I have heard that bubbles have something to do with the collecting of dirt and stuff to wash away, but I don’t really have any reason to believe it and no one has ever given a reason why. </p>
<p>What I think is happening is that the surfactant is what matters. The surfactant causes the soap to coat the skin and allows the soap a large amount of surface area to contact grime and bacteria, thus cleaning your hands. The bubbles, then, are purely a by-product of the soap’s effectiveness and allows us to know when there’s enough soap or when we need to re-up. </p>
<p>The reason I believe this is the case is that soap works by containing molecules with two ends that function differently. One end is attracted to oils and the other end is attracted to water. Once you’ve lathered soap on, the oils are, ideally, bonded with the soap. Then it washes away nicely due to the end of the soap molecule that is attracted to water. </p>
<p>I’d be interested to knowing anyone has more insight into whether the actual bubbles help, though. I’m pretty confident they don’t do a huge amount, and are just a useful signifier, but I’m open to being wrong!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to add, disinfecting is only the role of certain soaps. In general, soaps have the role of removing physical particles from your skin. Antiseptic soaps, on the other hand (pun intended), have additives that kill bacteria. A standard example of this is the alcohol in hand sanitizer, which simply kills the bacteria.</p>
<p>As to whether or not the presence of surfactants will make the disinfecting more effective, it would increase the likelihood of the antiseptic chemical contacting bacteria (since surfactants make liquids spread more easily) and thus likely increase the effectiveness. </p></div>		</li>
