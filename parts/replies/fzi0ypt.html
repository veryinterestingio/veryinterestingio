			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true embryologically. As to what it looks like...it’s a thicker region of flesh, somewhat like a fat tube (think a very short piece of rubbery penne). You could detach it from the surrounding tissue, so it is a separate structure, but nothing eye-popping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure. It’s not really attached like a string on a Marionette, where if you move the umbilicus, the bladder moves with it. It’s more of a ligament that connects the two, and cutting the ligament does nothing to either the umbilicus or the bladder. </p>
<p>The Urachus could be patent (continues to have flow to the bladder) or develop a cyst, as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a kid, I remember that I would occasionally get a strange pain inside my belly button. It felt like it was connected to something deeper in my body, and that it was going to rip apart. I would report this to my parents and they acted as if I were crazy. Now it makes me think that this urachus ligament might have been actually ripping apart as I was growing? Once I bece a teenager, I don't recall feeling this pain ever again.</p></div>		</li>
