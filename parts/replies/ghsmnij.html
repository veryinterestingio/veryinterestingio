			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a huge part of it. Certain mouth shapes resonate much, much better than others. So when we aim for resonance, we tend to make similar shapes with our mouths for specific vowels, rather than how we would pronounce the same word in standard speech.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Expanding on this, the ending of a vowel can make an accent destinct m, we don't clip our endings. And there are &quot;proper&quot; way to pronounce vowels. Like the word blueberry, midwesterners. Bleww-barree. Sung it is more like bloo-behrrie. Having a proper vowel shape helps voices to blend which helps with making a larger sound and tighter harmonies. When you have several people who are very good at blending and tight harmonies you can create overtones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My accent is somewhere between broadcast tv accent and chicago accent, and the letter E is <em>impossible</em> to sing with resonance in my natural accent. Still trying to figure out how to get around that one lol. I think I'll just have to move it slightly closer to an a sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if you're far from classically trained its roughly the same. I've done metal vocals and have no accent when screaming. Essentially the act of opening your throat to pass as much air as possible eliminates most of my accent, then the throat noises I have to make to get the desired effect eliminates most of the pronunciation quirks.</p></div>		</li>
