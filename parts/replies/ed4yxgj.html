			<div class="markdown"><p>That genuine sound part is incredible. Since apparently it is restricted to some forms of tinnitus, would it be safe to say that it is brought about by a unique type of damage/incident? I believe my high-pitched ringing was brought about by continuously listening to music at high volumes in middle/high school.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert, just a fascinated amateur.  But there appear to be multiple possibililties for malfunctions, therefore vastly different types of tinnitus.</p>
<p>I've experienced post-concert tinnitus, and today I often have the continuous high-pitched whistle.   But once after rushing up several flights of stairs, it temporarily changed into bird chirps!  Little &quot;pew pew pew&quot; sounds but very high pitched.  Electronics people would say aha! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squegging" target="_blank">oscillator squegging effect</a>, spontanous periodic pulsing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pulsing is probably your bloodflow. I hear those chirps too sometimes after cardio intensive exercise and if you listen carefully, they sound more like a high pitched heartbeat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve had it in one ear since I developed schwannoma. I had the tumor completely removed after the it grew back following the first surgery. They removed my eardrum and everything else including surrounding bone. The noise is the same I think because the damage to the nerve remains the same. I rarely notice it unless I think about it, though I do think it makes my remaining hearing a bit tougher.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. I always wondered if I had genuine tinnitus because to me, it sounds just like a slightly higher pitch TV static rather than ringing. Guess I've got tinnitus.</p></div>		</li>
