			<div class="markdown"><p>It's kind of interesting that just two variables, temperature and pressure, completely determine the phase, statistically. The same relationship holds for (other, since ice is technically a mineral) minerals too. Diamonds, for instance, can only be grown in a specific temperature and pressure region.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's important to note that they only determine the equilibrium phase. A lot of materials found in everyday life are in metastable state, which means that many more variables associated with kinetics are needed to describe these systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. And it's not only temperature and pressure the <em>only</em> two variables you use to characterize a thermodynamic system, two is the amount of variables you need to know in order to know the equilibrium state of a closed system, I.e. The number of degrees of freedom once everything else has been set.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For everyone reading, I think it's neat to also point out the Critical Point all the way to the right. Notice how the line doesn't touch the edge of the chart? That's b/c at that point, the liquid and vapor state become the same. This is called a supercritical fluid, and has the properties of both the gas and liquid state, and is it's own &quot;state&quot; of matter. You can find videos online, watching as the line between fluid and air just disappears</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just where it can exist as all three states at once, but they aren't merged together. You can distinguish the solid state from the liquid and gas states, they can coexist at the same time. The critical point is where you cannot distinguish the liquid and gas states b/c they are instead a merged state of the two together</p></div>		</li>
