			<div class="markdown"><p>I think people who propose the 4-day work week aren't working for companies that run 24/7 and have to constantly output a product/service. Lots of companies might decide to work a 5th day, make more money, and pay their workers more. A 4 day work week might be detrimental to an employee's salary or, as in your situation, just absolutely destroy your lifestyle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. I work in an industry where a 60 hour work week is pretty normal. I think if the workweek is reduced to 4 days, it think it'll be more of a general norm (like the 40 hour workweek) than an mandatory structure</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aside from that, imagine a factory has a widget assembler. If they hire on a 5 day work week in a 14 day pay period, the factory needs 1 full time employees for 10 days and one part timer for 4 days.</p>
<p>On a 4 day week, they need 1 full timer for 8 days and one part timer for 6 days. So you get the net effect of creating an extra job, with all other things being equal, so at least a better earning part time job.</p></div>		</li>
