			<div class="markdown"><p>You're assuming that our government isn't run by lobbyists. I can only assume that if we tried to do that here that nabisco/general mills/nestle would shut that down before it was even thought of. Serving sizes are arbitrary and are made to have consumers eat more</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some brands will list the nutrition information of an entire package, if it's less than a couple hundred grams/a few ounces and could reasonably be eaten in one sitting, but contains multiple servings. But as far as I know that's by manufacturer choice, there's no law that more than the nutrition of one serving has to be detailed.</p></div>		</li>
