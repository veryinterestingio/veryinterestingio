			<div class="markdown"><p>In a way, that feels... Reassuring, I guess. I would say I'm not terrified of the state of being dead, but I don't want to experience the process of dying. When I go, I want it to be quick, especially if it's an accident or a sudden trauma. This looks like that could be the case, should you be unlucky enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A friend of mine was in a bad motorcycle accident. What he said(rough translation):</p>
<p><em>So, I don't know how it happened but suddenly I am laying on the meadow. I think something bad happened because I don't know how I ended up there but before I was riding my bike! So I call my brother</em>(motorcycle rider as well) <em>and tell him where I am and that I probably need help, because I couldn't move, no bike, couldn't remember how i ended here. But everything was so nice, warm, nothing was hurting. I was just so sleepy, so I slowly fell asleep, but it fell so good and OK to do it.</em></p>
<p>Reality&gt; He slipped on some leaves, got trashed, was laying on the meadow(maybe wrong translation), he called his brother, he very vaguely described where he is and his brother thankfully recognized the place, because everything rest was not much helpful other than &quot;I wanna sleep now&quot;. Most of the information was gibberish. His brother then called an ambulance. They revived him succesfully and took him to the ICU.</p>
<p>The next thing he remembers is waking up in the hospital and his doctors telling him he has a 10 % chance to survive as he's very badly damaged. He spent around 6 months in the hospital just bouncing around different surgeries, then another 6 months on rehab to get the body back. They saved him, he's fine, no big aftermath in the terms of normal life.</p>
<p>Since then I am not afraid. As it appears the body has ways to make your last moments on Earth to be pleasent. Edit&gt; I mean the accident part, I am still horrified of dying in bed slowly of some form of cancer in intense pain as the doctors cannot give me more painkillers without killing me and they cannot kill me either. That's my horror death, but not the accident.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There was a beautiful and unbelievably sad thread a few months ago where someone who was definitely going to die of cancer very soon was asking about end of life care, and the people who answered had some really comforting things to say about it. From what I read, most people who are in the end-stages of cancer or other terminal diseases are put into medically induced comas if they are in the kind of pain that medication can't relieve.</p>
<p>I'm not suicidal, or interested in dying anytime soon, but reading that thread made me a lot less anxious about the inevitable.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wanted a sudden death like wake up in the morning, go for a bike ride, have a massive heart attack and be dead before hitting the ground. But recently my neighbor died in his sleep. I realized he never got a chance to say goodbye to friends or family or his wife. It seems like there was a lack of closure for him. So now I'm conflicted. I'd like to have a chance to say goodbye but I don't want to linger or suffer. I guess I'm lucky this is a decision I probably won't have to make.</p></div>		</li>

It must have come from people who experienced trauma, survived and procriated.</p>
<p>Edit. Just thought about the fact that this reflex propably is 'learned' in nature, and was a part of us before we were apes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is actually not that uncommon. Whenever you swallow there is a tiny chance that a bunch of different things goes wrong and your body goes into panic mode and knocks you out to protect itself from drowning. I know several people who have had this type of experience.</p></div>		</li>
