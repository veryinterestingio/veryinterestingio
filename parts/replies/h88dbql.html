			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's an entire limb it sounds like a reflex action, similar to hitting your funnybone. You may have done something that temporarily pinched or stimulated  major nerve bundle. Certain medications can also cause something similar like tramadol, which can cause side effects called 'brain zaps' which is like a whole body spasm combined with a feeling of falling. </p>
<p>If you're drowsy, dozing, or in the process of falling asleep when they happen, they probably are hypnic jerks. If they happen when you're wide awake then they aren't. </p>
<p>If it's individual muscles twitching on their own, that is more like a benign fasciculation or muscle twitch. They tend to stick around for days, weeks, before either moving to a different muscle, or stopping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are thinking of sleep paralysis. A night terror is a fit of sorts. Intense terror/screaming/flailing etc while asleep. Also not at all the same as a hypnic jerk... Which is that falling sensation or involuntary limb twitch/spasm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sleep paralysis has gone by many names, one of them the night terrors. Not to be confused with children waking up screaming, or having a nightmare where you suddenly wake up. The name comes from the sensation that you are not alone, that there is something malevolent in the room with you, sometimes it's sitting on your chest, crushing you and you can't breath or scream, and you feel it inching closer to your face, stealing your life away, you may even hear it breathing, laughing, talking, and you can't move, and it is terrifying. Then you suddenly jerk into motion only to find you're by yourself and fine. </p>
<p>They all stem from the same cause, part of the mind being asleep while another part is awake or nearly awake. I've personally experienced these episodes on several occasions and I'm speaking from experience. </p>
<p>I didn't say a hypnic jerk and night terrors are the same thing, only that the underlying cause can be traced to the body's inhibition of voluntary movement during sleep. If someone has 'a falling sensation or involuntary limb twitch/spasm' while awake, that's not a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hypnic/definition.htm" target="_blank">hypnic jerk</a> (hypnic being the key word there meaning sleep related) it would be vertigo and or a benign fasciculation, which are two unrelated conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also suffer from sleep paralysis. I have never heard it referred to as a night terror. Night terror has always been the extreme fear fits that children can have as far as I know.
That being said, there is always the possibility that I am missing something, maybe I'll see if I can find a definition where those two are interchangeable when I am off work. Experiencing sleep paralysis does not make anyone an expert on the subjects, the same as having a surgery done does not make me a surgeon.</p>
<p>As for the hypnic jerk, I maybe did not clarify enough, the involuntary limb jerking or spasms, I thought it was clear that I was talking about while sleeping or falling asleep. And then as far as your own comment, it did look like you were suggesting hypnic jerks were interchangeable with sleep paralysis and night terrors, possibly also just miscommunication.</p>
<p>At least it looks like we are on the same page with hypnic jerks despite that. I also would not call an awake limb spasm vertigo but that is a whole different subject and I'll just leave this at sleep related topics.</p></div>		</li>
