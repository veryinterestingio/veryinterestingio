			<div class="markdown"><p>I work with the developmentally disabled.  I had gotten an individual transfered to my case load, and noticed a high level of maladaptive behaviors, consistently followed by a diagnosis of a uti. They also have a catheter.  I requested that he be tested for a uti at least monthly and he bent back to baseline, few behaviors, mostly minimal. Recently, he called me and was straight out of his mind, his staff said he had been like that for a few days, I had the owner do a med check, and take him to urgent care where he again, wss diagnosed with a uti. So as far as I'm concerned,  its not just an elderly thing.  Its a person whose mental state isn't aware something is wrong- including children.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. However he doesn't regularly test positive when he is checked. This last time is the first since I've requested it which was in Dec 19. Thats why i had someone do a med count and we checked his lab work too.</p></div>		</li>
