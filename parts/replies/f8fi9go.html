			<div class="markdown"><p>How can I better understand the threshold between spontaneous and energized emission? I don't recall this concept from chemistry at all.</p>
<p>I thought any photon comes from the energy gap of an electron falling from a high level to lower one. They come at different energy levels, but this threshold you talk of it totally new to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a two energy level system there are two ways a photon can be generated from the high energy state. Spontaneously, or as a result of another photon of the same energy interacting with the atom (stimulated emission).</p>
<p>Within a material, spontaneous emission occurs at a rate dependant only on the number of atoms in the high energy state, while stimulated emission depends on the number of high energy atoms and the density of photons. As it turns out, the coefficient for photon absorption from the lower energy state and the coefficient for stimulated emission are one in the same, so the only way for stimulated emission to dominate over absorbtion is for more atoms to be in the higher energy state than the lower, hence the name, population inversion.</p>
<p>Look up Einstein A and B coefficients for a more in depth explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to add something I find mindblowing. When the theory first came up, it predicted only stimulated emission - excited atoms should have stayed &quot;trapped&quot; in that state until a photon of suitable frequency came to &quot;discharge&quot; them - these are given by the B coefficients which depend on the density of photons passing the atoms . However, experiments showed that excited atoms would decay faster than expected, and later it was found that they could decay spontaneously, i.e with no photon source at all. To fix this a coefficient A which did not depend on photons was needed, although the mechanism behind this was not well understood. Now the mindblowing part - you could (if you wanted) calculate a <em>hypothetical</em> photon density that <em>would</em> be needed to cause these spontaneous decays, even though there are no actual photons there. If you did that, then waited several decades for Quantum Fields Theory to ripen, you would find that your A-photon distribution matches exactly the &quot;virtual photons&quot; distribution caused by &quot;vacuum fluctuations&quot; in QFT. Isn't that amazing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The energetic excitation is the same in spontanous and stimulated emission. </p>
<p>Those excited states just dont decay instantanuously, they have a finite lifetime: If i excite my atom, it will spontanouosly emit a photon after several femtoseconds.</p>
<p>If i manage to get a second photon of the &quot;correct&quot; energy near the atom, it can &quot;artificially&quot; decay the excited state and generate a photon, that is identical to the second one.</p>
<p>The threshold he mentiones is, that you need a certain number of photons in the system in order to guarantee, that every atom gets hit by one in its excited lifetime. If it doesnt it will just decay spontanuously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understood it, it's some kind of resonance effect. Spontaneous emission is the electron falling back to the ground energy level by itself. Stimulated emission is the electron falling back faster than it originally would, because another photon comes along with the same energy as the transition to the lower energy state. You now have two photons of equal energy/wavelength, which can both stimulate other excited particles. It's a cascading amplification effect.</p>
<p>I've seen the equations that explain this stimulated emission effect a long time ago in quantum mechanics, but my prof was horrible at explaining it properly so I can't make it more intuitive as to why it happens. These equations were derived by Einstein.</p>
<p>Typically there are more energy levels than just ground level and first excited level. The electrons could be excited to, say, the fourth level, then fall back immediately to the third level, which is metastable. This means the decay from third to second excited state takes longer than usual, so the electron stays in the third state for a while. You need materials with such metastable states so you can have a lot of your electrons excited at the same time. This is the population inversion. And then, while in that third state, when a photon of the exact right wavelength comes along, you get the decay much sooner than it would normally. Then the electron would continue on decaying to first and ground level.</p>
<p>There could be more metastable energy levels as well in the same path, or there can be multiple possible paths depending on ionisation or molecular states.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! We've got one that passes light through an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acousto-optics#Acousto-optic_tunable_filter" target="_blank">AOTF</a> to pick the wavelength back out of the supercontinuum. It's basically a crystal that is vibrated at frequencies that scatter everything but the center band you're interested in. Using a tuned AOTF + supercontinuum laser you have a single light source that can move through a whole color spectrum with only a few milliseconds between colors.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nor neccessarily. You can make a pulsed laser like Titan Saphire. Those are spectrally broad.</p></div>		</li>
