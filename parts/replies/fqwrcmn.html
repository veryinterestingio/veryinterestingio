			<div class="markdown"><p>I ran into this on a winter break in college one time. I'm naturally a night owl, but this was the worst it ever got. I kept staying up later and later with a friend. We had no commitments and were having fun with lan parties. Finally,  it was Christmas Eve and I realized if I didnt do something,  I would miss our family Christmas. So I forced myself to stay up until 9pm on Christmas Eve and that fixed it.</p></div>		</li>
