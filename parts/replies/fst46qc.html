Not just KiB vs kB, which is pretty pedantic, but also b vs B, which is a substantial distinction. Considering all the folks claiming a background in programming, I would have expected less sloppiness.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Kb and kb have become polluted, depending on what standard you use or whether you use windows or iOS etc. Traditionally programmers would consider it to be 1024, but then people like HDD manufactures realised they could cut back by using the 1000 version as a 1TB is approaching 10% less if you use the &quot;1000 per&quot; way.</p>

<p>Picking any bank, say:  CPU $6000-$7FFF: 8 KB PRG RAM bank </p>
<p>0x7FFF - 0x6000 = 0x1FFFF = 8191, or 8KiB</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you’re gonna use the phrase
“strictly speaking”, you should take the time to get it right</p></div>		</li>
