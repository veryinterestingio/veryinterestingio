			<div class="markdown"><p>This is up to you. Some sites store session tokens on cookies, so if you enjoy not having to input your login information all the tiem, youâ€™ll have to keep cookies around. Some cookies are able to track your behavior, which is a sensitive privacy situation. So I guess it depends on how you value convenience vs privacy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't really true it is how 90% of people interact with the web but a lot of http requests that don't use cookies still use tokens. </p>
<p>My most common use case is out side of a browser all together where I authenticate with a third party then sending that token to a different application. They then verify with the original third party. </p>
<p>Some sites will go as far as putting the session token on the page or in the get parameters (real bad).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The actual problem are not cookies themselves, but tracking cookies. Non tracking cookies usually just store some settings that you have set - eg. if you switch light/dark mode of a website, it will probably get stored in a cookie. Tracking cookies record basically everything you do on the website and send it to google and facebook.</p>
<p>Just get an extension (some browsers do it too, if you switch it in settings eg. Opera) to block the tracking cookies and you will be fine. These extensions usually block the cookie consent window too.</p></div>		</li>
