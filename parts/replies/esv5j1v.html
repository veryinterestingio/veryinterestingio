			<div class="markdown"><p>Simple, if a company understands that the cost of maintaining the proper cleanliness exceeds the fines and potential bad press associated with inaction then they won't do it. It is nice to know that the equation currently seems to ends up with them doing the right thing but it shouldn't be hard to understand why they wouldn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The worst I saw when working at a donut factory was built up flour and dough in the track and trays of the proofer, though the worst areas never touched the food, it was just bits of flour and dough that collected at the bottom of the machine. After we finished processing raw dough and the donuts were on their way to the next process we scrubbed down the tables and conveyors and swept up dough/flour from the floor so that everything could be powerwashed overnight. The thing about large scale food production is that it can get very messy, so daily deep cleaning is a necessity.</p></div>		</li>
