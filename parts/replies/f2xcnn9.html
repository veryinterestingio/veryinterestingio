<p>That's a little too ELI3 - I was hoping for more of an explanation of how that actually works</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who owns several compounds, and have built multiple string sets.</p>
<p>Effectively, at about 90% of the draw length, the cams &quot;roll over&quot;.</p>
<p>This is the point where the egg shape cam transfers the load from the draw string, to the cables (the other 2 strings you don't pull on). At full draw, the cables are holding the majority of the bows energy or weight, which is described as &quot;let off&quot;.</p>
<p>Basically a very general version is (the cables have mini cams on each side, when the strings gets past the peak of the cam. the cables are doing the opposite) When the bow is fully drawn, the string will hold 10% of the weight, and the cables 90%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense, thanks - so basically it's about using egg shaped cams to transfer the tension to the cables?</p></div>		</li>
