			<div class="markdown"><p>There is something for this depending on the equipment you run. “Night mode” or similar will squish your dynamic range, so it isn’t blowing out windows or making dialogue inaudible. </p>
<p>It’s on a lot of reasonable AV Receivers, and I think it’s even on Sonos and the Sennheiser AMBEO soundbar.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you use the surround sound receiver most newer ones have the ability for you to select a voice and increase it times five. It basically targets the dialogue but mostly in surround sound receivers. I haven't seen it on a television. My Onkyo receiver does that but it's pretty standard on any modern receiver.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do want that though. There's dynamic range compression for you guys. If they compressed it in the master, those of us who like it would be screwed with crap audio.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's almost certain your TV or amp or whatever has a dynamic range compression setting, usually called night mode or such. Just turn it on.</p>
<p>(Yes it reduces the sound quality but that's what you'd get if the movie was made like that in the first place.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The funny thing is, you spend a fortune to get a good audio setup and then you nerf it to get a better home environment sound.  I am also guilty of moderating my volume</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve actually given up.  I just pulled my rear speakers down.  I’d rip the whole system out, except it’s integrated with the Blu-ray, so I have to leave the fronts and the sub.</p>
<p>My kids don’t know the difference and my wife watches everything on 3 with the subtitles on, so why bother?  Maybe someday I’ll get a basement mancave with a big ass screen and a proper surround system, until then it’s not worth the hassle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacking on the top comment, If you are still noticing this happening, and are in the USA, please report the station to the FCC for violation of the “Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act (CALM Act), it was made illegal in December 2011 and broadcasters were provided a 1 year grace period to get all the required equipment to be in compliance with the act</p></div>		</li>
