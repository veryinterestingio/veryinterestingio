			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, running a relay alone is stressful, then having to hand off a key part of the race just steps it up</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Distance is weird like that.  20m seems like a long distance if you and I are standing that far apart from each other.  In reality anyone in decent shape can clear that distance in a few seconds.</p></div>		</li>
