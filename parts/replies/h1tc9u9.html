			<div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: <em>Probably</em> about 4.6 billion years ago, assuming our understanding of solar system formation is correct.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The longer version:</p>
<p>The best theory at the moment is that Halley's Comet is a visitor from the Kuiper Belt (A belt of... debris/asteroids/chunks of ice/dust/etc about 30-50 AU out). The Kuiper Belt is really freaking old, and the current models assume that the contents of said belt formed at the same time as the planets did. This was about 5 billion - 4.6 billion years ago, while the solar system's 'protoplanetary disc' was still present and coalescing into distinct clumps of matter.</p>
<p>Some... thing moved past, or through, or nearby the Kuiper Belt some time in the distant past, and said thing was massive enough that its gravity slowed the orbits of various Kuiper Belt objects down. Their 'periapsis' (lowest altitude in a non-circular orbit) was now deep within the 'main' part of the solar system, and they eventually came to visit us.  </p>
<p>We're still working on construction of wide-survey telescopes powerful enough to actually examine the Kuiper Belt properly so we can get some real answers, but for the moment our best guess is that Halley's Comet is \~4.6 billion years old.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, it's 4.6 billion years old and might disappear in 15,000 years? That's the rough equivalent of an hour glass with one grain of sand left. </p>
<p>edit: I did the math, it's a 146.42 hour glass</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The prevailing theory, that I am aware of, is that the thing that dislodged the Kuiper Belt objects was Neptune. </p>
<p>Neptune is believed to have originally formed between Saturn and Uranus (noting that Neptune is the larger of the two ice giants but is paradoxically further away), but the gravity of the other 3 giants bumped it out to where it is now, and in doing so the clearing of its new orbit shot the Kuiper Belt objects further out and destabilized a lot of them, Pluto included. This same event is also hypothesized to be the source of the late-heavy bombardment, the hypothetical source of most of Earth's water, and the craters scarring the Moon and Mercury. Comets today are just remnants of that shift, ones that against the odds survived by not being intercepted by planets.</p>
<p>This does not explain, however, the source of long-period comets. These comets likely stem from the Oort Cloud and would have to have been disrupted by an interstellar visitor. They also have perihelions (greater than 1 AU) much further from the sun than short-period comets that come from the Kuiper Belt (MAY be so close to the sun that they pass through the corona or plunge straight in). This isn't a hard rule however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love the other answer, but it didn’t get to the crux of your question. Best estimates is that the comet has been in or near its current orbit for between 16k and 200k years. It’s origin is the outer solar system and we aren’t sure what kicked it into its current orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're assuming that 100% / 0.5% = 200</p>
<p>200 * 75years (Halley's Comet period) = 15,000 years.</p>
<p>However, it loses 0.5% on <em>every</em> pass, which means that on each pass you have to take into account the mass that was lost on the previous pass. Which means after 200 passes (15,000 years), Halley's Comet would be ~35% the mass that it was measured at on it's last passing.</p>
<p>But that could even be wrong as the percentage of mass it loses will almost certainly change as it's absolute mass changes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't it actually shrink FASTER each orbit because there would be more surface area to volume?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we model the rate of change of volume as being proportional to the surface area, then the radius should decrease at a constant rate. This is much more volume being lost while it's still large than when it's already small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if I did, that's still slower than losing 0.5% of the <em>original mass</em> per pass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. The mass rate loss will significantly accelerate over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where would it be getting that mass from? Space is effectively empty. There's negligible amounts of matter to accrete, especially compared to what's blasted off by the solar wind (which is largely hydrogen, not heavier elements).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, space is very empty so it's not going to collect a significant amount of ice.</p>
<p>Earth also loses more mass from its atmosphere each year than it gains from meteors, and it has a lot more gravity than a comet.</p></div>		</li>
