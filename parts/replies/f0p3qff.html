			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know the answer, but my guess would be pickled cucumbers got to be shortened to just “pickles” because either it was the first thing to be pickled, or it was the most popular thing that was pickled and was just shortened to pickles for convenience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pickling doesn't necessarily involve vinegar.  The traditional fermentation of cucumbers (without vinegar, only salt + time) are also called pickles.  I have a &quot;full sour&quot; tub of these in my fridge, and they say pickles on the container.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickling" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pickling</strong> is the process of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_preservation" target="_blank">preserving</a> or extending the lifespan of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food" target="_blank">food</a> by either <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_organism" target="_blank">anaerobic</a> <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation_(food)" target="_blank">fermentation</a> in <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brine" target="_blank">brine</a> or immersion in <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinegar" target="_blank">vinegar</a>. In <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia" target="_blank">East Asia</a>, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinaigrette" target="_blank">vinaigrette</a> (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable_oil" target="_blank">vegetable oil</a> and vinegar) is also used as a pickling medium.<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickling#cite_note-1" target="_blank">[1]</a> The pickling procedure typically affects the food's texture, taste and flavor. The resulting food is called a <em>pickle</em>, or, to prevent ambiguity, prefaced with <em>pickled</em>. Foods that are pickled include vegetables, fruits, meats, fish, dairy and eggs.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>to piggyback on this, part of the fermentation process creates vinegar via the metabolism of acetobacter, a type of bacteria that is naturally present on most surfaces, so if you stick a bunch of cucumbers in a salty brine they eventually are in a vinegar bath.</p></div>		</li>
