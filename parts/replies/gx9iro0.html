			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. Not sure if this is a good analogy, but it seems kind of like how Saran Wrap and plastic bags are individually clear but become white when you stack them up.</p>
<p>For example if you put a single layer of Saran Wrap flat on a very black surface, it's kind of like a weak mirror  because it's either specularly reflecting or it reaches the interior and absorbs.</p>
<p>Presumably as you stack more and more flat pieces of Saran wrap on top, the reflected image quickly becomes incoherent and eventually turns into something diffuse and grayish or white.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, this is why there can be materials that are both white <em>and</em> mirror-like, e.g. milk, polished marble, glossy white paint.</p>
<p>Subsurface scattering is like mist, but much more dense. This is why milk looks white straight out of the carton, but if you dilute it with water it starts looking more and more like cloudy water.</p></div>		</li>

<makes note to let it settle then take a look at the surface next time has a glass of milk></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ever had glare from looking at water? That's specular reflection, which milk also has. But milk also has a lot of internal structure (floating tiny fat and protein particles), which cause subsurface scattering, causing the diffuse mode.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How is white paint or primer so white then? Thereâ€™s minimal subsurface thickness to scatter anything and yet flat paint is completely diffuse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, a coat of primer is maybe a millimeter thick. That might be thin on human scales but that's approximately 1,000-10,000 times thicker than the wavelength of visible light. &quot;Thin films&quot; from the perspective of light are nanometers to microns thick.</p></div>		</li>
