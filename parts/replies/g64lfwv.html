			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been experimenting with different meats for burgers. It's kind of surprising how much flavor difference can be made. Using a chuck roast and grinding it you end up with a more beef flavor. Also tried round mixed with short rib for fat. Lots of flavors of beef out there.</p>
