			<div class="markdown"><p>So reading that, they make the layman comparison to a speedboat's wake - visually that makes sense, but if it's hurtling through a vaccuum, what causes the material to eject?</p>
<p>Is it just inertia?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ok so i have a few question here?? </p>
<p>the trail is how long? 13 light years in distance? </p>
<p>if so how fast is the start going and how long has it been traveling to travel 13 light years?</p>
<p>because obviously the star is not going at light speed right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the idea of that much gravity moving in a random direction sure is unsettling. Like if a blackhole tore through a galaxy, would everything be thrown off their orbits crashing into each other like billiards?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Space is too empty for stars to crash with any humane probability - think of galaxies colliding, there are examples.</p>
<p>If you think about planets crashing into their stars, that also seems unlikely - all objects within a system would experience nearly equal gravity from the black hole. That's unless it flew by very close, in which case all bets are off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mira confuses me. The only reason aircraft make contrails is because they are moving through a relatively stationary medium... But Mira is traveling through a vacuum... What's slowing down the expelled material?!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well if the material is being ejected behind it, the speed from the ejection will counteract some of the speed of it's travel. Like if you threw a baseball backwards from the bed of a moving pickup truck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That also happens if you throw a baseball in front of the truck, and to the side... And they'd all travel straight out from the moving vehicle if there wasn't air resistance pushing on them... So as /u/maktube said, space isn't it empty and those particles must be causing the drag on the ejected material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. Consider a machine that can shoot two balls in the opposite directions, at the same speed. Now imagine that it is traveling at a constant speed through a perfect vacuum, something like this:</p>
<p><code>o=o----&gt;</code></p>
<p>Now it shoots the balls. They would separate from the machine at the same rate, one moving at machine's speed minus ball speed, one moving with plus ball speed (ignoring the relativity here).</p>
<p>If the ejected balls appear to be moving away from the machine at different speeds, this probably means that either the machine accelerated after ejecting them, or the balls are traveling through a medium with drag.</p></div>		</li>
