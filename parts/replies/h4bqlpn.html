			<div class="markdown"><p>It has long been observed that in the human visual system, at least a part of the visual processing, such as identifying lines and shapes in the visual field, are performed not in the brain, but instead in the optic nerve paths on its way to the visual center in the brain. This &quot;pre-processing&quot; seems like it is where camouflage affects vision. It's a fair question to ask whether that feature of visual processing is highly conserved across species? ie. do deer, elk, etc also process their visual fields the same way? What about other non-herbivore game species like Bear, Wolves, Cougar. Also, what about arboreal animals like Squirrels  vs ground dwellers like wood chucks?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, these are good points that run counter to what I was saying. I was still very much approaching digital camo from the human POV, but even with humans, digital camo is not great, so my point was that digital camo is very much a compromise even for humans and is not really ideal.</p>
<p>You should see the answer by the wildlife biologist below which touches more on the differences between human and animal vision at an optical system level.</p>
<p>But yes, you are right, it's possible that animal vision actually has a harder time spotting digital camo than humans, so my analysis that digital camo isn't great for humans doesn't necessarily mean it applies to animals too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually &quot;digital&quot; is not related to the pattern of the camouflage at all. It only desribes the fact whether a camo is made digitally using modern softwares and programs, while standard camo is made by artists of sort. Although digital has become a synonym for pixelated camo since digital camos are most usually pixelated for better effect.
Also the effect of collecting small blobs into larger blobs, as a transition between micro and macro pattern, is a so called &quot;fractal&quot; pattern. As in mandelbrot set fractals, Italian woodland Vegetato is a great example of that :))</p></div>		</li>
