			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d really love to, but I by definition cannot. Those words simply do not exist as a concept in English...</p>
<p>edit: I can raise an example though! Take for instance “a tree”. In Chinese that phrase would translate to “一棵树”. 一means one, 棵 is the measure word, and 树 is tree. This seems convoluted and extra, and tbh I think there’s an argument to be made for that, and oddly enough there’s absolutely no standard of telling which measure word goes with which noun, but somehow we Chinese speakers get the feel, and we just... know.</p>
<p>Measure words can also be used to signify amount. Example: “A pig” = “一头猪”, where 一 again means one, 头 is the measure word, and 猪 is pig. “A team/sounder of pigs” would be “一群猪”, where the first and last character stay the same but the measure word in the middle changes to 群, implying multiple.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also native Chinese speaker here (Mandarin, Cantonese, and Wu). The dialects are all slightly different in their choice of measure words for the same thing, but I’ll start with Mandarin.</p>
<p>The obvious analogy with English is in uncountable things like a puddle of water 一灘水, a glass of milk 一杯奶, a bowl of rice 一碗飯, etc, where the measure word is the second character.</p>
<p>一支筆 means “a pen”. The measure word is 支, which literally means “branch”. It’s used for anything that looks like a stick: a needle 一支針, a tree branch 一支樹枝. For some bizarre reason, it’s also used for a song in Mandarin and Wu 一支歌.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there are multiple measure words for stick-like things: a bat (as in baseball bat) 一根棒子, where 根 literally means “root”. For cigarettes, Mandarin prefers 一根煙, Cantonese prefers 一支煙, while Wu uses both.</p>
<p>More examples of measure words: 塊 for slabs, like a cracker 一塊餅乾, a brick 一塊磚頭, a loaf of bread 一塊麵包, and specifically in Mandarin a watch 一塊表.</p>
<p>We have measure words for string shaped things like snakes and rivers 條, spherical particles like beans and planets 顆, small animals like frogs and dogs 隻, small surfaces like paper and faces 張, large expanses like land and ocean 片, piles of disgusting stuff like shit and piss 泡, buildings like rooms and schools 間, segmented things like recordings and time durations 段, etc.</p>
<p>A lot of common objects have such specific correspondence with measure words: a mirror 一面鏡子, a horse 一匹馬, a computer (or any large appliance) 一台電腦 or 一部電腦, a book 一本書, etc.</p>
<p>However, there are some general measure words for things that don’t have special measure words: 個. You can use this for general things like a thought 一個想法, a committee 一個委員會, a universe 一個宇宙. You can use it for people too 一個人, but if you want to be more formal, then you use 位 or 名: a teacher 一位老師 or 一名老師.</p>
<p>We had to learn these measure words in school and match them with different objects. Once you learn it, it becomes as natural as saying “a string of pearls”!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those words are used very differently in Chinese.</p>
<p>You can't simply say &quot;one table&quot;. You say &quot;one [object with a flat surface] table&quot;. There are some examples for this in English, where a measure word is obligatory. Say a pair of trousers. In Chinese you use measure words for absolutely everything though but you wouldn't translate them into English. That being said, many of those measure words are very specific so they can help understand what is being talked about even if you don't know the noun that is being counted. But at the same time, it's often not exactly clear why a specific measure word is the correct one.</p>
<p>Say body parts: One [thin, slender object] finger, one [one of a pair] arm, one [narrow, long or twisting object] leg all have different measure words. But why an arm is one of a pair and not a thin, slender object or a leg narrow and long and not one of a pair? Who knows.</p>
<p>But again, you wouldn't translate those. You wouldn't translate [a pair of] trousers either when translating English into German or whatever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>English has a few too, like how we have to say &quot;three heads of lettuces&quot; and not just &quot;three lettuces&quot; (at least in my dialect.) The difference is just that in Chinese you have to have one for just about every noun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think so. Thinking about it logically it would have been easier to make a single lens for the weakest eye before eventually coming up with the whole frame setup of a modern day pair. Hence 2 eye glasses aka a pair.</p>
<p>Scissors were derived from a single blade used to cut things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, I wear glasses and since I first wore them as a kid I understood you could have different levels of lens power for each eye. Made sense back in the day before the industrial age it would be practical to only make 1 (monocle) if your total vision wasn't too bad. Presumably as we got proficient in crafting them and the prices became affordable, crafting lenses for both eyes overtook making monocles.</p></div>		</li>
