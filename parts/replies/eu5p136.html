			<div class="markdown"><p>Glad that it helped you! The intuition is often much harder than the mathematics. You can follow mathematical logic and yet have no idea what you are doing.</p>
<p>To quote Einstein: &quot;If you can't explain it simply, then you don't understand it well enough.&quot; I try to approach my maths and physics with this in mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, that quote is commonly attributed to Einstein, but <a href="https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/35209/which-of-these-quotes-are-actually-einsteins-if-any" target="_blank">there's no verifiable primary source</a>. It just kinda floats around the Internet uncited. There are related quotes we can dig up, but nothing quite hitting home.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this anecdote regarding Richard Feynman does express precisely the sentiment, and is well sourced from a first-person account:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Feynman was a truly great teacher. He prided himself on being able to devise ways to explain even the most profound ideas to beginning students. Once, I said to him, &quot;Dick, explain to me, so that I can understand it, why spin one-half particles obey Fermi-Dirac statistics.&quot; Sizing up his audience perfectly, Feynman said, &quot;I'll prepare a freshman lecture on it.&quot; But he came back a few days later to say, &quot;I couldn't do it. I couldn't reduce it to the freshman level. That means we don't really understand it.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps it is this that has been boiled down over the years and then misattributed for mass consumption.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always had a question, maybe you can help me! When decoherence happens, so when the wave function collapse? Is it possible for a particle to go back to a quantum way? (so go back to a coherence). So if yes, when does it happen? An electron in an atom interact with the system so it can't be look at with the wave function because of decoherence? Almost everything in earth already has an interaction so quantum mechanic doesn't exist except in special places?</p>
<p>Sorry for my poor english and my poor physics skill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I understand the question correctly, yes it is possible to create a coherence with the correct conditions. A laser creates a coherent beam of light using stimulated emission. This is why we can get interference patterns  using Young's slits. You will only get interference if the light is coherent. This happens because the light is all the same frequency and the interference pattern shows how the phase of the light from each slit differs (think peaks and troughs of classical waves).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No I wasn't clear enough.</p>
<p>If you take young's slits experience with electron, you fire the electron, there is coherence, but if you measure it to know if it's come from the right or left slit it induces the collapse of the wave function so decoherence? Am i correct? So if the electron continue to live, is it possible to go back as a wave function =&gt; coherence?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be possible in theory for decoherence to be reversed, but in practice it becomes nearly impossible very quickly. it's like unmixing a cake, or like stopping a rumor on the internet. It's a practically unavoidable spread of information that in many cases happens at the speed of light.</p>
<p>It's the practical impossibility of undoing the decoherence process that allows us to say that a system &quot;collapsed&quot; to a certain outcome, because it makes it impossible to see evidence of the other possible outcomes.</p></div>		</li>
