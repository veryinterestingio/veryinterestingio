			<div class="markdown"><p>From my reading its based on light hours per day, if I recall more than 10 for optimal laying. So either artificial light or you level near the equator.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If they haven’t stopped laying, you’ve basically created a comfortable environment for the chickens so that they think they’ll be able to successfully raise their young like it’s summertime.</p>
<p>Over feeding them also helps, as the entire reason the junglefowl evolved to put out eggs was because of regular bamboo bloom events - bamboo plants all reproduce at the same time, so for a week there’s a huge influx of seeds and they don’t go bad for another week or two.  So the Junglefowl gorge themselves for those couple weeks on bamboo seeds and pop out as many eggs as they can in short succession.  Otherwise, they lay eggs far apart like other types of ground birds like Guineafowl, quail, ducks, and turkeys.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not entirely true. My family has had chickens since I can remember and they've almost always laid one egg per day (until they get old at least). The majority of their feed is just leftovers, grain and whatever else they find roaming the backyard. So they are certainly capable of laying an egg per day without supplements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on the breed, you don't need artificial light for them. I have 9 birds and I get 7-9 eggs a day. No artificial light at all. I do use a calcium fortified feed though.</p></div>		</li>
