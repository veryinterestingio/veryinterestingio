<p>Would not a lungful of air from person 2 approximately fill person 1's lungs? I don't understand why:</p>

<p>Granted they'd have to do do this 3 to 4 times for each of person 1's normal breaths</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because in his scenario they're trying to avoid using the entire lungful of air, they're trying to limit it to the air in the person's mouth, throat, and so on, that hasn't entered the lungs and therefore won't have an increased concentration of CO2.</p>
<p>This is because what you actually need to avoid is a buildup of CO2 rather than just the lack of oxygen.</p></div>		</li>
