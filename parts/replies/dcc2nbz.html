			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate how it can get overly sensitized and tense up at the smallest sounds. Sometimes if it's really quiet, small sharp sounds like clinking a spoon against a bowl will make the muscles tense up and I can both hear and feel my eardrums tensing up for a second. It's not painful but somewhat uncomfortable after a few dozen clinks. </p>
<p>...or am I just broken?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my understanding, I can activate this muscle at will. I know it should be an involuntary muscle, but I'm still conviced I can do it. I can keep it &quot;flexed&quot; just for a couple seconds, but it sort of does its job in reducing the sounds perceived. Do you think it's possible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's assume that this has been selected for increased fitness. I think it hilarious that perhaps hearing yourself chew is so distressing that people without this dampening were unable to stay in the gene pool. Perhaps eating was so annoying they starved to death. Maybe hearing themselves chew was so annoying that they became complete a-holes and lived a solitary life.</p></div>		</li>
