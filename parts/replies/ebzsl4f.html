			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory this would work. However the issue is the sheer amount of land that would need to be taken care of is crazy. Not to mention I can imagine even a controlled burn might get out of hand fairly easily in these areas. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I sometimes work with Georgia Dept. of Natural Resources in other subject areas.  I have been told repeatedly if they had a larger budget they'd spend it doing more controlled burns.  They do a lot of controlled burns to prevent huge fires in south Georgia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would have to be planned out well, but yes things can go well. Before doing a prescribed burn, agencies (Local FD, USFS, etc.) that are conducting a controlled burn have to have a fire plan for the site. This takes into account many what ifs, and there is a lot of science and research that has gone into fire behavior so we have a general idea of what will happen with given conditions. However, even with the knowledge of fire behavior and back up plans for for the back up plans, fire could still get out of control. But, these fires are less likely to be catastrophic, as there is at least one fire crew already there at the fire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And yes, unfortunately, the acreage of land that would need to be managed is tremendous and it would take a lot of time and money, but I believe, in the end, it would be worth it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. These forests should burn periodically. It regenerates growth and clears the forest floor of a build up of flammable debris. Smokey the Bear has been way too successful in convincing people that any fire is a bad fire. Trouble is after decades of fire suppression it’s very difficult to set and control fires intentionally. Any approach from now on needs to be extremely calculated. </p>
<p>This show has a great explanation of the problem (also happening in Australia). </p>

<p>Also, homeowners need to develop their defensible space especially if they live near wilderness areas. Metal roofs and concrete or stone walls might not be sexy, but they do well against fire. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that’s right - Australian trees too. Also I remember seeing on another documentary that there is a magic distance of cleared land around a house that will protect it against fire, even from embers. It wasn’t that huge but pretty unrealistic for those who live in suburbs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This 1000 times.  Across the world.
We don't need more fire suppression,  pretending we can change nature.  We need nature let run its course,  burning in colder months when it does not kill.  That simple.</p></div>		</li>
