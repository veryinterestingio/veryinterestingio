			<div class="markdown"><p>How do they <em>know</em> where to go though? They may have the magnetic sense imprinted but what would a similar experience look like in humans?</p>
<p>A parent imprints the location of work onto their child? How does the fly or child with an imprinted location memory know where that location is in relation to where they are? Like what if you took the progeny and placed them across the world -- what would any imprints do?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't really know. An educated guess would say it's along the same lines as what triggers animal migration, but we don't actually know what that is either.</p>
<p>It could be compulsion triggered by some sensory input, or biological reward systems that cause a pleasure response when going in that direction, with enough of them following it that it makes a notable impact. Maybe they just see those locations as a really nice looking colour and want to check it out, maybe they're piloted by tiny little men that use dimensional rifts to replace apparatus with fly guts if they need to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Although migratory animals, such as salmon and sea turtles, are thought to imprint on their natal magnetic field and use this information to return as adults, direct experimental evidence thereof remains elusive. This study experimentally demonstrates that organisms can imprint a magnetic field and that this imprinting can be inherited by their progeny. Prenatal exposure to a specific geographic magnetic field during development affected adult responses to the matching field gradient through downward movements associated with foraging. This same behavior occurred spontaneously in the progeny of the next generation.&quot;</p>
<p>It seems to be based on Earth's magnetic field, but if you create an artificial magnetic field or move them, they would just orient to what feels/looks right.  They seem to feel or see magnetic lines, so they would literally just line up with the local magnetism, even if it leads nowhere.  <em>Almost</em> like they don't learn in the generation they live, but rather pass on memory to offspring.  How?  It's in their DNA.  It'd be more like if you never met your parents, they died at your birth, but you knew instinctively to shop where they shop for your needs, work the same job and live in the same place they did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In humans this would look more like feeling safer in dense woods, on beaches, and on hills, and feeling less safe on open plains and in deep water, or to more easily hate, for example, snakes, blood, and spiders. This instinct/association drives people to congregate where they feel better by some association, not by a specific memory.</p>
<p>In flies this is more direct, so daughter fly feels better in a magnetic field going NNW because father fly felt safe there, and so they both tend to go to that area.</p>
<p>In humans it's more averaged out over generations, or subtle, but I wouldn't be surprised if we had something similar -- whatever our brains encode as general &quot;spatial&quot; variables could be primed this way. I don't think my brain has a part, before birth, that said &quot;Boston&quot; but it does have parts that say &quot;lots of people/activity&quot;, &quot;places that have things closer together/cozier&quot; and &quot;cool but not <em>too</em> cool weather&quot; that can mean that many of my children could end up liking Boston if I like it, though there is a chance they can like other places that are similar, or something else entirely, because for humans there's a lot more that goes into decisions than instinct.</p></div>		</li>
