<p>According to that, video game play does burn more than baseline, enough for it to be recommended to not count video game play as sedentary activity like you would for watching TV. Though they also say it isn’t as much as traditional physical activity.</p>
<p>I’m a bit busy right now so I could only read the abstract and conclusion, but I’d be interested to see if this was due to things like twitching and jerking while playing or if the subjects were kept still and measured “at rest” while playing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A much used way to look at &quot;brain activity&quot; is using fmri, which looks ast the BOLD-signal; the blood oxygen level dependent-signal. It's where you get those pretty visuals from(and how the field earned the nickname blob-ology). In order to use the oxigen in your blood, you need to burn calories, thats what the oxigen is for. I think it's therefore safe to assume that a working brain uses more calories than a hardly-working brain, though I'm unsure if it says anything about the magnitude of the increase in calory use.</p></div>		</li>
