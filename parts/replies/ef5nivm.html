			<div class="markdown"><p>Consider that often what we consider &quot;stinky&quot; is due to bacterial growths (eg human armpit stink, bad breath).  It strikes me that when kangaroos don't sweat, and so have to drool on themselves to even get cool, that they might likely be substantially less prone to bacterial growth than us damp monkeys.  Of course that's no guarantee, for all we know some other non-sweating animal uses its own urine, and stinks to high heaven.  And then there are skunks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's very important to note that, yes, it does still smell quite bad. </p>
<p>I like to relate it to the weird belly button smell you sometimes get if it's super hot or you just aren't very good at cleaning in the crevices. Yes you use water and wipe it out. But until you deep clean it out with soap or the like, it has that kinda gross, kinda weird smell that you can't quite place. </p>
<p>That and the pouch is generally all hot and smelly and sticky even after cleaning that smells tend to linger.</p>
<p>Source. Work with animals and marsupials. Was curious one day and asked. Was definitely shown (smelt) something I didn't expect. </p></div>		</li>
