			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the last thing you said is important and overlooked by many, people are often in pursuit of the most &quot;optimal&quot; in any situation but like you said if you stick with it, you'll get to the goal eventually even if your approach is slightly less than optimal. This applies to food/diet choices more than anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone's &quot;perfect&quot; diet might need them to eat foods they hate, drink a glass full of eggs, and squeeze 150g of protein into every day.</p>
<p>But if doing that burns them out and then they drop the whole idea of diet and exercise then it wasn't really perfect.</p>
<p>If you can only get 120g but need 150g for perfection, that's okay. 120 is a helluva lot more than 0</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing Iâ€™ve learned the most over my strength training journey is that you will NOT stick with anything if you donâ€™t enjoy it.
Wife got a peloton, but I also have a road bike. Spent about 2 weeks on the peloton before I realized there was no joy in it for me.<br />
On my bike I usually stop at a coffee shop or if itâ€™s later, bike to my local brewery. Just the thought of going to places I enjoy made biking 100 times better than doing the stationary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Youâ€™d be surprised how lenient diets can be. At my peak fitness I was deadlifting 700+ pounds routinely, and had a low enough body fat % you could see my abs.  Worked out 5-6 days a week although only 4 of them were major days and the 1-2 extra days were things like yoga, light cardio, or working out a lacking muscle group. </p>
<p>My diet 5 nights a week after lifting with my training partner? 2 burgers from In n out with 3 pieces of meat, 1 cheese, grilled onions, no tomato, light spread, lettuce wrap. With a fry and a regular coke. My nightly protein was 6 patties and 2 pieces of cheese lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why keto is bad. Sure, you can see results with it, but it's really not a sustainable diet. </p>
<p>Eating a well balanced diet and practicing portion control will be much better in the long run.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worked in a lab that's specifically addressed this question. Everything here is pretty accurate for the most part. To put everything more simply, high quality protein sources (those containing all nine essential amino at adequate amoints) mainly comprise of animal proteins, soy, and some legumes. That said, you can combine protein sources to get all of the essential amino acids (e.g. beans and rice) and be just fine. </p>
<p>1.0 - 1.8 g/kg/dy is usually enough for most people. Your level of activity, type of activity, and whether you are trying to lose weight will dictate how much you need. That said, you definitely don't need to be eating 200g + per day like some people lead you to believe.</p></div>		</li>
