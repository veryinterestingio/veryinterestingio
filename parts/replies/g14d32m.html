			<div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate: the speed of sound depends on the medium (and in some cases, the temperature, movement and composition of that medium).</p>
<p>The speed of sound in typical air is roughly 330 m/s, but varies with temperature, wind sheer and humidity. That is the white cloud you see expanding. That cloud is not MOVING at that speed, the shockwave is and the sudden compression is causing you to see the humidity along the way. The water droplets making up that cloud stay relatively motionless. This is the same effect that causes trans-sonic planes to have white clouds forming around them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the speed of sound in water is roughly 1480 m/s and thus almost 5 times as fast. This can be seen in the video footage taken from the boat.</p>
<p>The speed of sound in the ground is entirely dependent on the type soil, but is usually somewhere in the 5-13 km/s range, and thus 15-40 times faster than the shockwave propagating through the atmosphere. The shockwave in the ground will make soil and buildings vibrate, which in turn makes sound in the local atmosphere. That is sound you hear before the atmospheric shockwave hits.</p>
<p>Some of this is simplified and probably wrong, but it should give you some idea of what is happening.</p></div>		</li>
