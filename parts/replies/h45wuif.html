			<div class="markdown"><p>Another fun fact about certain kinds of rodent teeth is that often they will appear orange naturally and this is because they have a protective layer that contains increased amounts of iron in it. Beavers have this along with Nutria and other rodents that often chew things that would quickly wear down other less sturdy teeth.</p></div>		</li>
