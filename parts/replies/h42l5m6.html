			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be unrelated, but do you know why relaxation breathing techniques have your breathe in through your nose for 4 seconds,  hold for 7, then exhale through mouth for 8? Because it takes longer to breathe in through the nose, I end up not having nearly enough breath to exhale through the mouth for 8 seconds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, not an answer to your question but on that count of 4 inhale, &quot;pull&quot; the air in stronger, if that makes sense. Not necessarily fast but strongly. And gently, slowly release on the long exhale. I hope that makes sense. I try not to focus on the lengths of breath anymore so much as what is happening in my body (usually where I feel my breath strongest-diaphragm and lungs/chest) and how the rest of my body responds to that. </p>
<p>From what I remember it calms the nervous system (someone correct me if I'm wrong, &amp;/or kindly elaborate please). I kind of look at it as the opposite or flight or fight response-usually your breath quickens during this time, whereas with relaxation breaths you want to slow everything down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to inhale deeply and then slow down the force of your exhale to last longer. It isnâ€™t easy at first, but you can count a beat while you inhale and then gradually get better at breathing out for longer. </p>
<p>It helps to breathe into your belly, you can fill up with more air. One example I have is imagine your ribs opening like an umbrella while you inhale. It feels like it slows your heart rate, but Iâ€™m not an expert on anything.</p>
<p>But you know what, Iâ€™ve never heard of the holding your breath stepâ€¦itâ€™s been breathe in for 3 counts and out for 6 or something similar every time Iâ€™ve done it. Holding your breath is not relaxing! Try it without holding your breath. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really about inhaling hard and exhaling very slowly. Since when you're panicked exhaling is kinda difficult, forcing yourself to go slow, is good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>except that it bypasses the filtering/warming/hydrating functions of the nose.  It's faster, but the air is worse for the lungs.  </p>
<p>There is no benefit to breathing out through those nose, just in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a fairly committed runner, I have heard this many times over the years.</p>
<p>However, as humans are natural runners by biological design and this would seem to be an instinctual rather than learned practice... It would therefore seem strange that our bodies would default to mouth breathing under exertion, if it wasn't the best things for us.</p>
<p>Or am I missing something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is opinion based on personal experience, so take it with a grain of salt. I think the answer is simply volume. At a certain workload, your body needs more air than can be pulled through your nose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Robert Patrick did strenuous exercises for the filming of T2 to run real fast while only breathing through his nose - to give that &quot;Terminator&quot; feel to his performance. </p>
<p>Apparently, he overdid it so much that he was always faster than the dirtbike and had to reel it in so he does not always catch it.</p>
<p>So it would seem like pure nose-breathing is the secret power move ;-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't the type of running make a difference? Humans are natural <em>distance</em> runners by design. We suck pretty badly at sprinting and other burst exercise. We're creatures of endurance. That requires less immediate volume of oxygen and more consistent delivery over long periods.</p></div>		</li>
