			<div class="markdown"><p>No, for the same reason gravity won't ever &quot;wear out&quot;. The magnet isn't really exerting a force, it's a magnetic &quot;downhill&quot;. Things moving towards it lose potential energy in exchange for kinetic energy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ehhhhh that's kind of dependent on the magnet.</p>
<p>Will a magnetic individual crystal cell lose its magnetism over time? No.</p>
<p>Will a bulk magnet eventually experience pole reversal on a micro scale which will decrease and eventually result in a magnetically &quot;neutral&quot; object. Yes.</p>
<p>How long is whats dependent on the crystallography and material, but if the time line is &quot;infinity&quot; then the answer is yes, eventually a magnet you could hold in your hand will lose its polarization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took the question as more, does repeated usage deplete a magnet's power.</p>
<p>In other words does the magnet being left alone lose its magnetism at the same rate as a magnetic being constantly used, all other factors being equal?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The poles don’t reverse. It has to do with the the fact that all the molecules themselves have a magnetic dipole. Over time they randomize and the magnetic field of the overall magnet is weaker because all the magnetic dipoles are no longer summing to be one magnet. </p>
<p>That’s why high temperatures can also demagnetized a magnet. Because hear is the movement of molecules. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue with this is that I have learned that gravity is the bending of spacetime. I understand it a sort of inherent aspect of any physical object. By its being, space bends to encircle it, the more mass the bigger the circle or &quot;drain&quot; pulling things into itself. This slows down time so that light stays at its same speed.</p>
<p>A magnet is a certain type of electric field. It's not bending time or space, it's just attracting or repelling certain things. So I'd expect it to lose its attractive power at some point. Unlike gravity, which isn't from any particular property of the object except it being an object.</p>
<p>I'm writing this not because I think I'm right. I'd like to understand how I'm wrong if I am wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First of all a magnetic field is not a type of electric field. Electricity and magnetism are fundamentally liked but they are not the same thing. Second, just like you can think of gravity as the warping of spacetime, you can think of electricity and magnetism as the warping of a different kind of field, the electromagnetic field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We know electrons always have the same charge.  You can't take the charge out of the electron.  It is an &quot;inherent&quot; part of the electron.  Likewise for other particles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing needs to wear out or use energy to create a pushing or pulling force. A simple example of this is a spring. Just like a magnet, if you squeeze the ends of the springs together, they repel.  Forces like magnetism, gravity, electricity, are similar</p>
<p>On a similar vein when you're sitting on a chair, the electrons in the chair are repelling your electrons and pushing you up, but the chair isn't using any energy to do this.</p></div>		</li>
