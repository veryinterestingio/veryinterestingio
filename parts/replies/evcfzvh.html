			<div class="markdown"><p>Anesthesiologist here!  Highjacking this to try to give a bit more context.</p>
<p>When considering how to induce general anesthesia, one thing we consider is whether the patient has an empty stomach or a full stomach. We also consider the type of surgery someone is having, and what depth of anesthesia you will need for the planned surgery. For simplicity's sake, lets assume anyone having significant enough bleeding to require surgery will need general anesthesia with a breathing tube (think intra-abdominal / intra-thoracic surgery)</p>
<p>We often use a combination of drugs to induce anesthesia, including  propofol to induce unconciousness and some type of paralytic to optimize our conditions for intubation (placing a breathing tube). One commonly used class of paralytic takes a few minutes to work. During this time, the patient won't be breathing on his/her own because of the drugs we gave to induce unconciousness. Therefore, we'll mask ventillate the patient for a few minutes, while the paralytic kicks in. This is a high-risk time for aspiration (vomiting) because we usually are pushing some air into the stomach + lungs with our mask ventillation, causing the stomach to be distended. Also, our inate protective mechanisms to protect the lungs when we are awake are significantly diminished. Also, you're flat on an OR table instead of sitting upright.</p>
<p>Therefore, if someone is having elective surgery, we require patients to have an empty stomach to decrease this risk as much as possible, and we'll delay/cancel cases if patients eat the morning of surgery. This isn't possible for truely emergent surgery however, so we adjust our anesthestic technique to minimize or avoid mask ventillating the patient completely. The goal is to minimize the time from first inducing anesthesia to placing the breathing tube. This is called a rapid-sequence intubation, and typically involves using a quick-acting paralytic. We don't do this on everyone because it has its own set of risks.</p>
<p>The best answer, and what most people probably do in clinical practice, though, is to treat most if not all trauma patients as though they are full stomachs. First, your patient may not be in a position to tell you exactly when they last ate. Also, the stress of trauma can delay normal stomach emptying (body doesnt worry about about digesting food when under stress). I typically treat any major trauma as though they have full stomach just to be safe.</p>
<p>So my final answer is, although there's a reasonable rational behind  avoiding drinking water if you're headed for emergency surgery soon, it may not make a huge difference to your anethesiologist, who may assume you're a full stomach anyways. Drinking water would certainly never delay emergency surgery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen some horrible things on the internet but this comment right here saying that tea isn't special has got to be one of the only things that's actually got to me. You can't just say things like that when you must <strong>know</strong> there are British people on Reddit. I don't even think an apology would be enough to make up for what you've just said, so forget it. Don't talk to me or my fellow Brits ever again.</p></div>		</li>
