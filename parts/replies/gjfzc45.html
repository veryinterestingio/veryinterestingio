			<div class="markdown"><p>Shit I've been saying this for 10 years, after a court ordered me to do community service at a recycling center after some teenage shenanigans.</p>
<p>Guess what happened to the vast majority of the &quot;recyclable&quot; plastic? Yep. Straight into the garbage. You really think people are going to rinse the bottles for you, peel the labels, scrape the coffee grounds or whatever out of them? Hell no. They hit them off the conveyor belt with a stick and straight into the dumpster they go.</p>
<p>EDIT: Guys I'm not a recycling savant. I'm an engineer and my work has nothing to do with recycling. This was just my experience 10+ years ago doing community service to avoid a felony rap. I can't tell you exactly what to do or how recycling works in your area. All I can say is that yes, it's definitely not what most people think it is, and that if you care you should dig into it and find out how it works in your city. Call up your recycling center I'm sure they'll be happy to tell you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That phrase is not just a collection of 3 words.  It's an order of operations.</p>
<p>1.Reduce 2.Reuse.  if all else fails, 3. Recycle</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, but the first 2 steps are the hardest (I'm guilty as well). Laws to discourage single use plastics would make a huge difference. Let me refill my laundry detergent, shampoo, conditioner, and soda bottles and there goes 90% of my plastic waste.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Reuse - as much as possible.  If item is not reusable, you have failed at step 1 - reduce. When all else fails, item is broken/worn out, then:</p>
<p>Recycle</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm honestly amazed people don't know this.</p>
<p>The way it works is we put all our recyclables onto barges and send them to China and the Philippines where they promise they'll recycle them but just throw them into the giant landfills. The company gets to claim it recycled, the consumer believes they are helping the planet etc</p>
<p>Virtually everything you recycle goes in the trash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, it's mainly an issue with plastic recycling. Other materials are still recycled, and don't necessarily have all the problems OP mentioned that result in most plastic going in the trash.</p>
<p>Aluminum in particular is supposed to be the best thing to recycle, I believe. </p>
<p>Perfect is the enemy of good, too. I'll still put plastic in the recycle bin, but I try to make an effort to just use less as a whole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you are not taking crazy pills, but you are underestimating the cost and/or amount of manual labour needed. If you want to clean and seperate everything at the plant manually it is going to cost way more than &quot;fresh&quot; plastic. (I'm guessing in the order of 10-100 times more)  Who is going to pay for that? It's too much for local authorities to subsidise, too expensive to finance through taxes and you can't sell it because who is going to pay 10 times more for an inferior product?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I grew up before curb-side recycling was a thing. I was taught that I had to remove labels, wash, and rinse all the recycling (including bottles and cans) or else the recycling center wouldn't accept it. I am not surprised that people think that all the sorting/cleaning is being done at the recycling center now that it's just dumped in a single unsorted bag to be picked up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Raw plastic is cheap. Crazy cheap. As soon as you need to pay someone to sort, separate &amp; clean the used plastic so it can be recycled, the recycled plastic becomes much more expensive and lower quality than virgin plastic.</p>
<p>China used to accept all of our recycling for almost free, put it in empty ships returning to China, pay low skill workers basically nothing to do the work, and burn or bury what was unusable. Then they realized that the long term costs (health &amp; environment) meant it was costing them money to turn our trash into lower quality raw material, so they banned it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it is. My brother used to work in a incineration facility. He told me when people started sorting plastic (due to a government incentive to charge the â€˜rest garbage collectionâ€™ and make plastic collection free) their gas consumption per ton of garbage almost quadrupled since plastic makes for great fuel. All their exhaust fumes are washed so most of the toxic compounds released by burning plastics are not being released into to the air.
I used to work as a garbage collector while studying chemical engineering so I was interested to see where our plastic was going. Turns out most our plastic is shipped to China to be burned over there, where exhaust fume washing might not be as thorough as we do it here (Iâ€™m not sure though, China is improving big time in regard to the environment). More recently weâ€™re also shipping our plastic to Turkey where it end up in landfills anyway, since China is getting less and less eager to take our plastic.
Most plastic that is being recycled is for instance coming from agricultural foil, where you have tonnes of plastic consisting of the same material without paint and stuff. </p>
<p>That said, here in the Netherlands itâ€™s more environmentally friendly to put plastic garbage in the â€˜restâ€™ category rather putting it in â€˜plastic recycleâ€™ stream since we burn most of our garbage. This is however, very region specific and very hard to generalize. A lot of times the garbage business can be quite a shady business and people making the rules mostly donâ€™t understand whatâ€™s good for the environment and whats not. After all, burning plastic doesnâ€™t sound very environmentally friendly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As long as we are using fossil fuel for energy, you can replace virtually the identical amount of pollution/energy produced with trash incineration power plants burning said plastic.</p>
<p>Since the vast majority of plastics are made from fossil fuels in the first place, you are basically just using that oil that would otherwise have directly been burned for a bit of time before burning it anyway.</p>
<p>If your landfill is perfectly regulated and controlled, then you'd be taking carbon under the ground so to speak.</p>
<p>But again, we are already burning X kWh worth of fossil fuels, and if we burn a bit less than those and get the energy from plastics, the net pollution is the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Read about how exhaust is scrubbed when power plants burn trash and plastic. The carbon is captured and buried, unlike the exhaust from a vehicle or furnace. Burning plastic in this manner is another way to reduce pollution. Especially as people switch to electric vehicles and heat.</p></div>		</li>
