			<div class="markdown"><p>At 0 C, water <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_diagram#Crystals" target="_blank">solidifies at \~0.63 GPa</a>. With the 1 atm per 10 m assumption, that's \~63 km (39 miles) of depth. Not sure if that's a coincidence with your &quot;63 miles&quot; or a units issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, yes, but that's a <em>temperature</em> induced phase change.</p>
<p>Essentially a certain amount of energy needs to be drained from the water for a temperature-induced phase change, because the phase change represents a significant loss of motion.</p>
<p>Pressure gets around this by <em>forcing</em> the water molecules not to move, so it needs to be ridiculously high if you're not gonna help it along with temperature changes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's at standard atmospheric pressure of 101.325 kPa, or ~0.1MPa.</p>
<p>When you increase the pressure, but we're talking here about three orders of magnitude, then the freezing temperature first drops to about -20C, then rises.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your refrigerator is most likely about 0 C. Water does not freeze in there, unless you put it at the very back near the cooling coils.. However, the freezer should be like -8 C or so which will actually freeze things well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No problem! It just freaked me out because your 0.63 vs 1.0 GPa swap happens to be the same as the mi:km ratio so I thought something weird happened there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory, it's possible, but these calculations depend on the gravity exerting force on the water and the temperature. I'm not sure, but I think the moons are too small to exert the force necessary.</p>
<p>If there was a ball of water the mass of earth, it would have a solid &quot;ice&quot; core assuming the whole thing was normal earth surface temperatures.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thanks for answering anyways though.</p></div>		</li>
