			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not. But let's say you cut up an orange on the counter. Or some strawberries to go with your win. Then you took the wine cork out and set it on the counter. If that wine cork touched where the strawberries were it's possible the eggs would get on the cork, in the wine, and have a heyday with all the sugars in there.</p></div>		</li>
