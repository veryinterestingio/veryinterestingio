			<div class="markdown"><p>My parents have done lawn and landscaping for the last 28 years. My mom's arms look like alligator skin, while my dads just look kinda tan. Granted, my dad has some kind of weird anti-aging gene. He's in his 60s but he could genuinely pass for his mid-40s. It's strange how different people are affected by sun/age differently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a parasol, which I take out with me when it is very hot and sunny, usually if I'm going to a park or beach. I don't use it the entire time, but often enough to feel protected in addition to my SPF50.</p></div>		</li>
