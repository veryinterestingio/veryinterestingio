7.9 km/s would be enough to &quot;cancel&quot; gravitational acceleration, but how would that make you &quot;Fly off into space&quot;? It would seem to me that it's going to simply put you into a (nearly) circular orbit around the earth.<br />
If you want to &quot;fly off into space&quot; you'd need to enter a parabolic or hyperbolic trajectory. A quick back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that this would require a velocity of a little over 11000 m/s, which means you'd be looking at a about 1 rotation per hour.</p></div>		</li>
