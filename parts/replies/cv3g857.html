			<div class="markdown"><p>This is Becca-  Great that you've heard about the Dismal Swamp and the maroon communities there.  On that project, I work with Prof Dan Sayers at American University.  My Master's research was about glass artifacts used by both the 'escaped slaves' and the enslaved people who dug the canals and lumbered the Swamp.  My PhD work involves exploring parts of the Swamp archaeologists haven't been to yet.  The Great Dismal Swamp Landscape Study team includes archaeologists, geophysicists, historians and anthropologists from several universities around the country.</p></div>		</li>
