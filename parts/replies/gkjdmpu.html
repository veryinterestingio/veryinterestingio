			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a very good reason this isn't done except in extremely &quot;trusted&quot; environments. Refinement of spent fuel can give you uranium or plutonium in weapons-grade quantities and purities. That's very much against the anti proliferation treaties of today, and for very good reason.</p>
<p>Not saying we shouldn't be doing it - just saying it's not nonsense that it isn't done. The cold war sucked, yo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>maybe save money in the long run? As of now, it doesn't seem like nuclear power companies have to factor in long term storage cost at all. So, when you factor that is, it probably is cheaper</p></div>		</li>
