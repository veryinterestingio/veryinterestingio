<p>Termination is a lot different. Literally changing the plugs at the end and the sockets in the box makes a huge difference in things like reflection of the signal off the end back onto the wire, clobbering the signal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's a ton of digital signal processing (DSP), aka complicated math processing, that's done to recover the signals. Every year, we get better at it.</p>
</li>
<li>Traditional Ethernet cabling is at the end of speed improvements. Given the noise on the wire, there's only so much data per second you can pump over it. There's only so much demand for faster networking over such cabling, too.</li>

<p>Termination hasn’t changed, it’s either punched down or crimped on, either way it’s self piercing conducting metal making contact with the insulated copper conductors. </p>

<p>I doubt it. I’m no expert, but my guess is you’ll see speeds of 1Tb/sec over copper in the next ten years. In the last 10 we’ve gone from 100Mb/sec to cable that can do 100Gb/sec. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While the crimp plugs haven't changed much, the sockets you plug them into have, reducing lots of stray capacitances and inductances. And the other part of termination is the electrical termination, the resistance, together with stray impedances, inside the device. This has also changed - which, all together, provides a much cleaner signal to the device, allowing higher clock rates and more bits per symbol.</p>
<p>Of course, the biggest change with cat 6 is to the cable, with higher twist rates allowing the noise rejection to work at higher frequencies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ethernet is the data transfer standard. You can have Ethernet over cables with a lot of different connectors.<br />
Take industrial Ethernet.  RJ45 to M12 D-coded 4-pin is common.
M8 and M12 are the common sizes and you have A, B, C, D, S, T, and X coded. The letters represent different keyed notches so that they only fit in a certain way. And you have anywhere from 3 to 12 pins. The more pins you have the faster speed and power capabilities. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Sure it has.  New connectors have <a href="https://www.platinumtools.com/upload_images/thumb_jpg_650/1527871255platinum%20tools_ez-rj45_cat6_crossed.jpg" target="_blank">holes in the front end</a>, so the wires pass all the way through the connector instead, eliminating the guesswork involved in trimming the inner wires. The crimper then cuts the excess from the connector.</p></div>		</li>
