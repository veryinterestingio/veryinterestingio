			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, horse legs are under such high tension from their tendons they tend to shatter when they break. This means they are prone to massive infections and bleeding. </p>
<p>Horses when immobilized also tend to develop fatal intestinal conditions called colic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive seen a horse die of colic. Basically, they're bodies are not designed for long periods of inactivity, and lying down and rolling around (from pain) can cause their intestines to tie themselves in knots. Its a horrible, impossible problem, and its horribly painful. From personal experience, I'd much rather be shot in the head than die from a stomach ache that bad. By a lot.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The doctors did a great effort to try and save the horse but it was no easy task.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Horses also need to move in order to digest their food. If they're kept immobile, they can't digest. They also can't vomit. They wind up with a buildup of gases in their stomach, called colic, which can be fatal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many wild animals will die from a broken bone especially those who need to hunt or are hunted.
Even with a low threat environment the energy and nutrition required to heal breaks is huge and takes an awful lot of rest etc which most animals just don't have the luxury of. </p></div>		</li>
