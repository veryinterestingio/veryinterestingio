			<div class="markdown"><p>Man I wish. I discovered I had renal disease about 12 years ago and was told at that time we were hoping for lab grown transplants within 5-10 years. The hope was that I could avoid the transplant list. Unfortunately that didnâ€™t pan out and I ended up getting a transplant earlier this year. My hope for lab grown organs over the years has steadily decreased to zero lol.</p></div>		</li>
