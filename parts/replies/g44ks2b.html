			<div class="markdown"><p>My bunnies stomp on the floor when they sense danger. Once they were in the garden and a cat came in and they were stomping like elephants. So I scared the cat away.</p>
<p>One of my bunnies only stomps when she's annoyed/pissed off oddly enough. But she's the most domesticated one we have so I'm not sure if we've conditioned her to do that when she's pissed at us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They not only do it to warn others of danger they also do it when mad or annoyed with something. When they're happy they do a binky which kinda looks like them kicking there backlegs up and clicking there heels haha. Rabbits are truly awesome and highly intelligent.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Once I was making funny faces at my little baby cousin just to try to make her laugh. But I guess she didn’t know me well enough to be comfortable with it and she SCREAMED. It might not be obvious but yeah, screaming is a deterrent!</p></div>		</li>
