<p>The time separation of two events depends on the observer, but it does so in a predictable and calculable way, based on the relative speeds of those observers (and, in GR, local curvature of spacetime).</p>
<p>Imagine standing opposite someone else and holding your hands straight out in front of you. From your perspective your left hand is on the left and your right hand on the right. But from theirs, your left hand will be on the right of the right hand. But this doesn't mean their position is subjective; we know because we can do this thought experiment - knowing where your hands are, where you are and where the other person is we can figure out exactly what you would each see.</p>
<p>While what we measure depends on our perspectives, it does so in a predictable way, based on the relationship between our perspectives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit: maybe a better thought experiment than my coin flipping example is if we could magically freeze everything in the universe at the same moment. Travel didn’t effect the passage of time, wouldn’t everything we stumbled upon during a universal tour be a part of that singular moment?</p>
<p>It is a magical thought experiment, and maybe some of the language is getting muddied by the varying meanings of time.</p>
<p>Edit: I’ve read one response involving light reaching observers but light being received in a brain isn’t the essence of something happening. I know smarter people than myself have thought hard on this so it would be nice to know what I’m missing. Or if I’m just using different meanings than what is described here.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Look at velocity. If I am walking at 3 mph, then I'm walking 3 mph relative to the ground. But...the earth is moving at 10,000 mph. So I'm walking 10,003 mph relative to a static point in the solar system. Does that mean velocity is &quot;subjective&quot;? No, it just means I need to pick a reference frame, then everything follows suit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're under the impression that the speed-of-light-lag (i.e. the time it takes for information about an event to reach the observer) is the only obstacle to determining whether events are simultaneous.</p>
<p>(I'm assuming this because you seem very concerned with <em>where the observer is</em> relative to the events.)</p>
<p>Even after correcting for the speed-of-light-lag, there's still the problem of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity" target="_blank">relativity of simultaneity</a>. Given any two (spacelike separated) events, you can always find two reference frames that disagree about the order of those events.</p>
<p>So rather than being concerned about <em>where the observer is</em>, you should worry about <em>what reference frame they're in</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Length contraction is a part of relativity. There is no privileged reference frame and distances are frame dependent. There is no absolute distance against which you can measure the timing of events.</p>
<p>Distance, like time, is relative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except you don't feel velocity, only acceleration. You will never know how fast you are going because there's no absolute reference frame.</p>
<p>From this neutral observer, that 250 years can look like 100 years to equally correct reference frames.</p></div>		</li>
