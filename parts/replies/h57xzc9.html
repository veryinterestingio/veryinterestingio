			<div class="markdown"><p>Glad to hear that the transplant worked! I think what you are describing works with stem cells and maybe blood transfusions, but I don't think it is possible with organs like liver, kidney, whole limbs etc. Because they are closed units of highly specialized cell types in the first place. But I may be mistaken, my genetics/immunology days were long ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes</p>
<p>Even more interesting, for someone who gets a bone marrow transplant (following leukemia), they seem to inherit the donor’s vaccine history, but lose their own </p>
<p>(Vaccinations cause long lived memory B cells, and some of these are transferred in a bone marrow transplant)</p></div>		</li>

<p>A common side-effect of many immunosuppressive drugs is immunodeficiency, because the majority of them act non-selectively, resulting in increased susceptibility to infections and decreased cancer immunosurveillance. There are also other side-effects, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, peptic ulcers, lipodystrophy, moon face, liver and kidney injury.</p>

<p>So, potentially yes, but different types of immunosuppressive therapies or medications can act differently in the body, so the degree to how vulnerable you would be to other common or serious infections depends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most likely. It depends on their HLA typing. The immune system changes over time, and identical twins are probably some of the best matches out there, they still are given immunosuppressant therapy most of the time.</p>

<p>That said many identical twin transplantees do still receive immunosuppression medication even if it's not 100% necessary. Doctors would monitor it and withdraw it if needed. Better be safe than sorry!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they most likely do.</p>
<p>The immune system changes over time in response to external factors, and HLA typing would still need to be done in order to determine if IS therapy is necessary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Check out bone marrow transplants. I worked on a bmt unit and transfusing blood was one of the most confusing things. There was a spot in the chart that showed their original blood type, the blood type of the donor, and the patient's new blood type. I was only there for a little bit, but I never really figured out that whole system. Good thing I didn't need to transfuse anyone while there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, they're talking bone marrow transplant. And your bone marrow is responsible for (most) cells in your blood, and thus for your blood type. Since they first wipe out your own bone marrow to replace it with the new one, your blood type changes from your birth blood type, to the blood type of the marrow you received.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure nobody would actually read this since I’m so late to the convo but…</p>
<p>To answer your first question, no. Generally during transfusion, patients are given units than only contain red cells. As you might know already, matured red cells cannot replicate because they do not have nucleus anymore (more room for heamoglobin, more flexibility for passing through small vessels).</p>
<p>Now, for the part about bone marrow transplant, type matching involves HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen), which is a typing system that is independent from blood groups (ABO). This means that occasionally, a patient will be receive a bone marrow transplant from a donor with a different blood group.</p>
<p>Normally, before a recipient receives a bone marrow transplant, as part of conditioning, they would be given a course of radiation/chemotherapy to destroy their existing haematopoeitic stem cells so that they’ll stop producing their own blood cells. Then, after this, the recipient would receive the bone marrow transplant. Eventually, the old is removed by the liver and replaced by new cells that are produced by the transplanted bone marrows.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more that happens before, in between, and after but that’s an entire textbook on it’s own. But in respect to blood transfusion, weird things happen when testing the blood people who have had a bone marrow transplant.</p></div>		</li>
