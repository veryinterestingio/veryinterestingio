			<div class="markdown"><p>They are usually electromagnetic brakes, but the power applied keeps the brakes unlocked against the force of a strong spring. So a falling elevator, disconnected from its power, will make them instantly clamp down. The worst thing that can happen if their electrical component fails is that the elevator isn't going to move when it should. Nice failsafe design, like air brakes on trucks where the pressure is the only thing keeping the parking brake off. </p>
<p>The brakes also usually activate when it's stopped at a floor (power cut off, spring forces brake on).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The key isn‚Äôt that it‚Äôs mechanical. The key is that the default system state is ‚Äúbrake applied,‚Äù so regardless of what failed, in event of a failure the brake keeps the heavy thing from falling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where did you learn this? Im an elevator mechanic. The most common type of brake on a wire elevator is with a single wire thats attached to the brake on the elevator. This wire goes down to the bottom and then all the way to the top on a &quot;wheel&quot; (not sure about the english words here) The wheel makes the wire stop and then it pulls the brakes so it clamps down on the guiderails.</p>
<p>I test this brake after I finished building</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here‚Äôs a video that describes all of the various braking systems. There‚Äôs definitely a more ‚Äúofficial‚Äù source that exists, but this does a good enough job at describing the mechanism (including the additional over speed wheel you mentioned):</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The braking system that you're describing is indeed one of the multiple brakes that are on a modern elevator. In fact, the one on the wire will kick in before the emergency brake that I described will activate. But, it doesn't help much if the cable(s) snaps.</p></div>		</li>
