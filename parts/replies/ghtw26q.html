			<div class="markdown"><p>Need to add on the very first part, where the mRNA that is injected is picked up by a dendritic cell that is hanging around doing its job of picking up random things it finds and bringing them to immune cells in the regional lymph node to inspect. </p>
<p>The mRNA then is translated by the dendritic cell into spike protein. Dendritic cells are antigen presenting cells, so stick this up on their surface. </p>
<p>Dendritic cell then goes to the regional lymph node every once and awhile and is like “Hi guys this is what I found today! Is this cool? Do you like me now!?” </p>
<p>Cells in lymph node then say, “WTF you just brought an enemy nuclear warhead into the lymph node. I’m glad you found this and told us but seriously WTF is wrong with you. Send in the disarmament team.”</p>
<p>And then all that adaptive immune stuff starts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got the Pfizer shot. I felt nothing on the day I got it, and some slight pain the day after. On the other hand, I get the flu shot every year and I always feel like someone punched me in the arm for a week after. The nurse that administered the Pfizer shot told me it was because of the needles being used to give the shot “are great!” I have heard the second dose is a doozy though, so I am waiting till then to pass my final judgement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That answer is incorrect. The mrna molecules fuse with muscle cells and they produce the protein which is displayed on HLA receptors which trigger an immune response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems to be a common misconception. Dendritic cells are not the main targets of LNPs. Taken from another thread.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You’re also a little off. <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(20)30932-6.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(20)30932-6.pdf</a></p>
<p>While some of the expression occurs in the muscles, LNPs seem to make it into the bloodstream and thus you see expression in the liver and the spleen.</p>
<p>Furthermore there is existing evidence from other LNP studies that the majority of expression using the “classical LNP formulation” results in liver expression.</p>

<p>This vastly limits the ability to use LNPs to target other tissues which is why scientists are working on strategies like antibody conjugation to the LNPs.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will be the first to admit that it’s been over a decade since I had any involvement in immunology outside superficial clinical applications. </p>
<p>However, your very first reference states that dendritic cells expressed antigen after IM injection, along with regional lymph nodes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Robust <strong>expression of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD was detected in muscle samples</strong> collected from the i.m. injection site of ARCoV-inoculated mice, <strong>which were mostly colocalized</strong> with CD11b-positive monocytes as well as CD163-positive mac- rophages and <strong>CD103-positive dendritic cells in muscle samples from vaccine-immunized mice (Figure 2D)</strong>. As expected, no RBD expression was seen in muscle tissue from placebo-LNP treated
mice, and LNPs also stimulated massive infiltration of mono- cytes and macrophages, which functioned as adjuvants, as described previously (Maugeri et al., 2019). Furthermore, coloc- alization of SARS-CoV-2 RBD- and CD11b-positive monocytes <strong>was also detected within i.m. lymph nodes from ARCoV mRNA-LNP-inoculated mice (Figure S4). Abundant SARS- CoV-2 RBDs were also detected in livers from ARCoV-immu- nized mice (Figure 2E), which agreed with the in vivo and ex vivo luciferase expression profiles (Figures 2A and 2B).</strong> Further analyses also showed that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD fluo- rescence signal primarily overlapped with glutamine synthe- tase-positive pericentral hepatocytes surrounding the CD31- positive central vein (CV), Arg1-positive hepatocytes, as well as CD163-positive liver macrophages (Figure 2E). These results highlight the capability of our mRNA-LNP formulations to deliver mRNA in vivo and recruit antigen-presenting cells to process the expressed antigens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your problem may be in misinterpreting my initial comment. I was not suggesting that dendritic cells are the “main target” (to use your words) of mRNA vaccines, but rather, that local dendritic cells are the first thing that uptakes the mrna and starts expression. </p>
<p>Whether most mRNA translation and antigen expression occurs in regional lymph nodes or is done by antigen presenting cells in the reticuloendothelial system is a separate point, independent from the initial discussion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Super helpful. Last question: is this process something that one would notice in their body? Injection site pain due to local inflammation is common after the first injection. But, how about any symptoms of this cascade and refinement process? Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why you can get a short term prodrome (non specific mild symptoms of illness) with any vaccine or with exposure to a pathogen after having been vaccinated successfully.</p>
<p>About 36 hours into getting my first shot of this vaccine I started getting aches, at 48 hours I felt slightly light-headed and had chills, and then I was pretty fatigued for a day. After that it tapered off over about 12 hours and I've otherwise felt fine. Part of the cascade and refinement is leukocyte proliferation which can lead to overall increase in inflammatory markers as a side effect due to some of the chemical signals sent around the body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Has anyone tried limiting exposure to PEG-ylated products before and after the shot - both the first and the booster, and then seen if these symptoms were reduced (or counterintuitively - increased?) Do existing anti-PEG antibodies reduce vaccine efficacy by preventing the vaccine from getting into the cell? Anyone studying this atm?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So would that mean that we get some immunity shortly after getting the vaccine, but would only reach our max immunity after the 10~ day period? Or would it take several days to get any kind of immunity at all?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would defiantly initiate the immune response so if you did get infected in the first few days after the vaccine you’ll be in a better position to fight the infection. Your immune system will be primed to fight the covid infection compared to someone who had not had the vaccine. But the aim of a vaccine is to induce sterilising immunity - stop virus before in could infect a single cell. So when people talk about immunity they really mean the end point.</p></div>		</li>
