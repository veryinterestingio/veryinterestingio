<p>Example: the Earth is in constant motion spinning on its axis and orbiting the Sun while the Sun orbits around the center of our galaxy, which is itself moving. But if we sit or stand in one place we think we are &quot;motionless&quot; despite all this motion that goes on under our feet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a very bad anology because the Earth has a constant motion with no acceleration. We don't have the ability to feel speed, we can only feel acceleration. That's the reason why we don't feel the Earth move. If the Earth where to suddenly jerk closer to the sun for some reason similar to if a person suddenly lifted their arm, we would certainly feel it.</p>
