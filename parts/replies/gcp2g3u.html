			<div class="markdown"><p>Also aren't some spider webs made so that some points are sticky and some not, so that the spider knows exactly where to walk on them?  I didn't think there was anything special that allowed spiders to walk on their own webs besides that.  If so it would make it difficult to walk on other spiders' webs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does that mean that if a spider moves on and builds a Web somewhere else, it will be nearly identical to its first web? But still quite different from webs from other spiders of the same species?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to say since the level of specificity and complexity of webs is very different among species. In short, yes they are (two webs made by the same spider can be a little different, due to different conditions).</p>
<p>One thing that we can assume valid is that the individuals of a species build their own webs using the same basical architecture (and so it can be used as a taxonomic indicator)</p></div>		</li>
