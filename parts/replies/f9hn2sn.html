			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I'm aware, in some countries they didn't have the infrastructure or capacity to actually re-process all the recyclable waste that is collected.  They would take in recycling from domestic recycling bins, sort it for the small amount of stuff they are capable of recycling domestically.  The rest of the waste would be sold to countries (like China) in bulk and basically they deal with it.  China gets cheap substrate to re-process and we get to say it was recycled.  </p>
<p>This works great until China doesn't want to buy anymore, or adds requirements on the waste they will import (sorted correctly, washed not dirty, only specific types of plastic etc)  So what happens is the collected and sorted recyclable waste piles up in landfills waiting to be dealt with, or in some cases skips that altogether and gets dumped with the non-recyclable waste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Felt worth noting here, I work for an architect and we are currently working on a bid for 5+ paper pulp recycling plants that are Partially Chinese owned (they know how to run the operation) but mostly US owned based around the USA. This is to bring some of the recycling stateside as it is very expensive To ship used cardboard/paper overseas. Also because given the current political climate they might not always be able to realistically export to China.</p>
<p>And that’s just one of the projects I am working on, I’m sure there are other types of plants opening up all over conducting similar processes,</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't speak for the entire planet, but all of the local trash collectors around here have dramatically cut back on what recycling they'll accept. Things like paper, pizza boxes (due to the grease), and glass are no longer accepted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correction: Regular consumers are sending garbage to transfer stations in unprecedented volumes, however, since China banned garbage imports, there's no facilities able to receive and process the waste. Just google &quot;Plastic Recycling Myth&quot;, and take your pick of articles covering the issues, from the Financial Times to the Guardian.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the market for post-consumer plastic waste is limited, because you can't turn a used plastic supermarket bag into the shell for an iPhone. Most post-consumer waste is relatively low-quality plastic used in consumer packaging, and is frequently contaminated with non-recyclable content which limits its utility and drives up the cost of recyclers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm on my phone, and it's really late, but it's important to note that it's not all recycling that's failing. It's plastic recycling. </p>
<p>It's way too late to go looking for the sources again, but if my numbers are wrong, just look it up yourself. </p>
<p>Anyway, its basically something like 90% of Aluminum gets recycled, paper has like a 60-70% rate, glass is like 40-50%, and plastic is something abysmal like 10%. </p>
<p>But it's important to note that plastic does not constitute the bulk of our recycling.</p>
<p>But it's like you say: a lot of single-source recycling (one blue bin at the curb) is proving to have negative consequences. Because it used to be that we had to separate our paper (colored from white), and not put in soiled paper. Then there were can, bottles, etc. </p>
<p>Now a lot of companies use the one bin, which leads to contamination of the recyclables. Like not washing out your milk jugs or drink containers. And it leads to a contamination level above China's threshold for recycling.</p>
<p>Because they're happy to still take out stuff. They just want it at a lower contamination standard.</p></div>		</li>
