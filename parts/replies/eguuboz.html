			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the pleasure of working in proximity to one of the water pipes that feed NYC fresh water.  I needed to call a number, who told me where to meet him.  He arrives, makes a call to notify the office he's going to open up a hatch, and opens a hatch on the sidewalk. As the hatch opens, an antenna pops out and starts broadcasting that the hatch is open.  Down a flight of stairs is a door that looks like it belongs in a vault or submarine.  Behind that door is where I had to work.  Next to that was a pipe at least 10-12 feet in diameter.  I was told it was one of the arteries feeding water to Queens and Brooklyn.  I drove and walked by that hatch a million times and had no idea about the infrastructure beneath my feet.</p></div>		</li>
