			<div class="markdown"><p>You nailed it.
It's not totally off the record because I knew who the people were by the way they spoke when I did transcription for my mom but I lost the memory of who they were purposefully.  I couldn't recall a single source under torture. It's apparently a cool trick that I can do.  I can force forgetfulness. </p>
<p>That last bit was me just realizing a thing that apparently I can do.  Manually drop a memory.  I know I did this for hours a day and have no memory of any of the transcripts.  Even though I remember the transcripts I did that were for publication.  I remember the shredding scandal at the city council and remember everyone involved including their nicknames, but I don't remember anything about the environmental scandals that I transcribed and never made it anywhere.  One had witnesses, the other was off the record.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See, I'd call this 'deep background'... A source doesn't want to be attributed but is happy for the journalist to use the info to track down sources that can be on record.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not totally accurate. Off the record info is routinely used without checking other sources of the source is reliable enough. It's not like they will immediately lie to you as soon as you say you won't name them. (Well, they <em>might</em>, but then they weren't reliable to start with.)</p>
<p>EDIT: this is in reply both to this comment and the other you wrote down below.</p></div>		</li>
