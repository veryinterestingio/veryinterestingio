			<div class="markdown"><p>An espresso is a shot of coffee that's been extracted in a coffee machine under high pressure. You can grind your freshly roasted beans for this. </p>
<p>If you mean this vs a pod machine the main difference is that the ground coffee in pods is not fresh, but it is a better choice flavour wise than instant, as coffee grounds will still have the bioflavinoids that produce complex flavours, which instant doesn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No not a pod machine but like a typical coffee maker with paper filters. Though a French press would count for my question since the grounds have been exposed to water longer.</p>
<p>I guess I should be asking chemists. I'm aware of coffee freshness/staleness in distribution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference is the pressure in professional coffee machines that allows literal extraction of the oils that produce crema, which is an additional source of flavour complexity. Drip coffee uses gravity and cannot ever 'extract' these oils, especially since they are lightweight and if formed at all would just stay above the coffee grounds in the filter.</p></div>		</li>
