Their survival tactics would have to revolve entirely around a different mental state right? Like being wary of mental pain and trauma more than physical?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, maybe I can help you with this one, I’m a pathological liar, aged 17, a result of bullying and depression since age 7. I also have a slight other problems and my depression isn’t cured, but I’m on it. I also have a sort of (and I say this because it’s not the clinical sort) multiple personality. It’s either my emotional depressed me, or the egocentric asshole liar me, there’s no in between.</p></div>		</li>
