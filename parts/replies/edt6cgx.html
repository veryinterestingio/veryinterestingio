			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently it's not very easy to condense them back to liquid and is beyond the ability of the average service station to have that equipment for the return it gives.</p>
<p>It's done at the refinery when the fuel truck returns because of the scale of quantity. It's also not massively economical, in fact in days gone by the refinery would just burn them to dispose of them (Some still do depending on where they are in the world), but as that is harmful to the atmosphere and we have a global temperature issue right now, nobody wants to be doing that.</p>
<p>It's about safety and pollution limitation rather than any sort of financial return.</p>
