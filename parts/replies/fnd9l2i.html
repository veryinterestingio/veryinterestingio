You are correct in saying that originally mammals fed on insects and/or small vertebrates and plant-eating evolved later. As early mammals were small creatures they likely hid in burrows and crevasses. There is an excellent book on the origin and evolution of mammals by my colleague Tom Kemp (published in 2005).</p></div>		</li>
