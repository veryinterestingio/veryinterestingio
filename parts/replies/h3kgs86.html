<p>Yup currently CO2 is at about 400 parts-per-million. Which means that for every 2500 liters of air there are only about 1 liter of CO2 gas.</p>
<p>Your normal box fan can move about 1000 liters/second. </p>
<p>Lets just assume that the Earth is flat to make the math a little easier. The City of Toronto has an area of 630km\^2. Most of the air is within 10km of the surface so that leads to a total volume of 6300km\^3. That is 6,300,000,000,000,000l of air or six quadrillion three hundred trillion liters. </p>
<p>Lets assume we want to move that volume of air thru the CO2 remover in 10 years. You would need about 20,000 box fans.</p>
<p>That is just for 1 city. How much would you need for the atmosphere? The Earths atmosphere is 4,200,000,000 km\^3. That means you need 133,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 box fans do the whole atmosphere in 10 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s hard to do that to cars because they have limited space, weight, and energy. It’s difficult even in factories and power plants because the air is still 80% nitrogen. You can’t easily just slap a hose on the exhaust connected to a storage tank. A lot of work has to be done to separate and contain CO2</p></div>		</li>

<p>What if instead of box fans we used Dyson's?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another problem is all of the processes require additional energy. We don't have anywhere near the clean energy overproduction to waste it on CO² capturing. For now or is still better to use it to burn less fossils.</p></div>		</li>
