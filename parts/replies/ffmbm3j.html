<p>I've heard there are a lot of similarities between being on the spectrum and ADHD. Stories like yours make me think that's probably true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great description, matches my experiences as well. To add to that, noise isn't the only thing that can cause overstimulation. I often get overstimulated by having my attention divided into more directions than I can handle. Noise might be the most common form of overstimulation, but I've even had it happen with touch or smell as the primary factors. </p>
<p>The best way I would describe it is like, imagine having a really tough day (as many are for us on the spectrum). While you're stressed and kinda frantic, suddenly someone slowly starts turning up the dials inside your head. Noises become louder, lights become brighter, and being touched can become painful/overwhelming. You don't realize it's happening on your end right away - why are the supermarket's lights being turned so much brighter? </p>
<p>It isn't really unique to autistic people exclusively, we are just dramatically more sensitive to it than the average person because most of our senses are on overdrive. To the average person the noise of a busy mall is fine, but if there were suddenly a hundred times more people and ten times louder and you're also having to perform crossword puzzles while dealing with it (social interaction adds an additional challenge), suddenly it becomes a lot more understandable how it could be so overwhelming. </p>
<p>It isn't a weakness of autistic people necessarily, just a consequence of our sometimes superhuman senses.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I’m on the spectrum and I also experience seizures. This is exactly what I experience, a building of painful intensity that occasionally triggers a full blown seizure. The lights are particularly a problem. I will sometimes wear sunglasses while shopping when it gets real bad, despite how embarrassing it is to look like an idiot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, you probably don't look like an idiot. Sunglasses are more associated with coolness or whatever, so wearing them is unlikely to make you look like a moron.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get sensory overloads with the onset of migraines. I bought a sleep mask to wear while just sitting at home and believe it or not, the pressure of elastic on my head from the sleep mask helps. Thought it might be worth a try for you too</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible there are more explanations, but the primary one would be stimming. Self-stimulatory behavior (also called stim/stimming) is often repetitive movements/noises that are quite common among people on the autism spectrum. Most autistic people have them in some capacity, but those of us that are 'high functioning' (not an entirely accurate term because some 'low functioning' autistic people live successful lives and some 'high functioning' autistic people struggle to make ends meet) just have learned which behaviors to mask and hide while around others.</p>
<p>Sometimes stimming is used to relieve tension when overstimulated - it feels like this pressure building inside of us and it has to come out somehow. Sometimes it's a way of keeping yourself on track, keeping your fidget-y body busy so your mind can tend to the important stuff - this is why fidget spinners help some autistic people. It can also be used to express feelings - even those of us who are verbal can become non-verbal when stressed or overstimulated, so stimming behaviors might be used as a way of communicating during those times (for example, tapping your foot faster and faster as you get more stressed out).</p>
<p>To give some personal examples, I don't really stim very much anymore and when I do it's usually pretty easy to hide behaviors (I touch my face/hair a lot, have a lot of particular speech patterns and phrases I fall into, and sometimes it's stuff that comes across as cute or funny instead of weird). But when I was in highschool one of my ways of stimming while in class and stressed/bored was to bite on my lip, and it would sometimes get so bad that it would bleed. This is definitely an example of a harmful stim that needs to be corrected and avoided, but some stimming can be beneficial so it really comes down to a case by case basis and it isn't always a good thing to suppress the stimming behavior, especially if it helps. </p>
<p>To grossly oversimplify, it's kind of like how when you get hurt you cry out in pain involuntarily. You can probably resist it if it isn't too severe, but vocalizing the pain and not holding it in helps with the pain kind of like scratching an itch. It's similar, except instead of just being limited to expressions of pain/discontent they can include any number of things that can make autistic people come across as strange or eccentric to others. But for autistic people those behaviors are just as natural as a sigh when you relax, or a scream when you're startled. It's a behavior that naturally responds to a stimuli.</p>
