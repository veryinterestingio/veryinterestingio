			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good answer, although I think saying the collisions are electron-electron or electron-nuclei is a bit misleading. The dominant source of scattering at anything above very low temps is almost always electron-phonon scattering. While phonons are collective modes of the lattice, I would not say that electrons collide with nuclei, since the electrons would be happy to propagate without any collision in a fixed lattice. They can of course scatter off impurity nuclei, but that is a negligible contribution above very low temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good clarification, thank you. It's always a hard balance to describe things simply enough without losing important details and distinctions, so I'm always happy when someone can expand on things in a better way than I thought of!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since we are being specific, isn't a phonon just the motion of nuclei in the lattice?  In that sense it's not really more right to say electron-phonon than electron-nuclei collisions.  Isn't the problem really that we're talking about collisions, when it is really just scattering due to the magnetic field being disrupted in an ordered crystal,  without actual collisions between the particles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually do think it is less correct to say electron-nuclei interactions. Phonons act as quasi-particles that  have different collective properties than the atomic nuclei. Importantly, as I alluded to above, fixed nuclei present a periodic potential to the electrons that gives rise to Bloch modes. Were the nuclei to remain fixed, electrons could effectively propagate through the crystal lattice in these modes without any scattering (i.e. with no resistance). Therefore, the electrons actually would have NO scattering (or collisions) with the nuclei were they to remain in their fixed lattice positions. However, the intuition of phonon scattering is that when the position of the nuclei is disturbed, the electrons no longer see a perfectly periodic potential and the Bloch modes will not propagate continuously. Therefore, the electrons scatter not off the nuclei but off of deviations in the position of the nuclei (i.e. quasi-particle phonons). The functional form and dependences of this scattering is in fact different than it would be if you were scattering off nuclei, too. I understand it seems a bit pedantic, but that is why I say it's more correct to say electrons scatter off phonons not nuclei.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the resistivity of semiconductors in general decreases with increasing temperature until they basically just become a metal, and this decreasing resistivity for silicon starts to happen at 160 C.  This can happen unintentionally with thermal runaway where you have a positive feedback loop causing your device to release its magic smoke.  You can even get current hogging in power transistors.  What's more common though is just having your intrinsic carrier concentration reach the level of your dopant concentration and you no longer have n-type or p-type silicon to even have function devices.</p>
<p>On the other hand you can have freeze out at low temperatures, where you just don't have enough ionized dopants.  Tends to be more of an issue with lightly doped stuff and isn't an issue at all if it's degenerately doped.  Course you can also go to the extreme where you have to remember silicon has an indirect bandgap and you no longer have enough phonons so your bandgap changes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, iirc temperature describes a the probability distribution of velocities for a particle or a group of particles. So if a particles has a high temperature, it is more likely to have a high velocity. The <em>most likely</em> (which is often but not always the average) velocity is defined as v_th = sqrt[2<em>k_b</em>T/m]. At room temperature (or 300 Kelvin) the thermal velocity to an electron ≈ sqrt[2<em>k_b</em>300/9.11e-3] ≈ 95,538 m/s</p>
