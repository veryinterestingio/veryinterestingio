			<div class="markdown"><p>The only one I'll point out is that Japanese is written top to bottom and right to left when written in the traditional style. However, since the end of WWII horizontal writing from left to right as is common in the West has become very common. At this point its pretty much a wash between seeing both forms in daily life. When I took Japanese the professor at the time expected us to write in the traditional way for essays and more formal papers, but to write in the horizontal for day to day tasks. He explained to us that while we may see the traditional form in Japan often, most people wrote left to right for daily tasks, texts, emails, etc..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems to my untrained eye that there's some consistency there.</p>
<p>Main articles seem to be in traditional style, but what looks to be the advertisements, diagram labels and minor snippets are in left-to-right style, so as to make best use of the space available.</p>
<p>It makes sense to me that there'd be an attempt to find balance between form and function, at least according to what I understand* about Japanese etiquette and formality.</p>
<p>* Which might not be enough. I could be completely wrong here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>just want to add that writing tools were also different and better suited for the direction of the language's word order--not right or left handedness.  </p>
<p>Europe had pens, right handedness was better suited and lefties would have smudges of ink on since words were written left to right.  </p>
<p>The east Asians (Chinese, Japanese, Korean etc) had these brushes that you hold vertically straight with no tilt that pens require, hence when writing right to left, you wouldn't smudge the inked words on the paper or your hands. this was not because lefties were accommodated to but because brushes were the writing tool</p></div>		</li>

<p>That might sorta kinda make sense, if you were working on a tablet, you started from the center, and you just kept rotating the tablet as you went.</p></div>		</li>
