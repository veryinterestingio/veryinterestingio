<p>A dimensional analysis alone doesn't capture that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but in the case of air, it's pretty reasonable. Viscosity for air is pretty much zero right? I don't know much fluid mechanics, but dimensional analysis is super powerful for situations like this I feel</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree dimensional analysis can be powerful for something like this. We use arguments like this all the time to form experimental hypotheses. For it to be correct though, it requires you already <em>really</em> know all the properties and parameters in play.</p>
<p>Like you say, you need to neglect any other property with time dimensions: viscosity, ambient pressure, acceleration+, etc. For explanatory purposes, this is largely throwing the baby out. So I'd call it a mathematical explanation, that comes along with a large amount of presupposed physics (including neglecting the viscous force).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea you’re right, dimensional analysis is better. And it “seems” negligible </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For large objects and high speeds viscosity is negligible, but this is not immediately clear, and if you want to study a dust particle the analysis doesn't work any more. Be aware of assumptions you make, and check if you can make them in the case you consider.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Units and dimensions in the same equation? Ewww. Is it kilogram-metre / Telsa squared, or  Boltzmann constant × gravitational acceleration × mass / time sqaured? Lol. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Kg x mass? Those are the same thing</p>
