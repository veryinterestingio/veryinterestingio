			<div class="markdown"><p>Best ELI5 answer here. How does the &quot;recognizing something is very wrong&quot; happen? Is only if you eat something that your body thinks is bad (spicy, contaminated, etc) or can it also happen if you eat something and halfway freak out it's bad (eating food more raw than you're used to and thinking it's going to make you sick, but isn't actually contaminated food)?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Maybe at our current level of knowledge. Gut microbiome looks like an incredibly promising area of research - the symbiosis we have with our various bacterial colonies is almost certainly more active and influential than we understand today. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mexican food tends to be rich, spicy, and have a lot of fiber from the beans. If your body is not used to fiber or if you consumed too much grease, you get the runs.</p></div>		</li>
