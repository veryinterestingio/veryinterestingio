			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I ask you why regenerative cooling uses so many lines of coolant rather than broad, shallow channels? Wouldn’t that be less weight, and couldn’t you broaden the channels along their length in manufacture to control pressure in the coolant over the range of thermal exchange?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a balancing act of cooling and structure. Also good to note that the axial heat transfer is pretty decent. You can conduct heat on all sides of the channel. It can be profitable to make more channels than one large channel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the main reason is that the small channels act like air moving over a heat sink. More, smaller channels translates to more metal/fluid contact and more heat transfer for the same flow rate</p></div>		</li>
