			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't realize refinement was such an expensive procedure. I figured given the volume they manufacture, it would be only pennies to refine a gallon of gas. However, now that I am reading all the comments, things make sense. Taxes are a pain, then they also need to move the gas to the pump ... and, of course, the guy selling the gallon of gas also wants to make some money. </p>

<p>Refining is actually very complicated.  <a href="http://www.reactor-resources.com/assets/images/ProcessFlowDiagram.png" target="_blank">Here</a> is a high-level diagram of the processes a typical refinery carries out.</p>
<p>I think most people know that refining involves separating crude oil into different products (e.g. gas/petrol, diesel, jet fuel, etc.).  But that only accounts for two of the boxes in the figure (atmospheric distillation and vacuum distillation).  The entire process is an order of magnitude more complicated than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Higher complexity refineries have higher operating expenses, but can also squeeze more high-value product out of each barrel of crude. They can also make more money by processing heavy sour crudes, and can actually lose money if they can't get cheap shitty crude. <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/vOTpB7D/new" target="_blank">Here</a> are some generic figures to show the differences between types of refineries and what value they can get from a barrel of crude. Note that they had to buy crude at a number lower than the direct refining value (DRV) in order to make a profit off that barrel. These numbers are based off 2007 average spot prices for the products.</p>
<p>Also, you'll see <a href="http://imgur.com/vJNzKWr" target="_blank">here</a> that refining is actually a very small part of the total value chain on a barrel of crude. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just that it's expensive. There are multiple tiers of supply and demand. Gasoline is a perishable good and there are seasonal and regional formulations that are not interchangeable.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cost of transporting it comes into play, too. </p>
<p>You would expect Jersey, being the only state left where it is illegal to pump your own  gas, to have higher prices per gallon because all stations are full service. However, prices tend to be the same or slightly lower than many self service markets just because so much refining actually takes place in Jersey. </p>
<p>Edit: as a side note, gas stations make very little profit from actually selling gas. Most of their profits come from food and beverage sales in the stores or automotive work if they have a shop. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I'm an economist.  This is, to be blunt, just incorrect.  The cost of refining is small portion of total at the pump gasoline costs, and by far the largest factor is the price of crude.  </p>
<p>Here's some data from 2014 showing the price composition of at the pump gasoline in California.  As you can see, while there are minor fluctuations in refinery costs, it's nowhere near significant enough to explain the slow lowering of end user gasoline prices when commodity crude goes down in price.  </p>
<p><a href="http://energyalmanac.ca.gov/gasoline/margins/index.php" target="_blank">http://energyalmanac.ca.gov/gasoline/margins/index.php</a></p>
<p>What's actually happening is that at the pump gas prices aren't a particularly efficient market, and we see downward price mobility as 'sticky' and slower to reflect lower crude prices for the profit driven reasons one would expect.  Upward crude price movements translate quite quickly.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's completely correct in that the cost of crude is only a portion of the total cost of a gallon of gas, but fails to account for the costs of taxes and marketing which take up more money together than refinement. </p>
<p>In the site you linked for 2014, for example, the price of crude is about 2/3 the retail cost ($2.50/$4). If the cost of crude were to be cut in half, the cost would go from $4 a gallon to $2.75 assuming all the savings were passed on to the consumer, which is rather close to the example posed in OP's question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not enough upvotes!!!  The premise of this question is wrong.  Crude was, from 2011 to mid 2014, around $100 a barrel.  Gas at the pump was averaging 3.70.  In the past 6 months, crude is around 60 a barrel (40% lower) and gas is averaging around 2.25 a gallon.  Shockingly, 2.25 is about 40% lower than 3.60.  The two DO trend very closely together but lag due to delays in refining/transport costs and supply/demand that allows for prices to go down in the first place.  Just because today a barrel of crude is worth less than it was yesterday doesn't mean that today a fuel depot is willing to sell their gasoline at a loss.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What reason do you have for believing that oil markets (or at least gasoline markets) &quot;aren't particularly efficient&quot;? </p>
<p>You would expect anything involving commodities excluding monopoly situations (like diamonds) to be extremely efficient. Frankly there are few markets you'd expect to be more efficient than oil and gasoline markets. Product differentiation isn't important. There are a large number of suppliers and a large number of consumers. There is an extensive infrastructure network for transportation both intra and internationally. There are very well developed and high volume energy derivatives markets that a huge number of financial institutions are involved in.</p>
<p>Where is the inefficiency coming in?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think I communicated uncleanly or you misunderstood me.  Not commodity gasoline, point of sale gasoline that you put in your car has an inefficient price finding mechanism.  Opportunity cost of finding cheaper gas, for instance, just as an arbitrary example.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The price of refining gasoline isn't the reason for the lack of a drop in price at the pump. Go back and look at oil prices in the early 2000's - the price per barrel in 2004 was right at or around what it is now, and I was paying around $1.25 at the pump. The cost to refine gasoline has dropped in the last decade, but even if it were to have held steady that wouldn't change anything. Also, the federal gasoline tax has held steady at 18.4¢/gallon since 1993. Most states havent changed their gasoline taxes either. The oil companies are simply price gouging, plain and simple. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: I was wrong!  I retract my statement. Looking at all of the data points, the average refinery cost/profit in 1999 was 45 cents. In 2014 it was 39 cents.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), however, which issues the “Official Energy Statistics from the U.S. Government” the average cost at the pump for a gallon of gasoline is broken down as follows:</p>
<p>74% - Cost of the crude oil
11% - Taxes
10% - Refining costs
5% - Distribution and marketing</p>
<p>So even though refining costs have dropped, the vast majority of the price at the pump is still based on the price of crude. When the price of crude drops and the price at the pump barely moves, that's the oil companies price gouging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what data you're looking at. That site gives you about 30 data points per year. Looking at 2004 (the year I originally used in my example) the refinery cost/profit ranges from about 25-74¢ in 2004 to about 18-70¢/gallon in 2014. Without plugging in each data point to get an average, it definitely appears that the actual dollar cost to refine gasoline has dropped, and accounting for inflation the dollar cost of refining has dropped even further.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not necessarily gouging, it's more a matter of demand. The global demand has gone up significantly, while global refining capacity has not. So there is more pressure on the refining capacity to keep up with demand, thus the market allows them to charge more. I'm not saying that is <em>fair</em> to everyone, but they're charging what they do because enough people are willing and able to pay that much.</p></div>		</li>
