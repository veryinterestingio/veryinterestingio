<p>Basically the wheel let's you scroll through the live footage instantly. Something happened that was one of your cameras (you have most likely 2-4 cameras assigned) you scroll back to the beginning of the action (takes about 2-3 seconds) and call the director you have the replay ready</p>
<p>When he wants to show it to the audience, he tells the editor (guy choosing which cameras to go on air) which point of view to take and tells you when to start playing the footage. Depending on nature of the action you play back in real time or slowmo.</p>
<p>All this can happen in less than 10 seconds if needed. </p>
<p>After the replay was shown, or when the director does not want the footage at that moment, you mark the beginning and end of the phase/play/action and store it in a memory bank for later use. We used to have a separate bank for the summary of the game (when the game is done you sometimes see the highlights, this is most likely done with the EVS).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The director is the one choosing which shots go on air, not an “editor”. The producer is who talks to replay ops and what angle, etc and tells director the replay is good to go to</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also in our trainings we never had the full crew, roles could be merged depending on the amount of people available.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does someone get a job like that director position? I'm just curious what kind of career path that takes, like can they come from regular TV directing or does it take special training?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you graduate as director I guess it has mainly to do with the approach you want to take yourself. You'll probably start of looking for assistant directing jobs in the TV world (instead of movie) and try to get the jobs which are sports related.</p>
<p>Having subjects at school that involve multi-cam production will of course help.</p></div>		</li>
