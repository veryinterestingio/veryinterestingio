<p>It’s kind of true. Grease is where all the flavor is when you’re cooking meat.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I make the 'grilled cheese' / sandwich, then spread a small amount of mayo on side A [outer exterior slice of bread], then small amount of butter on top of the mayo, on side A [with salt and pepper on top of that] and let it heat  for a final 20-30s [fats and salt/pepper taste stronger/better when burned].</p>
<p>Then eat with side A making direct contact with your tongue.</p>
<p>You can do a lot with 2-3g each of mayo and butter.</p></div>		</li>
