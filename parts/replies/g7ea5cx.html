			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer and I was thinking it may have been enzyme related. If it helps, the question came up because I had squeezed and strained both the night before and they looked quite different: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/FVnMCFi.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/FVnMCFi.jpg</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, pectic enzymes that degrade pectins and cause them to fall out of solution (and bringing other stuff with it) could be an additional factor. For home-squeezed situations, they’re not produced by the fruit itself (as far as I’m aware) but could possibly be produced by wild fungi that live on the fruit. But my gut tells me that there wouldn’t be enough of them to give you this effect at large. It’s certainly used in industrial settings, though.</p></div>		</li>
