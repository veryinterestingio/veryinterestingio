When he gets there everyone basically treats him like a novelty item. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly Heinlein's a time for the stars. It contains some good but simplified thought experiments on time dilation due to accelerating to near light speed. In the book's universe telepathy is real and proved to ignore light speed limitations. Earth sends out exploratory ships with telepaths on board who talk back to telepaths on earth until they get too close to light speed and then because of the relative time frames the telepaths stop being able to understand each other.</p>
<p>Because of having &quot;in universe&quot; concrete proof of faster than light information travel they develop (but never explain) physical ftl travel so by time the explorer ship calls for help it's just a short hop for a rescue ship and most of the universe has already been settled leaving the explorers as historical oddities.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That part really upset me too and nobody talks about it. </p>
<p>The first booo set up how close they were and how they were such good friends and had the whole “together forever” vibe and then it seemed like almost immediately they had to say goodbye forever in the second book. I felt so bad for them because as soon as Ender left on his ship you knew that was it, no going back, she was gone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please read the next books. The story is great and it also tackles some important philosophical problems. The prequels are less philosophical, but they are nice to read also, as they convey some backstory and help bring the whole world together. The shadow series was my favourite prequel. It shows the life of homeless children struggling to survive on the streets - Ender's future allies. I'm not gonna tell you anything else, just go read the books!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more classic Sci fi and less hard but time dilation is also a huge part of the hyperion cantos. In the first book at the end the last story features a pair of lovers who only meet at intermittent points in the woman's life due to her husband leaving on constant space trips for the Navy, he remains in his 20s through the story while she goes from 18 to 25 to 34.. ect. Great series highly recommend it. </p></div>		</li>
