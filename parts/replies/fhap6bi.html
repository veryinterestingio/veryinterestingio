			<div class="markdown"><p>In the UK housewives are very proud of their double glazing. If you marry an Englishman and you meet their parents at their house and it's a detached property with double glazing, then compliment both things. And pretend you need to sit down from shock if they built a conservatory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because many houses in the UK are old, and they were deliberately built so as to let drafts in. They were intended to be heated by open coal fires, and open fires only burn well with a good strong supply of fresh oxygen.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to the last 40-or-so years and even the oldest British houses have been converted to have modern central heating. At that point the deliberate drafts of cold damp air become a nuisance rather than a necessity, and a lot of money is spent to make previously-drafty houses warmer. Which includes double-glazing the windows.</p>
<p>The reason people get so houseproud about it is because converting a typical house from single- to double-glazing involves a significant financial outlay: many thousands of £££. Just like buying an expensive car, when people have spent a lot of money on improving their property, they like to be complimented on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also inert gas leakage in windows starts at 10%  per year generally. So when purchasing windows really pay attention, because 5 years down the road those windows you spent thousands extra on will be little better than non argon filled windows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have read the leakage rate is closer to 1%, not 10%.
We have all triple-paned windows for 10+ years and there is no sign of water vapor (that would indicate a leak) on any of them.
I'm not saying there is no leakage, just that I don't think it's anywhere near 10% unless damaged.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Workmanship is the biggest variable in the leakage rate. This article compares the standardized manufacturing processes and quality of product, and the results are quite surprising.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, but in truth there isn’t a huge difference... and that 10% leakage rate isn’t totally accurate in that you don’t loose 10% every year and 10 years down the road there isn’t any argon left. because as it leaks out air takes its place and mixes with the gas so the first year it might leak out 10% argon, it’s now 90 argon 10 air. that mixes up and next year it replaces some of the gas and air with different air. So it would loose 9% argon and 1% air. And so on and so forth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Google &quot;window U value chart&quot; to take a look at the raw data. There's also different exterior glass coatings (like low e) that can improve thermal efficiency as well. There's a lot of combinations now. </p>
<p>Honestly what's 'best' depends on a lot of other factors too including window size, climate, and what direction the window faces as well. Added efficiency isn't necessarily required, cost efficient or even wanted in some temperate climates so it's not an easy question to answer that would cover everyone's situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. It doesn't matter what structure, technology, etc. Just look at the U-value (every product should have this info) and it tells you how well it insulates.</p>
<p>Of course then there are things like longevity and other features people look at but for how well it insulates the U-value of the product itself is what matters.</p>
<p>Then for the final end result you need to see where and how well it is installed (wall design, location of window in relation to wall insulation, how airtight, etc.)</p>
<p>For A/C energy savings there are other things like IR&amp;UF filter films, coatings or whatever which can significantly lower excess heating of the structure, but I have limited experience and knowlege on that side.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In cold climates my philosophy has been super thick wall insulation (not thin &amp; effective because that won't let it breathe and you're facing dangerous issues with humidity being trapped. So thick highly insulation with good ability to pass moisture through the insulation layer. </p>
<p>Then get good enough (not the modt important thing in the house in this sense  since it's only low sqare footage and they neve insulate at super high level). High quality windows and install them super well (often requires several weeks to assess the result then adjust, seriously rare for all of them to be 100%, some _will_ get condensation...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Tl, Dr: Focus on wall insulation: it can be gotten to extremely high U-levels, retrofit many times easy. With windows just not too poor quality and too low U-value and that's fine.  Don't spend for insane U-values there.</p></div>		</li>
