<p>P.S: While I haven't seen research on it I'm also guessing that your attitude changes how deep you sleep. At least I tend to sleep extremely deeply if I'm a place where I feel safe, even if the noise levels are pretty high, but if I sleep in a place where I can't lock the door or in a tent or if someone else is in the room...much lighter sleeper.</p>

<p>This is really interesting. My gf is a very light sleeper. So maybe this is why she sleeps better in certain places.</p>
<p>If you do know any verified studies around this it would be really interesting to know.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I know part of this one. So sleep hygiene plays a part in how well we can fall (and stay) asleep. By sleep hygiene I mean :</p>
<ol>
<li>Making sure all light sources are eliminated from the sleeping place. This can mean : covers over LED lights, phone facedown, shutting off pc, making sure you have quality light blocking blinds/shutters.</li>
<li>Ensuring your body is as relaxed as it can be to go to bed. This may mean a nice warm shower, wearing socks to bed, or using a calming scent or noise (white noise, calming oceans or your favourite childhood audiobook). Or, being in what our mind considers a &quot;safe space&quot;. That space is totally up to the individual. </li>
<li>Temperature is important. Socks. Help regulate body temp. Wear them unless you are uncomfortable doing so. Make sure your room is not too cold or too warm. Too warm can cause night terrors (purely anecdotal, but had 10+ sources indicate summer and overheating in sleep was correlated to night terrors. Myself included).</li>
<li>No screen time 30mins or more before bed. Blue light from screens can cause stimulation in the brain,keeping you awake.</li>
<li>Meditation. Relax. So hard for us that have anxiety. But make lists of sh*t that needs to be done tomorrow so you don't wake at 4am going &quot;*<em>, </em>,, i need to do xxx!&quot; make a list before you go to bed of things you must complete the next day, if required. Helps the 4am anxieties of &quot;FUCK DID I REMEMBER TO DO THAT?!&quot;</li>
<li>Meds. Some medications can cause insomnia or issues with sleep. If you have recently started a medication, talk with your gp or local pharmacist</li>
<li>If none of this helps, go see your gp.</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't know how relevant this is, but popped it up here in case anyone needs it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I'm too warm I wake up every 10-30 minutes, but I still feel rested. If I only part of me is too warm, like if I roll on top of my charging phone or bunch up my heated blanket, I do feel that pain in my dreams. A bunched up heating blanket made me dream about getting in a car wreck and laying on the ground next to the burning car unable to move.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meh. I pretty much sleep like a rock no matter what if I'm in my own bed and not sick. My SO does all this sleep hygiene stuff and struggles to sleep well ever. I'm not saying it won't help anybody, just that it's not &quot;the reason&quot; OP is looking for.</p></div>		</li>
