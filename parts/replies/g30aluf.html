			<div class="markdown"><p>With respect to change of color: what can happen with really old bricks is cracking and flaking as well. In climates where you get frozen winters, water (especially salt spray from winter storms near oceans or seas) gets in there and freezes and expands, slowly flaking the brick and adding cracks that darken it. </p>
<p>The water can also erode the mortar (which has lime and dissolves over time in acidic rain conditions), and causes that mortar to show less of the white lime and more of the darker sand that's in it. So very old brick buildings don't regain 100% of their shine even with a power washing, and eventually you have to get the bricks &quot;repointed&quot; - replace their mortar - to help keep the water out.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really interesting, I've been in my room for around 13 years or something like that now and I was curious about why bricks would turn so dark after some years, I've also seen lots of older bricks around my neighborhood that are like that, some of them darker and some brighter and more &quot;saturated&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, within European and European style buildings in urban areas and predating 1920, smog may be prevalent. It may be visible more on film, as brick was like Bob Dylan. Invisible in the 80s. Its only recently been valued and much more commonly restored now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At A&amp;M there was a building built where the architect was from UT, so the architect selected a brick that was initially to spec, but faded to a UT burnt orange after a number if years. Or at least that's the story that was told on a tour several years ago in the before times.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Bricks become darker over time because they are porous (lots of little holes in them) that can be filled with dirt. Power-washing can bring them back to life :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When they rebuilt 10 Downing Street in the 60s, they cleaned the &quot;black&quot; bricks and found out that they were actually just yellow with a couple hundred years of grime. So they were painted black to keep the appearance people expected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hahaha, this question appeared on my head yesterday night when I was bored looking at the bricks on my wall questioning why they have that color specifically, got lots of interesting answers and I learned a lot about bricks. I guess that's going to be somehow useful in a future (?)</p></div>		</li>
