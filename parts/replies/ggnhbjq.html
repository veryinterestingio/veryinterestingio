			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh my gosh, yes. Right below my bra line started bulging out before my baby bump fully took form. That baby is now 10 and that bra line bulge is totally still there. Only I notice it, of course, but it forever changed the shape of my torso.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look out for the phantom kicks after baby is born. For a few months after both of my pregnancies I felt them randomly and it felt like I still had a baby in there kicking around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Idk how squeamish you or your partner are, but if your Dr is cool and you want to- ask of they can catch the baby. My ob &quot;delivered&quot; the baby into my husband hands and he got to put the baby on my belly/chest. With our first we didn't know the babies gender so he got to say it's a boy. It was so cool!!</p>
<p>Also- you will have monster blood clots for like, 3 days. Drink water so much you feel like you will float away, especially if you nurse. You'll still bleed for a while, but it always seemed after 3 days the worst of the clots were out. No one warned me of that so when I was in the shower several hours after delivery and a clot the size of my hand plopped out, it was a bit disconcerting!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After the baby is born, when you lay on your side, your stomach lays next to you. That was a bizarre twist. </p>
<p>And for when you get older (after babies or significant weight gain) that uterus can apparently slip right the fuck on out. Or so I've been told and it's a terrifying concept.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. As do I. </p>
<p>I found out from a friend who’s a nurse and walked in on a woman who didn't know her innards were hanging out.  I asked my friend to stop talking, she did not. She thought she was so funny. </p>
<p>I'm still significantly traumatized and hope having two c-sections prevents such a possibility. But I'll chose ignorance on this one. I do not want to know.</p>
<p>You hear that Reddit? I do not want to know.</p></div>		</li>
