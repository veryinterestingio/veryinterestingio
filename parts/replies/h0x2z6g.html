All the alcohol gets into your system eventually but your blood alcohol probably never gets as high as it would with the same amount of alcohol on an empty stomach. You are also just likely to drink slower if you feel full.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not saying that food in your stomach would change anything about how your body eliminates the alcohol.</p>
<p>I’m saying that if alcohol gets into your bloodstream more slowly, the peak blood alcohol will be less. Imagine if the rate of absorption of alcohol was slowed to be equal to the rate at which it can be metabolized. The blood alcohol would go up slightly, but never increase above that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not harassing you in any way about the typo....but what if all the alcohol one drank WAS metabolized somehow by one's lover? Your  significant other could get drunk by you drinking. You guys could be thousands of miles apart and suddenly you start to get giddy and stumble over your own feet. You panic for a moment then think to yourself, &quot;So n so is out drinking again!&quot; You're in a meeting so you can't leave but you're also making a fool of yourself. How crazy would that be?!</p></div>		</li>
