<p>maybe this is why I seem immune to motion sickness, even in some of the most notorious VR or on boats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>most sci-fi focuses on illusions that take place within the context of a single sense, like the idea of being in an escher-like non-euclidian space.  But I think its because we don't have great intuitive or scientific understanding of synesthesia to be able to play with the idea of sense conflict very much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s also just generally difficult to convey that type of illusion in traditional media. Text on a page isnâ€™t going to cover it. Neither is audio or video. You need something like VR or a really tricked out physical set in a walk-through attraction to do stuff like this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work with those big shelves that you can move with spinning handles, like in archives.</p>
<p>Once I was looking at a shelf and someone moved it. Somehow my brain couldn't comprehend the wall moving closer, concluded I must have been falling away from it, and I lost my balance as it tried to figure it out with my inner ear.</p>
<p>Great experience, 10/10 would do it again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sensory conflict becomes horror very quickly, e.g. seeing something moving but making no noise, hearing or feeling something that you canâ€™t see, sound and visuals not lining up.  Common in both movies and games.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is similar to how someone can suffer motion or seasickness; my eyes from inside the boat show me I'm stationary, but the internal balance systems of my ears say were moving about all over the place.</p>
<p>The brain freaks out at this conflict with floods of hormones and such, leading to varied levels of nausea and vertigo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People are mentioning GPS for an example, but you are on the path of a better example.
When people end up in cars underwater, they donâ€™t have visual orientation and gravity affecting them as normal. Many people die because they swim in the wrong direction instead of straight up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, which is why this works this way. If you arenâ€™t on solid ground, your body ignores which way is down, so you donâ€™t know which direction to swim.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was swimming in a nearby lake with some friends when I was a kid. Jumping off the boat into the water. Doing flips and shit. I did a backwards flip into the water and after going in started swimming back &quot;up&quot;. I noticed it was taking too long so I opened my eyes to look. Mostly just brown muddy water. That is, until I hit the bottom. I was already nearly out of breath. I immediately righted myself and pushed off the bottom with my legs as hard as I could and swam like a fucking mad man to the surface. Felt like I nearly blacked out by the time I broke to the top. Didn't do no more flips that day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I forget exactly what it was but I was watching a show where some regular people were doing military training and one of the activities was to train for a helicopter crash into water and the emphasis of the training was simple. &quot;DO NOT PANIC&quot;.</p>
<p>Escaping and all that wasn't hard so long as you didn't panic, it is however quite difficult to not panic when you are crashing into water in a helicopter. Even with it being just a simulation with divers all around to save you, someone still panicked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good analogy are all the truck drivers who keep getting their trucks stuck on the railroad crossing in our town even though there are signs everywhere saying your going to get stuck on that hill. They rely on their navigation system way too much.  It's not uncommon for semis to get stuck and sometimes hit by trains in downtown Kennesaw GA. They are completely redoing the roads here soon to turn that into a pedestrian only crossing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>same thing happens in VT, the problem is often that truckers are from a good ways away and their nav tool won't let them choose another route, or the trucker doesn't know how to adjust the route, or they don't have enough time to adjust the route. and then they find out they don't have enough time to get rescued from a mountain either.</p></div>		</li>
