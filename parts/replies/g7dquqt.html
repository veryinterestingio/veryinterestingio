			<div class="markdown"><p>the Chinese are the only ancient civilization that im aware of that actually did a 6th option: they would build a farming/supply colony and in addition to sending their army, they would have like a farmer corps that would raise animals and even plant and harvest crops to  supply the soldiers on campaign.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have definitely heard it used in the context of waging war, but that was throughout my studies and I dont know where I would find those references at this point. But as the wiki says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The tuntian system had its origins in the military, and for much of the Han dynasty the land in question was farmed by soldiers on orders of the military authorities; in this case all of the crop harvested was to be kept by the military for supply uses ...  <em>Cao Cao's innovation was the introduction of the 'civilian tuntian' on a large scale both for common people and for soldiers during peacetime</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>the language is a bit open to interpretation here, but the way I read is that the tuntian system was a military thing, but then Cao Cao made it also a peacetime civilian thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, sorta. The Mongols ate a lot of horse dairy, sure, but that just moved the problem back a layer. Horses gotta eat, too. And making sure their horses had enough fodder was a constant problem, not just for the Mongols, but for all the steppe nomads. An army of ten thousand horse archers has to travel with a herd of forty thousand horses. If they don't keep moving, they'll eat the grass down to the roots in a matter of days.</p>
<p>That meant that if the defenders could lock up all the food in fortified towns and castles, the Scythians or Huns or Cumans or Kipchaks or Mongols or whoever it was this century had just a few weeks to break in, or they'd have to give up and go home. The Mongols broke the game for a generation by inventing/stealing/buying siege equipment that could break down walls before the food ran out. (As an aside, it would be more correctly called assault equipment, because the whole point was that it was an alternative to laying siege to the place and waiting out the defenders) But that only worked until their enemies got better at building forts, which happened approximately overnight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like the age old arms race.  Better seige equipment, better fortifications.</p>
<p>I would think that finding food for 40,000 horses would be easier than 10,000 humans.  The horse milk would be more nutritious than most non-perishable foods and you conserve energy/time riding the horses.  Whatever they were doing seemed to work out pretty well.  You are obviously way more knowledgeable about this than I am though. </p>
<p>I stumbled upon the Mongolian horse milk thing when I got curious why we don't drink horse milk now.  Turns out its gaining popularity.</p></div>		</li>
