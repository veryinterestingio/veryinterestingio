			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm actually in residual stage (think of it like 'remission' for cancer), but I did use to hallucinate visually as well. I've also had tactile hallucinations (touch), but as to my knowledge I haven't had any smell or taste hallucinations.</p>
<p>I can't really answer your second question because schizophrenia is very complex and can vary wildly from person to person. There are people who just hear things- not even all of people who have auditory hallucinations hear voices. There are people who hallucinate constantly, some that hallucinate periodically, and some who don't hallucinate at all. Hallucination is just one part of the combo meal that is schizophrenia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I experience auditory hallucinations sometimes right before I fall asleep. It's called hypnogogia I believe. Very common with people who experience sleep paralysis. Anyway, it's usually unintelligible whispers or sometimes just somebody yelling. It is a really bizarre sensation because they seem so obviously localized outside of my body. </p>

<p>Were you visual hallucinations clear? I experience something from sleep paralysis, but they are always just vague &quot;entities,&quot; never anything I could actually describe. I just always malicious intentions from them.</p></div>		</li>
