			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an amusing situation that comes up in 3D printing. PLA is non-Newtonian while molten. When laying down an extrusion it’s possible to cleanly ‘snap’ the excess plastic off by a rapid ‘hop’ with the printhead in the direction normal to the plane.</p>
<p>So it’s possible to harden it midair too while it’s stuck between a surface and a ‘container’</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As long as it just sits on the table, nothing happens, gravity doesn't matter to it. When it is poured, you get shear stresses from the flow and it does its thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is easier to understand if you look at the strain rate rather than the stress. If the fluid is deforming rapidly, the viscosity increases. If it is stationary or nearly so, no viscosity increase.</p></div>		</li>
