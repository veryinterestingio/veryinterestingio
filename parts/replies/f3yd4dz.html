			<div class="markdown"><p>The cathedral was built 150 years before that, 1072. It was then damaged in 1141 by a fire and an earthquake in 1185.</p>
<p>The reason the central collapsed in 1237 was due to it being rebuilt in the gothic style, which tried many new and often rather untested things, causing the accident. That had little to do with &quot;getting it wrong&quot; in regards to old techniques, they were doing new things entirely and as such had to (re)invent many things which they often didn't have the means to fully calculate.</p>
<p>It then stood without failure until 1549, so I'd say they got it pretty right.</p></div>		</li>
