			<div class="markdown"><p>Active-noise-cancelling headphones, even the cheap ones, are great for this.  Often when flying I'll just put the headphones on, not plugged in to anything, and have the active-noise-cancelling turned on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For flying i wouldn't recommend cheap ones because the noise is really intense and cheap ones propably wont meet your expectstions.</p>
<p>I did around 32x1,5h flights with the Sony WH-1000XM3 and they are AMAZING and totally worth their money as their not only have good anc but an extremely good and balanced sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a caveat to this. Do not by the ear buds from Sony. Buy the over the ear headphones. </p>
<p>The earbuds noise canceling is decent but not the same quality as over the ears, and the one benefit of looking moderately normal during phone calls is ruined by the fact phone calls are barely a functional feature on them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use my XM3s almost exclusively for flying. They have spent hundreds of hours on my head. Absolutely worth every penny. Battery life is long enough for trans-Pacific flights. ANC is great.</p>
<p>Recently tried the airpod pros for a short flight, and while it's a bit more comfortable, the ANC is not nearly as good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a misconception… noise canceling isn’t as helpful as noise dampening. Audiologists often recommend dampening for people looking to reduce sensory input. If you want real relief- go with ear muffs (the plastic dampening kind like in woodwork not warmth) or ear plugs. Easily $20.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I tried many types, all other ones were hurting my ear after an hour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i recommend the silicon ones, they are the most comfortable especially of you're the type who sleep on the side of their heads whether in a plane or in bed</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I found that works is the molded type as your image suggests. The surface is closed and doesn't absorb body oils. There are cheaper versions that have open cell foam exposed to the skin of the ear canal. They seam to suck up skin oil and lead to irritation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recommend buying in bulk. Sometimes these are £4 for 4 or £10 for 100. </p>
<p>On my last flight I had earplugs, eye mask, a neck wrap pillow, facemask, and it was bliss. Next time I want a pillow with a hole in it like a massage table so I can flop forward on it and sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Buy silicone earplugs. They are typically marketed to swimmers, you can find them on Amazon or in Walmart in the sporting goods section. They are amazing, so much better at noise reduction that foam plugs, and more comfortable too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They aren’t though. Typical silicone ear plugs have an NRR of 22. Typical foam plugs like the ones listed above are usually around 32-33.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>check into &quot;Etymotic&quot; earplugs. theyre designed to reduce all frequencies evenly and you can still hear speech and music very clearly, just quieter. not so muffled as traditional earplugs.</p></div>		</li>
