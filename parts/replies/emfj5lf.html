<p>Uncle-in-law worked for DNR when Wild Kingdom did a video with them catching elk. In the show, they look like they catch 3-4 different elk. He said they only caught one the whole time; they just had a bunch of cameras around and each angle looked different enough...</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is Planet Earth, not Snatch.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And then we filmed over three years, and we spend a record 3,500 days in the field. To give you an idea, that means every final minute of the show you watch, we spent 10 days in the field.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but that's not BBC. Some of it is also over edited to make storylines that weren't really there </p>
<p>For example a bird landing by another bird can be edited to be this pretty important encounter, when in real life it was there for like 15 seconds and was on its way</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is some of that, particularly the example of the polar bear birth, in Frozen Planet, which was actually filmed in a man-made wildlife centre.
Of course the one thing the rarely gets any criticism, is the sound for the shows, which is almost completely artificial and added in post production. With most of the lengths they have to go to get footage, there’s just no actual way for them to record the sound properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find the post-production sound to be completely reasonable and necessary in theory, but frustrating in practice. The sound was much too over the top and obviously off in Planet Earth 2, an otherwise almost flawless series.</p></div>		</li>
