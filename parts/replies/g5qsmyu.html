			<div class="markdown"><p>I came across this video a couple weeks ago, funny coincidence to see this question pop up now. Love that channel, there's so many videos on things I had never even considered, things that on the surface seem completely dull and mundane, but he makes them all interesting.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Proof that expertise on even the most ridiculous topic is better than watching some dumbass kid make a tribute video for your favourite video game. In fact, it's almost worse, because the kid is probably dropping tons of random slurs.</p></div>		</li>
