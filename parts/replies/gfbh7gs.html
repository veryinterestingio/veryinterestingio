			<div class="markdown"><p>Both are nerves telling you they’re unhappy. One is them telling you to stop shaking them; one is telling you that the top layer of your skin is uncomfortably cold, despite your blood flow doing its best. Itch is one of our nerves’ most powerful adaptations to try to alter our behavior.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An allergy pill worked for you?! I’m gonna have to try it. For years a brisk walk or bike ride and my parts of skin will start to itch so badly it feels like I’m on fire. Usually my arms or where the waist band of my trousers touch my skins. Sometimes it is so bad I was to scratch my own skin off - I can’t believe I never thought if the to try an allergy pill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Me too man! I used to get the worst rashes up my arms when I used vibrating tools, like a reciprocating saw or jackhammer. I got the rash on my chest from walking slightly long distances, it would start to itch after about 2km I think, shorter in the cold. I started taking antihistamine before exercise or work if I was using vibrating tools for long. And it’s been probably the most life changing thing ever. I read up on exercise induced anaphylaxis and while I don’t think I got it as bad as some, I literally changed my life by taking a tiny tablet. Incredible!</p></div>		</li>
