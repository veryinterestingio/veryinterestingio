			<div class="markdown"><p>100x more atoms means 100x more reactions. So 1 Fission split is 200 MeV, and the 100 DT fuses will produce a combined 1700 MeV roughly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually 100 times the atoms is fifty times the reactions as a fission reaction consumes one atom but a fusion atom consumes two.</p>
<p>But the advantage is still large.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, hydrogen weighs 1 atomic mass unit but deuterium weighs just over 2 thanks to having a neutron glued on to it. But you're comparing densities, and there's the density of the uranium vs the heavy water to consider.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, in theory one can include an arbitrary amount of deuterium, because it is inert until it is ignited, while when building a fission bomb one is limited by the critical mass? Right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, you need need a critical mass for a nuclear fission chain reaction. For fusion you need to have temperature and density so that many nuclei overcome their electrostatic repulsion and fuse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it is 11kg of the uranium, but they got around that limitation, by fashioning it into a hollow polyhydron shape. Then to start the reaction the beryllium reflectors encasing the material imploded it into a single mass. If the timing is off it just blows apart the core and no big boom, that's all part of the reason they are tricky to produce in the first place, besides getting the material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plutonium bombs are the ones that require implosion, which is very hard, but plutonium isn’t too hard to produce for a country with nuclear reactors.</p>
<p>Uranium-235 bombs can be made by just shooting two subcritical masses together that form a critical mass when assembled. The catch is that separating U-235 from natural uranium which is almost entirely U-238 is extremely difficult to do on the scale needed to make enough for a bomb, and the industry required is massive and quite obvious to other countries. Iran was (is?) exploring this route, while North Korea took the plutonium route.</p>
<p>All in all, it’s essentially impossible for nuclear reactors to enable a terrorist organization to produce a nuke in secret without deliberate aid from another country, which has been rather helpful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Criticality is a function of geometry. The earth has a super-critical amount of U-235 but it doesn’t explode because it’s spread out. Any fission bomb uses a primary explosive to squish a super-critical-but-spread-out amount of material into a tighter geometry, which then explodes. Gun types fire two chunks towards each other (and are inefficient because the leading edges become super-critical while the outer edges aren’t) and implosion types squish a sphere by means of an outer sphere of explosives. </p></div>		</li>
