			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most correct answer in the thread.  &quot;Lawn weed killers&quot; deliver what is essentially a fatal overdose of the growth hormone most broadleaf plants (dicots) depend on. Many preparations include 2,4,5-T which is even more potent, and an even more potent herbicide that operates in a similar fashion - dicamba - is controversial due to allegations that it can easily drift on the wind and kill desirable plants.</p>
<p>Monocots like grasses are either immune to the effects of such herbicides, and / or the growing parts of their structures are not exposed enough to absorb enough of the herbicide to matter, including all northern grass varieties like bluegrass and fescues.  Many grasses grown in the deep south like bermudagrass and zoyszia are, on the other hand, susceptible to lawn weed killers.</p></div>		</li>
