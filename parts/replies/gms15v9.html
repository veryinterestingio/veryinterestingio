			<div class="markdown"><p>Also they were likely co-evolved with megafauna like giant ground sloths because only an enormous animal could eat the pit whole and then scatter it (plus with a little fertilizing dung!) allowing it to spread. It's probably also why the pit is mildly poisonous, to deter smaller animals from eating it. </p>
<p>Without the megafauna the only way they can spread is via human means, and it's possible the pits won't germinate unless treated to a stomach-like environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Read Darwins origin of the species. The first 300 pages or so describe mans selective breeding/domestication of different animals Its a great history. Its in the latter half of the book where he describes evolution by replacing the active management by man with the various pressures nature places on wild population. Also nowhere does he talk about the evolution of man. Thats a whole other book.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What you do is cut off a small limb in the right way, and it will grow roots. Then you plant it, and it is a clone of the original tree. Repeat a few thousand times.</p></div>		</li>
