			<div class="markdown"><p>It also makes you dull as  personality since you can't enjoy hobbies anymore and use all your willpower to go shopping or something like that, so when you meet up with someone you don't know what to talk about because depression ate your life.</p>
<p>Then you stop trying because it's embarrassing and you don't want to disappoint people anymore. Your social skills atrophy or never develop and you stay at home living like a hermit waiting for the day you die without anyone noticing.</p></div>		</li>
