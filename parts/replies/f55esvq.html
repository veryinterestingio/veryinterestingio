			<div class="markdown"><p>Pair production results in some of the largest known explosions, where a star that's so huge its gamma rays start spontaneously turning into electron-positron pairs when they interact with matter. Without the necessary radiation pressure pushing out against gravity, since the gamma rays are no longer there radiating out, the star contracts, which causes more, higher-energy fusion, which causes it to make even more high-energy gamma rays, which causes more pair production, which causes the star to contract further. The positive feedback loop can cause as much matter to fuse in 10 seconds as the sun does over its entire lifespan, fifty times over, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair-instability_supernova" target="_blank">utterly obliterating the star itself</a>.</p></div>		</li>
