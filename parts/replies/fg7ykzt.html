			<div class="markdown"><p>For one reason or another, yea.</p>
<p>You could also just be really overweight. That tends to make it difficult as well.</p>
<p>Barring that, yes. Something about touching your toes is threatening to your nervous system so it’s like nah. </p>
<p>Not threatening like someone holding a gun or getting hit by a poisonous snake, but yea. </p>
<p>Good news is you can generally reduce the threat by exposing yourself to it gradually in increasing amounts.</p>
<p>Graded exposure is the name of the game with pretty much all exercise adaptation.  Even reducing threat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes since. The body is signaling pain while stretching to tell us &quot;hey easy there or you'll tear&quot; but as we stretch more and become more flexible it takes pushing further for your body to signal pain to say &quot;hey easy there or you'll tear something&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fellow physio here. Fantastic explanations to all the follow-up questions you've been asked. It's sometimes such a struggle trying to succinctly explain this stuff to patients in the clinic with the limited time we have, especially when you may have to distangle some of the misinformation they've been given in the past. I'll definitely be stealing some of the analogies you've given above to add to my education repertoire.</p>
<p>I sometimes send patients a link to one of my colleagues' websites (included below), he did a really fantastic write-up on all of the current evidence regarding stretching. As you mentioned, it's really not as simple as stretching = good or stretching = bad. But certainly the explanations that physios, trainers, etc. have been giving for many years has really missed the mark and I'd say we're duty-bound to realign people's viewpoints with what the evidence says.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey man, thank you. I really appreciate that coming from another physiobro out in the wild.</p>
<p>I’m also a big fan of painscience. I don’t always agree with everything he puts out but I think he does great work overall.</p>
<p>Pain is as fascinating to me as it is frustrating for my patients. I think when I first started I would try to explain to them how pain worked and the nervous system and blah blah. A lot of it is the stuff I went into here but this is a bit different because people requested it.</p>
<p>I’ve had a lot of success more recently with focusing less on excessive pt. education (unless requested) and more on just changing how I talk to my pts about what they’re dealing with.  </p>
<p>Not over reacting to an experience of increased pain. </p>
<p>Pointing out objective aspects of how they’ve approved and reminding them pain is information but it’s not a good measure of progress. </p>
<p>Most of all, as cheesy as it sounds, I try very hard to impress on my patients how resilient the human body is, that they aren’t “broken,” and that they will get better. I find not spending huge amounts of time blasting them with diagnoses and anatomy terms and behaving as though they’re obviously going to get better (as long as you actually believe that) does a ton for their mindset. </p>
<p>I don’t know if any of that is at all helpful but hopefully some of it’s worth something.</p>
<p>Keep fighting the good fight brother.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No he doesn't. Literally the first sentence he writes is, &quot;Stretching is a pleasant ritual for many people, myself included.&quot; And literally two paragraphs later: &quot;I stretch almost every day — hamstrings, lumbar erector spinae, and especially the deep gluteals are my favourites.&quot; The rest of his article simply breaks down the science for and against stretching. And guess what, there is  some evidence of stretching having positive outcomes! It's just rarely for the physiological reasons that people like Paul (a former massage therapist who used to give people stretching all the time), myself and others have attributed it to for the last 40 years. And I gotta say, Paul is probably one of the least emotional people I know when it comes to this stuff...he just cares about what the evidence says. And speaking of evidence...</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Can you point out to me where he says it's impossible? You can't because this is what he says regarding plantar fasciitis: &quot;possible role of stretching in treating that condition, but the bottom line is that it either doesn’t work, or not all that well.&quot; So yes, it might be effective for some people, but probably not for the reasons you think. I'm guessing you think that stretching the tissue somehow lengthened it, making it less tight and painful. Pain is far more complex than that, as you can read about above in one of /u/RxStrengthBob's comments. Did you receive therapy during that time you had plantar fasciitis? How do you know it wasn't the manual therapy they did? Or the strengthening exercises you did? Or natural resolution of your pain with no intervention, as can often happen with plantar fasciitis patients. But to play devil's advocate to your point, here's some evidence showing that stretching for plantar fasciitis might help:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12851352" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12851352</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3150253/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3150253/</a></p>
<p>*this one makes note that: &quot;There were too few studies to assess whether stretching is effective compared to control or other interventions, for either pain or function. However, there is some evidence that plantar fascia stretching may be more effective than Achilles tendon stretching alone in the short-term.&quot;</p>
<p>Here's some conflicting evidence showing it's not that effective:</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.bmj.com/bjsm/2014/09/15/plantar-fasciitis-important-new-research-by-michael-rathleff/" target="_blank">https://blogs.bmj.com/bjsm/2014/09/15/plantar-fasciitis-important-new-research-by-michael-rathleff/</a></p>

<p>So at the end of the day, this is the importance of scientific method. When we have multiple studies showing that something doesn't work, with a few studies showing that it does, we conduct a systematic review. And even those are sometimes misleading, if the studies were poorly designed. But guess what, at the end of the day it's still WAY BETTER than your anecdotal evidence. </p>

<p>I'll just let Paul answer this one: &quot;Many people will reasonably question the value of a dissection study — so different than the living body! However, the clinical relevance of studies on corpses varies with context. Certainly many things can and have been learned from dissection. In this case, we’re looking exclusively at whether or not an anatomical structure can be elongated when pulled on. It’s not a test of stretching effectiveness in the real world, but of the mechanics and anatomy of the stretch. If a well-executed passive stretch does not elongate the IT band in a corpse, is it likely that a living person could do any better? Do live IT bands respond very differently to being pulled on? I doubt that. The result is also consistent with a lot of other evidence and with other aspects of the anatomy of the structure, established in this and other studies, particularly that it is anchored to the femur along most or all of its length. It is not an “elongatable” structure. This can be established as well on a corpse as in the living — probably better. We then can decide what to make of that — that is, what clinical implications arise — but the biomechanical facts are difficult to dispute here. The response that “it’s just a dissection study” is a convenient way to dispose of inconvenient, myth-busting evidence. But dissection studies have their place and are very good at determining things just like this, and that’s why we do them.&quot;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Truly don't even understand what your second sentence means. If you meant to write the word &quot;inarguably&quot;, then you mean we need to stretch because it's practical and no one can argue against that. What? He literally writes out 1800 words on why the evidence shows us it's no really a benefit for MOST people. Your argument is: &quot;I stretched my plantar fascia and it felt better.&quot; If you're &quot;all for science&quot; as you state, you must realize how silly your anecdotal evidence is. It's no different than a patient who swears that the crystal they wear around their neck wards off evil spirits and disease. Well they didn't catch the flu this year, so by-golly it must work!</p>
<p>I'm not trying to be rude, but the reasons you gave for criticizing his article are terrible. If you want to debate the merits of the research he cited then go ahead. It'll take you hours to pore through it all, but I encourage you to because it is important that we be skeptical. But be skeptical for the right reasons, not just because you have a knee-jerk reaction to an intrinsically held belief about something.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No you don't</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yea, he's saying the literal tendon itself doesn't really stretch. It's inherent elasticity is not changed by being in a living person. Another team even took it completely out and tried to machine stretch it. What more evidence do you need?</p>
<blockquote>

<p>He said <em>increased</em> range of motion. And it's not. If I can perform all my daily tasks and exercise appropriately  with my current range of motion, what benefit would I see from arbitrarily increasing it? What objective benefits, in a vacuum, are there to being hypermobile for any person for that matter?</p></div>		</li>
