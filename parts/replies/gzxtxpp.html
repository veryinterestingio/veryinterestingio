			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, the dude who found out that all eels spawn in the Sargasso Sea was this Danish dude named Johannes Schmidt who decided pretty much right before WWI broke out to go all alone into the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean to search for where they spawned. He decided the best way to go about this was to fish in certain spots and look for the smallest larvae; the smaller the larvae, the closer he was to the spawn spot. </p>
<p>I don’t think he thought about how big the Atlantic Ocean is. </p>
<p>It took him SEVENTEEN YEARS. <strong>Seventeen. Fucking. Years.</strong> </p>
<p>But he found it. He found the spawning grounds. I don’t know how this man didn’t go insane. But it says a lot about human motivations, what drives us and adds another chapter of the human condition— what could possibly possess a man to spend a great chunk of his life looking for the birthplace of something as inane as eels? But he did.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of an old copypasta:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our entire existence is owed to persistence, endurance, and determination. When we put ourselves to a task, it gets done, period. And this instinct is still affecting us today. 332BC: Alexander the Great hits a stalemate with the fortified island city of Tyre. Instead of going back defeated, he builds a kilometer long bridge in order to raze the city. 49BC: Cesar, after defeating the Gauls and invading Britain, turns a political fight into a civil war by invading Italy with only a single legion. He eventually becomes dictator starting a world superpower whose engineering feats are only recently being broken. 1804AD: A charismatic French general declares himself Emperor and sets off to conquer much of mainland Europe. He is captured, exiled, and then escapes. The soldiers sent to recapture him instead lay down their arms and join him. 1961AD: One man decides that we will go to the moon, despite much of the technology to do so not even existing yet. Just eight years later, two humans stand on the surface of the moon and look back upon the Earth. 200 years ago, we didn't have railroads. 100 years ago, we didn't have airplanes. 50 years ago, we didn't have spaceflight. 25 years ago we didn't have the Internet. We've already inherited the Earth and soon we WILL inherit the stars and anyone or anything that stands in our way will be eliminated one way or another.</p>
