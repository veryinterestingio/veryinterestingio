			<div class="markdown"><p>I can add a bit to that — vortex generators disturb the air so that the plane doesn’t stall all at once.</p>
<p>It’s much better to artificially cause half the wing to stall earlier, even though it technically reduces performance. </p>
<p>It gives the pilot an opportunity to realize that the plane is responding sluggishly because they’re pushing against the edge of the flight envelope and now half their wing has lost lift.</p>
<p>Way easier to recover a plane when the flight control surfaces still have airflow moving over them. Once those stall, you basically just have to pitch the nose down and gain enough speed in the proper direction to end the stall and regain control.</p></div>		</li>
