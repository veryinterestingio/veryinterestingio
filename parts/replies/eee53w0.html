			<div class="markdown"><p>Heres another cool factoid. If you watch videos with binaural audio using mics with identically shaped pinnae, your brain will adapt to the new shape and the recordings will sound normal. But when you take off the headphones, real world sounds will sound &quot;wrong&quot; until your brain adapts.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that your auditory cortex doesn't know how your pinnae are shaped. When your brain is developing in the womb, there is no link between the shape of your ear and the structure of your auditory cortex. The brain has to learn the shape of your ear by connecting the spatial position of audio sources to the differences in the way they sound.</p>
<p>You can also achieve this effect by using wax to change the shape of your ears. At first you will lose the ability to localize audio on the vertical axis, but then you'll adapt and regain the ability.</p>
<p>There's also a visual analogue to this effect. If you wear glasses that flip the image upside down, eventually your brain will flip the image right side up. But when you take off the glasses, everything will be upside down until your brain flips it back again. This is also due to the brain's ignorance of the specific structure of your eyes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Some of the better ones have a model head placed between the &quot;ear-mics&quot; in order to capture the way the head modifies the sound waves as they move around it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most binaural audio is created synthetically. They record using cheaper 3D arrays then use signal processing to mimic the head. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called the head related transfer function : <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-related_transfer_function" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-related_transfer_function</a></p>
<p>Using this function, you can actually simulate the way the sound would be deformed by the echoes in software, and thus without a super expensive mic setup. </p>
<p>Of course, that only work if the software knows where the sound source is, so it won't work for movies, but it is perfect for video games, where you can't know in advance where related to the player the sounds will come from, and thus you can't record it for every possible positions of every possible sound source. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Audio companies like Dolby literally make test runs with thousands of slightly different “Head Related Transfer Functions”, to see which one works best for as many people as possible for as many different contents as possible.
Basically, because every persons head and earshapes are slightly different, the same Transfer Function will work better or worse for different people.</p></div>		</li>
