<p>i wonder if this has to do with a difference in the predators faced by zebras and horses.  that is, lions etc will leap on the back of a zebra (or whatever) to bring it down, so the best way to deal with that is to try to roll over and crush the lion.  perhaps horses didn't have lions to deal with.  </p>
<p>horses did have to deal with mountain lions but mountain lions are solo predators.  african lions hunt in packs.</p>
<p>horses had to deal with wolves that hunt in packs but wolves don't jump on a horse's back</p>
<p>i haven't given this much thought before - that might be obvious...</p></div>		</li>
