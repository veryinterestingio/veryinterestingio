			<div class="markdown"><p>I pieced together my own saying from posts on here and a bit of South Park haha always helps me:</p>
<p>&quot;Motivation is a fickle mistress, it comes and goes on a whim, but discipline, dissapren! Comes from within.&quot;</p>
<p>If you rely on motivation to achieve something you will never get anywhere, motivation starts a project, discipline finishes it, gets it done, deals with the hard part. Goals are not always fun or exciting, some days you just have to shovel shit so tomorrow the grass will be greener.</p>
<p>You have to &quot;get&quot; motivation.</p>
<p>Discipline is something you &quot;have&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good theory. Essentially you trigger that &quot;accomplishment&quot; experience in your brain without having actually done the thing. Planning for it and &quot;promising yourself&quot; you will do something makes you feel at ease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also it takes zero energy and motivation to think about doing something while you are likely in the most comfortable position you are in at any given moment. It leads to delusionally thinking about the reality of the events. You think about the events from a frame of reference of utter comfort and relaxation. Once you have to actually exert energy, and feel discomfort, boredom, and pain, you realize your ideas were not as fleshed out, thought out, and prepared for as you are now experiencing. You place the comfort you currently are experiencing into the planning of the event, not the reality of discomfort that will actually accompany it. Once your frame of reference changes, when you get out of bed, dread creeps back in as boredom, discomfort, and pain become reality again. Ask someone who experiences chronic pain, even while in bed, if they create these plans like everyone else. I guarentee they do not.</p>
<p>Simply put, comfort and the absense of pain do not make a great frame of reference for acts/events that are uncomfortable, painful, boring, or time consuming. Comfort, relaxation and the absense of pain lead to delusional planning that does not adhere to the full scope of reality outside of the context of comfort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It helps when you’re taught from a young age to avoid discomfort and pain, and only think happy or good thoughts.</p>
<p>It helps kids in the short term but it’s the emotional equivalent of eating a Twinkie; it tastes good but it’s not healthy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya. Growing up with an abusive childhood has a few positives: im not &quot;weak&quot;, im resourceful, independent, grounded, had to teach myself everything so i had more life experience from failures at any given age than most that age (very mature for my age at any age) but far moreso am I irreparably damaged mentally and emotionally by it. It caused me a personality disorder and a host of other disorders and the damage from those outweigh any of the benefits that resulted from the abusive encironment. Im really well equipped to survive and thrive in high chaos, high abuse situations but am not equipped to survive normal, regular living. I simply fail to thrive when i am not put in high stress, high chaos negative environments.  My brain was shaped to its environment. After a decade of therapy i do not think i am going to ever become adjusted to normal life. As always, the truth is in the middle. Dont put so much on the kid that you emotionally and mentally &quot;break&quot; them, causing irreparable damage to their brain in the form of mental disorders, but dont pamper to the point they have no ability to handle any adversity and crumble under a feathers weight of stress. Like weight lifting, load em up with real life discomfort and pain, but spot them so they do t get injured by it or maimed. Let em get heartbreak, let em trip, make em exercise, make em study and do homework( i was smart so never had to study or do homework, or pay attention in class and all my parents cared about was what grade i got, not instilling solid studying habits and shit), make em mow the grass in July (with water breaks).</p></div>		</li>
