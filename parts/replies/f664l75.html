			<div class="markdown"><p>Shockingly close to 100% since they use forced draft and a counter-flow heat exchanger. Simply put a fan forces the exhaust from the burner to go through a bendy path opposite to the direction of the flow of water, so as the exhaust cools due to transferring heat to the water it encounters still cooler water. Since heat energy can only flow from a high temperature to a lower one this arrangement ensures that there's always heat exchange.</p>
<p>Storage water heaters on the other hand send the gas up a central chimney type exchanger where it encounters warmer water as it loses heat. Less efficient but there is no need for a fan or indeed any power at all. </p>
<p>Just checked and the exhaust for my on-demand heater was just 120°F/50°C on a 60F/15°C day. You can hold your hand over it no problem. That might sound not great, but the flame temperature of natural gas is roughly 3500°F/1930°C so damn near all the heat has been removed. </p>
<p>The electric ones even have some nifty engineering in them. Switching that much power generates a lot of heat, so they just heat sink the transistors to the incoming water flow to pre-heat the water before it hits the heating elements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to heat it up at some point. If you heat it up beforehand you're still heating it up just as much and giving it just as much energy, except now you're going to lose some of that energy while you wait to use it.</p>
<p>In theory, it's much more convenient to heat up only what you need, when you need it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's much more to it than that. Of course this is true for a simple electric boiler, but with some heat sources it becomes complicated. For example coal or wood - if you want to heat up a tiny volume of water, they'll be very inefficient, before you ignite them properly and everything... Way more efficient if you have a huge insulated water tank, heat all of it up once every couple of days, and then use that heat for a couple of days in between...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the part that always confused me. It 100% makes sense to me but the amount of energy required to heat it up on demand seemed sky high to me so figured it was losing its efficiency there. Someone else responded to me with a good explanation of that though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is that heating water up really fast means passing it over something stupidly hot.</p>
<p>If you heat water up slow you can pass it over something way colder.</p></div>		</li>

<p>... For a lot longer. Energy = Power x Time</p>
<p>Half the power for twice the time is the same amount of energy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much 100%. Converting stuff into heat is something that we're actually really good at. These days you can get a heat pump which boosts your efficiency up to around &quot;400%&quot; (you produce 4 kW of heating and 3 kW of cooling for every 1 kW that goes in, you then dump the cold/hot air into the atmosphere).</p></div>		</li>
