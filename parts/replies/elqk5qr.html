			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an excellent question. Thank you. There's a couple of things that athletes and everyone should pay attention to. Pay attention to your family history. If you have a family member that has died suddenly, that is a warning sign for you to get screened. If you pass out without warning or during exercise, that would be something to get checked out. Also, frequent heart palpations can be a symptom. But palpatations are common and usually not caused by ARVC. ARVC can also come out of the blue.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Should this statement be interpreted in the specific context of family history, or in a general context (meaning, something that even an EKG/imaging might not catch)?</p></div>		</li>
