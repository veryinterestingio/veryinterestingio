<p>My question was where was it before? You said it was in &quot;adrenaline storage,&quot; where IS that? And why isn't it making you jumpy all the TIME if it's apparently already ready to go at all times, waiting to be &quot;dumped into the river.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adrenaline is produced by the adrenal gland, above the kidneys. It's not even actually adrenaline that perks you up. Adrenaline tells the body to release glucose into the bloodstream which gives you a burst of energy, among other things. </p>
<p>When you take in excess sugar, your body releases insulin which makes it store the excess glucose in the liver in a kind of inert form called glycogen. Adrenaline causes the glycogen to release into the blood as glucose which gives you energy, increases heart rate, dilates pupils etc....</p></div>		</li>
