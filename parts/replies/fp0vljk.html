			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. All out of the skin just different lengths.</p>
<p>You can see it in medium and long haired cats if you part the hair. The coat looks glossy and slick when patted down but as soon as you part it you see there is lots of fine fluffy hair under that top coat at a shorter length so it doesn't show normally. It's even a often different colour from the guard hairs on top. My boy has black areas where his undercoat is gray.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to what others already answered, here is a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Down_Awn_and_guard_hairs_of_cat_2012_11_13_9203r.JPG/330px-Down_Awn_and_guard_hairs_of_cat_2012_11_13_9203r.JPG" target="_blank">pic of the types of fur</a>. To the left you can see the undercoat (waviest ones) which are shorter, the middle ones are awn hairs (transitioning from wavy base to thick straight tips) and the totally straight, thick guard hairs on the right.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes. Same as how some birds have down feathers as well as regular feathers.</p>

<p>Different types of fur are produced by different follicles.</p>

<p>Yes, they are different types of hair, not just different lengths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah thank you, even though I've studied a lot I'm always learning :) My first language sorta has a different sentence structure, so whenever I'm tired my brain mixes up word order, or I sound redundant, etc. I feel better with the tiny disclaimer lol</p></div>		</li>
