<p>particularly as a nuclear deetonation would provide a significant mass of material by which to observe via aurora.</p>

<p>I'm curious about this statement. I thought nuclear detonation produced nothing but energy. How does it produce material that has mass?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bomb casing and most of the fissile material (I don't know about the fusion fuel for hydrogen bombs) in a bomb will be vaporized and scattered around. For example, the little boy bomb used in Hiroshima contained 64kg of uranium, but only about a kilogram actually participated in fission and just under a gram was converted to energy. Modern bombs are more efficient in their use of fissile material, but most of the bomb's weight is still around to be distributed as fallout or (in the case of space detonation) ionized gas. </p>
<p>Also note that the comment you quoted says &quot;provides,&quot; not &quot;produces,&quot; which is more correct because the bomb isn't making any more mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That energy has to go somewhere, and in the case of detonating a nuke in the atmosphere, some of that energy goes into ionizing the otherwise neutral matter just hanging about.</p>
<p>One of the after effects of the starfish blast was to create an artificial ring current, very similar in structure to the VA belts mentioned above, but at a different location and without a source of replenishment. It did help investigate the VA belts, but I doubt this was the purpose of the blast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the casings are still there as shrapnel, but really what it means is nuclear explosions cause the molecules in the atmosphere (or ground/dust if ground based explosion) to become radioactive/ionized projectiles, which interact with our magnetosphere if detonated near it and produce auroras.</p></div>		</li>
