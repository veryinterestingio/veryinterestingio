			<div class="markdown"><p>Amplifiers are the correct answer. While the cables do use fiber optics and huge amounts of copper, those are only part of the answer. They typically run lots of power on the larger copper sections, and use that to power amplifiers for small interior wires or fiber optics so that they can boost the signal as often as necessary.  </p>
<p>Edit: The internet has told me that we have fancy solid-state amplifiers that boost the light signal without actually capturing and remitting the signal. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_amplifier" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical\_amplifier" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical\_amplifier</a></a></p></div>		</li>

<p>That way, each bit of cable hears a loud message instead of a really quiet one!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly. Amplifiers are actually what is used at the end of each span. Repeaters and amplifiers are intrinsically distinct in that the first requires optical-electrical-optical transformation and, thus, is an active element. These are very, very, very costly in the optical world. Amplifiers, however, do not require such conversion and operate directly on the optical layer (the most common type being EDFAs). These are much much cheaper, also because they can amplify multiple wavelengths (and sometimes cables) at once. In fact, one can argue that one of the main enablers of today’s internet and telecom services is the EDFA, as they allowed the amount of undersea cables we currently have at a reasonable price — whereas if we only depended on repeaters, that cost would have been tens to hundreds of times higher, likely hindering the current internet connectivity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for being the only person who seems to actually know how undersea cables work. Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers are inexpensive and extremely reliable. A repeater would be a lot more expensive and a lot less reliable.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Saying it explicitly: this is even worse because of various forms of Wavelength Division Multiplexing.  One of the ways we can get so much data through the fiber, is by putting multiple signals together on different colors.  So, for example, you could put 10GB on each of 50 colors, and shove them down the same fiber.</p>
<p>If you want to have an active repeater for that, you need to split those 50 colors apart again, decode each one, re-encode it at full power, and then recombine them all.</p>
<hr />
<p>Contrast an amplifier, which directly increases signal power by the magic of lasers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So when you see an image like <a href="https://twistedsifter.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/close-up-of-a-fibre-optic-undersea-submarine-cable-2.jpg?w=800&amp;h=763" target="_blank">this</a></p>
<p>You always hear how only the small wires in the middle are used. Are you saying that one or more of those are fiber optic and some are copper?</p>
<p>Even then I am confused because that looks thin and there has to be some major voltage lost between 80km until it gets to a repeater.</p>
<p>And then where does this repeater get power from to amplify.. now i have more questions</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The power for the amplifiers will be provided by the large bundle of outer armour wires, and the copper ring and steel armoured cables in the middle. The plastic insulates the two, so there can be a voltage between them. I'd expect the outer ones to be earth, although they might be held at a slight voltage to provide cathodic protection. The fibres in the middle carry the light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thin &quot;cables&quot; at the end are the fibres. These are what's used to transmit the data via light. </p>
<p>The armouring on the outside of the cable is what will likely carry the power. Looking at the picture, I'd venture that the outer ring will be return (earth) and the inner ring power. Volt drop will be accounted for.</p></div>		</li>
