			<div class="markdown"><p>Except, you know, when they take pharmacology they'll understand the effects ibuprofen has over the body and when they take virology they'll learn how infectious pathogens cause damage to the body, and maybe there's a correlation that makes sense, maybe not. Maybe the medical professionals will be great resources to ask when it comes to, you know, medicine?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that’s what I meant by the part where they have the capacity to learn and understand the research, but that doesn’t necessarily translate into the desire or actual action of analyzing it.  </p>
<p>On a similar note, you do know what they call someone who graduates at the very bottom of their class in medical school, right? Doctor. Just because they learned enough to pass the pharmacology class doesn’t mean they have a great grasp on the underlying concepts...some of them just know how to read a list if indications, and hopefully understand conta-indications can be more complex than what’s listed, and someone gives them a prescription pad and says ‘have at it’.</p></div>		</li>
