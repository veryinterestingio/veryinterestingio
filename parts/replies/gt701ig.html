			<div class="markdown"><p>About a hundred years ago when we were first getting a sense of the existence of other galaxies Edwin Hubble came up with an idea for galaxy evolution. He thought that galaxies started round and eventually started to flatten out and form spiral arms. So he called the round and elliptical galaxies &quot;early type&quot; and spiral galaxies &quot;late type&quot; because the round ones were supposed to be formed first and later turn into spirals.</p>
<p>It turns out that spiral galaxies are actually middle aged and elliptical galaxies are older. But Hubble's way of classifying galaxies was already widely used so astronomers still call old galaxies &quot;early type&quot; and newer galaxies &quot;late type&quot;. I personally just avoid those terms and just say elliptical or spiral or dwarf.</p>
<p>We know now that younger galaxies tend to be blue in color, and older galaxies tend to be more red. Usually galaxies transition from blue to red because of a major merger, but there could be other processes. What we know is that when galaxies get to a certain size they stop forming stars (or they form them very, very, slowly). After that they grow through mergers with other galaxies.</p>
<p>Galaxies tend to get bluer the farther back in time we go, but we still see a mix of all types of galaxies.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The current theory is that dark matter attracted gas which subsequently formed stars. Primordial black holes are a possible identity of dark matter, but that's speculative at the moment, and it's more widely believed that dark matter will turn out to be a new kind of subatomic particle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.</p>
<p>I haven't seen anything yet that can clearly account for the super-massive black holes just from gas accretion. We can get galaxy formation with just dark matter halos, but the super-massive black holes had to come from somewhere, and primordial black holes are the only thing that can give them enough mass. But this leaves us with the issue of why are there no (easily detectable) intermediate and low mass primordial black holes. I haven't seen a good explanation for that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have recently read somewhere (don't remember the article now) about the alternate theory of formation of supermassive black holes in the early universe. But it's still a speculation by some physicists, and it involves dark matter.<br />
The thing is even with primordial bhs forming with stellar or multistellar mass with the size of intermediate bhs, there was still not enough time for them to accrete and become supermassive at the stage when these supermassives are observed at such an early stage.<br />
The alternate speculation/theory is dark matter. Immense amounts of dm forming the collapse of super gas clouds into supermassive bh in the early universe and most initial galaxies forming around them. And because there were plenty of gas, a lot of them were quasers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are primordial BHs mainstream now? I know they are a somewhat fringe theory for dark matter, but do we have evidence now that they seeded galaxy formation? If so is this a recent development?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We know that every galaxy has a supermassive black hole at the center and we can see quasars back ~13 billion years which means the first galaxies had supermassive black holes. The black holes came from somewhere. So we have to assume that they formed pretty close to the big bang. But this would only create supermassive black holes and not intermediate sized primordial black holes which is what some suspect dark matter might be. But we don't see good evidence for the intermediate mass black holes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to <a href="https://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-S6IMBH/index.php" target="_blank">LIGO</a> we should be more sure one way or another in a few years, at least in regard to IMBH mergers.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><code>The sensitivity required to first observe colliding IMBHs, assuming that the theoretical merger rate estimates are correct, may be achieved by the</code> <a href="https://www.advancedligo.mit.edu/" target="_blank"><code>advanced LIGO</code></a> <code>and</code> <a href="https://wwwcascina.virgo.infn.it/advirgo/" target="_blank"><code>advanced Virgo</code></a> <code>observatories. The advanced detectors are currently under construction and will come online in a few years. This new class of detectors should be sensitive to merging IMBH binaries with total masses up to 1000 times that of the Sun and up to distances which will be larger by more than a factor of ten compared to the previous searches. Thus, the advanced LIGO and Virgo observatories may open the era of IMBH astronomy and reveal, for the first time, some of the most intimate secrets of the Universe.</code></p></div>		</li>
