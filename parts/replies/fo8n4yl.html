I don't recall how many they said they had, or even if they did, but the goal of that program is obviously to get the eggs to the private sector in quick fashion to produce massive amounts of vaccines for our current scenario.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's mostly why I am impressed - I understand the extra help the FDA can give you but the timeline for 800 mill doses intersecting with the current logistics blows my mind - I switched from the discovery/R&amp;D side to small pharma process development, always in protein science.</p>
<p>I assume they'll still need to get through some process hiccups, evaluate some of their upstream/downstream strategies, test what scales, decide at what point the process is good enough to lock in, validate all the necessary analytics, and then go through PPQs without any hiccups, and start producing what will have to be commercial batches.</p>
<p>800 million is still a huge amount - then farm it out to a CMO? Refurb a building and scale up, do the engineering runs? On top of this, the logistics of making sure some Satrorius or Thermo Fisher supplier on the other side of the world can get you your consumables during shipment chaos? Color me impressed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the fate of the world is hinging on Thermo lead times I'm going to make my peace right now.  I work in support.  Once upon a time, a decent vendor with local spare parts supply was a viable support option.  These days, if it's mission critical, you have to have complete backups to backup all your backup equipment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Campaign prioritization would allow for a SUS supplier to build only patient critical assemblies,  and their sub-suppliers to align so all production for the COVID19 vaccine is supported.  Essentially that means the rest of the industry would see their lead times increase by months if they’ve single-sourced on the SUS supplier awarded the bid for mass producing a COVID-19 vaccine.  My hope is that the SUS industry will work together to help build essentially the same assembly so that capacity needs are met without too much disruption for the rest of the industry.  BPOG should be able to help facilitate that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>At least a year for 250M doses, but probably longer (and much longer if there are supply problems with eggs / processing equipment).</p>

<p>So do the supply chain issues we're already seeing with eggs (too many piling up due to restaurant demand + not enough to meet consumer demand) worry you?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ok, now I need a movie about the 900k secret CIA secret agent chickens that keep the country safe from influenza.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Presumably, it wouldn’t be an overall egg supply problem — If you do a back of the envelop calculation that, on average, each American eats one egg per week, that’s ≈330M eggs that are consumed each week, so far more than would be needed, but the supply is only good if it can actually make it to the manufacturing floor, so logistics would potentially be more of a bottleneck than sheer supply. </p>
<p>Also, it’s likely that a specific grade of egg from a farm that has a higher grade of hygiene requirements (to prevent things like E. coli contamination) would be needed, so the supply is probably smaller than the overall egg supply. Those requirements could potentially be waived in an emergency, but you’d be balancing safety of the vaccine against time to market, which is a difficult tightrope to walk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the same egg source. The egg farms that produce eggs for research and vaccines are very stringent, they use specifically selected chickens and have specific protocols for workers (such as not allowing workers to own or be regularly exposed to other chickens.) Source: I live in rural CT where some of the farms are located. See <a href="https://www.criver.com/products-services/avian-vaccine-services/spf-eggs?region=3601" target="_blank">this website</a> and the pricelist for the eggs.</p></div>		</li>
