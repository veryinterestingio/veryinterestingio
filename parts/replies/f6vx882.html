			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, I have aphantasia, the inability to visualize. I do not have a minds eye, a minds ear, or a minds nose. I cannot see, hear, or smell memories, or imagine images, sounds, or smells..such as, imagine you are in a meadow, with sounds of birds chirping, and the smell of honeysuckle in the air...all nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Phenomenal memory, which from what I’ve read of other aphantasia accounts, is common. But also it’s important to specify what kind of memory, but I’d say... all kinds. Things I’ve seen, heard, read, talked about. I can’t picture the front of my house, or the a room in my house, but I could probably describe them in such detail that you could probably imagine it as it is. I can easily move about my house in the pitch black as I know specially where everything is. </p>
<p>The best I can describe how I remember things, is that everything is in a spreadsheet or database in my head, in programming code. I can’t see Blue in my head, but it’s as if I can reference #0000ff (the rgb hex for blue) and know what you’re talking about when discussing a blue ball.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another total aphant here! Many people say I have a great memory for facts, and I do. You'd want me on your trivia team. What I lack is episodic memory (like those with SDAM). I have never experienced an actual memory, where you  relive a moment in time in your mind. I live in the present pretty much all the time. My memory is very third person, like I've read a good biography of myself. There is a definite relationship between visualizing and autobiographical memory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>9 months ago, someone did an ama on being a non visualizer. It was actually closed or taken down by a mod bc the person couldn’t prove they were or something...but reading them describe that they couldn’t visualize and others saying they could....that back and forth creates a strong understanding that you are like one of the two types of people. Before 9 months ago, I thought when people said “imagine....” it was just a figure of speech, meaning...I’m talking about a red ball, and you’ve seen a red ball before, so know I’m talking about that...but I now know, they actually mean...picture a red ball in your hand...actually superimposing it with your mind, into your hand....which to me is like....some kind of superpower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>can you memorize songs? like, the tunes and melodies in particular? edit: what about drawing without a reference? sorry if this is a bother, i've never heard of this before and i'm super fascinated!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine there’s two paths for the answer on your songs question. As far as memories lyrics or sheet music, yes, easily. Even as far as memorizing the movement/muscle memory of playing a song on an instrument, yes. But besides being “technically” good at instruments in school, I’m not musically gifted. I don’t pick up on things in songs, I’m not good at singing. But besides listening to music in the car or while working out, I’m not really interested in music. So as far as can I listen to a song and memorize progressions or melodies... not really, but not because of a memory thing, rather because I don’t have a knack for music. </p>
<p>I’m also terrible at drawing, but I could say that if miraculously I was granted to ability to draw well (or perhaps if I took lessons and practices for years), I would be able to draw, say like the front of my house, in great detail, without being able to see it in my head. I just know what all the shapes are and where they go and what color things are, as data. If you told a computer to put a square at this coordinate and color it red, then a circle at this coordinate and color it blue, the computer would do so, without being able to picture in its own mind the image of these things before doing it...if that makes sense. </p>
<p>However, as for the “without a reference”, if you were to describe something to me that I hadn’t seen, and I were to draw it, assuming I was skilled at drawing.... it would probably end up... being interesting, and not how it was in your head. I don’t know, maybe like when you imagine a character in a book, then a movie comes out, and you’re like, that’s not how I pictured them.... but if a sketch artist drew them from the books description... it might be more like what you see in your head?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I can vividly remember the way the last thing my mom said to me sounded before she passed away 6 months ago.</p>
<p>I can also remember the way my dad's hands felt the last time I held them (he died 14 years ago).</p>
<p>I try my best to think of these things often so I don't lose these memories. I hope that works!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didnt know that was a thing people could do. I cant hear, smell, or touch in my memories and i only see singular vague images, like a low res photo.</p>
<p>Is that something I should see someone about?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, and you sound just about normal, if maybe a tiny bit behind the curve.</p>
<p>the thing is not to put too much weight on &quot;touching&quot; or &quot;seeing&quot; a memory. It's not like anyone is hallucinating when they say they are imagining an apple. They are likely referring to the same vague low-res photo you'd see when I say &quot;picture what an apple looks like&quot;. </p>
<p>However this seems to be a scale, people are better or worse than other people at thinking in other sensory inputs other than the inner voice and visualization. Some are better at imagining sounds, or smells, or feelings. However most people are going to be in the same boat: they think about the smell of a rose and they get a vague, low res sensation of that smell the same way you &quot;hear&quot; a vague, nonexistent voice when you are thinking using words.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm by no means an expert in this, but to my understand there are various different levels of capacity for imagination in that sense. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia" target="_blank">Aphantasia</a> talks about it a little bit. Essentially it comes down to that different people have different levels of detail when it comes to their minds eye. It's not harmful in anyway, it's just how it is.</p>
<p>I have no idea what causes it and whether or not it can be trained later in life or if it's just inherent. It's a fairly unstudied topic so I wouldn't be surprised if nobody can answer those questions with certainty at this moment.</p></div>		</li>
