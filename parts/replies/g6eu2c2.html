			<div class="markdown"><p>The liver has a major role as it a) burns a lot of glucose and also b) has about 20% of your blood in it at any one time. The liver is single most important organ in warming you via your blood but as others have said, muscle and brown fat also play a part.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The liver doesn't really burn much glucose under normal circumstances. Hepatocytes prefer beta-oxidation of fatty acids to cover their own energy needs. They may use glucose for various other pathways, for example the pentose phosphate pathway generating NADPH for fatty acid synthesis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly generation.  The things the liver does don't change a huge amount from moment to moment.  And the liver doesn't necessarily make more heat than other similarly-size organs, it's just that it has the necessary plumbing to transfer that heat into your blood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did, but I was late to the party. Brown Adipose tissue (BAT) is the primary source of heat generation (thermogenesis) in mammals. The liver accounts for the lion's share of heat outside of homo sapiens. In humans, the brain is actually responsible for most of it, but the difference is that it's produced as waste heat, and not intentionally for keeping warm.</p>

<p>Fun fact: Leatherback sea turtles ALSO have BAT.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That seems to be the correct answer. Since heat = energy. <a href="https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/88954/what-is-the-human-energy-consumption-by-organ" target="_blank">https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/88954/what-is-the-human-energy-consumption-by-organ</a></p></div>		</li>
