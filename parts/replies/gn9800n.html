<p>Now, as for there being a known physical limit, this does not seem possible to calculate in my opinion. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <em>very</em> theoretical limit is actually quite easy to calculate, because it is the specific energy of the Li -&gt; Li+ + e- half cell plus that of the most theoretically energy dense cathode, which is decided from half cell standard electrochemical potential vs. molar weight. In a nutshell, you want a light element with a high standard potential (which is basically the whole concept of a Li battery), so without having done the proper math for all of them, my bet would be on fluorine/fluoride (~19 g/mol and +2.9 V). Am on mobile, will do the math later if this is not buried :).</p>
<p>On a less theoretical level, there'd be Li/air, where Li itself is the anode, and Li2O2 is the cathode. Here, the theoretical energy density is 40 MJ/kg, about 40 times that of a commercial Li Ion battery.</p>
<p>This shows quite well that one of the biggest issues with modern batteries like NMC is that you carry around a lot of &quot;dead&quot; weight just to shuttle around that one charge. No, Co an Mn are all quite heavy elements. Even at the anode side you need 6 C atoms (weighing in at 12 g/mol each) for one electron's charge, which seems quite wasteful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heâ€™s talking about the number of ions that can enter or leave the cell, per gram. An amp is a unit of ion flow rate, and an amp-hour is a number of ions (literally 3600 coulombs or 2.24 x 10^22 ions).
The voltage depends on the cell chemistry, how charged the cell is, the discharge rate, and the internal resistance of the cell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small correction needed, an amp is actually a unit of charge flow rate. You first need to divide your total charge by nF (number of electrons involved * Faraday constant) to get mol and then convert it to number of ions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In this case, you're absolutely correct. My issue is I'm a scientist who works with this stuff every day, so sometimes I forget to translate things to relative terms. I'll keep this in mind for next time. As it stands, /u/angermouse translated the figures below. He stated 270 mAh/g (or 270Ah/kg) equates to 972Wh/kg for a 3.6V battery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Curious on the reason why the literature generally compares capacities in mAh/g vs. Wh/g though? I get that Ah is the standard measurement for batteries in general outside of literature because it gives you how long you can run a battery for that draws I amps for t hours. </p>
<p>Is there is a standard reference voltage that is taken due to the nature of the cells (like measurements at STP), or is it because there is something inherent about current and time that is more important than voltage e.g. maybe you can adjust the voltage easily, but there could be limitations on Ah?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not sure what the data centre point is? I don't really see why weight is going to matter there. In reality, I don't see why energy density is even that significant in a data centre.</p>
<p>Also I'm sure it might be good for large vehicles? Like HGVs, or even LGVs? Trains?</p></div>		</li>
