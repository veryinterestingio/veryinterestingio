			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a doctor or microbiologist, but if my understanding is correct, if your immune system isn't compromised and you're vaccinated you should be ok, however sometimes people become carriers. For example my SO never was diagnosed with tuberculosis but was exposed at some point because they are a carrier, so if a respiratory issue or major immune system issue occurs (cancer, HIV, along those lines), the TB could become active. </p>
<p>The problem with people choosing to vaccinate is that say you have like 3% of a population that isn't vaccinated, well they're at risk for contracting the illness, which has the ability to mutate. If a mutation occurs then it's like we never had the vaccine to begin with.</p></div>		</li>
