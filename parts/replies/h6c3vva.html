			<div class="markdown"><p>To be more specific than 'see top comment'.</p>
<p>Even though the rays of a laser are extremely parallel, a regular laser spot would, by the time it reaches the moon, be bigger than the moon itself. With the light divided over such a huge surface, you couldn't see anything.</p>
<p>With specialized equipment it becomes somewhat possible. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_experiment" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar\_Laser\_Ranging\_experiment" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar\_Laser\_Ranging\_experiment</a></a>.<br />
There, a laser is aimed at a retro-reflector put on the moon. The laser is about 6.5 km wide by the time it gets there, and out of 10\^21 photons, they receive back only one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man light is cool. Shame I’m terrible at physics and beyond any form of help otherwise I’d probably be studying it. It’s amazing how there’s just so much crazy stuff that happens all the time that keeps our universe working. Equations are hard. Or more accurately I can memorize individual equations and other facts but can’t combine them into a bigger picture.</p></div>		</li>
