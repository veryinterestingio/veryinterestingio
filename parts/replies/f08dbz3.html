			<div class="markdown"><p>A while back, I was scanned in a 2 or 3 Tesla machine. I don't recall the exact figure, but it was the newest most powerful one at Barnes hospital in St Louis.  Lying on my back, I started with my hands on belly, fingers clasped. I got extremely hot in there, and my arms felt like they were burning.</p>
<p>I moved my fingers apart, and the burning sensation stopped. Was still hot, but not nearly as bad. </p>
<p>We're my arms acting as an antenna or something?  That's the only thought I came up with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically.  Anytime you have your hands clasped together, legs crossed, etc you can create a circuit and absorb more RF.  This is amplified if your skin is sweaty, which happens naturally as you absorb some of the energy that the scanner is trying to bounce out of you.  Like it's not advisable to be scanned in shorts if you are a larger person, because your thighs are going to touch and there is more possibility of RF burns that way.  Greater field strength and lengthy scans can increase SAR (energy absorption).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually that the gradient currents can form a loop which causes the discomfort. SAR is very conservatively monitored by the scanner and won't be able to cause noticeable heating in tissue. We've put ourselves in the scanner and intentionally tried to trip the SAR limits before and there's no noticeable sensation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Glad someone mentioned this. During my last MRI, I had muscle twitches and hot spots on my arm that I <em>never</em> usually have. First time I looked into it, all I saw was &quot;MRIs don't cause any nervous system activity&quot;... About a year later, I read that the government was acknowledging this. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The magnetic fields that change with time create loud knocking noises which may harm hearing if adequate ear protection is not used. They may also cause peripheral muscle or nerve stimulation that may feel like a twitching sensation.</p>

<p>My best guess is that the medical field prefers to paint them as risk-free. Good on the FDA for putting information out there that others don't wish to share!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I had a MRI I was extremely uncomfortable. My whole head felt like it was blowing up like a balloon, including my eyeballs. Is this what you're describing? I looked it up afterwards and felt like I was crazy cause nothing came up that explained what was happening to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely not what I'm describing... did you have any anxiety going into it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not more than usual. I swear it pulsed with some of the sounds of the machine. Like everytime it made the sound, my head pulsed with it.</p></div>		</li>
