			<div class="markdown"><p>Much like terrestrial drones, Dragonfly uses a lithium-ion battery as its power source.  The battery itself uses the same cells that are used on the International Space Station which are trickle charged using the MMRTG power source.  On the day of the first landing the lander will be about 77 light minutes away from Earth and will remain a similar distance throughout the mission so all flights must be fully autonomous.  Fortunately, Titan’s atmosphere is very stable due to its tremendous thickness and distance from the sun, so the likelihood of strong winds is low.  Further, Dragonfly is equipped with the DraGMet instrument suite which is specifically designed to measure winds and atmospheric properties, and DraGMet measurements will be used as part of the go/nogo criteria prior to every flight ensuring that Dragonfly only flies when the winds are fair. - Doug Adams, Spacecraft Systems Engineer, JHUAPL</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised to hear that a lithium-ion battery could have sufficient juice to power a large drone for 66 days. Is it because it's a very large battery, or is the drone engine just super efficient?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They mentioned above that it will trickle charge the batteries using essentially a nuclear battery. The RTG can't put out the power it need for flight short term, and so the LiIons I assume are basically just a buffer as they can deliver high output required for flight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The team clarified that flight will be autonomous, as the communications delay from distance averages at several minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to reference your question about winds. Here is a video with the science stats from the Huygens lander that landed on Titan. It shows the windspeed at various altitudes:</p>
