<p>bacteria won't stick to a non-porous surface and by using a detergent or soap you essentially smother your hands in a product of the soap called a surfactant that reduces the surface tension (that slick feeling) and creates a film-like barrier between your skin and the bacteria which allows the bacteria and germs to slide off your hands when you rinse the soap off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not necessarily true what really happens is the soap / surfactant with two ends one attracted to water and the other to fat grabs onto the shell of bacteria / viruses and wraps arround it like a special wrapping paper. The fat side gets the germs and the water side makes it easy to wash it off.</p></div>		</li>
