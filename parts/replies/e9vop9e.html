<blockquote>
<p>If man-made dust is unimportant as a major cause of climatic change, then a strong case can be made that the present cooling trend will, within a decade or so, give way to a pronounced warming induced by carbon dioxide. By analogy with similar events in the past, the natural climatic cooling which, since 1940, has more than compensated for the carbon dioxide effect, will soon bottom out. Once this happens, the exponential rise in the atmospheric carbon dioxide content will tend to become a significant factor and by early in the next century will have driven the mean planetary temperature beyond the limits experienced during the last 1000 years</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How accurate has this prediction turned out to be? We are now early in the next century, has the mean temperature pushed beyond that experienced over the past thousand years?</p>
<p>The paper was published in 1975 and talks about a &quot;present cooling trend&quot;. I thought that global warming kicked in along with the industrial revolution; what cooling trend was Broeker talking about?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-well-have-climate-models-projected-global-warming" target="_blank">Pretty accurate</a>, although he underestimated the cooling effect of human aerosol emissions (&quot;man-made dust&quot;) a little bit. Yes, temperatures are the warmest they have been in the last 10,000 years and probably much longer. Global temperatures are a bit iffier to date further back than 10,000 years because you have to use more indirect things like ocean temperature records from fossils at the bottom of the ocean and measurements of isotopes from ice cores in Antarctica and Greenland. Turning these measurements into a globally-averaged temperature is hard and pretty inaccurate. For the last few 1000 years we can use tree rings, which are related to temperature, to measure spatial patterns of temperature changes on land pretty accurately.</p>
<p>Broecker was talking about a <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/" target="_blank">brief cooling period from 1940s-1970s</a>. Coincidentally, the cooling trend basically ended in 1975 and we've had a solid warming trend every since.</p></div>		</li>
