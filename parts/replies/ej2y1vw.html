			<div class="markdown"><p>I felt a low-grade nausea virtually every morning in high school. Looking back, I'm pretty sure it was anxiety or stress related.</p>
<p>A doctor described it to me like this: when you're stressed, adrenaline is pumped out in high doses. Too high of a concentration makes you feel nauseous as the chemicals from your blood begun to spread into your stomach. I can't speak for how true that is, but the metaphor stuck with me for a long time. And it turns out that brain problems and gut problems are linked in <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-gut-brain-connection" target="_blank">surprising ways</a>. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for mentioning adrenaline. Every once in a while, I’ll get quick but extreme bouts of nausea and after the feeling passed it just feels like a very concentrated dose of adrenaline. Kind of like the feeling you get when you narrowly avoid a car accident. I tried explaining it to my doctor and he sent me to a gastroenterologist. Two years of tests and still nothing but I haven’t been treated for anxiety yet aside fro. Being prescribed a Vitamin D supplement and an antidepressant that I never even filled. </p></div>		</li>
