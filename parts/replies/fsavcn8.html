			<div class="markdown"><p>Also you can see the haystack. MH370 is under water, and under a load of silt, in the pitch black depths of an area that's been 'narrowed down' to that of a small country or territory. And it's in pieces. </p>
<p>&quot;How do you find a needle in a haystack?&quot; - magnets. Or you can <em>burn the haystack</em> and all that remains will be ash and a piece of metal between one and fourteen inches (depending on the 'needle').</p>
<p>&quot;How do you find a crashed airplane out at sea?&quot; - that's the real question. It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack in a pile of needles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, we can see so much out there in the universe due to how much there is to see.</p>
<p>A good example is the <a href="https://www.spacetelescope.org/science/deep_fields/" target="_blank">Hubble Deep Field</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And this example is also a good example of how we inspect the ocean floor. Not all of our sky is examined with that atttion to the minute detail.</p>
<p>The Hubble Deep Filed is just a very very small part that we have looked into, and we did this with certain small parts of our world's ocean likewise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really just not that interesting. When you get to the parts of the ocean where there is no sunlight, you really don't see much. Anglerfist, Dumbo octopuses, etc... Are cool but that's what you find after like a looooong time looking. Mostly it's just crabs and dirt.</p></div>		</li>
