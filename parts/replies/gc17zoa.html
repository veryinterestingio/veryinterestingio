			<div class="markdown"><p>yep, came to say this but I'm glad someone already did. I was dating then married for a couple years, and my step kids, especially the youngest, had a really tough shake. I certainly empathize and understand why, but my wife was way in the habit of tuning the kids out. But then would occasionally tune IN and be mad how loud they were. Once this is a child's MO though, that's just kind of how they operate... I think eventually they unlearn it a bit for the sake of fitting in better with their friends at school though. But as you can imagine, it doesn't necessarily even out like that for a few years at least, I would think.</p></div>		</li>
