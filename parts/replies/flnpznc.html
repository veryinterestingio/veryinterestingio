<p>Also, a recession doesn’t necessarily mean a lack of money.</p>

<p>It actually does. And you partially explained it. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Businesses have a harder time getting  loans and are less likely to take risks.</p>

<p>A business is then paying back previous loans and not taking new loans. </p>
<p>The supply of money is decreasing. That $100 loan payment gets erased, basically throwing the cash into the fire, as the bank crosses it off their balance sheet. But there’s no new money being created from any loans. The actual sum of all the bank accounts in the world dropped by $100</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, once people lose their jobs the spending  goes down. The government forcing people
to spend wouldn’t work that well and probably isn’t legal. </p>
<p>But the government can take steps to avoid or end a recession. The FED has taken bold action to make sure that money is available to anyone who wants it. Banks, businesses, and people all can have confidence that money is available through loans and other borrowing. The government has taken action to ensure that businesses and people survive the quarantine and have resources to keep the economy afloat. However, as long as the lockdowns are in place, the economy will suffer.  </p>
<p>The current plan is to provide relief and set the stage so that the economy can take off once the lockdowns end. However, no one really knows how long this crisis will last. The longer it lasts the more businesses will go under and the longer it will take to return to “normal”. We are also seeing that the virus is exposing problems in government, the economy, healthcare, and the perceptions of the people.
These will force changes that will impact our future economy. We are also in a very contentious election year that will change the outlook on the economy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, the money still exists, but may not be a liquid asset. I.e. own a house or car or have a retirement fund. All three of these assets have value but none can be easily converted into cash based on their true value during a recession. One of the biggest issues is a lack of loanable funds. If you can’t borrow money and you don’t have any cash on hand it’s nearly impossible to participate in the economy.</p></div>		</li>
