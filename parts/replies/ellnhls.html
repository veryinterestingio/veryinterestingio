			<div class="markdown"><p>So that's how the scrolling is cut off! I used to use inspect element pretty often to overcome the annoying banners that &quot;scrolled with you&quot; and greyed out the rest of the screen and deleting the given element (like you described), but I got stumped on when it would lock the scrolling. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There a great chrome plug in called &quot;f*ck overlays&quot; that I love to use.</p>
<p>Any element on the page you don't want to see? Right click and select fuck it, then it's gone.</p>
<p>Essentially a shortcut which sets the display property of the element to hidden without opening the developer console yourself.</p>
<p>Works for the occasional time I see something on pinterest since I refuse to make an account.</p>
