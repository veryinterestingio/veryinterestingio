			<div class="markdown"><p>It does align the polymer chains in the direction of the stretching, but the white is coming from the induced free volume in the crazed. The light does interact differently with the surfaces of the voids/cracks, but as far as I’m aware it isn’t really related to crystallinity. But I could easily be wrong  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You aren't going to get crystalinity just from flexing the material. Crystalinity is mostly set when polymerization occurs. It can be induced in the mold or if you reheat the polymer into the higher glass transition temperature/ re melt it. If you melt it you can induce crystalinity with the help of an additive, the rapidity of cooling or stretching the material in multiple directions, though this is much harder to get into a crystaline form than during polymerisation.</p>
<p>You are right, the discolouration comes from the void space between the strands of the polymer chain, rather than the polymer itself. </p></div>		</li>
