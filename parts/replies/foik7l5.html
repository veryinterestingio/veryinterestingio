			<div class="markdown"><p>The shell is always vapor permeable. They have to dry to a certain level before they will pop. If you heat too slowly the boiling water can produce less than popping pressure and diffuse through the shell until there isn't enough liquid left to produce popping pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most microwaves vary between about 800W and 1200W, so it's not a <em>huge</em> difference. However keep in mind that as you heat something the heat is also dissipating into the air as well, so you're losing a bit, and this amount is dependent mostly on the temperature of the food. For an 800W microwave, the heat you're losing will be a far higher percentage of the total heat coming in (800W), so it actually heats <em>less</em> than 2/3rds of the 1200W microwave. Just like if you put a stovetop on high, water might boil in 3 minutes. If you put it on the lowest setting that might provide 1/4 the heat, it will <em>never</em> boil, because once it reaches a certain temperature it starts losing heat at the same rate it's coming in from the element, so it the net change is 0 and it won't get hotter. So even though the 1200W is 150% of the power of the 800W, it will pop the kernels in less than 2/3rds the time, probably closer to half, which is what you're seeing.</p>
<p>Oh, the magnetron in microwaves can also take a bit of time to get up to full working temperature (the filament won't emit many electrons until it's hot), so the first ~10s or so might be nowhere near full power. In older, cheaper microwaves this is likely to be worse, which will affect the cooking time as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all popcorn is the same, the actual time varies a lot. I stop the microwave when it slows down to three seconds between pops. It is the optimal way and I keep track of how many unpopped kernels there are left in the bag.</p>
<p>It's usually around 10-15.</p></div>		</li>

Hallowed be thy scent,<br />
Thy popping come,<br />
Thy noisy fun,<br />
In microwave as it is on stove.<br />
Give us this day our daily corn,<br />
And forgive our burnings,<br />
As we forgive those few unpopped kernels.<br />
And lead us not into cinemas;<br />
But deliver us from overpriced snacks.<br />
For thine is the taste sensation,<br />
With the melted butter and the salt,<br />
The sugar and the caramel,<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>You make it sound so industrial. I have a <a href="https://www.xenos.nl/popcornmachine" target="_blank">30 euro</a> countertop one that air pops them and blows them into a bowl. No oil, so healthier, no burnt ones and I get may 2 or 3 unpopped ones when I do it and they typically don't even end up in the bucket. </p>
<p>Great machine.</p>
<p>Pro tip, for anyone wanting the most authentic popcorn taste buy some Flavacol seasoning salt. Best used for oil popping popcorn on the stove, but I find spreading it over afterwards works well.</p>
<p>Edit: If you want the best stove topped popcorn, IE least burnt risk, heat up oil with 2 or 3 kernels in it. When they pop pull it off the heat and add the rest of the popcorn kernels and remove the popped ones. Let them heat up in the oil for 30 seconds or so and then bring it back on the heat, they should all pop really quickly!</p>
<p>I'm a bit of a popcorn lover.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a similar countertop popper, it's shit. Like, how do you season the popcorn? Just sprinkling some salt on them after they popped doesn't work, they're without oil so salt doesn't stick.</p>
<p>I can't put anything in the machine either as the bowl isn't removable, cleaning it would be tricky.</p></div>		</li>
