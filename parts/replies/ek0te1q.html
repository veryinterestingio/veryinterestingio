			<div class="markdown"><p>A fully sequenced Neanderthal genome has been out for almost a decade now, so it's fairly straightforward to compare sequences from humans with this as a reference.  Of course, our species have extremely similar genomes (something like 99.7% sequence similarity, which is about a full percentage point higher than our similarity to chimpanzees; <a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/05/100506-science-neanderthals-humans-mated-interbred-dna-gene/" target="_blank">source</a>), but there are still enough differences to tell them apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Define human.  Neanderthals are sometimes classified as Homo neanderthalensis and sometimes as Homo sapiens neanderthalensis.  Modern Humans would then be either Homo sapiens or Homo sapiens sapiens.  So Denisovans and Neanderthals may have been sub species instead full separate species.  Homo actually means human being in latin, and would be fair to classify all species in the Genus Homo to be human.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So everything in our DNA, whether Sapiens, Neanderthal, Denisovan, or some other species in the Homo Genus would be human. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fairness, my comment probably doesn't really fit the tone of the subreddit lol, I just wanted to provide some further information for anyone interested, and I assumed based on OP's phrasing that they already have some familiarity with the background to this topic.  It's quite difficult to explain relatively nuanced subjects like this in a way that an actual five-year-old would understand, and I often struggle to get much below ELI15-ish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What always blows my mind is thinking about the time when that mix was happening. There must have been loads of birth defects based on incompatibilities between the species, strange effects that we can't even predict, and then every once in awhile an absolute unit of a motherfucker where all the genes aligned perfectly by chance. Like a Hercules. But still, what do you think the live birth rate would have been for a Sapiens and Neanderthal mix? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think just fine, but some of the offspring could have been infertile. Like Mules. Or it could have been like Grizzlies and Polar Bears, which produce perfectly normal and fertile cubs. I don't think the mix would have been too crazy at all, Neanderthals didn't look all that different. If anything, the homo sapiens groups at the time might have suffered from inbreeding as they were quite spread out and introducing Neanderthal DNA might have saved our back to survive as a species. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious, is this an educated opinion? I've heard there are negative issues that continue due to Neanderthal DNA so it seems reasonable to me that a 50:50 mix would be more problematic on average, not less. I'm no expert though. </p></div>		</li>
