			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, stupid question: isn't this why we used to hold babies upside down and hit or spank them once? It's not great optics, so I get why we don't do that anymore, but wouldn't it get the job done in an emergency?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We haven’t done that for a few decades now. Hanging a baby upside-down was probably thought to aid fluid drainage out of the lungs but fluid is not usually the issue and you risk dropping the slippery little bugger on its head. </p>
<p>These days we take the baby to a warm spot, dry and stimulate them, use a bag and mask to inflate the lungs, then continue to ventilate if needed until the baby starts breathing. If the heart rate is also low then we may add chest compressions. </p>
<p>In the 15+ years I’ve been a midwife, I’ve only had to give a few babies anything more than a  few inflation breaths - term babies are more robust than they look!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My baby was born with two loops of cord around his neck, the poor guy. They called a code for him and rushed in an oxygen setup, but he perked up on his own right as they were getting it set up. He gave me a fright. 27 seconds without breathing, and he was a fast one! He's my first and he was born in one, 30-minute long contraction. </p>
<p>Thank you for what you midwives and OB/Gyns do. You are amazing people! My baby was actually delivered by a nurse contrary to our plans (high risk MFM) because he came so dang fast, and I was so happy to have that nurse midwife!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans in general. I remember reading a story of a toddler getting run over by some kind of vehicle, someone backing out of a driveway or something, and the kid was totally fine, if a bit traumatized. His bones were flexible enough that nothing broke even from the weight of a vehicle rolling over him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are now better methods to stimulate a neonate to breathe. 6 minutes is a long time, and nowadays if the oxygen saturation hasn't progressed in a satisfactory manner, the delivery team with get equipment (ambu bag) ready to help delivery oxygen and even intubate if necessary.  It's pretty common for babies to have respiratory abnormalities and irregularities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't this why they now say not to cut the cord immediately? There's still oxygen in that blood, and it's being circulated. Have they stopped cutting it immediately? Or is that still a common practice?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Delayed cord clamping is common now, there is so much of the babies blood still flowing from the placenta and once it’s all finished the cord will turn white/translucent and look like calamari. It usually only takes 5 or so minutes but a lot of people leave it in tact for longer than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I cut the cord pretty quickly, within a minute or so. They tried getting her to breathe before cutting the cord and they didn’t start the timer until I cut the cord. I think they needed to move her to the warming area so the other team could work on my wife.</p></div>		</li>
