			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi MarijnBerg,</p>
<p>Within this we utilise the term deviancy in a more contemporary sense rather than the traditional sociological term.  Professor Atkinson, who was kind enough to write a foreword for the book noted in 2014 that Stan Cohen (1998:9) had highlighted the inadequacies of criminology when he posed the following three questions that criminology seeks to answer:</p>
<p>· Why are laws made? </p>
<p>· Why are they broken?</p>
<p>· What do we do or what should we do about this?</p>
<p>·  </p>
<p>The essence of this was that criminology is largely shaped by the criminal justice, obviously. But, this produces a level of short “sightedness” so to speak for social scientists endeavouring for criminology enquiry. So when we set out to explore video games and sought to look past the “video games cause violence” hyperbole we were very aware of the inherent issues with using the more routine criminological approaches. </p>
<p>From this we began to pull upon the work of Dr Thomas Rayman and Doctor Oliver Smith who are rapidly developing the theoretical frame work known as “deviant leisure”. This framework, which draws upon Zemiology, Ultra Realism and some facts of cultural criminology seeks to reconceptualise social deviance and explore how individual, social, economic and environmental harms are structurally and culturally embedded within contemporary forms of leisure. In the simplest terms, deviant leisure focuses on the proliferation of harm rather than socially constructed notion of crime. This allowed us to endeavour towards much more nuanced interpretation of how harm can be proliferated on such media platforms as well as what we would usually categorise as crime.</p>
<p>So, keeping this as short as possible because it is a great question and important for people to understand what we mean by the term deviancy and how we apply it in this work it is perhaps best to give you a direct quote from the book:</p>
<p><em>“…with such a focus of the video games industry, which allows us to question the depth and spectrum of harms,</em></p>
<p><em>it is crucial to first articulate what is meant by deviancy. As Smith and Raymen (2018) detail, the perspective is shaped by both cultural criminology’s critique of liberal and consumer capitalism (Hayward, 2016) and ultrarealism’s (Winlow &amp; Hall, 2006) focus upon the corrosive nature of consumer capitalism corrosive values, which underpin harmful subjectivities. From this approach, the atypical and widely accepted perspective of deviancy accepted within sociology, premised upon behaviour which exceeds the tolerance of the community (Clinard &amp; Meier, 2007), is ‘inverted’ (Smith &amp; Raymen, 2018). From this opposing theoretical gaze, we can begin to ascertain how the sociopolitical structures, framed within economic capital as the central driving force, promote modes of deviant behaviour as a normalised. We increasingly pursue individual identities, utilising symbolic materials and</em></p>
<p><em>experiences as the signifier of such an identity. However, the increasing homogeneity propelled by consumer culture stifles the possibility of the desired individuality. Such bids for individuality invariably lead to those engaged within the nexus to impinge upon the rights of the other (Smith &amp; Raymen, 2018), resulting in a multitude of harms, though due to the homogenisation of material culture the harms are largely unrecognised. Smith and Raymen (2018) identify four core harms within the remit of deviant leisure: subjective harms, environmental harms, socially corrosive harms and embedded harms</em>.”</p>
<p>So, in short we attempted within the book to begin discussions around how video games can embed and perpetuate harms within those four areas.</p>
<p>I hope that makes sense and sorry if the formatting is awful. We all regularly use Reddit but rarely post, I normally get bogged down in reading the latest AITA to my wife or fixate on the aquarium community (Craig).</p>
<p>As far as the second question (another good one) throughout the project we saw attention to loot boxes and the recognition of them as harmful forms of gambling begin to really pick up pace. In the United Kingdom it is currently being discussed within parliament on and off. This was the main area that concerned us. The area we did not concentrate on within the book but have colleagues currently working on is the crunch culture within the video games industry. This really concerns us as it is endemic of the wider harms we are seeing within the economy at the moment. </p>
<p>Thank you for the questions!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi U/chenobble,</p>
<p>It is important that we evaluate and critically explore the term “deviancy”. We have noticed already that lots of the questions here use the more “traditional” understanding of the term in relation to the breaking away from or violation of standardised norms and values. This book adopts the relatively new approach to deviancy outlined by the work of Dr Oliver Smith and Dr Thomas Raymen in that we need to instead explore those behaviours and attitudes that are not only harmful (in a variety of ways) but are actually encouraged within a neo-liberal consumer capitalist society (for instance, online gambling; the travel tourist industry; night-time economy etc.). In a just and more moral society such behaviours would be seen under more traditional perspectives of deviancy, but as of right now these are actively encouraged and perpetuated under our current political economy. Further still, as detailed by Smith and Raymen, these normalised and actively encouraged behaviours fall under 4 main harms: subjective harms (If anyone out there is a fan of Žižek they will understand the use of the term “subjective” - imagine bar fights, for instance); environmental harms (tourism and pollution, for instance); socially corrosive harms (take Trump’s acquisition of an enormous stretch of Aberdeenshire coast and thus effectively cornering off a large swath of land for just those who could afford to enter); and finally embedded harms (think of those activities that are highly normalised and characterised by extreme individuality and perceptions of “coolness” i.e. the online gambling industry and all the harms associated with it).</p>
<p>Does that make a bit more sense? If not let us know and we can try a different way :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's seems to be suffering from successive sources all falling to jargon heavy language. It'd be nice if the sources reference were paraphrased to be easily understood, but it's pretty common for scientists to fall into the trap of verbose language.</p>
<p>It's why concise language emphasised in uni.. and then promptly forgotten afterwards.</p></div>		</li>
