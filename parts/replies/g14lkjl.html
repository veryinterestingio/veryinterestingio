			<div class="markdown"><p>So speakers are just a vibrating surface that create pressure waves through the air, which we interpret as sound. When an explosion that big happens on the ground the pressure wave is fragmented into many parts because it travels at vastly different speeds through different materials. Basically the entire area around the explosion is turned into a bunch of massive speakers and you are actually hearing the vibrations coming from the earth at different times based on how solid the material they passed through was, then the final one is the actual pressure wave that has traveled through the air all the way from the explosion itself</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems that there was fireworks stored in the same building, those caught on fire triggering multiple small explosions and fireworks going off, which started an even bigger fire which eventually hit the fertilizer causing the whole thing to explode.</p></div>		</li>
