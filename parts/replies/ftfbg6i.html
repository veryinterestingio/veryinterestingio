			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a common misconception that we'll ever &quot;cure&quot; any cancer. Cancer refers to a whole range of different things, which can loosely be called &quot;abnormal cell growth&quot;. Your body is often fighting cancerous growths off before you ever realise. </p>
<p>We will just improve treatments until they are so good we can deal with most cancers (hopefully), but it's likely to be a mix of different treatments for different cancers depending on a massive range of individual factors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep cancer is inherent process of higher life forms DNA. Only a select few very basic animals avoid it. Jellyfish that can revert to juvenile stage basically live forever but don't do a whole lot.</p>
<p>I think the naked mole rat is one of the most advanced creatures with exceptional resistance to development of cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could also say it‘s a probability game. As cells divide and DNA replicates, it‘s going to have errors, no matter how good the self checks are. It‘s just statistics. The immune system usually takes care of aberrant cells, but when it can‘t manage anymore, you get cancer.</p>
<p>We also see more people dying of cancer because they aren‘t dying from other causes like they used to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup - the popular misconception is that 'cancer' is this single monolithic condition with a single cause and therefore a single treatment.</p>
<p>Instead, it's an entire category of conditions - being mutations of cells that self replicate. It would be like considering all birds to be a single entity and being surprised why penguins are different to eagles are different to emus are different to macaws are different to finches are different to kiwis, etc...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well wouldn't it be fair to say that if we could either improve cell replication in general (all cell types, isn't there something about t-cells here?) Or be able to identify and remove irregular cells (a function of our white blood cells anyways?) That we could? This is obviously a massive over simplification, but the idea being that all in all it's bad cell replication, that it would be possible to address?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scientist: my team and I have painstakingly done research and experimentation and after many dead ends, we have found something that may be helpful in treating cancer. </p>
<p>Reporter: so if this were to completely exceed your expectations and cure all cancers, would you call it a breakthrough?</p>
<p>Scientist: well sure, if it did way more than we’re suggesting it’s even capable of doing. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this is basically it.</p>
<p>Just think about the news cycle. When you hear about 50 girls kidnapped from their school in Africa every day for a week, then do not hear about it for 2 years when some of them get rescued, had they suddenly disappeared out of existence for two years? no. The media just keep moving on. It is actually dreadful, it shows that 99% of real news is of no use to the reader/viewer except for effective entertainment purposes.</p>
<p>In terms of drugs research breakthroughs, if you keep reading the literature, you will find that the breakthroughs do not disappear, and can be read about frequently in the peer reviewed literature. In short, if you want entertainment, watch the news. If you want to know what's going on in research, it takes some effort, but many articles are freely available.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pop science news is just plain terrible, the headline you see will almost always be altered heavily from what an advance actually is for the sake of attention grabbing clickbait, too often falling just shy of legal liability. It can be that bad.</p>
<p>As for cancer treatments, there's a ton in trials, or just starting to show up, or etc. Drugs take a long, long, long assed time with a lot of expense to develop. But for certain types of cancer there's now pills and other treatments in varying stages and levels of availability that can highly reduce or even sometimes eliminate the need for chemo. The average survivability for cancer has shot way up for decades and looks set to continue until cancer isn't even a big concern for most, assuming they have access to treatment. It'll just take quite a while to get there.</p></div>		</li>
