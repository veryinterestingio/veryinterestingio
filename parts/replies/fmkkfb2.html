			<div class="markdown"><p>I just know that I can't picture things in my head? I found out that other people could. </p>
<p>I first heard about aphantasia when it was in the news because of some research article like 5 years ago and I asked a coworker &quot;wait, when people say they're picturing something in their heads they don't mean they're actually seeing a picture, right? It's just a figure of speech for &quot;think about the concept of?&quot;&quot; He assured me that of course people don't actually see an image in their minds. It later turned out we both have aphantasia.  </p>
<p>One example of where it's kind of obvious in hindsight was that I always found mindfulness &quot;visualization&quot; exercises to be silly and I never understood the point. It turns out that other people are actually <em>picturing</em> something though. My therapist tried to get me to go through a &quot;rescripting&quot; exercise for a recurring nightmare that I have, and visualizing the rescripted version is supposed to be an important part of that, but I just can't do that. I was able to imagine some of the sensory experiences instead, but my imagination just doesn't involve a visual component.</p></div>		</li>
