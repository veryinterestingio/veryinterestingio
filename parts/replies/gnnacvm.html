			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is oxygen such a big sign of life when there are plenty of plants and anaerobic organisms that would be perfectly fine without it? Why is it that of all chemicals in our atmosphere, oxygen is the one that stands out the most?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because O2 is very reactive and does not last long in the atmosphere before reacting with something. Therefore, there must be a continuous source of new oxygen being produced, and the only significant source* of atmospheric O2 we know of is via photosynthesis.</p>
<p>*Note that there have been some studies which hypothesize abiotic sources of O2, such as <a href="https://phys.org/news/2015-09-oxygen-definitive-evidence-life-habitable.html" target="_blank">UV induced reduction of titanium oxide</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well we know that life is essential for life on Earth, at least in its current form. Also, if I remember correctly, oxygen is relatively unstable, so it needs to be constantly replenished, which plants do for us on Earth. So if we detect oxygen in the atmosphere of another planet, it strongly suggests life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dioxygen is actually <em>produced</em> by plants when they photosynthesize. I don't believe that any other mechanism is known to produce it in large amounts (O2 represents around 21% of our atmosphere). Dinitrogen, the other predominant gas (78% of the atmosphere), is replenished by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2271" target="_blank">the tectonic activity</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best chance of an alien civilization (for the sake of example around Alpha Cen) to see life on Earth would probably be via the radio emission that our societies give off. I'm not exactly sure if we would be able to detect an Earth-like level of radio emission coming from Alpha Cen, but there are certainly efforts to detect whatever signals there may be (see <a href="https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/initiative/1" target="_blank"><a href="https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/initiative/1" target="_blank">https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/initiative/1</a></a>). </p>
<p>In terms of our experiment, we showed that we are close to being able to have the capabilities to image an Earth-like planet in the habitable zone of Alpha Cen. In another decade, I expect we will reach the sensitivity necessary to achieve this goal. In other words, if another civilization is on the other side and is just a few decades ahead of us, their technology would likely be able to see that the sun has a planet in its habitable zone. If such hypothetical aliens were a bit further ahead, they may even be able to perform spectroscopy to determine some basic properties of our biosphere, regardless of our radio signals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The wild part to think about is that if complex life exists on other planets, it will be either millions of years &quot;behind&quot; us or millions of years ahead <em>at minimum</em>. The chance that they will be within even a few thousand years of technological development from us is effectively zero. It'd be like trying to guess a number between one and one million and expecting to get within 10.</p>
<p>Heavy elements and stable star systems have been around for billions of years before our solar system even existed. There is no barrier we know of that would have prevented technological life from arising before the earth was even a planet. Which really segues us into the Fermi Paradox. Why is it so quiet?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And even in the near zero chance say they were within 3000 years, that would still put them far far ahead of us in technically advancement. </p>
<p>The Star Trek idea that alien civilisations would have anything significantly in common with us is also of near zero chance. I suspect if we were ever to discover actual complex alien life forms, they would either be simple bugs or so advanced, we would be the bugs to them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People say that the stars are quiet, but let me ask you: how long have humans been looking? On geologic and astronomical timescales, our search period is negligible. In terms of astronomy, as a species, we don't even get all the low-hanging fruit in terms of discoveries...</p></div>		</li>
