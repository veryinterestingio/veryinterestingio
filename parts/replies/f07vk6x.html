			<div class="markdown"><p>and this points out some of what is being missed by the other comments on this thread so far, which is that a magnetic field does not induce current. A <em>changing</em> magnetic field induces current. </p>
<p>Moving in and out of the MRI is a changing field but sitting in an MRI would do nothing electrically even to a loop of wire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple kinds of magnets in an MRI scanner. The big one (1.5 T, 3.0 T, etc.) is a static field that is always on. It typically will not cause nerve stimulation unless you move through it too quickly. There are also changing magnetic fields that only operate when the magnet is on. These can cause nerve stimulation even when the patient is not moving. This is a common concern for patients undergoing intensive scans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An MRI isn't a single constant magnetic field.</p>
<p>&quot;Pulses of radio waves excite the nuclear spin energy transition, and magnetic field gradients localize the signal in space. By varying the parameters of the pulse sequence, different contrasts may be generated between tissues based on the relaxation properties of the hydrogen atoms therein.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Read that text again. It's just saying the radio component is pulsed. The magnetic field remains constant.</p>
<p>The idea behind an MRI is that the magentic field causes polar molecules (dipoles) in your body to line-up with the static magnetic field. A radio pulse is then used to knock these lined molecules out of alignment. When they realign after the pulse has ceased, these rotating dipoles, create a small counter electromagnetic signal that can be read. Because your body has different concentations of these polar molecules in the different tissues, different signal strengths occur that can be read and interpreted to show you the structure of these tissues.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The main magnetic field can certainly cause these kinds of effects. In addition, there are constantly changing magnetic gradient fields that are used during the operation of the scanner. The gradient fields change quickly in time which produces a large flux and possible nerve stimulation. Both the main field and the gradient fields can cause effects in patients.</p></div>		</li>
