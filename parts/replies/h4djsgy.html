<p>But why is it faster. And also there’s the impact of deflection of movement.</p></div>		</li>

Any sound made in the cockpit should move at the speed of sound plus the speed of sound. Since it's all relative. The only time this exception shouldn't work is with the speed of light, since there's no way to go faster than the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is more of a general note, and anyone correct me if I'm wrong, but worth noting the same effect you see with speed of light applies at lower speeds too, to a smaller extent.</p>
<p>Using arbitrary units (as I'm not using exact numbers). Observer on the ground sees 1000speed jet. Jet fires a rocket at (from own perspective) 1000speed. The observer doesn't see rocket fly at 2000speed, but only 1500 (for example, depends on how exactly you define one &quot;speed&quot;). As you approach speed of light, the perceived speed of rocket by either observer gets closer and closer (and they equal at speed of light), while at speeds near 0, they approach values you'd traditionally expect (Vgroud_rocket = Vground_jet + Vjet_rocket).<br />
If 1000 speed = speed of light, they'd both see rocket at 1000 speed. If 1000 speed = 0.000000000000000000001% speed of light, they'd see rocket at approx 2000speed/1000speed respectively. </p>
<p>At speeds actual jets fly tho, this effect is negligible.</p></div>		</li>
