			<div class="markdown"><p>Mountain Dew <em>starts out</em> more flat than most sodas because they put less in it. Some people like that. You can carbonate Mountain Dew up more - there is nothing about the cans or their formula that hurts carbonation. </p>
<p>It will hold its carbonation better if you can keep its container colder and/or close the container, or better yet <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pressurized-Beer-Mini-Keg-System/dp/B07DQ7CLKP" target="_blank">put it in a re-pressurize container </a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well thats pretty sweet, i stopped drinking dew from the 2L bottles because it never held its fizz but thats genius. With that i could keep it fizzy for longer with a little effort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. It's super easy, and makes you the hero of a kid's birthday party. </p>
<p>Heres the long version. Get a cheap styrofoam container, a little hammer, tongs, and those clear plastic beverage dispenser things for picnics with the little valve like a keg has, get like 10 lbs of dry ice, and a drink or two that matches the color theme of the party. Before the party starts, mix up your drink and plop in chunks of dry ice until you have fog billowing out the top. It takes like 30 minutes before it tastes fizzy, though, and you have to babysit it and keep dropping chunks in. The clear  beverage dispenser thing lets them see the bubbling and fog and color of the drink to choose, and also ensures that no big bits of dry ice get in the cups.</p>
<p>Making your own sparkling cranberry juice or something like that is more for adults, and I considered getting a mini keg kit so I could hold it at pressure and keep the fizz and premake everything before a party, but that was too much cost/work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure, lots of variables go into the minutia of this reaction, I'm just trying to paint with broad strokes and keep it in line with the spirit of ELI5. I've been trying to dive deeper in little chunks as people ask specific questions. Maybe I'll make a master post with all the little details and supporting source links.</p>
<p>What are some of the more out there things you have tried? Dry ice is a great way to lower the temperature to introduce carbon dioxide to normally stubborn solution and get it to stay put for a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Out there? In terms of method or choice of drink? Real juices carbonated are my favorite - like sparkling cranberry juice, sparkling tart cherry juice, etc. You can just buy pre-made pop or carbonated water, so I try to carbonate stuff I can't just buy.</p>
<p>Dry ice is already enough out there that it will make you the hero of any kids party -  show up with some koolaid mixes that the right colors to match the theme in clear plastic drink dispensers with fog billowing out the top. The kids will think you are a magician, and the adults will think you are a chemist. &quot;Come on guys, its just dry ice from walmart.&quot;</p>
<p>What I have wanted to do but never gotten into is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BACOENG-Pressurized-Growler-Secondary-Regulator/dp/B077ZQC74W" target="_blank">kegs</a>.  You can carbonate with CO2 gas, and you can hold your fizzy stuff at pressure so it stays fizzy like an un-opened  soda can. You could also still use dry ice, but make sure you have a pressure regulator. Dry ice blows lids off plastic drink dispensers, but a metal one could go boom in a scary way. Kegs would be better to bring custom drinks to an adult party, but they lack that fog magic kids like so much.</p></div>		</li>
