			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand it differently.
The danger associated with rapid decompression of absorbed gasses in the blood (the bends) is most often observed in people breathing pressurized gas. Scuba divers.
However the problem isn't exactly breathing pressurized gas. It's your blood absorbing pressured gas.
It could theoretically happen in free diving. If we could hold out breath long enough for our blood to absorb significant enough amounts of gas at those pressures, then rapidly decompress, you could get bends.</p>
<p>In fact whales can get the bends.</p>
<p>As per this article.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer it depends. The effects are compounded by how long and what type of gas you've absorbed as well as how fast you ascend. Worst case? The dissolved nitrogen in your body moves into your blood stream, forms into bubbles and you choke on your own blood while simultaneously having air embolisms in your spinal column, brain and joints. I've never seen it in person but have read and talked to people that have and its incredibly painful. </p>
<p>Best case is you come up slower and under shoot your deco limit. You'll have the same problem but not as bad, joint pain, difficulty breathing and headaches. </p>
<p>You can prevent this by spending time under pressure or &quot;at depth&quot; by coming up slowly and letting the compressed gas slowly exit you. </p>
<p>Think shaking up a bottle of soda then opening it fast vs opening it up just a little at a time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scuba divers who venture beyond ~15m (basically anything other than introductory diving) level are trained to slowly return to the surface over the course on 10ish minutes, or wait 5m below for several minutes in a &quot;decompression stop&quot;. Many divemasters will plan the route so that the stop is unnecessary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Decompression illness is mainly caused by absorption of nitrogen in the blood stream as the body cannot metabolize nitrogen.  As others have pointed out partial pressure of gas theory applies and oxygen can become toxic over certain limits (in diving we are taught to keep SPO2 below 1.4 as partial pressure of Oxygen over 1.6 can lead to central nervous system issues including convulsions and dying).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>But holding your breath wouldnâ€™t change the amount of oxygen in your body</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It still changes the partial pressure, but the effect is smaller. The air in your lungs gets compressed, increasing its partial pressure and pushing more gas into the blood. If you don't have a gas supply under water then the air in your lungs is everything that can be added to the blood stream, however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shallow water blackout is caused by a sudden decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen in your lungs &amp; blood.</p>
<p>Going deeper allows your body to absorb more oxygen from your lungs and when you ascend it can be very dangerous.</p>
<p>When freediving on a breath hold you compress the air in your lungs and that increases the partial pressure allowing more oxygen to be used.</p></div>		</li>
