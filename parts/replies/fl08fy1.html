			<div class="markdown"><p>There'll be some shifts in the microbiota, but in general things tend to balance out just like in humans after the first few days.</p>
<p>Worst case scenario, you can do a rumen contents transplant. Those cows with portholes on their sides (rumenotomies) are more than just novelties. Got a sick cow on your farm? Grab some rumen contents from that cow and force feed it to the sick one. It's been practiced for decades, and only more recently gained attention in human medicine to help treat certain digestive disorders.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats super interesting. Many mammals are omnivores but don't actively hunt, squirrels or hippos for example. But I'm guessing the weight of the insects ingested in a day isn't really a big factor?</p></div>		</li>
