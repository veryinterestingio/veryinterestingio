			<div class="markdown"><p>Architect here, this is 100% correct.  For this to work, you have to have a 3 pole (or 3 way) switch at each end, instead of the standard 2 pole switch.  3 pole means that there are 3 wires attached to each switch (ignoring ground wiring), one that leads to the rest of the circuit and one that leads to each of the paths - A and B - that you mentioned in your explanation.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiway_switching" target="_blank">wiki</a> on it has a few good diagrams to explain visually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>4 way switches are actually much easier to install than 3 ways. The wires Path A and Path B wires , we call them travelers in the field, just make up on either side of the switch. You basically have travelers in and travelers out. You can’t hardly mess it up, and it’s exactly the same if you want to switch in 4 places or 4000. Just keep jumping travelers from one 4 way to the next.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any trick where you can use 2 pole switches? I could swear my old installation had a light controlled with 2 pole switches and part of the sorcery was having a jumper wire on (at least) one of the switches but I could never find any schematic that would replicate that and I was too young at the time to remember exact details.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds like someone modified a 2 pole switch into a 3 pole switch by adding a jumper wire as the third pole.  I would recommend not doing this, as it is not a UL rated assembly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s been a long time since I was helping my dad with construction but I think they made two-way/three-way switches where it was a 2 way out of the box and if you broke a tab off it became a three way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Over here (house built during this century in Finland) there's typically a relay to turn the lights on/off and the actual light switches just toggle the relay. No need for complicated wiring.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Both switches are always pointing to either A or B. Both switches need to point to the same path (A or B) for the light to turn on. The first line is where the light would be in the circuit and my reddit formatting skills make children cry.</p></div>		</li>
