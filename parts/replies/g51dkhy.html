			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on the surface getting dirty thing, most tape is two parts: a strong sticky (what's explained above) that is slow to get sticky, and a weak sticky that is immediate, but weak. The thing is, a little of the weak sticky gets peeled off every time the tape touches something.</p>
<p>ELI10: The reason tape seems to lose its stick is that the quick stick (tacking agent) usually holds the tape in place while the slow stick (pressure sensitive adhesive) cures. But without that quick stick, nothing is keeping the pressure on the tape, so to speak, so the adhesive won't cure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if have some used tape, whose tacking agent is gone, I could still use it if I was willing to spend some time (Minutes? Hours?) pressing togheter the two surfaces?<br />
Also, I would think that every time you stick and unstick some tape, even some of the pressure sensitive adhesive would stay on the old surface. Or it does not?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s fascinating. What’s the mechanism for the pressure dependent changes, ELI20?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're asking about this solid/liquid metamorphosis it's because there are fluids that are called Bingham plastics. These are solids that starts to flow under certain conditions like after applying finite force. Perfect everyday example of this is tooth paste.  </p>
<p>If you want to know more check on wikipedia for Newtonian and Non-Newtonian fluids.</p></div>		</li>
