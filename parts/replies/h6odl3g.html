			<div class="markdown"><p>Firstly the babyâ€™ immune system would most likely not be developed enough to tolerate infection. Secondly, generally no is the answer to your question. We can see thsy even when people as adults are given the vaccine but are infused with antibodies shortly after for due to infection with covid, their response to the vaccine (creation of antibodies against the spike antigen) is extremely diminished.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Babies generally can't develop antibodies to diseases they encounter when they are first born, which is why maternal antibodies play such a big role in protecting them from disease at that stage. After a few months, babies can develop short-term antibody responses, but long-term memory cells still don't form. This is why many childhood vaccines are given multiple boosters during infancy - to keep antibody production going until long-term immunity kicks in.</p></div>		</li>
