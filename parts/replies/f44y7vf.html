			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically soap is hydrophobic on one end and hydrophillic on the other end. Oil is hydrophobic and will try not touching water, but will stick to other hydrophobic surfaces. Normally what happens when we clean with soap is the hydrophobic end sticks to the oil, and the hydrophillic end sticks to the water and is taken with it as it rinses over. With plastic, since it is inherently hydrophobic, it will more easily bond with the oil and not allow water to come between to two materials, so you need to slowly rinse layer after layer off the top.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily.  Oil can't get dissolved into water, but soap can be dissolved into both oil and water and it basically surround the oil and lets drops of the stuff float in water.  </p>
<p>Essentially the soaps sticks to the oil to and you have a fight going on.  later is mostly water with a tiny bit of soap, so you need a lot of soap to overwhelm the sticking effect to the plastic with the sticking effect to the soap.  The soaps isn't fighting another sticky thing with those other substances, so it's playing tug of war with no opponent.  With plastic, it's playing tug of war with the plastic an it needs lots of help to win.</p></div>		</li>
