			<div class="markdown"><p>Putting a duct around/behind the fan will also increase how much air it moves, because generally* the blades are more effective at sucking in a linear direction than omnidirectional.</p>
<p><em>Edit: I may have put too much focus on the linear aspect of the sucking fans. There is also a significant efficiency loss due to tip vortex effects, where the high pressure air in front of the fan blade gets sucked around to the low pressure area in the back. I know I mentioned this in the </em> below, but I needed an opportunity to talk about how the air gets sucked around some more.</p>
<p>*it does depend on the design, but almost all fans are more effective inside a duct, due to decreased losses at the fan tips</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have any literature to back up this statement? This is not what I have observed when designing electronic systems with DC fans. We usually design a plenum behind the fans rather than duct. </p>
<p>Inlet geometry does make a different though, and having a smooth transition (but not quite a duct) is important.</p></div>		</li>

<p>FANS NEVER SUCK.  PROPELLERS NEVER SUCK.  There's no such thing as suck!  A fan blows air and creates a relative low pressure area.  The relatively higher surrounding pressure pushes air into the low pressure zone to equalize the pressure.</p>
<p>People and cargo don't get sucked out into space or sucked out of the hole in the fuselage.  They are pushed out.</p></div>		</li>
