			<div class="markdown"><p>Cod liver oil was one of 3 major sources of fat up here, the others being seal oil (made from seal blubber) and butter (a luxury resource until the 1970’s). (Wild boar went extinct a long time ago, and they never lived up north anyway. Pigs have alway been something the rich farmers had).</p>
<p>We’ve been making seal oil and cod liver oil since the stone age. Used not only as food, but also for everything else one need oils for. Imagine the smell of cod liver oil lamps burning....</p>
<p>And yes, we used to eat enormous amounts of cod. Also othe fish ofc, but all fish fat is rich in vitamin D. </p>
<p>Also, for the times one would eat meat, you’d use the whole animal. Head meat (especially around the gums) is a source of vitamine D.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a reason Vikings had such impressive boats (which later turned into impressive navies.)</p>
<p>Our food came from the ocean, and there's your source of vitamin D.</p>
<p>So yes, we ate a lot of cod (marine life in general.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's standard to add vitamin D to milk in the US, not sure about other countries (or if you mean they add even more in Finland than we do here).  It's an important factor in calcium utilization in the body, so it makes sense to pair vitamin D with milk since that's an important calcium source.</p></div>		</li>
