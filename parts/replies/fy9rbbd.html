<p>Excellent post.</p>
</li>
<li>You mention:</li>

<blockquote>
<p>However they don't generate that much power compared to how much they weight, especially compared to solar panels. So if you can get away without using those it's often better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If anyone’s curious, inside of Jupiter’s orbit it’s more cost-efficient (weight, volume, etc. all have serious cost impacts) to use solar panels. Outside of Saturn’s orbit, it’s more cost-efficient to use RTGs. In between they’re about the same.</p>
<p>This is because light intensity, and therefore solar panel output per unit area, drops off with the square of distance to the source. If you’re 2x further from the sun, you need 4x the solar panel area (and therefore weight and...).</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's a blessing and a curse for space missions. Due to the extraordinary political and technical sensitivity of producing an RTG, there were delays in the production of the module used in New Horizons, requiring the mission parameters to be adjusted for the reduced Pu-238, and therefore power output, remaining.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's dependant on intensity, so long as the frequency is high enough (i.e. the photon has at least the bandgap energy).<br />
Below that frequency, there will be no photoelectric effect, no matter the intensity. But above it, more photons mean a higher current.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right about individual electrons, but remember the problem in deep space is intensity. The number of photons hitting the panel drops off in a 1/r^2 manner as you get further from the light source.</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CodeX57" target="_blank">CodeX57</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right in the fact that whether the photoelectric effect happens depend on the frequency of the light, but how many times it happens is dependant on how many photons reach the panel to knock electrons out. More photons &gt; more knocked out electrons &gt; higher current.</p>
<p>The number of photons per area decreases as you get further from the source, in other words, the flux of photons decreases by an inverse square law (Google stellar flux for a nicer graphical explanation, it's really just simple geometry), so the current decreases and the solar panel becomes less efficient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As you alluded to, another issue is not the technology but the public perception of safety. The Kosmos incident and other nuclear power plant incidents makes people fear having nuclear reactors flying over head. (Admittedly there is a lot more that can go wrong when not every standard satellite even makes it to the correct orbit.)
It’s hard to develop technology and fly prototypes when the public is afraid of the risk and politicians are afraid of the optics. This leads to lack of funding and development. As you said, the US put a reactor in space in the 1960s, we should have much more developed by now, but priorities change and things like the moon program go away, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah and nowadays there are also a great more deal of regulations for ground testing that makes development complicated. On that front the kilopower project was a great achievement. They managed to be on schedule and on budget which people did not necessarily think was possible. This is great news for hopefully more powerful and useful developments in the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am very much pro nuclear energy. Putting significant quantities of radioactive material on top of bombs blasting off into the atmosphere scares me, though. Rocket launches fail way too often to take that risk. Let's just leave our reactors on the ground until space launches are reliable</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you look at the history of nuclear power plants--indeed, this is true of <em>any</em> big, revolutionary piece of engineering--the reason they are so safe now is because much of what we've learned is written in blood. </p>
<p>Learning how to take a nuclear power plant and put it into space will involve accidents. It just will. And accidents in or near space or Earth's orbit have potentially <em>very</em> high costs.</p>
<p>I think we'll probably get there someday, but this is not tech that justifies the risk right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really the main issue, and why we don't launch nuclear waste etc into the sun. The risk is <em>much</em> higher than what we've willing to tolerate. There's a long list of things that can go wrong when trying to reach orbit, and most of the scenarios are catastrophic to the craft. Unlike a nuclear accident on the ground, a failure here immediately disperses radioactive material (potentially a lot of it) into the atmosphere where it can spread over a large area. What made Chernobyl so bad was that the fire was open and created smoke that could be carried in the atmosphere. An accident of this nature would give those processes an exponential head start. There's also the potential problem of having to recover the larger chunks of radioactive material that would be scattered over a very large area.</p></div>		</li>
