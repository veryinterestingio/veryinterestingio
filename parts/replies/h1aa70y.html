			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually believe I remember reading something along the lines that the Moderna could have been a lot less of a dose and maintained the same efficacy rating etc but just because they did all the trials/studies with the 100 micrograms doses they had to stick to it for it to be approved by the government for production. As to why they felt like it needed to be 100 microgram dose initially I don't know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're mostly correct. Both companies speculated a bit on dose, timing, preservation conditions, etc. All of that has to go in their proposal that's approved by the FDA for the trials. Once it's accepted, it's harder if not impossible to change, and would require a new study or gleaning from mishaps in the field (over or under dosing, as we've seen; changes in scheduling, as we've seen; mishaps in storage conditions, as we've seen).</p>
<p>Much of it is an educated guess, and you learn as you go. May turn out we're better off vaccinating 10wks after the first booster, hard to say because we've never had a trial of this magnitude before, but that's how science goes - try, fail, try again, succeed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Were we talking about the yearly flu vaccine there would likely have been much more time to fine tune the vaccines. Covid 19 caused a race to the finish line, and right now &quot;working&quot; is much more valuable than &quot;perfect&quot;. Any follow up boosters (if they exist at all) may well be more refined.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're probably right about the 2nd dose timing. I think it was the Shingrix vaccine that had a 4 week booster but they totally underestimated how many doses they needed. Long story short, turns out as long as you got the booster within a year you were fine. I imagine these companies were trying to push the vaccine out and research showed 4 weeks was good so they went with it. As time went on and more research and longer trials could be conducted they learned these things aren't always as time sensitive as initially thought</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify, no one “created” mRNA. mRNA is the intermediary between DNA and proteins in our body, it’s a message (hence why it’s called mRNA because the m stands for messenger RNA). Essentially, the mRNA we are injected with for the COVID vaccines is essentially just the code for our body to produce the spike proteins on Coronavirus. Once our body produces these spike proteins, we can undergo an immune response to create antibodies against Coronavirus. We just needed to figure out the RNA code of these proteins to use in the vaccine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, they do create the unique modifications that make the virus mrna sequence more stable/immunogenic/who knows. It is proprietary but suffice to say you cant just inject mrna into someone and get a response</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't really know either, so I'll join you in speculation. If I understand correctly, the two vaccines use a different mRNA, which means a different molecular weight. It's possible that you could get a similar number of mRNA molecules, even though the masses are very different. I tried to google how many base pairs are in either vaccine, but wasn't successful.</p></div>		</li>
