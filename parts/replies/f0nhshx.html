			<div class="markdown"><p>This is kind of irrelevant, but I remember having a conversation with a group of friends once, and somebody took the piss out of somebody else (who wasn't there) for not being able to ride a bike. I pointed out that she couldn't swim and the consensus was that not knowing how to ride a bike is much &quot;worse&quot; (for want of a better word) than not knowing how to swim. I still don't really get that though - to swim all you need to do is float (which happens naturally), and flail your arms and legs around a bit. To ride a bike you need to balance - both are hardly difficult, but I would say swimming comes much more naturally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say kind of the opposite when I was growing up.  Bikes were everywhere.  Water?  If I fall in water, I will freeze to death. The end.  Don't learn to swim, learn to stay out of the water.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For <em>most</em> people, this happens naturally, but I was a sinker. I could fill my lungs with air, relax my body, and go <em>straight to the bottom</em>. I learned this when I tried to do the &quot;dead man float&quot; while qualifying for swimming privileges at camp, and while everyone else just kind of floated at the top, I went all the way to the bottom and had to swim back up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have known a few adults who never learned to ride a bike. It’s certainly less natural / instinctual than swimming, since bikes have only been around for a little while. I’ll admit, mountain biking is my hobby, so I am “good” at it, but I am actually a pretty weak swimmer.</p></div>		</li>
