			<div class="markdown"><p>It's funny because at the beginning when torrenting started to become popular, i clearly remember pausing and unpausing torrents at the end when stuck on 99%+. People always told me: why are you pausing, it'll only make it slower! But in reality, it was a gambling to hope to get the piece from someone faster!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most rare pieces of a torrent are uploaded first from the seed (to make them less rare), but they are sent to the peers with the highest upload speeds (again to increase propagation speed).</p>
<p>The faster you upload the faster you will download, as you will be more likely to receive rare pieces.  If you don't upload you're called a &quot;choke&quot; and put in a penalty hold.</p>
<p>However, there is forgiveness so eventually even non-uploaders will receive the complete file.  It will just be slower if the swarm is small.</p></div>		</li>
