			<div class="markdown"><p>A side point to this comment - this is knows as hydrostatic equilibrium and the larger and more dense a planetary object is the close it is to a perfect sphere providing it is not rotating. If the object is rotating quickly in which case it bulges at the equator due to centripetal forces and becomes an oblate spheroid much like Jupiter which spins rapidly. In nature I would comfortably say that all stelar objects from the smallest asteroids right up to largest black holes rotate.</p>
<p>Black holes also experience a bulging of their event horizon but this is for another times to explain .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The shape of the event horizon cannot be directly measured although it can be inferred by the speed at which accreting matter is orbiting the back hole, which also gives us rotational speed caused by <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame-dragging" target="_blank">frame dragging</a>. This is essentially space-time conserving angular momentum (rotation).</p>
<p>The mass of black holes can be estimated by tracking orbital speeds of stars although there are other ways.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are <a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/objects/heapow/archive/compact_objects/spinning_bh_chandra.html" target="_blank">non-rotating black holes</a>, though they are a lot less common than rotating ones.</p>
<p>Edit: sorry, didn’t realise these were just a theoretical thing only.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some diffuse galaxies and large elliptical galaxies are spherical(ish) these galaxies are often low in dark matter and low in density. Diffuse galaxies are loosely bound and are often falling apart slowly. Larger elliptical galaxies are often formed by large spiral or lenticular galaxies colliding with one an other. Some theories suggest their shape changes as in these collisions the super-massive black holes at the centre of the galaxies are ejected at great velocity. Some have theorised these black holes influence or at some point have influenced the shape of their galaxies. In the absence of these black holes and following the maelstrom of stellar activity following galactic collisions some believe this is why elliptical galaxies form spherically rather than into the spiral disks we observe.</p>
<p>Edit: Also dark matter has a distinct impact on the shape of galaxies, however we are unable and o directly observe dark matter so it is difficult to understand to what extent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference between sphere-like things and disk-like things is that in the formation of sphere-like things, the material forming it can efficiently get rid of both mechanical energy and angular momentum, allowing it to collapse into a compact object. In disk-like things, energy can also be  gotten rid of, but not so much angular momentum. This causes the ratio of angular momentum over energy to rise, and thus causes the object to take on a spread-out, disk-like structure.</p></div>		</li>
