			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe, but there wouldn't be an answer without defining the envelope of that environment.</p>
<p>That's kind of the point, too.  Life has diversified into different environments, so even if you started with some kind of minimalist approach, it would evolve to specialize in different conditions and, inevitably, some would specialize as &quot;generalists&quot; too (if that makes any sense) that could perform decently in a wider range or in environments that were prone to vary a lot over time or spatially.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This tickles my ecologist side only too much now... The answer should be yes, there must be a minimum size for a genome to make survival in a varying environment possible - but that soon requires us to define what sort of environment and what sort/range of variability we want to consider.  </p>
<p>With bacteria, going by an evo-eco perspective, a viable minimum could be something that enables survival in a very restricted range of environmental conditions, only found often enough and for long enough to reproduce successfully, and an ability to create spores for surviving adverse conditions.  </p>
<p>That's already a wide definition of viability, and one for the wild, though...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice :) my background is also ecology, so that's where my thinking comes from too. </p>
<p>Yeah, I think this also brings up questions of minimum genome size for long-term survival (e.g. building in redundancy and resilience), as opposed to just the ability to persist short-term under varying conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends what you consider a varying environment. Most bacteria have very different environments that they survive in but they all have environments where they wonâ€™t.</p></div>		</li>
