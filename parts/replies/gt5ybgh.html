<p>... Unless I missed something about breast injections...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When they remove the breast tissue due to or to prevent cancer, they almost always remove the local lymph nodes, and that's going to alter both the person's immune response as well as possible cause a circulatory issue.  If their circulation is disrupted or obstructed, they could actually end up losing blood flow to their entire arm, and need an amputation. You're not going to give an immunization and encourage increased blood flow in an area of the body where someone is predisposed to circulation problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Breast tissue actually often extends back towards the armpit a bit but more importantly, there's a direct highway link between the breasts and the armpit lymph nodes. So often (always?) they take those too to reduce the chance of metastases. Don't want that cancer jumping onto your body's superhighway.</p>
<p>So now you're missing the lymph nodes that usually process the shot. It's probably better (although I don't know why) to shoot it in where it's closer to a lymph node.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct that they don't always take out the sentinel lymph node, but they often do. Not everyone who gets a partial mastectomy has lymph precautions in that arm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay I read most of it but the bit when you said something about people giving the shot on a count of three but injecting before three really sent a shockwave up my whole body in horror. But I cede points for the ingenuity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's to surprise you before you flinch.  Because if you flinch, those muscles tense up and the shot will hurt more.  </p>
<p>I take it you're one of those people who is &quot;not a fan of needles.&quot;  Well, I'm here to tell you NO ONE LIKES NEEDLES.  I often say to patient &quot;you ever notice that there's no fans only page for needles?  No fan club page, no needles have an insta started by their devoted followers.&quot;  If you LIKE needles, you're the odd man out.  If they make you pass out, well, you'd be like the very first guy I ever drew blood on.  He was a Marine and he was tough! He was a huge devil dog.  But that devil dog passed out like Scarlett O'hara when he looked at the needle I was sticking in him.  </p>
<p>Needle size doesn't affect how much pain a needle causes you as much as the speed with which whoever sticks you.  I mean, within reason.  But if someone is unsure of themselves and is coming at you with a needle and they're moving at a snail's pace, ask for someone else to do it.  Really.  We don't get butt hurt about that.  Some of us are sharp shooters and some of us aren't.  Confidence is key.  The confidence of the person putting the needle in you and your confidence in them.  </p>
<p>Pain is relative.  Pain means you're alive to feel it.  Trust me, a kid comes in after a car accident and doesnt even flinch when we put two huge 14 gauge IVs in them, that's not a good sign.  It's very disappointing.  Even if you're unresponsive, you still pull back from pain reflexively.  Feel lucky you can feel the pain at all and aren't being brought to us without that reflex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went in for a short procedure and the nurse had trouble getting a good stick for the catheter. After her third failed attempt, she bailed out and had someone else come do it to avoid putting me through unnecessary discomfort. That nurse got it the first time. I was thankful to both for different reasons.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Storytime: When I was younger, I tried to join the Army, and when I was up at the MEPS for my physical, they come to draw blood for whatever test. I sit down in the chair and start to go limp before they even got the tourniquet on my arm. So the civilian nurse angrily sent me to sit in the corner and promptly forgot about me. Everyone else is done, and a Navy corpsman who was working there sees me and was like &quot;what's his story?&quot; and they realize that I had been forgotten. So he comes over and asks me what happened and then has me follow him to an exam room where I can lay down. He has me look in the opposite direction and keeps talking to me while he quickly gets the blood drawn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the reason why I specifically tell nurses and techs not to warn me. No countdown, no &quot;you ready?&quot;, just stick the needle in when it's ready. I'm concentrating on relaxing and a countdown would just make me tense at best, literally move away from them at worst. The sound of them preparing stuff is bad enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But I don't want you to be ready.  The countdown is not to stick you when you're ready.  If you know it's coming, you tense up and it is more painful.  The 1, 2, 3 ready, go, is to distract you.  For the least pain, I need to stick you right before or after you say go.  Just keep holding still.  And breathe.  Breathe.  That's the key.  Breathe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the expectation that's the worst part. I always used to just do it without warning and most people said it didn't hurt much. </p>
<p>It's really just the fluid displacing muscle tissue that hurts and the immune system response to the antigens that cause that sick feeling the day of/after a vaccine.</p></div>		</li>
