			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, let us not forget, that there are thousands of different kinds of forest communities. It's not as simple as &quot;the oldest, healthiest, and most stable forests have the most undergrowth. Some untouched forests have no undergrowth. </p>
<p>And when talking about forests with trees further spread apart with a ground layer that is densely covered in grasses and forbs, that's actually a woodland. </p>
<p>A forest has a more closed canopy with a ground layer that is more tolerant to shade. </p>
<p>Often times the forests where trees have become too thick thus choking out the underlayer are actually your woodlands, because the grasses and forbs that grow in woodlands need a fair bit of sunlight.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: grass being the primary victim.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess I should say grasses and low-lying veg that’s it’s able to cover. Any non-native that mimics the ability of a bush or fern to shake off the needles and who’s roots run a little deeper, would probably be fine. It’s not super toxic.</p></div>		</li>
