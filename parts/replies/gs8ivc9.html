			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I can't do that either, just spitting out what's in my mouth doesn't feel right if I don't rinse it with water, even if that's what I'm supposed to do. It's like lathering up my hands with soap and then just flicking it off instead of rinsing with water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be nice if Dentists actually explained this.  I grew up being told to mouthwash, brush with toothpaste, brush with a clean brush, rinse mouth with clean water.  Not rinsing makes sense now that I’ve read the explanation from dental hygienists here now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I didn't know that. Honestly that sounds kind of gross. </p>
<p>Although.. I used to have this friend who always brushed <em>before</em> his coffee.. and he would say &quot;I'm letting my toothpaste sit&quot; when I'd offer him coffee. I always thought he meant he didn't want to mix the flavors... But maybe he was actually letting the toothpaste sit after brushing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue is the fluoride content in all non-prescription mouthwash is lower than the fluoride in toothpaste.... and the fluoride is what you really want most of the time.    So you're really just lowering the concentration of fluoride on your teeth, assuming you use it after brushing.  If you are using it after (acidic) meals, I <em>imagine</em> that is a good use and possibly better than brushing due to the potential for eroding enamel.  Not a dentist, just somebody who tries to take oral health seriously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly my understanding as well.</p>
<p>I only keep mouthwash around for if I've been eating something super acidic. Otherwise, it's better to leave the toothpaste on your teeth since it's got a much higher fluoride % than mouthwash does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Communities which introduced fluoridation to the water supply found significantly improved dental outcomes afterward. Fluoride in tap water is far from useless!</p>
<p>That said, you want a fluoride treatment to remain undisturbed for at least 30 minutes to be effective, and applying a lower-concentration treatment right after a higher one reduces the effectiveness to essentially that of the less concentrated treatment.</p>
<p>A hygienist-applied fluoride treatment is far more concentrated than anything else. Toothpaste is more concentrated than a F-providing rinse, which is more concentrated than fluoridated water.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<ol>
<li>Floss, and/or use a water pik <em>before</em> brushing.</li>
<li>Don’t rinse after brushing, with anything</li>
<li>Drink fluoridated water throughout the day as a baseline treatment, excepting a half hour after tooth brushing or rinsing</li>
<li>Do none of those things (for the time period your hygienist states) after getting a professionally-applied paste or “painted” treatment</li>
</ol></div>		</li>
