			<div class="markdown"><p>To put this more like eli5; there's dirt, and there's soil, and then there's top soil. Mushrooms and bugs eat dead plants, trees, and leaves, and that top layer on the soil is called topsoil. In a tropical or subtropical forest, the topsoil is only about 1&quot; deep at most - in an area with a lot of growth it can be as shallow as 1/8^th of an inch. (edit: i should have said &quot;topsoil builds up at a rate of 1/8^th inch per <strong>year</strong>&quot; - it can take a century to get a foot of topsoil built up, and flooding tends to wash it ...) It gets washed away during heavy rains; and also rapidly used by plants like ferns, vines, and saplings before it has a chance to build up. Soil underneath the topsoil has certain qualities that support root systems physically, as well as providing a place for insects to go, but there's less nutrients for the plants to use. Soil is where the water is &quot;stored&quot; and managed by the plants. Topsoil has all of the Nitrogen and other elements and compounds required by plants.</p>
<p>And just in case some people didn't know this: plants don't really gain mass/weight from stuff in the soil (except water) - most of the weight of a plant or a tree is actually carbon dioxide captured from the air</p></div>		</li>

<p>Close, the majority of the mass is carbon.  CO2 is captured from the atmosphere and the carbon is stripped to be used in various compounds to support the plant’s life.  Oxygen is then released back into the atmosphere as a waste gas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a small correction, but the oxygen released is not from CO2, but from the breakdown of water. The oxygen in CO2 goes to make both water and sugar. Most of the weight in sugar is from CO2 so the original statement would be correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well, if there's spare nutrients, something would use it. The canopy is so dense that when a tree does fall over, an entire bootstrap ecosystem starts because of the hole in the canopy. All the bugs and critters move to the log/stump, seedlings start from being dormant because of no sunlight, vines actually subside a bit because they're having to compete with stuff like shrubs and grasslike plants.</p>
<p>It's a cycle, a circle, and really kind of cool. For the record i live in a <em>sub</em>tropical rainforest, and just read the research and scientific papers of nearby universities to learn about it. I don't have any credentials, other than i was really into aquaria (hence knowing lots about nitrifying bacteria) and i am now really into growing plants and trees in an existing forest stand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, since we’re talking tropical rain forest, usually none. They grow through several seasons, once the nutritional value of the soul is depleted they move on to new ground. It’s called “slash and burn agriculture”</p>
<p>Edit: you know what, never mind. I’ll leave it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, lots of fertilizer. To some extent, plowing the 'waste' parts of the plant back in after the grain or fruit is separated.</p>
<p>Even with that, topsoil is depleted every year on most farms. Midwest farms that used to be prairie have multiple feet of topsoil so can tolerate losing part of an inch every year for many years. To actually rebuild soil, farmers would need to have 'rest' years with a cover crop where they plowed the entire plant back into the soil before the next planting.</p></div>		</li>
