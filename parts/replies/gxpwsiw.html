			<div class="markdown"><p>Photons can be created and destroyed all you like as long as energy is conserved. Virtual particles are even easier to 'create' as you don't even need to care about a lot of physical laws. Virtual particles aren't 'real', they are really mathematical objects which help explain quantum field theories.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Indeed. That was kind of the point. If the magnet produces photons or exchanges them with the object it's pulling, how is the energy conserved? Does the attracted object return a photon to every photon received from the magnet or am I mixing my physics here?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Magnets (and gravity) aren't seen as having &quot;carrier particles&quot;, not currently, anyhow.  The idea of seeing the force as the impact of particles has problems- 1) The force can be attraction, not repulsion, so it's not like an impact, 2) what happens to the vast majority of virtual particles that are broadcast out and don't &quot;hit&quot; anything, 3) how is it that having a third object inline past the two bodies attracting/repelling each other isn't shielded from the effect of the far object that it has no line-of-sight to?</p>
<p>We're nowhere near settled on what sort of metaphorical description should be used.  Particles doesn't really fit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Virtual particles have been considered an acceptable way of explaining electro-magnetism for decades. The most accurate model of electromagnetism we have was build by assuming mathematically virtual particles are how it works. All of the points you raise suggest you're thinking of virtual particle as classical objects which they emphatically are not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People are explaining this in terms of magnets requiring energy to be pulled apart, but I think the more confusing scenario is, say, an object floating above a magnet, like popular desk ornaments. Surely some energy is required to hold the object in place, against gravity? Can the field provide limitless energy in this example and how?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Applying a force doesn't necessarily require a transfer of energy. Energy is only transferred when the force causes movement. There's no more energy being transferred when a magnet holds up an object than there is when a table holds up an object.</p>
<p>That's non-intuitive because our muscles don't work like that, they do need an energy input to hold something up, so I think that trains our mind to expect the same in other situations. Not too sure on why our muscles work that way, you'd have to ask a biologist.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Specifically, only when the force causes movement that has some component parallel to the force. For example, the centripetal force that keeps a ball being swung on a string on its circular path also does no work, because here the force, despite causing the ball's velocity to change, is always at a right angle to the ball's velocity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Biologist here! The actin-myosin bond in your muscles is weak (compared to the bonds in the wood of a table) and easily reversible. Hence, you need to constantly use ATP to refresh it and keep them contracted. As well as the energy used in the nerve impulses to send the signal to contract.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you place a book on a table, is any energy required by the table to hold up the book against gravity?</p>
<p>Energy is expended in order to do work - which is force times distance, the magnet and table do indeed act with a force, but since the nothing is moving, no work is being done and so theres no energy required.</p>
<p>This misconception may come about as a result of our own experience with holding objects against gravity or other forces - clearly we require energy to do so.</p>
<p>I'm no expert in biomechanics but as far as I know the key difference here lies in how the body works - in order to keep muscles contracted and tense the brain constantly sends electrical signals which correspond to a use in energy, furthermore the muscles themselves oscillate and so you have work being done.</p></div>		</li>
