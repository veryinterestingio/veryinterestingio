			<div class="markdown"><p>You also still use the Öhler system on your clarinets if I recall correctly. That happens to be a descendent of the Müller clarinet from the early 1800's which is significant because he is the one who invented the first air tight pads for woodwinds. This is super important because older pads would leak air all the time and were super temperamental. The stuffed pat combined with the low profile cup key make the clarinet mostly leak proof. A few decades later the flute maker Theobald Boehm invented a new key system for his instruments which streamlined and simplified the keywork. From there  Hyacinthe Klosé and Auguste Buffet jeune, two french instrument makers and performers, worked together to adapt the Boehm system to the clarinet which became the most popular key system on earth. Buffet clarinets are some of the best clarinets in the world and some of the older ones are highly sought after for professional performers (golden era clarinets).</p>
<p>Interesting side note: Anton Stadler, Mozart's principal clarinetist in his orchestra, lost the origional of the Clarinet Concerto Mozart wrote for him. All copies that exist are technically just our best guesses of how he intended it to sound. Stadler's clarinet, however, was special. It was not only keyed in &quot;A&quot; (like orchestral clarinets are), but it was specially made for him with an extension to a &quot;C&quot; below the standard low &quot;E&quot;. This means he had the same written range as a bassoon, just an octave higher. So, some clarinets use Bassett Horns with C-extensions to play some of the excerpts to their full range. In my opinion the Urtext Edition by Verlag is probably the most accurate version and comes with a nice, modest, paper on the piece written in english, deutsch, and french.</p>
<p>Sorry for being a nerd, I studied the history of the clarinet a lot in university and I rarely get to use that info.</p></div>		</li>
