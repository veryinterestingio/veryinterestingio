<p>One time the city was re-paving my street and my car was blocked in as they were paving outside my driveway. I needed to go to work so the paver dude just told me to drive right over the freshly paved asphalt. I did and it made a slight tire track on the asphalt, which they rolled over with their roller equipment and it was gone. Imagine if that was concrete or anything else, probably impossible to drive thru.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Impossible with concrete. The main street off of ours was completely redone - power lines, water mains, sidewalks, pavement. There is a concrete spot for a couple vehicles to hang for the crossing guards to use (by a school). Concrete was poured in the morning, they forgot to rope it off, and someone drove on it 8 hours later. They had to remove and redo a huge portion. Took an extra 5 days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The plasticity is a very big deal in places like Minnesota with a very severe freeze-thaw cycle. Temps can vary up to 80 degrees within a single week, and it would destroy something like concrete.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As long as the expansion and contraction are consistent. Pay attention to asphalt roads where it goes under an overpass. Where the shaded parts meet the unshaded parts it will deteriorate quicker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I must add that this isn't always the case (talking about plasticity). Where I live (SH) summers can be REALLY hot, Australians can confirm. Added to the weight of cars and trucks constantly pressing on it, roads often get deformed and squished outwards, affecting drive-ability and water run off. This can be repaired of course, but at a big cost and sometimes as often as every 3 years.</p></div>		</li>
