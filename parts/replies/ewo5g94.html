			<div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting, as someone who didn't grow up with smartphones, but instead tv, that's what watching a tv show or movie does for me. If I browse reddit or engage in social media in bed, I could be up for hours past bed time, but if I turn a TV show or movie on, I can barely make it past the opening credits. Maybe it's because I grew up falling asleep to television. If my theory is correct, you're significantly younger than me. 26 years old, tops.</p></div>		</li>
