			<div class="markdown"><p>I read somewhere years ago that ticks can survive six years without a blood meal. Also, they can detect the carbon dioxide of a respirating mammal from a mile away, lying in wait for something to brush past it. They seriously stoke in me an irrational fear, I hate the thought of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I go out in the woods a few times a week. One day last month I was sitting at my desk, and ran my hands through my hair. I felt a little bump on the back of my head and immediately knew what it was. I asked a coworker to take a look and confirm.</p>
<p>Nobody had anything to remove it with, so I sat/worked at my desk the rest of the day, knowing it was attached to me. </p>
<p>0/10 would not recommend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure it always helps, but I've found tracing a spiral on the exposed part of the tick a few times makes them either dizzy or mad, but they release the bite are you can throw em away</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m convinced they fall from trees. </p>
<p>Once, while visiting my in-laws in Pennsylvania, I wakes from the house via a concrete path lined with trees in the suburbs. While in the car, I see a spider-like bug on thigh by my knee and thought it was a spider so I flicked it. It hit the car floor but didn’t scurry, and by the way it’s legs were tucked in I knew it was a tick. I kind of freaked out. I might have cried. </p>
<p>My in-laws thought I overreacted and I still can’t walk beneath a tree while visiting without the fear of a tick falling on me. I’ve never had one bite me, but im really afraid of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They freak me out, as well. Recently went on a camping trip up in NH with a buddy, and we kept making these mile-long trips out to a marshy lake near the campsite. In the quarter-mile of brushy boardwalk near the lake, we consistently got 5-8 ticks on each of us, 10-15 round trip. Across three trips out there (gluttons for punishment), we probably found 30-40 ticks each. Never got bit (that I know of), but my buddy did, and he managed to drag three of them back into the tent (found them crawling on his sleeping bag in the morning). Very much dislike the disease carrying little bloodsuckers.</p></div>		</li>
