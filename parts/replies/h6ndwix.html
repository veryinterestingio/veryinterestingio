<p>STIR/SHAKEN is a framework of interconnected standards. STIR/SHAKEN are acronyms for the Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR) and Signature-based Handling of Asserted Information Using toKENs (SHAKEN)</p>
<p>Imagine if they used the T in tokens instead of &quot;ken&quot; lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>part of the problem for that is for places that actually operate legitimate call centers and what not... </p>
<p>you call in to a service desk/help line/what have you... agent says &quot;just incase we get disconnected, what is a good number to reach you on?&quot;<br />
the call gets dropped, and Joe calls you back (HA!). you don't want the customers to see that Joe is calling you from his DID(direct inward dial) at 317.362.xxxx number... the company wants you to see that masked as &quot;1.800.382.5631&quot; when he calls you back. it's their &quot;presence&quot; that counts.</p>
<p>in all honesty, i picked up a google voice number when they first came out in '09. i used to forward that to my cell. used it for all my outbound dials, and about three years ago, i swapped over to google fi as a cell provider and can count on one hand how many robo-calls i've received. and i'm missing three fingers...</p>
<p>i don't know if it has to do with the fact that my area code is five states away from where i live or if it's google doing their spam thing but no complaints from me...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a legit use for the spoofing BTW, companies that was all outbound numbers to appear as the main company line for example.</p>
<p>The solution to allow this is registering these numbers as allowed to be spoofed but the phone companies don't give a shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The real solution is for the phone call to send two different phone numbers/identifiers:</p>
<p>- This is who I actually am</p>
<p>- This is what I want to be identified as.</p>
<p>The &quot;true&quot; number can be used to verify that the caller is legitimate via a two-way handshake, while allowing the &quot;fake&quot; number to be presented to the user for legitimate purposes.  Anyone who abuses the system has a verifiable &quot;true number&quot; that can be used to track them down and/or ban them from the system.  This would be trivial to implement if phone companies actually cared.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well kinda. This technique to use the company number is built into call services as a feature today. They still get validated and changes to that number generally rack up fees. This is <em>supposed</em> to be validated and policed by the provider...</p>
<p>However, there are very shady providers. So how do we deal with shady providers? We make them authenticate. With new authentication methods, we are building a &quot;trust&quot; network. Once the major carriers get everyone up and validated...we just stop accepting non-validated calls.</p>
<p>Without any glaring holes, this should make spam calls very much more expensive. So we should see a lot of relief.</p></div>		</li>
