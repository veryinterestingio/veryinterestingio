<p>But, even if it's super well mixed, the original colors of the blue and yellow pigments wouldn't change, right? So at high enough magnification it should still be possible to see the blue and yellow?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends if it’s dye or pigment. Pigment is basically ground rock, so you can see tiny particles of the pigment in a binder <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Cross-section-optical-microscope-examination-A-Visible-light-of-the-T5-sample-from_fig2_261158611/amp" target="_blank">like this</a> if you zoom in. The tiny points of colour mixing in the eye are the same principle as neo-impressionism, when a painter would use tiny points of colour on a painting. <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/gray-weather-grande-jatte-georges-seurat/hwFSKKR0kae9mA?ms=%7B%22x%22%3A0.5144644090494486%2C%22y%22%3A0.5039988315886444%2C%22z%22%3A9.59324741699789%2C%22size%22%3A%7B%22width%22%3A0.26101999092256645%2C%22height%22%3A0.5324803871303677%7D%7D" target="_blank">zoom in on this!</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A pigment is typically a finally ground powder. This is suspended in the liquid, and can easily sink over time. </p>
<p>A dye is a colored liquid. A dye can be a powder, but this powder will dissolve in water. </p>
<p>As a dye is dissolved, it should be mixed well enough that a microscope that can see color won't detect the difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, it's &quot;mixed well&quot; if you can't see individual speckles of blue or yellow on the scale you're looking at. So you'd have to mix much more thoroughly (or, like, use blue and yellow dyes that melt into each other and absorb each other, becoming 'green dye') to have it look homogeneous under the microscope than with the naked eye.</p>
<p>(And if it's not dyes, but tiny plastic blue and yellow particles, there's gonna be a magnification after which it doesn't look well-mixed at all, it just looks like blue and yelow baseballs in a pile.)</p>
<p>--Dave, tl;dr: it depends partly on how the paint is composed and maybe on how close you look</p></div>		</li>
