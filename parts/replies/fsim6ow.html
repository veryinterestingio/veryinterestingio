			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a type 4 allergic response, but the defining factor of this response isn't &quot;direct&quot; immune activation. In fact, its more indirect, and that is why the rash takes a day or so to develop. </p>
<p>Ivy oil (urushiol) is absorbed in to the skin and oxidized to form a ‚Äúhapten.‚Äù The hapten alone doesn‚Äôt illicit an immune response, but when the oxidized oil attaches to larger molecules in your body, it forms adducts that can be recognized by T-cells. </p>
<p>Wiki:
&quot;A well-known example of a hapten is urushiol, which is the toxin found in poison ivy. When absorbed through the skin from a poison ivy plant, urushiol undergoes oxidation in the skin cells to generate the actual hapten, a reactive quinone-type molecule, which then reacts with skin proteins to form hapten adducts.&quot;</p>
<p>A more direct response is a type 1 immune response - where, after the first response, you make IgE abtibodies that bind to histamine releasing mast cells. The antibodies serve as triggers, and when pollen is re-encountered, the mast cells explode with their histamine payload, making us sneeze, have runny nose, itchy eyes etc. This tends to be more direct because of this trigger mechanism, whereas reactions to poison ivy involve the oil sitting on your skin and then being absorbed slightly (few hours), then becoming oxidized (maybe a few more hours), then your cell mediated immune system recognizing and attacking the cells that absorbed the oils.</p>
<p>TLDR: allergic responses to ivy oils involves a delayed T cell response, which is completely different from allergic responses to pollen or stinging nettles that involves quick release of histamine.</p>
<p>Edit: Haptens are also interesting because they are sometimes used in vaccine design/immunology research, to encourage immune responses to a specific protein or molecule!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, but I just have to be pedantic for a second and note that poison ivy is a &quot;type 4 hypersensitivity reaction,&quot; not type 4 immune response or allergic reaction. &quot;Immune response&quot; is broader than hypersensitivity, and allergies are more specifically type I hypersensitivity. Poison ivy often gets called an allergy, but it's technically not one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For some reason (sorry I don't know the specific details), these people do not mount a T-cell response when they are initially exposed. It could be that your skin and the immune cells that reside there dont trigger the inflammation that calls in the T cells. However, these people who are not allergic always maintain the potential to become allergic. After the first time the oils cause enough of an immune response (or enough inflammation) to recruit T cells, then after that they will have memory T cells that can become reactivated upon future exposure, causing a rash. </p>
<p>On a side note that is interesting - Some people mount a natural T cell response to tumors and fight off their cancers on their own. Many other people aren't so lucky. So this process has been manipulated with drugs (usually monoclonal antibodies) that encourage the anti-tumor T cell response to occur. This has been very successful in treating some melanoma patients, and other cancers as well!</p>
<p>Edit:
Seems like some people worked out the receptor that binds urushiol products, CD1a. Could be genetic differences in this receptor, or the corresponding one in T cells that governs the ability/inability to get a rash. (Hypothetically)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Urushiol-producing plants are just as problematic dead as alive -- a live fresh plant is worst, because it's still manufacturing the urushiol, but it's common to get poison oak from dead/dormant twigs/dry leaves.  And burning it inadvertently on a brush pile can cause inhalation of urushiol in smoke.  Which is... bad.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's probably a defensive adaptation that has a survival benefit to the plant, so not really a coincidence from the plant's perspective. More of an exploit than a defect. The harder it is to mess with the plant, the better the plant can survive and reproduce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the whole family of Anacardiacaea has these irritant resins. In biology and especially in something like a resin you can adapt to both be water repellent and deter animals.  Humans might be one of the few very sensitive to poison I've but as I've understood most plants of this family have some resins that are detterents to many animals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In general, especially before humanity decided that <em>all land on the planet</em> belonged to it, having an irritant would be a very effective deterrent to getting trampled. This is because most animals, humans included, will simply avoid the area where the plant is growing. Why go to the trouble of tearing it up when you can simply avoid it? It's much easier, less energy and time intensive.</p>
<p>Whether it be spikes and spines, stinging hairs, or irritant oils,many plants have evolved features that deter larger animals, so that they can grow in peace without getting trampled or eaten.</p>
<p>Of course, I agree that the oils aid in water retention. That doesn't preclude it from <em>also</em> being a defensive adaptation. Biology is marvellous, and evolution has produced many such multifunctional compounds, systems and structures. The truth of a living organism and the way it interacts with its local systems can never be reduced to &quot;x does y, and only y&quot;. Life is much, much more complex than that.</p>
<p>Again, I'm not saying it definitely <strong>is</strong> a defensive adaptation, since I don't know enough about this plant. But to deny the possibility, when plausible supporting hypotheses are still available, is unscientific.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. There are animals that have no reaction at all to certain poisons that affect humans, and vice versa. That's generally because, in that environment, that poison evolved to affect those targets. We don't &quot;need&quot; a reaction to certain snake venoms, we could have a body that just ignores it completely. But the snakes don't like that, so they evolve until they mess us up, which keeps them safer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And it‚Äôs a constant game of catch up, because even in the example with poison ivy and humans, there are humans who are less sensitive and even completely immune to poison ivy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, not exactly this. You still need evidence to make a claim in science. That MAYBE happened, except that many herbivores eat poison ivy all the time, and humans are one of, if not the only, species allergic to it. Humans were probably never huge consumers of leafs, and the small quantity of berries humans ate was almost definitely not a big driver of a widespread plant. </p>
<p>Just because it &quot;makes sense&quot; from an evolutionary perspective doesn't mean that's what happened. From what I can find most animals that eat leaves are not at all allergic to poison ivy. It does appear to be just a coincidence in this case, which happens in evolution all the time.</p></div>		</li>
