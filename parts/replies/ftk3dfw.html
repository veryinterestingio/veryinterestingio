			<div class="markdown"><p>It helps to pairbond with a daywalker. The night owl can be productive and awake all night and then have an hour or so to spend with their daywalker. Then they go to sleep and the daywalker can handle the errands and whatnot</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is my life. I luckily discovered early on that I was a nightowl and so I took adavantage and always volunteered to work overnight shifts and now I work 5 days a week 10p to 6am. Its perfect. My day is a reversal of the normal day. Your 6am is my 6pm and vice versa.  </p>
<p>My daywalker wakes me when she gets home from work @ 530p.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like I have a totally different sleep cycle than I need for work... I'm always tired but at night I'm awake and the only thing holding me back from doing something is the thought that it's night and that I should sleep because I need to go to work the next day.</p></div>		</li>
