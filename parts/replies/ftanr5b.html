			<div class="markdown"><p>Nucleus <em>is</em> the protons and neutrons. And protons and neutrons <em>are</em> groups of quarks. There are no matter-like balls and spheres enclosing anything like we often were visualized in textbooks, however, there are force-like volumes (imagine two magnets repelling each other for very rough visualization of such force-like volume).</p></div>		</li>

<p>is it just the actual protons and neutrons and they are stuck together and thats what it is, with no &quot;container&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, the nucleons (collective term for protons and neutrons) are bonded together with the Strong Nuclear Force, the strongest of the 4 Fundamental Forces in our Universe. The more neutrons there are, the more unstable the nucleus is - which is why you might have heard of the phrase &quot;every element wants to be iron&quot;, which is applicable during nucleosynthesis. The instability means that the nucleus is in a collapsed state (so in that case the shape might be a bit wonky) as it gives off alpha radiation which is helium nuclei, lowering the &quot;mass&quot; of the nucleus, changing its element of course.</p></div>		</li>
