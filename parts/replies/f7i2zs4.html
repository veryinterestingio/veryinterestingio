			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add that some random cuts can be similar to surgically smooth. But it's keeping them clean that will keep the pain away. Paper cuts or slicing your hand with a very sharp knife might not hurt as much initially even though you could be bleeding or in pain when it's touched.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once cut in the tip off my finger with one of those single razor blades. Showing that it doesn't cut if you press straight down but will cut if you move (which i didn't intend to actually do). I saw it go in pretty deep and it bled like hell. But it hardly hurt it had more of an annoying throb too it.</p>
<p>That cut was all but surgical but the blade was sharp as hell. So i think it is not tearing away as much as most other cuts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you're saying you pushed a fresh razor blade into your skin to prove it wouldn't cut? But then it cut? </p>
<p>Haha still appreciate the scientific info though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did a similar thing when I was something like 11. I was building a Piper J-cup (thats the name I remember) scale model rc plane, and I had glued 2 things that shouldn't've been glued together. Then the brilliant idea to use a box cutter to split them appeared in my head, and I went to town on it. At first everything went fine, but when I got around the the middle of the parts, the blade got stuck all the time. I fiddled with it and turned it around until I was cutting against my thumb pushind directly at the to-be-cut seam.<br />
Suddenly the part split, and I plunged the boxcutter into my thumb head-on. It sunk just under 1 cm into my thumbnail (it went in the &quot;left&quot; side of the bone) and I immediately pulled it out. No blood, no pain, just a dull feeling all around my left hand. Then I cupoed it in my hand and blood started flowing through the finger of my closed right fist.<br />
I ran out of the garage to tell my dad who was on the phone and he just started to motion and then yell for me to go to the bathroom. There we just kept it under cold water until the bleeding stopped (with a couple of  dousings with disinfectant), and put a hilariously undersized normal bandage on it. At some point I got dizzy and the world started spinning around me and I had to sit down, but it passed in around 20 seconds.</p>
<p>I was careful with the thumb for around a week, and replaced the bandage daily, until the skin was healed. Left me with a split thumbnail for a bit over a month though.</p>
<p>At no point did I feel pain, just mild discomfort for a day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My friend used to cut herself and she said scratching herself with the blade of scissors hurt way more (and rarely caused bleeding) than using a super thin razor blade, which bled like a lot but barely hurt at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right that “local” would have been the better term.</p>
<p>I’m not an anesthesiologist or a surgeon, but I do also believe that the anesthetic injected around surgical incisions also exists as a topical (eg lidocaine) in contrast to things given IV like propofol or inhaled like isoflurane. That’s why I feel like I often hear it referred to by them as a topical even though it is injected subcutaneously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because he/she is wrong to say topical. The word for an injected anesthetic that mum's a small area is local. Topical anesthetic is applied onto the surface of the skin/wound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also a huge difference in the number and sensitivity of nerves in various areas of the body. The back (as in OP's case) is rather light on nerves, whereas your fingertips are heavy.</p>
<p>Additionally surgical cuts are done in ways to minimize post-surgery stress on the wound - i.e. pulling and stretching.  Areas like the palm of your hand or the bottom of your foot get pushed and pulled around a lot from grabbing/walking/etc, which is why surgeries usually try to go in from the top of your foot/back of your hand if possible. </p>
<p>Not to mention that a nice clean surgical cut is easier to stitch-up securely than a random jagged cut.  This keeps the wound from pulling, making it much less painful.</p></div>		</li>
