			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. How I remember it is:  </p>
<p>Your body is made of several trillion cells, over the course of a decade your body will lose and generate several trillion new cells.  </p>
<p>So, not necessarily all cells, and some more often that others. Your skin for instance is on like a 30 day turnover.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a cycle, though. In that time you <em>could expect</em> that all of your cells have had one replacement, yet some cell types or locations you would be certain that they had had hundreds of replacements. Perhaps a better way to think of it is that each cell type has it's own cycle, and all those have experienced a change in that 7-10 period.</p>
<p>And yeah, i did fly that explanation by the seat of my pants ...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the myth that skin is mostly dead skin comes at least partially from the movie Sunshine where they enter an abandoned spaceship covered in dust. In that very specific circumstance of a hermetically sealed environment surrounded by hard vacuum, it's a lot more likely that dead skin is a major contributor of dust. In all other cases, it's pretty hard to believe.</p></div>		</li>
