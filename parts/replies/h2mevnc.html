			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, a lot of live captioning is done with stenotypes. More recently, an alternative to the stenotype has gained some ground: speech recognition. It doesn't work the way you might expect it to, though—there isn't a computer recognizing speech straight out of a broadcast or courtroom proceedings. Instead, the captioner / court reporter / whoever repeats everything into a special microphone with an enclosure they can hold against their face. That way, it doesn't matter so much if someone in a courtroom is mumbling, or if a broadcast has loud noises in the background. The computer hears only clear speech with minimal background noise.</p>
<p>You can see some of these special microphones <a href="https://talktech.com/stenomask-steno-sr/" target="_blank">here</a>. It looks like this company's microphones sell for around $200–300.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some of the live captioning mistakes are hilarious. Example in the Tom Hanks version of &quot;The LadyKillers&quot;, he introduces himself as &quot;Professor G.H. Dorr, PHD&quot;.</p>
<p>Here in Sweden, phd is a type of sour milk, and sure enough, the captioner typed up &quot;Professor G.H. Dorr, sour milk&quot;</p>
<p>You had to be there... :-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couldn't they just avoid the &quot;repeat&quot; phase and just set the special mic for the speaker and transmit directly from it? You would avoid potential mistakes in the repetition, and also everybody in the room and those watching the stream could hear the speaker more clearly. It would look weird tho.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. They're really neat. Someone demonstrated one for me at an accessibility workshop. It's very much like a piano keyboard where playing different chords creates different words.</p></div>		</li>
