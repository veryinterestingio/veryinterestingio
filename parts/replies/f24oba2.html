			<div class="markdown"><p>They don’t care about data. The internet link companies buy from owners of submarine cables is measured by bandwidth only. Makes no difference to their profit if you consume less or more data. </p>
<p>Charging for data is making money for a product that doesn’t exist. </p>
<p>On mobile kinda makes sense for legal reasons like everyone else said here already. Over radio is easier to guarantee amount of data than signal stability.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sounds like a net win for the ISPs, then</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an oversimplification. The amount of data transferred has a very very minimal impact and for all practical purposes, it is zero at a marginal level i.e the extra GB transferred costs nothing to an isp. However, the long term implications are that data transfer hence becomes bigger and bigger. Now we transfer 100s of GBs a month whereas in the early 2000s, it was difficult to hit a cap of 1 gb. That does not happen on stale infra. ISPs constantly need to upgrade it for your data gorging pleasures such as 4k video and low latency gaming. That cost is what they need to offset from your subscription payment. So it may not cost on a marginal level, but it has a very real cost on the whole</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same could potentially be said about speed no?</p>
<p>Does it cost my isp more to provide me with a 200meg connection as compared to a 50meg connection? The infrastructure is the same on my end since when I got an upgrade they did nothing that I saw</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Their lines have a total bandwidth that they can provide. Let's say, for simplicity's sake, that their line can handle 10gb/s. They can sell 10 1gb/s accounts, or they can sell 100 .1gb/s accounts. Either way, they still have the same cost to run the 10gb/s line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really, the marginal cost is negligible, their expenses are nearly all in fixed costs, like paying wages, replacing broken equipment, and rent. </p>
<p>The price structure exists to milk the consumer for as much money as possible, rather than because that's what it costs to deliver more data, or deliver data faster. Yes, computers and networking equipment use more power under load, but that is like a dollar or two per month in the extreme 24/7 fully saturated use case.</p></div>		</li>
