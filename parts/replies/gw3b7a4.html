			<div class="markdown"><p>So you go through all that trouble to slightly increase your quality of life. Why not go the extra step to launder it and actually enjoy the money to the fullest.</p>
<p>Even if you use the dirty money on everything cash you still can't spend all 30k on rent and car because even that is suspicious because how are you surviving when 100% income goes to rent/car.</p>
<p>So from the 30k a year you're still spending about 5-8k a year on living. And only the stuff after that you can actually profit on. </p>
<p>So a second full time job just to be able to change your 30k a year life to a 45k a year life?</p>
<p>There is of course 1 factor I'm ignoring here. You keep the money in full, so if you're doing this for a couple of years and then leave the scene you can continue eating lobster and caviar for years to come.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, spend money on untraceable experiences. Travel on affordable airlines, stay in affordable hotels, make your friends pay their own share, then blast cash on drinks, drugs, hookers, skydiving, get the entire village drunk. Then go home with pictures of your visit to the local museum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is a very middle class statement. You could live like a kind on 130k cash. Many &quot;escorts&quot; do this with no issues. The people laundering money are the ones looking to buy multiple homes, cars, etc.</p>
<p>As far as the IRS is concerned 130k a year is nothing.</p></div>		</li>
