			<div class="markdown"><p>I would imagine we wouldn't be as advanced as we are today.  A great many technologies were invented (or accidentally invented) trying to further advance military technologies.</p>
<p>Ancient blacksmiths didn't try to find better metals and alloys for the hell of it.  They were trying to build a better sword or lighter/better armor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m in the opposite camp. Motivation is a big part of human advancement. War is one of the greatest motivators. Modern nation states for example were created due to their efficiency in war time.</p>
<p>As a wise man (who I forget the name of) once said, war begets the state and the state goes to war. </p>
<p>I believe we’d be much less advanced had we not had so many wars. It’s not that war is the only way to advance it just encourages people to quicken the pace. It makes advancement a necessity so that you can better defeat your enemies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d say writing is the greatest human invention, and the printing press is appended to that somewhere. Writing has allowed humans to overcome time itself, to reach forwards and backwards and pass on knowledge and techniques. It allows us to compile and transmit all our discoveries and to not be starting from zero continuously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, we would have a hard time finding out the discovery was lost if it was truly lost. The problem was that the people with the problem that had already been solved and the people with the books that contained the solution were not talking with each other about the issue, in large part due to being very far apart. So you have a lot of cases of rediscoveries as knowledge were not so widely available. Movable types itself have been independently invented at least four times but it was either not a success and therefore the records of the invention ended up in the depths of a library or the technology was deliberately kept secret to protect the ruling classes from an enlightened lower class.</p></div>		</li>
