			<div class="markdown"><p>My credit union must be using this. It takes under 2 hours for my checks to actually appear in my account using mobile deposit (taking a pic of the check). The only waiting time is for a person to look at the check to make sure it's real. I can also wire money in real time to my girlfriend at her other credit union</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>UPI is slightly more than that, all major banks in India pretty much support it you can transfer from one UPI address to another without knowing any other details apart from UPI address. You can use it for payment pretty much for any bill and you don't have to share credit card details for most online purchases</p></div>		</li>
