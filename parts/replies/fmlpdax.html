			<div class="markdown"><p>people prefer to drink cold water? there's over a billion Chinese that prefer warm water.  </p>
<p>i always assumed this preference was nothing more than habit. you think chicken feet are gross because you didn't grow up eating chicken feet. or you don't and you did.  </p>
<p>a preference for cooked water over raw water has an obvious advantage, especially in places where there is poor sanitation.  </p>
<p>if you think people really just naturally prefer cold water, then please do share what you know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a cultural divide. Most Western countries &quot;prefer&quot; cold water, while a lot of Eastern countries &quot;prefer&quot; warm water.</p>
<p>Neither is more correct, and provided the water is clean, it makes no difference health wise what temperature it is.</p>
<p>You might be right with the sanitation argument. If you're from a culture where boiling water to clean it was required until relatively recently, it probably feels more &quot;right&quot; to drink it warm. Most Western countries have had robust water sanitation since the 19th century, so boiling water to clean it isn't really in the public consciousness anymore.</p>
<p>Drinking warm water feels really weird to me. Wrong somehow. Like drinking piping hot fruit juice or eating cold french fries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i'm getting kind of used to the warm water. it hasn't really been that much of a transition, although i'm drinking beverages cold when left to myself.  </p>
<p>i've been wondering if the need to boil water for potability may even be connected to the importance of soups in many asian cuisines. it's more efficient to boil water as part of the cooking process, rather than have a separate step to boil water alone. i think soups probably do double duty, disinfecting the water, and capturing more of the fat that would otherwise be lost.  </p>
<p>when taking chinese people out to eat here in the usa, i make a point of asking the waiter for tap-cold water, rather than ice water. and sometimes the water arrives without ice.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's why everyone also likes their food cold as well. Nothing like pouring that ice-cold gravy onto a huge, frosty mound of mashed potatoes!</p></div>		</li>
