			<div class="markdown"><p>As a general rule, the harder a cheese the less lactose, the softer it is the more it has.  </p>
<p>So harder or more mature cheeses = good, softer and creamier cheeses = not so good.  </p>
<p>To my knowledge anyway, would recommend research if actually intolerant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also Central Europe, I developed lactose intolerance over the past year. I casually mentioned it a colleague and he said &quot;Oh yea I have it too. Also [four other colleagues]&quot;. I worked with them for years, we eat in the same restaurant and I would have never known. They either pick food without milk or cheese, or eat tablets that help with digesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people I know including me (here in central europe) are just sensitive to lactose. Hard cheese is completely fine, something like brie is okay if I don't eat a lot but if I make a protein shake with milk I can stay on the loo for the rest of the day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also Central Europe and just met another lactose intolerant person in this region for the first time last year. I was born with it, but I doubt most of my friends even know because I really only have trouble with cow's milk (goat's milk is fine) and some soft cheeses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's exactly what the video goes into. That populations who domesticated livestock for a longer time have slowly adapted to being tolerant of it, whereas populations which didn't do so until much later are less tolerant of it.</p></div>		</li>
