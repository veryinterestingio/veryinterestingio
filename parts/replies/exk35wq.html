			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s so confusing as a visitor. I tried to get to my hotel in downtown Chicago and the GPS literally took me 5 stories underground. It’s like every road has 5 levels but they all share the same street name.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Who makes a street going North, South, East, AND West and makes it 3 levels... all with the same name. </p>
<p>I love Chicago but goddamn it that is the most absurd design I’ve ever seen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes Wacker Drive is a bit of a clusterfuck but the rest of the city is laid out on a nice square grid courtesy of the replanning that happened after the fire.</p>
<p>Contrast that with a city like Boston where the streets go literally in every direction and just stop and also curve around.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm a Chicago native that's really good witg direction and Wacker still confounds me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't drive much in the city but honestly I've found it pretty easy to navigate, sure there are some weird parts to the streets but with the grid system being as good as it is you can get most places if you know the address and can find north.</p></div>		</li>

There are multiple levels, and most Uber drivers don't know how to navigate it. Fun fact, The Dark Knight also filmed the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYqlI9mdtVA" target="_blank">chase scene</a> there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It allows access to bottoms of buildings for some parking garages and delivery drivers. But it also is a long road that connects two opposite ends of the loop. This is a better example of how most people use it for transportation</p>

<p>Check out this map of Torontos PATH system. Largest in the world. Underground there is restaurants, stores, and all kinds of businesses. If you live in a condo and work downtown, you can live your whole winter without setting foot above ground aside from home and work.</p></div>		</li>
