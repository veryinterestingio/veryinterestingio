			<div class="markdown"><p>God, my handwriting was so bad that I had to write notebooks full of individual letters, never helped and I hate handwriting. So I got much better at typing and now proceed to type as many of my assignments as I can. When I need to write it out it sucks because I just can’t do it(I really can’t be bothered to put in the time as I put in countless as a kid and I just don’t wanna anymore) but it sucks because there are exams where I get questions wrong because he can’t read my letters and they mistake words. Really sucks but I can’t write slow on my exams which I need every second(ADHD, I lose time on tests because sometimes I dose off for way too long) shit sucks.</p></div>		</li>
