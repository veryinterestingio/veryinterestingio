<p>Also true for Arabic</p>
<p>Also pretty sure that’s true for Icelandic and Gaelic as well.</p>
<p>In fact, there are quite a few languages/nations that have culture/language institutes responsible for maintaining a prescriptivist ideal for it’s language for the purpose of nationalism or revitalization</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Spain academics are not appointed by the government but by other academics. Being appointed an academic is considered a huge recognition in itself: the best of the best consider you one of them. The authority of the academy stems simply from people respecting their authority. This is why people respect Nobel prizes: nobody has said that whatever the Swedish Academy of Science says is the official truth.</p>
<p>In summary, academies are just private clubs (often with public support) for the best in a field (selected by themselves, so some academies are certainly garbage), and that's why their opinions are often of interest.</p></div>		</li>
