<p>In rare cases cancer can spontaneously regress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We began to understand in the mid 1990s with genetic assay that this isn't actually rare, but rather, that this happens multiple times a week, and that it usually happens so early (on the order of invisibly small clusters of cells) that the carrier and thus medicine never knew it happened in the first place</p>
<p>Kind of like fires in nature, right?  There's a hundred thousand a day but the plants have adapted and almost all of them go out nearly immediately, and we only really think about giant forest fires, so we tend to think of them as rare, but they actually aren't</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! That is what I also wanted to add, that our immune system is pretty great at protecting us against cancer on a regular basis but sometimes it fails and cancer can evade our immune system. There are several great articles on it, but this an good one for anyone interested. :) </p>

<p>Quote: &quot;Indeed, it is possible, even likely, that your immune system may regularly fight off cancer or pre-cancer on a regular basis without you even knowing it. &quot;We all have a mechanism to filter out a small amount of cancer cells to prevent us from having visible cancer in the body,&quot; Dr. Tan says. &quot;Over time, that balance becomes lost.&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>So technically, most cancer are left untreated and are not fatal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for adding this. This is why there’s a fair amount of debate on early screening and intervention. The worry is we intervene on a cancer when we don’t need to, possibly causing metastasis in the process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We've also seen this happen in head &amp; neck cancer. A patient will present with a single nodal met, and no identifiable primary. Presumably, the primary tumour spontaneously regressed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. I went to the eye doctor for a routine checkup in my mid-20s, and they realized that my field of vision had a big gap in it where I couldn’t see anything (that I’d never even noticed before, because it’s off to the side). They did some imaging, and turns out I had a spontaneously regressed retinoblastoma that had basically stopped part of my retina from working properly, causing the partial loss of vision. They think I got the retinoblastoma when I was very young, but that I somehow successfully fought it off before anyone had a chance to notice it. So I can technically say that I’ve cured cancer without even knowing it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean that's great and all but I hope you know what the definition of cure means.</p>
<p>You beat cancer and that's great, but we shouldn't be throwing the word cure around until it's actually proper</p></div>		</li>
