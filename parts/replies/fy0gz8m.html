			<div class="markdown"><p>A syndrome from what I remember is also a set of symptoms that are correlated to each other, and they are often, but not always indicative of a disease. It is also not necessary that the group of symptoms that form the syndrome are only ever related to one particular condition or disease.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>Down syndrome has symptoms with a known cause, so physiologically it is no different than a disease.</p>
<p>On the other hand, toxic shock syndrome has a bunch of symptoms that can have more than one cause. </p>
<p>Premenstrual syndrome is a true syndrome in this sense - it is a set of symptoms, but there is no known cause, so we can't call it a disease.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Very minor correction: COVID-19 is the disease; SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify very mildly, COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2  (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) virus. The symptoms of the disease are a result of both the virus doing damage to cells and also the response of immune system doing further if not greater damage.</p>
<p>Growing up when this was emerging news, I didn't know the distinction between HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) which is the virus and AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) which is the disease, I found this pretty interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're welcome. I was just now listening to an interview with a doctor treating COVID-19 patients in hospital, it was very interesting to hear it was found that patients who died of COVID-19 showed little signs of cellular damage due to the virus. The big killer it seems is the inflammation caused by an overreaction of the immune system.</p></div>		</li>
