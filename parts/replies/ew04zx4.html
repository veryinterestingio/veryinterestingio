<p>In this sense the kind of &quot;edible&quot; gold coating a candy is no different than the kind of gold in say a gold ring.</p>

<p>With the possible exception that the leaf is probably quite pure, while the gold ring is likely alloyed for the sake of durability. At least, you hope the leaf is pure! In India there's a product called Vark, which is <em>usually</em> fine silver leaf applied to small sweets or seeds. In theory it's just like eating a tiny amount of gold, no big deal. In practice testing has found that a majority are adulterated with aluminum, cadmium and lead. </p>
<p>All told it makes me grateful for EU/US/CA food safety standards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ideally even in India it's supposed to be pure,both in case of silver and gold. Some people talk of them having some medicinal qualities if taken regularly in small amounts. But with the current food adulteration situation, one would be better off not having them rather than having them as garnishes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But different metals do affect taste. Apparently gold cutlery makes food taste the best because it is more inert than steel. Maybe explains why royalty used to like using it. Just like how Coke tastes different if you drink it out of plastic, glass or metal containers. Not sure how this would affect EATING it but it's possible it effects taste.</p></div>		</li>
