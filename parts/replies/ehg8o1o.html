Ultimately you will just become a paid passenger in a long exchange of tragedies. Find other ways to help. I bevame a big brother to a kid in one of my old group homes. But even that is a struggle.</p></div>		</li>

Trying to do my part too. I could only hack it in the system for a couple years, but I think I can do more being there for one kid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So well put. I think my job as a case manager at a homeless shelter that had an extremely toxic work environment on top of it has scarred me enough to stay away from helping on an individual level (direct services) for the foreseeable future. Right now I’m focusing on my own healing as well as being there for my family and friends. I am also working towards a career that will focus on systemic change instead of change on the individual level. Most likely in policy writing/research. </p></div>		</li>

<p>You only get one shot at this life. Sometimes... You gotta take care of you before you can take care of anything else. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who has various mental health issues and has worked with (had) more than a few social workers over the years, I think social workers are unsung heroes. Of course, you get the awful ones too, and some mediocre or just-doing-it-for-the money ones. And there's nothing inherently wrong with that. But the few times I've been privileged enough to actually have a social worker who cares and invests themselves emotionally and physically into their work it's been more helpful than I know how to express.</p>
<p>I don't think this is just me either, many of the friends I've known have seen significant improvement when they've had social workers around them that care and make the effort.</p>
<p>No doubt it's a very hard job. It can be very difficult and frustrating to work with people with mental health issues, especially because things like depression can, if not outright cause, then make more likely pessimism or outright fatalism, which can cause people to not want to help themselves. This can be really difficult for loved ones and workers trying to help. We like to say that you can't help someone who doesn't want to help themselves. I don't think this is true in a strict sense, even if it's a good general rule. But it's definitely very frustrating and tiring trying to help someone who doesn't necessarily always want to be helped, and even when they do want to help themselves, struggle to maintain optimism or fend off fatalism or suicidal ideation and general negativity regarding the future and their own actions.</p>
<p>Regardless, you're a hero. Even if you have quit, imagine how much better the world might be if everyone took just a year or two of their lives to care for others. I definitely feel a need to give back in the same way others have invested in me, and hopefully when I do I'll encourage others to want to help those who need help too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I truly appreciate this. I was a case manager at a homeless shelter...it’s hard for me to write concisely my immense amount thoughts and feelings I have surrounding it. (I re-wrote this post so many times with different things included/excluded lol). I still think about that job and certain clients every single day. I wonder if they are alive and if they are okay, and try to come to peace with the fact that I will never know. The wound is so fresh that everything is a reminder. I think what was the hardest for me to handle was the combination of the toxic work environment, my own personal traumas, and then of course the general nature of how broken the system is and then being (in a way) the face of the system while working in the trenches of humanity. I also think what was often the worst part of the job was due to the fact that I was working in a limited-stay residential setting. I had to mediate and address soooo much insane communal living conflict, which of course stemmed from chronic trauma and chronic homelessness (it was never really about the cheese missing from the communal fridge or the sock left on someone else’s side of the room). Some of it made me scared for my personal safety. And then on top of all the usual traumatic things people often hear about with social services/crisis work, people don’t realize how much manual labor is involved with moving clients’ belongings in or out of housing, cleaning things, and as with most shelters, we were constantly trying to get rid of bed bugs (which means never ending amounts of laundry). There’s the base level of stress in all of social services by providing active listening and emotional support while listening to stories with the most heinous traumas and violence I could have ever imagined, but what was often the hardest for me to deal with was the conflict within the shelter itself (which I could pretty much write a dissertation on dissecting the causes of it and effects this has on clients lol). </p>
<p>But regardless, your last paragraph in particular really resonated with me, so thank you again for this comfort you gave me by sharing a piece of your journey. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was also born with heroin addiction and my mother lost me and my sister's temporarily to child services. She managed to clean herself up enough to regain custody of us all pretty quickly, though.</p>
<p>She relapsed a few times over her life, and seeing her fighting terminal cancer when I was in my teens, it's weird to say, but I've definitely seen the best and worst of drug use/addiction over the years. (The 'best' being that, after a hit being the only time my mother wasn't in agony while she was slowly dying...)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mother died almost 14 years ago oddly of a complication mostly unrelated to her cancer and completely unrelated to her drug use, but her husband, my step-father died just before Christmas 2017.</p>
<p>He had a bladder infection and got really ill, refused medical treatment and instead opted for continued self medication. With heroin (as he had done for the previous 35 years) and in his weakened state, just died...  No loss, his addiction always came before everyone else. My mother was mostly able to put her kids first over her usage. <em>shrugs</em></p></div>		</li>

<p>With or without drugs in the womb, a mom of seven kids by seven fathers who winds up in prison is likely going to find all sorts of ways to cause issues for their children’s development, for instance.</p>
<p>We also do know that the crack baby epidemic was a bit of a hysteria out of proportion to the actual problem, though. Babies with short term withdrawal issues, yes, but not necessarily permanently severely damaged babies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely true, I was born in 82. The crack epedemic was popularized mostly in the late 80s.  Some of my siblings have shown completely different sympotms than i have at birth, depending on my mothers drug of choice at the time. But I can assure you that there were distinct symptoms and behavioral issues that i went through as an infant, well before environment.  </p></div>		</li>
