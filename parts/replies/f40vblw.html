<p>Why are tobacco plants coated with that stuff? Because it is the product of a chain of radioactive reactions occurring in and above the fields, the original source of that apparently comes with the fertilizer people put on tobacco fields.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I looked it up: The culprit is thorium-230, a quite stable isotope that is a decay product of uranium-238. And because trace amounts of uranium are pretty much in every rock, there's thorium-230 in them as well. When this isotope decays, it turns into radon-226, which is a noble gas, which rises from the ground and mixes with air. This isotope in turn only lives for a few days, and decays into polonium - which is a solid and therefore falls back to the ground as dust.</p>
<p>So even if a tobacco field is not fertilized with minerals containing trace uranium, some amount of radon gas will always be there, and with it polonium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. And it's in the air we breathe. We get exposed to quite a lot of radiation all the time. It takes a lot of radiation to have a measurable increase of cancer risk, and an unbelievable amount to get chernobyl-like acute radiation poisoning.</p>
<p>I read a little about the issue and found <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2509609/" target="_blank">this research paper</a> about the topic. They say that a heavy smoker has more than double the amount of polonium in their body on average, and that an estimated 1% of lung cancer cases are caused by this.</p>
<p>They also go a bit into more detail about how the polonium ends up in the tobacco at such a high rate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As high-phosphate fertilizers are applied to tobacco crops, PO-210 is absorbed from the soil through the plant roots.26 PO-210 also deposits on the surface of the tobacco leaf via fine, sticky hairs (trichomes), which bind airborne radioactive dust particles generated during the application of fertilizers.29 PO-210 is thought to be encapsulated with calcium phosphate and lead-210 into insoluble radioactive particles, which are subsequently transferred directly into the mainstream smoke (the smoke that is inhaled directly into smokers’ lungs).29,30</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few corrections:  thorium-230 decays into radium-226 which decays into radon-222 (Rn-222) which is indeed a noble gas. Low concentrations of Rn-222 can be found literally everywhere as thorium-230 and radium-226 are common in most soils. Rn-222 has a half-life if 3.8 days and most of the subsequent decay chain are even shorter-lived — if they are deposited into the tobacco they decay away rapidly once the tobacco is harvested. </p>
<p>However, the decay chain does have a relatively long-lived isotope: lead-210 (Pb-210) with a 20 year half life. It’s this isotope that accumulates on the tobacco and eventually in the lungs if inhaled. Pb-210 and it’s daughter product polonium-210 (Po-210) both emit alpha particles which, while not very penetrating, do deposit all their energy into the nearby lung tissue, cause significant damage. </p>
<p>Incidentally, Po-210 May be familiar to some as the isotope that was used to poison KGB defector Alexander Litvinenko a few years ago.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Lead 210 decays to polonium 210 by double beta decay, not alpha decay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are certain elements plants require from the soil.  They have biochemical methods to move those chemicals into their tissue.  Polonium isn't similar enough to any of the elements they require to insert itself into that pathway.  You can compare this to strontium, which is very similar to calcium.  I read a study back awhile that talked about strontium in cattle bones and milk because it was displacing calcium in its food source.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It does.</p>
<p>Polonium will absolutely be in some of the food you eat. It isn't absorbed into the bloodstream because the body has no use for it, though, so it'll just leave naturally the next time you pay a visit to the porcelain throne. You're going to get some radiation dose while it's inside, sure, but we get tiny amounts of radiation from <em>everything</em>. Since it passes so quickly it's not a problem.</p>
<p>The problem with smoking specifically is that you're (a) putting it in your lungs, (b) making sure it stays there with all the tar buildup, (c) disabling the defense mechanisms the respiratory system has to remove said tar, and (d) adding more every time you take a puff. It doesn't leave. You just gave polonium direct, semi-permanent access to the inside of a delicate organ.</p></div>		</li>
