			<div class="markdown"><p>Which for me is why i live unmedicated. The focus aspect is the least impactful part of my condition. I have taught myself how to focus... It is draining, and requires rest... But intense extended focus is teachable. The rest of it?  Ot that i have found.</p>
<p>Hopefully waiting for someone to come along and share how i am wrong and either a) a medication or b) training can be done to address the other areas beyond focus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will say focus is a big part of the benefit of meds for me. But I've also found that there's a knock-on effect. If I focus, I have a productive day at work, I get that dopamine hit that comes from successful task completion, I feel like I'm smart and good at my job and have done work I can be proud of. I feel capable and can choose either to give myself a well-deserved rest or use that momentum for more executive functioning tasks. It depends what your biggest struggles are, of course.</p>
<p>I was medicated pretty young and always felt like I could make the personal choice to go off my meds (my mom has it and has never been medicated) so when I was in high school I decided to go off my meds. If you look back, the outcome didn't look too bad. My grades dipped a whole letter grade but came back up. I got into my first choice school. But truthfully everything was just so much harder. Every A I got in high school was hard-won, every homework assignment completed was a success. Everything was so goddamn hard. I decided to go back onto my meds for college. I graduated from college in the top 5% of my class while overloading most semesters and had a pretty active social life to boot. And frankly, it wasn't even that hard. If I had an essay due on Friday, I just....did it on Wednesday. It was like magic. I still had all of my little strategies, and they were even more robust after four years of no meds, but now I had the focus to round things out.</p>
<p>I don't regret going off my meds in high school, and as I said my mom is just like me and has never taken meds. And I go without mine on weekends, vacations, etc. And obviously meds don't fix everything, I still leave doors unlocked and lose things and forget prescriptions. And part of me is glad for it because my ADHD really has shaped who I am, it's made me more generous toward other's mistakes, it's made me better at lateral thinking, it's made me more creative. But I can have my cake and eat it too, be my unmedicated creative self exactly as much and as often as I want, and be my medicated self exactly as much as I want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, if you didn't have to pour molten effort into trying to focus, it might be easier to manage the rest of the symptoms.</p>
<p>Also, other medications, such as atomoxetine and guanfacine, help with the emotional impulsivity/sensitivity side of ADHD and less with the focus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. You're using all your spoons to focus. Medicine would give you more spoons</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stimulants also help with motivation which is a large part of the executive function deficits of ADHD. I've found they help with motivation to a fault. IE they will motivate you beyond what is in your reasonable self interest to be motivated to do. I often overextend myself when working, and as a result overpromise and underdeliver.</p></div>		</li>
