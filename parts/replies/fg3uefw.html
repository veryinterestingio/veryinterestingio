			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, fossils are hard to find in tropical areas...although this just further supports the idea that early humans weren't way up north earlier on where fossils might have been <em>more</em> likely to survive than the fossils we actually do find down in the south.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fossils are extremely small sample sizes of living creatures.   I have a paleontologist Prof that I'm pretty close with who really hammers statistical analysis to his students.   The supposed 1 in a million odds of fossilization that gets tossed around regularly online is just to give us an idea of the rarity of fossilization.   The environmental conditions have to be SOOO perfect, that the variability of fossilization rates is completely dependant on geography.  </p>
<p>So you're right!  Tropical conditions are horrendous for fossilization, while temperate lakes are almost perfect.   This is why we have some amazing lacustrine deposits from Neolithic Europe, but almost nothing from ancient Africa.   It's a geographic difference.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I first thought you meant &quot;optimal conditions for human beings to live&quot; and I identified strongly with that analysis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, that’s part of what led to the “caveman” nonsense.  The vast majority of our ancestors never went near a cave, but we find remains of the few who did, and people then think all of our ancestors lived in caves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The general thoughts were because of improved brain function/size to create tools and techniques for better animal fur/leather use, better food storing techniques, better fire manipulation, overall modern humans were more adaptable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans are literally tropical creatures as far as our physiology is concerned. We haven't done more than (re)evolve a little bit more hair and some pro vitamin D absorbing white skin to survive the North. Even your most pasty ass Nordic person is only slightly more ready to survive the cold than a tropical bird. </p>
<p>What makes humans able to survive weather that our bodies just were not meant for is technology. The humans got further north than everyone else because they had the technology to do so, but because our tropical asses could naturally out survive a Neanderthal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just curious, but what makes you say &quot;tropical&quot; and not &quot;savanna&quot;? </p>
<p>And while I don't disagree clothing and shelter is huge, there's actually evidence that, eg., <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2015/sep/how-inuit-adapted-ice-age-living-and-high-fat-diet" target="_blank">Inuit populations have a genetic mutation to better suit them to the environment and their diet</a> so I wouldn't be so quick to discount an adapted/evolved human physiology.</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/atomfullerene" target="_blank">atomfullerene</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but that's because it took so long for people to cross Beringia (assuming certain New World fossil sites are not actually evidence of premodern humans...and I don't think they are).  H. erectus and its descendants were in Southern Asia for a million and a half years without crossing the bridge, so it's not like they just didn't have enough time to do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think we'll ever find proper fossils of the first humanoids to settle the Americas as sea levels have risen, washing away any remains of coastal settlements. Any remaining signs are likely underwater somewhere along the northern part of the West coast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the bridge wasn't there all the time, only during ice ages which would of made the area even harsher. It wasn't until a properly prepared people was able to cross such an area.</p></div>		</li>
