<p>Btw, keeping a depressed person awake for 24 hours drastically reduces the depression in the majority of cases, but those symptoms come back the moment you get a few hours of sleep.</p>

<p>It sounds so far-fetched and I know it's incredibly unhealthy but I've experienced this myself numerous times. Strangely enough, after the 24 hour threshold it feels like a chemical veil got lifted. I wonder if there's any good research on this subject and if they've been able to identify/isolate what goes on in (what I assume to be) neurodivergent brains so a potential treatment based on those findings can be developed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's just the effect of staying awake, since the body probably releases stuff to stop tiredness. I feel high as shit when I don't sleep.</p>
<p>Once the tiredness sets in though, you feel even worse so it's pretty crappy to stay awake to get that high.</p></div>		</li>
