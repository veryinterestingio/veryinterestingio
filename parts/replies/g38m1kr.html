			<div class="markdown"><p>They're chemicals in the cone cells of our retina which react to light of certain frequencies, in a way which triggers the nerve endings which send pulses to the brain. The reason they're called pigments is that, since they react to different colours of light differently, these chemicals would look coloured if we had a lot of them - just like the chemicals which colour our skin, hair and eyes are called pigments.</p></div>		</li>
