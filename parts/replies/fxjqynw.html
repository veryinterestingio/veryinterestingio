			<div class="markdown"><p>The 10x figure (when 300k cases were reported they were saying it was probable 10x that had been infected, which at that time would have been 1% of the population) was afaik based on early statistics published regarding disease progression rates. (20% of infected migrated to lungs, 15% of those required treatment, 15% of those went critical- it probably doesn't even apply anymore but these were the ratios published back in march based on observed cases around the world.)</p>
<p>Those rough statistics actually made it easier to calculate <em>prior</em> to widely available tests because the assumption could be loosely made that tests were only being performed on patients of a critical nature which gave us a cross reference with the progression statistics. (If all 300k cases were in that middle 15% or lower, we had a probable cap of 2m cases, and almost absolute cap of 10m.)</p>
<p>That reference point no longer applies because of increased access to testing, plus it's possible those ratios have been updated.</p>
<p>Based on the old ratios you could say 15-20 million (there's your 'CDC says 6-7%' figure) is on the high side of likely. 75-100 million is a rough probable cap to the number of people that have been potentially infected in any capacity. </p>
<p>As weird as it always sounds, as far as deadliness statistics are concerned, the more infected and less dead, the better it appears. If it's 100m people infected and 130k dead we're talking about a .001 death ratio, if it's 15m it's .008 almost 9. For reference as reported it's lingering around .05. </p>
<p>Just for death reference:</p>
<p>If the 320m total population of the US caught it and these rates held true-</p>
<p>.001= 320,000</p>
<p>.009= 2.8m</p>
<p>.05= 16m</p>
<p>Dead.</p>
<p>So in this respect it's not absurd to say I hope to high heaven the CDC is largely underestimating that 6-7% figure. While I would much prefer an actual strategy to beat this thing (a freaking lockdown with $2k/month UBI and essential worker incentives ON TOP of UBI- plus mandatory all personnel PPE with heavy fines and potential charges (disturbing the peace/reckless endangerment) for non-compliants,) what we are left with instead is the hope that it's much more pervasive than we think with much lower percentages for death and permanent injury (which is as of yet a great big unknown.)</p>
<p>Not to be scary, but those figures would repeat every wave. Typically, coronavirus family viruses can be caught up to 3 times in a year. (Sources below.) This means whatever that death ratio eventually settles on after the initial 'spread' period, that amount of people would likely die every 4 months as this thing makes its rounds. Like a flu with no off season. This is before you even factor in mutations.</p>
<p>Also a factor to consider are the who-knows-how-many with long term issues from the angiogenesis, clotting, or psychological issues this thing appears to produce.</p>
<p>:) </p>
<p>We need lockdown til it's gone, and much more seriously this time.</p>
<p>Edit to add: there is no such thing as herd immunity for the coronavirus family. Every single other coronavirus is re-catchable (the same strain) within a few months. 3 times a year for the exact same strain is not abnormal. Herd immunity for this thing is a wish and a pipe dream, not a goal to attempt to achieve. All 'herd immunity' does is encourage mutation and re-catchable variations of the virus.</p>
<p>That's a VERY dangerous game.</p>
<p>(Sources provided for herd immunity is a crapshoot at best, because &quot;immunity&quot; is not a thing:</p>

<p>ALL of these point out that 99% of people infected with ANY coronavirus (but also specifically SARS-CoV-2) do NOT make enough antibodies to neutralize a new infection (or reinfection.) Point blank. Reinfections are likely in 99% of infected patients, within a year, likely up to 3 times per year. There is also a distinct possibility that reinfections could actually be <em>worse.</em>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't seem like a bad idea to me. I'm an Canada and when we had a huge number of people returning from the US when this thing started. It just wasn't feasible to test that number of people, so everyone returning from overseas were required to quarantine for two weeks under the assumption they had it. In fact that policy is still in place now.</p>
<p>In the situation /u/ahobel95 is in, it might make sense to assume that their entire household has it, and require quarantine for all of them. That makes sense to me, why use a test when they could test negative today and then get infected two days from now which could happen because they're living with someone that has it. The problem is that their work is requiring them to continue going in. </p>
<p>To me it would make sense to have a quarantine order for any household that has a positive case, and at that point there's no need to test everyone in the household, at least not until 2 weeks has past to make sure they no longer have it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. There aren't any known mutations that would allow the virus to dodge immune response. </p>
<p>Here's an article that talks about testing antibodies against both &quot;Italian&quot; and &quot;Wuhan&quot; strains: the finding seem to be that the same exact antibodies affect both.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coronavirus family viruses are not something the human body produces effective antibodies for. SARS-CoV-2 is no exception.</p>
<p>This study follows several thousand people over decades to prove that people catch the same strain of coronavirus multiple times a year:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.11.20086439v2" target="_blank">https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.11.20086439v2</a></p>
<p>Here are multiple articles and links to studies that showed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are not produced in high enough quantity to prevent reinfection, and are not retained in the immune system for long. It is an average to say these studies all indicate the average person can expect multiple infections a year of Covid-19, regardless of the strain. The average to expect is at least twice, but up to 3 times a year may be considered normal.</p>

<p>The current actual hope is for T-cell immunity.</p>
<p><a href="https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/5/48/eabd2071" target="_blank">https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/5/48/eabd2071</a></p>
<p>This only develops in severe patients who develop ARDS, although they appear to transmit this T-cell data to those around them.</p>
<p>This means our actual strongest hope for 'herd immunity' is NOT from the 3m infected, but the small percentage of severe cases that recover.</p>
<p>That's... Not a herd immunity tactic, it's a short list of survivors.</p></div>		</li>
