<p>Although the number of zeros you'd have to write out before getting to a number that isn't zero (0.0000000...000000001%, etc) is so large that your brain would likely collapse into a black hole just from storing that much information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's much better to treat the table as a potential barrier and make this a quantum mechanics problem, not an electro-dynamics problem. The actual EM forces would be such that, just looking at those, there is zero chance of making it through without destroying both hand and table.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the potential would be created by your electrons bring repelled by the table electrons. But if we only consider that then there is zero chance of going through the table. Consider that potential barrier in the quantum sense as a modified version of single particle tunneling and you have an unimaginably small, but nonzero chance</p></div>		</li>
