			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes its hard to say but if i recall correctly that expansion happened within around 10\^-26 seconds. However the speed of light refers to the maximum speed objects can travel through space - space itself is free to expand as fast as it wants. Even in our universe today, regions of space far away from us are moving faster than light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Objects can't move faster then the speed of light, but expanding space can which is why as the universe expands we will evenchually no longer be able to see stars. The specifics on why are here.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Space is expanding faster than the speed of light at this very moment. The further away a distant galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from us. </p>
<p>The most distant galaxies we can see are travelling away from us faster than the speed of light. </p>
<p>And no, that doesn’t contradict the idea that the upper speed limit in the universe is the speed of light, because the reason they are traveling away from us so quickly is because the space between us and them is expanding so quickly. The geometry of spacetime can expand faster than the speed of light. </p>
<p>We can still see them, even though they are traveling away from us at faster than the speed of light, because when the light we are currently seeing was emitted, they weren’t yet traveling away from us as quickly. But over billions of years these galaxies have moved further and further away from us, and the expansion of space has accelerated. </p>
<p>That’s why the radius of the observable universe is 46.5 billion light years, even though it’s only been  13.8 billion years since recombination. If the atoms that emitted the cosmic microwave background we are seeing right now only travel away from us at less than light speed, the observable universe would have a radius of at most 27.6 billion light years.</p></div>		</li>
