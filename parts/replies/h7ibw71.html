Here are some articles on the web for it just occurred to me that this is one of those cases where the neural network basically matches almost exactly how our unconscious picks out our name, even when we're half asleep.

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more accurate to say that our entire brain functions more like the dedicated neural network that recognises &quot;hey Siri&quot;. We don't have an equivalent of the CPU they does all the other processing that a phone does. </p>
<p>That being said, we don't yet understand the brain well enough to give a fully satisfying, comprehensive answer to your question. This is because you quickly get into having to explain how we become conscious of hearing our name, and the current state of the art in neuroscience has little definitive to say about consciousness. </p>
<p>Main point is that &quot;hey Siri&quot; and other &quot;AI&quot; stuff is often inspired by what we do know about how our brains work. Neural networks to some extent are copies of our brain's processing architecture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, with the newest iOS (iOS 15, which is still in beta, although you can download the public beta and use it if you want) Siri is now using your phone to locally process what you are saying into text for searching (rather than sending your audio to the cloud where it is processed) She still gets the actual answer from the cloud of course, but this speeds up Siri requests significantly</p></div>		</li>

You can also tell Siri ‚ÄúSiri share this with _ ‚Äú and she will either share what‚Äôs on your screen or if that‚Äôs not possible, she will take a screen shot and send it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer.  When ‚Äúhey Siri‚Äù first came out, only iPhone 6S and higher could do the activation phrase while on battery.  The A9 Chip had the M9 coprocessor that ran at low power and listened for it.</p></div>		</li>
