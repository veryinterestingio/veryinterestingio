			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to your answer - batch manufacturing records are not made available to the public as they are proprietary records and are meant to capture all the key data related to the validated manufacturing process of a drug/vaccine/therapy. As such, if they were available to anyone, that process could potentially be replicated by competitors.  However, all inspection findings by the FDA and most regulatory bodies are published online and are available for anyone to see. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These BMRs are also available to auditors such as the FDA or whichever regulatory body is relevant in the country in which the drug is distributed so they can vouch that the processes are robust and being followed correctly. There are also internal quality audits in companies to ensure that operators are filling out the records correctly and accurately at the exact time an action is carried out. In the pharmaceutical industry, organizations must show that they are following GMP (good manufacturing practices) guidelines. Therefore, companies are under constant scrutiny to ensure the quality of not only the medicines they produce but also the data records generated when producing them. If they fail any of these at an audit they can face huge financial and operational sanctions so it's in their best interests to make sure everything is safe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every batch before it is released for use has to go through disposition where QA go through every document used in that batch with a fine tooth comb. Any issues are raised and have to be addressed before the batch can be released. Depending on the issue they find it could be a simple correction made in the doc by an operator or more serious issues are escalated and have to be impact assessed and investigated. If there's anything serious that could affect batch quality that can't be proven otherwise then that batch is ditched and never sees a patient. There are also so many samples taken throughout the manufacture and if any of these are out of spec then the batch is no good too</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>THanks for the follow up.  Its been 20+ years since I transferred out of GMP to R&amp;D and clearly my data retention policy isn't up to snuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This right here is actually where I started having problems with this process. It's not a mainstream view, sure, but just like how I don't like running proprietary code on my computer I've become weary of injecting proprietary substances into myself.</p>
<p>As a note I'm not trying to question the vaccine or say people shouldn't get it. I'm just not happy about not being able to know what's going on. Especially when it comes to my body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only does someone have to sign for each step. There must be a second person who has to sign that they verified the step was done. (aside from some small stuff like &quot;check the music is set to Bach&quot; (not a real example) which may be signed by only one person). Most of the record is double signed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this, some steps require checks by another person who is trained in whatever is happening at the time. These are usually critical steps which would lead to a lost batch if not done correctly. Other steps are witness steps. These are signed by an independent witness who isn't involved in the process. These are mostly witnessing raw material additions or something simple like taring a balance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even small tasks can require a witness if they are critical to the performance of the finished product. Something like a pH or conductivity test/adjust.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this falls under the same scrutiny as my job. I manufacture medical implants, and everything you said there rings true to me as well. Fda, or our customers, can check all of these documents at a moments notice. If I knowingly messed up a part and sent it though anyways, they'd know exactly who it was and it wouldn't end well for me.</p></div>		</li>
