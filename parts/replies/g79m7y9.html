			<div class="markdown"><p>A four or five-year-old girl had an allergic reaction during a mother's day brunch at the restaurant I worked at when I was a teenager. Her color turned quickly and she lost consciousness. She later died after being rushed to the hospital via ambulance. She was with her father and paternal grandmother that weekend who forgot she was allergic to strawberries.</p>
<p>Glad that's not too common. ::(</p></div>		</li>
