<p>Many terrestrial snails, such as a common garden snail (Cornu aspersum) have to fear water loss because of evaporation during dry weather. So they only touch the ground with parts of their foot sole and leave behind a discontinuous, seemingly dashed, slime trace. But of course they do not really hop around.</p></div>		</li>
