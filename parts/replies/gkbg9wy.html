			<div class="markdown"><p>Working as an EMT I came across many newly dead bodies and this holds up. The only time I saw dead people with closed eyes was if they died with their head below their center of gravity or of a hanging. In those situations the excess blood causes the eyelids to swell shut</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mortician friend confirms and said that heâ€™s never seen a person with their eyes closed unless there is some kind of outlier factor like a trauma that puffs up the face or, like you said, they were dead upside down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that's a pretty specific response given they're the two same qualifiers that the other dude mentioned yet there's about a dozen other reasons the eyes would be shut. How would the mortician know if they were upside down?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My older brother always makes fun of me (it's funny tho) for not having my eyes completely shut when I'm sleeping. He takes pictures of my face whenever he has the chance and shows them to me as soon as I wake up. I have big eyes and I thought it's all because my eyelids can't stretch to cover my eyes shut for 8 hrs. But, wow, thanks for this info. I've always felt insecure about my eyes when I'm asleep (credits to my horrible pics) so I always make sure that my eyes are covered with pillow/blanket before sleeping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, thank you. I actually had my thyroid checked last 2019 when my general physician and I were trying to figure out all the possible causes of my mental illness. The test results came back normal, fortunately. My mother used to have big eyes when she was my age so I guess it's all in the genes. I hope mine gets smaller as I age like hers did ðŸ˜…</p></div>		</li>
