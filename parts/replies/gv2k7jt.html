			<div class="markdown"><p>In the webseries, we’ve created a rubric that we use to grade the animals but this rubric is more used to evaluate that particular animal rather than compare animals. For example, one metric on our rubric is the ecological domain, e.g. cognitive abilities that would help an animal navigate challenges in it’s environment.</p>
<p>As you point out, animals have different needs/encounter different challenges meaning certain cognitive abilities that would benefit one species would not be beneficial to another (fish climbing a tree). There is debate as to whether intelligence evolves in general or whether certain cognitive abilities are “cherry picked” by evolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We went ahead and created our own metric for the show. Animals aren't easily compared to each other across species and definitely aren't compared to humans very well. Each species have different evolutionary/instinctual values and skills, will respond differently to different training and experimental conditions, and so on.</p>
<p>When it come to creating the show u/ecologistuntamed I got together and read paper after paper to try and categorize the different intelligence tests in use, and what areas of intelligence they might be attempting to probe. We took those tests and put them into four categories Awareness, Rational, Ecological, Social. Then we added an X-Factor category to adjust when a variable was over/under-represented in the research or if research simply hadn't been done!</p>
<p>From there I created this visual rubric (<a href="https://gph.is/g/apKvxjO" target="_blank"><a href="https://gph.is/g/apKvxjO" target="_blank">https://gph.is/g/apKvxjO</a></a>) and we were off! As experts in the field of animal intelligence caution against directly comparing the intelligence of animals across species (and sometimes even across experiments) this created metric lets us compare the <em>metric</em> across species, without directly comparing animals to one another. I hope that answers your question!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the metric you are grading them by? Intelligence comparable to a human, or a more centric view and rating their intelligence relative to what that animal needs to survive. The whole fish climbing a tree debate.</p>
