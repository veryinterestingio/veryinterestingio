			<div class="markdown"><p>After your wound scars it is actually still healing underneath for several months afterwords. Bio oil and silicone sheets/ointments keep new scars moisturized, and the sheets out small amount of pressure on the scar, helping new scars heal softer and flatter by promoting proper skin growth over collagen.</p>
<p>The more intense/professional scar treatments are Using cortisone injections to break down collagen, using lasers to break down collagen, or for certain types of scares using small needles to open up wounds in the scar tissue, which will heal over normally if the skin bed underneath is okay, because the wounds are small and shallow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not so much &quot;filler material,&quot; as it is fibrous tissue that is normally present in the area but the cells lack collagen and therefore are much less elastic. This is why in Brazil they sometimes use the skin of the tilapia fish on burns, the fish's skin has a lot of collagen in it and the regenerating tissue takes collagen from the fish skin directly, greatly reducing the scaring in burn victims. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-brazil-burns/brazilian-doctors-use-fish-skin-to-treat-burn-victims-idUSKBN18L1WH" target="_blank">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-brazil-burns/brazilian-doctors-use-fish-skin-to-treat-burn-victims-idUSKBN18L1WH</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I broadly applied it as filler tissue because I think it helps understanding it better. Skin does naturally have fibrous tissue but scars are also nonfunctional. They lack hair follicles, sweat glands and nerve ends. </p>
<p>Fibrosis “scarring” also happens in organs, muscles, etc</p></div>		</li>
