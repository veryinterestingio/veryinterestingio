<p>A fever is your body trying to burn out an invading disease/virus/bacteria. But sometimes it heats up so much it can damage your own organs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not always helpful, especially in an age when we have all sorts of modern medicines to help us get better faster. It can be painful and immobilizing - the latter, of course, being kind of the point but that was back when we didn't have things like steroid injections and antibiotics and bandage wraps and plaster casts.</p>
<p>And like a lot of responses, the body sometimes has difficulty regulating the appropriate amount of it. Fever is a similar example: a little fever is good to kill or disrupt viruses and bacteria. A lot of fever disrupts your own brain cells and can kill you. So we artificially regulate these things because we have better tools than all of the billions of years of our various ancestors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. </p>
<p>I used ice + vinegar soaked cloth on my sprained ankle, because it was advised to me to reduce the swelling. All of the swelling was gone the next day.  Was delighted to know this secret... I was dead wrong... that ankle never truly healed, I have a weak colapsed ankle now ~10 years later. No mather how much I train, the ligament is “gone”.</p>
<p>Thankfully I didn’t repeat this “great advice” with my other injuries.</p>
<p>Swelling is there for a reason. Unless totally out of control due to autoimune reactions or generally inflamed body (diet&amp;lifestyle), don’t try to reduce it too much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>THIS.  I had an ankle I always sprained horribly. RICE. Each time. I'd do it every year at least, it was my weak ankle.  I'd always roll it easily.  What RICE did was allow scar tissue to build up, breaking the mind/muscle connection.  I couldn't detect when my ankle would roll.  About 8 years ago I read about this and did an Ice/Heat alternating each minute for sets of 10.  I would stretch and use a band as much as I could without pain. Would also rub in mineral oil.  Instead of the normal 6 weeks on crutches, I was up in about a week and a half, and better yet, its never rolled since!  I can feel when its going to roll and I'll just call or lift it quick.  Its amazing how RICE gave people such long lasting weak areas.</p></div>		</li>

So far it hasn't been totally proven but studies have shown decrease in recovery time</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to hijack the top commentand say there's something called the hunters response which is when all the positive effects of ice actually reverse after 20 minutes of keeping it on. That's why you should never ice it for more than 20 minutes at a time.</p>
