<p>Map creators aren't really 'developers' as such, they are artists who have mastery in this particular craft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick correction, designers and artists are considered “developers” in the games industry. I think what you’re thinking about is “engineers” AKA the ones that specialize in programming.</p>
<p>“Game developer” is a catch all term that includes artists (which itself includes animators), designers, and engineers. Often dev-side QA as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an umbrella term as well as a specific term.  Inside the industry, we commonly use the term specifically, because everyone who works in the industry fits the broader definition.  Outside the industry, or in broader software parlance, the broader term is more appropriate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The designers generally block in the layout of a level and define what the major points of interest are, while the environment artists are left to decide what kind of environmental story they want the level to tell, such as &quot;who lived in this house? What kind of person were they and what were their interests?&quot; Of course, these levels go through several reviews with all the involved parties and the directors, where notes are given and can include stuff like &quot;can we get a bloodstain here?&quot; Or &quot;what 'motivates' this out-of-place element?&quot;, as well as general design and artistic crit, which helps to pull all the various elements together and scrap stuff that doesn't make sense. Artists have plenty of autonomy, but the directors have a major hand in defining the design and storytelling of the levels. Things like collectibles and whatnot are a separate thing entirely too and if it has text, then it probably comes from the writers, rather than the designers. Especially for something like GoW's or The Witcher's blurbs for every monster or pickup, that text comes from the writers. These again are also going to be heavily influenced by or need approval from the directors.</p></div>		</li>
