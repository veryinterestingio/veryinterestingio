			<div class="markdown"><p>And it wasn't just with the Greeks. One of the best bible quotes from somewhere between 593 - 565 BC highlights this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet she became more and more promiscuous as she recalled the days of her youth, when she was a prostitute in Egypt. There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>--Ezekiel <del>20</del> 23: 19 - 20</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you're saying that &quot;hung like a horse&quot; is actually a Biblical allusion!  We should be throwing it out like &quot;pearls before swine&quot; or &quot;prodigal son&quot; to show off how cultured and well-read we are!</p></div>		</li>

<p>19 I am the Lord your God; follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. 20 Keep my Sabbaths holy, that they may be a sign between us. Then you will know that I am the Lord your God.”</p></div>		</li>
