			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it actually has anything to do with the curvature of Earth. The lines appear to be converging in the first picture because you're viewing a 2D plane at an angle instead of top down like you would on a piece of paper. When looking at a 2D plane this way, even parallel lines will appear to be converging at a distance because of the perspective, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Pc-lens-demo-tiltedcamera.svg" target="_blank">like this</a> (from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt%E2%80%93shift_photography#Perspective-control_lenses" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt%E2%80%93shift\_photography#Perspective-control\_lenses" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt%E2%80%93shift\_photography#Perspective-control\_lenses</a></a>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is actually the root of the question OP is asking. When you represent the telescopes in 2D from an earthbound perspective the lines appear to converge. In a real life scenario you could actually measure the angle of the telescopes relative to the horizon on earth and they would be pointing towards each other, thus appearing to converge. Itâ€™s the 3D version of forced perspective because the world appears flat from an observer in the ground. </p>
<p>In the sun scenario I talked about if you placed the telescopes directly next to each other and pointed them at opposite sides of the sun you could actually see the divergence. If the earth truly was flat and you were 1000 miles apart the telescopes would still have measurable angles which diverge even from an earthly perspective. The appearance of convergence when the telescopes are placed at a distance is due to the curvature of the earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, I see what you're saying. I answered OP's question originally on r/NoStupidQuestions, but I never thought of the 2D trapezoid shape we're dealing with here as having a curved base on earth.</p>
<p>To me I think it makes more sense to use a straight line between the two telescopes (that would go through the ground) as the base instead of following along the curvature of the earth. So essentially if we were to place the two telescopes on north and south pole. The base on earth's side would be the spin axis.</p>
<p>But now I get that if we use cardinal direction on earth to talk about the situation then the telescopes can be pointing directly towards each other.</p>
<p>Though I think the root of OP's question (based on the phrasing in the title) is more of the apparent triangle shape that appears in the first picture. In your field of view, the two telescopes are apparently far apart, while the distant star is almost a single point. If you connect the dots, you get a triangle. That's why I think the solution to the &quot;paradox&quot; of the first picture lies in the perspective distortion mentioned earlier.</p></div>		</li>
