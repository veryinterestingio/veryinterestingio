			<div class="markdown"><p>Slight clarification, our ears do not perform Fourier decomposition. The cochlea directly senses sound in the frequency domain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The spiral shape of the cochlea allows for differing frequencies to stimulate specific areas along the spiral. This results in a tonotopic map that enables people to perceive various frequencies of sound.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, there is this binaural beats phenomenon. If you play a sine wave at f1 in one ear and f2 in the other, the signals are integrated by your brain, and you perceive something resembling the beats effect that you could perceive with only one ear. I need an adult (or a neurologist) to explain why this happens; is this a fancy physics simulation in our brains developed by evolution?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is still fourier decomposition. The incoming waves are all mixed together at the start and the ear seperates them geographically with its shape. I wouldn't call it directly sensing in the frequency domain. If you want to highlight that it doesn't really have to &quot;do a lot of work&quot; so to speak, then you might say that the ear preforms fourier decomposition passively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Disclaimer: not a signal processing person.</p>
<p>I thought that &quot;Fourier decomposition&quot; implies the input is a time series of amplitudes, and the output is something like frequency vs intensity. Is it a more general term, applying to functions that map something to the frequency domain?</p>
<p>I made that nitpicky point just to emphasize that your ears are not like a computer microphone, and your brain does not contain a Fourier transform circuit (Or does it? See binaural beats.).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer, I really don't understand why so many people think that lightwaves to not produce interferences. Look at the (Nobel prize winning) frequency comb for an actual application of this effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Becuase he asks if it makes visible light! the fact of the matter is that UV and infrared photons will stay UV and Infrared even when superimposed, and the light will not be visible, nor will photons of visible energy exist</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did you read about the frequency comb? You get beat frequencies and everything. You would get visible light, but you'd need to get the frequencies of the lasers absolutely correct. What happens in the particle picture is a different question.</p>
<p>Also take a look at the Michelson-Morley experiment.</p></div>		</li>
