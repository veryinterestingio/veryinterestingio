<p>Buy Eneloops, and the premise of the question disappears.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So that's why batteries I charged in April are seen by the charger as almost dead? I thought they were just shit brands, even though they're recognized brands.</p>
<p>I've mostly been in a work environment where there was a charged pile an discharged pile for kb and mouse batteries. At home, I've always had just enough batteries to run what I had, and charged when needed. I bought a few packs to always have charged batteries ready to go, but I always seemed to have to charge them again months later.</p>
<p>Did I waste my money with trying to have &quot;spare&quot; sets, and I just need to recharge batteries as needed and immediately reuse? I really only need them for my camera, a few misc occasional use items, and several wall clocks and remotes (which I apparently learned that they are not good to use for the latter two).</p>
<p>Should I give the extras away, and just keep what I need for each device, or can I keep extras on hand, and rotate them in the charging cycle for longevity across all batteries?</p>
<p>edit: I guess I should disclose brands, in case it matters. I've a few Duracells, a few more Energizers, and a lot of EBLs.</p>
<p>Another edit: Are rechargeables OK to charge and leave sit to discharge themselves, and stay in that low state? And/or once I discharge them through use, can they sit discharged for months without damage?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this mean Eneloops are good for LED candles?</p>
<p>My LED candles require 2 AA batteries each.  When the alkaline batteries are near needing to be replaced, the light level is very low.  I see a similar effect in my LED headlamps, where I use lithium AAA batteries.  I would much prefer a lower light output from the get go, in exchange for candles with longer life.  I went through a lot of alkalines!</p>
<p>I used to have NiMH before I got the candles, but they ceased to hold a functional charge &amp; were taken to battery disposal/recycling/whatever Best Buy does with them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A better brand may mean your rechargeable batteries last longer but the capacity of a NiMH battery will always be substantially less than an alkaline battery. So I doubt this will give you a longer life, but not throwing hundreds of batteries away is probably a strong point in NiMH's favour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I failed to write that, but I would be OK with the shorter life in exchange for not going through hundreds of alkaline batteries :-D</p>
<p>The NiMH I had were well used, so needed recharging far too often to make them suitable for candle use.</p></div>		</li>
