			<div class="markdown"><p>No because scale isn't the metal it's an oxide.</p>
<p>I guess it could be re-used as iron oxide, which is used in colorings and dyes, explosives and I'm sure other things, but not as steel/iron.</p>
<p>Iron oxide is so plentiful and generally unwanted I don't think people generally bother to reuse it. The plant I work in pickles the scale off and it's disposed of as waste when they recycle the acid.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A lot of the other answers aren't exactly wrong, but not wholly correct either. This is both simple and 100% correct.</p>
<p>Nice job!</p></div>		</li>
