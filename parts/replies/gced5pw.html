			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not. If anything they will disperse more. There are a lot of reasons to have multiple locations that including backup security, electricity costs, and network performance. The advantages of single large locations drop off pretty fast past a certain size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More importantly, outages and distribution. Companies deliberately duplicate and distribute content in multiple datacenters across the world so if one goes down, the impact is limited, and for faster delivery. If there was one data center, and it got hurricane'd or there was a power outage, the entire internet would be gone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not.  I would guess that the addition of new videos to YouTube outpaces the increases in storage capacity technology, and will probably continue to do so.</p>
<p>Gut feeling, no actual knowledge to back it up though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you have a point. not only are there more videos being uploaded, every video is getting larger as people get access to higher resolution. a 10 minute video in 4k is like double the size of the  same video in 1080p</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the same way and reason theres not only one supermarket; Logistics and competition I suppose. </p>
<p>Companies would benefit more in having way more datacenters in the cheapest most efficient format because internet due to physics has limitations and lag is not fun</p></div>		</li>
