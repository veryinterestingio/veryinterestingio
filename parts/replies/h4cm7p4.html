<p>As a non-hunter I've always been skeptical of how much of an effect the camo has at all. I spend a lot of time hiking and recreating in the woods and I often come across deer, turkey, grouse, quail, etc. I'm dressed in plain clothes, moving around, not being purposefully quiet. And more often than not these animals don't bail the instant they detect my presence, only when I start closing distance on them. It's not uncommon for me to be within a rifle's killing range, probably a shotgun too (I don't know what the ideal range is for taking birds, I'm unfamiliar with long-barreled hunting shotguns and chokes and such... 30-40 yards seems reasonable?). Maybe hunters should just ditch the camo altogether and don some comfy hiking clothes and just act non-chalant!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a hunter and a recreational hiker, I know what you talking about. Unfortunately it's not that easy. Most of the year animals are pretty chill about humans as long as we aren't being aggressive or showing to much interest in them. They'll keep an eye on us but we mind our business, they mind their business.</p>
<p>Hunting season is a different story. Within a week of opening day most animals know they're being hunted. Most are on high alert and adjust the daily routine to minimize encounters. I have personally walked up to some turkeys of season within 30ft. During hunting season they bolted after seeing me 100 yards out.</p>
<p>There's also all the animals you don't see. They see it hear you first so they freeze up or lower to the ground. Running is biologically expensive, so not being seen is the first line of defense. Camo gives the little extra edge to hopefully allow us to detect them before they detect us. When that happens the animal thinks it's safe and will freely move around. We are good at seeing movement, but a buck in brush that froze up? Surprisedly significant chance you'll walk by without noticing.</p>
<p>Also for the shotgun question, that's like the max range I would push it for upland birds. Waterfowl hunters tend to shoot a bit farther.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ha interesting thought!</p>
<p>In addition to what the other commenter mentioned though, I'd also point out that animals living around trails, campgrounds, and other outdoor rec areas are affected by three things. First, they are simply more used to human presence than those animals living deeper in the woods where hunting takes place. They are acclimatized to the sights, sounds, and smells of people, even if they still don't want you too close. Second, there are some pretty universal laws about minimum distance from trails and campgrounds hunting activities are limited by. Animals close to these areas just aren't hunted. This is doubly true if in a protected area that prohibits hunting altogether. Finally, probably least important, their natural predators tend to avoid human activity, making the area even safer for foraging and the animals less alert.</p>
<p>All these things together lead to local wildlife being a bit less skittish than that you might encounter deep in the backwoods if you're hunting.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How much of the effect is obscuring the human's silhouette, making the human hard to identify, rather than making the human truly &quot;blend in?&quot;</p></div>		</li>
