<p>There’s no real way to Eli5 here, at least in my opinion, you actually need to understand the math before hand</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, the question itself supposes the asker understands what logs and square roots are to start with. Most five year olds are still grappling with basic arithmetic. A true ELI5 would be along the lines of &quot;Okay, we're about to cover your next twelve years of maths education in one post. Hang on to your hats.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for going through this in more detail. A lot of the answers were &quot;because it's an approximation&quot; but this gives an idea as to how it was formed. Also, I hadn't realized how bad my recollection of log and exponent rules had got so it's good to know that I should practice this stuff more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bruh, I'm with you on that. Just about everyone I knew hated calc 2 in college, but I loved it because of Taylor series and all that. It felt like learning that unlocked the secrets of the fuckin universe, I don't understand how more people didn't get how awesome it is!</p></div>		</li>
