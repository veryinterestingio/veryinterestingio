<p>It's very relevant. In fact, that's the reason we were able to eradicate smallpox - because there is no reservoir species. We can't hope to eradicate pathogens with reservoir species - because normal human interventions like vaccination and quarantine are not feasible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s absolutely irrelevant to the question. Yes, it’s relevant to whether the disease can be extirpated through vaccination or other control. No, it has nothing to do with why rabies persists in spite of rapidly killing its hosts - which is what the question asks. </p>
<p>In any case, asymptomatic infection is almost unheard of, even in bats, so any arguments based on that claim are both irrelevant and misfounded. (The argument about asymptomatic infection in bats is based mainly on the presence of anti-rabies antibodies in some South American bats, and those studies failed to control for bat lyssaviruses related to rabies, which are known to be widespread in South American bats and to lead to cross-reactive antibodies to rabies.) (There’s better evidence for asymptomatic, or at least survivable, rabies infection in hyenas, but I assume you’re not making the claim that hyenas are a major source of rabies in North America.)</p></div>		</li>
