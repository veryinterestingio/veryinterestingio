<p>though we do have some symmetry in many organs,  kidneys, lungs, brain reproductive organs.</p>
<p>the stomach and intestines are kinda crumpled versions of the original worm tube.  </p>
<p>The heart is kinda symmetrical but obviously needs some asymmetry simply to function. not sure what the story is with the liver, gall bladder and pancreas. guess mostly we only needed one of them and they had to go somewhere in the cavity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you should vision the ‘random’ organs as ‘bus stops’ along a straight street. Like in the worm. Even though the stops are technically on one side of the street or the other if you mapped it out it’s just hashes on a line, symmetrical. But over time things grew larger and the ‘worm’ compressed upon itself a bit. The straight street meandered a bit throwing the symmetry of the single organs off. The paired organs can always balance themselves but the gaps left by single organs were filled by intestines or other organs to balance the body.</p></div>		</li>
