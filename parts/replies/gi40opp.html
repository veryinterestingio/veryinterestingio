<p>In the day, the TV is blasting in the other room, the neighbors are living their lives outside, cars pass regularly. The noises more or less cancelled each other out. And more importantly there are no sudden nor surprising noises.</p>
<p>At night, when everything is quiet, when there's just the hum of the fridge and the tic tac of the clock, every noise is a sudden noise.</p></div>		</li>
