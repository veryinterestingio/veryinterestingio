			<div class="markdown"><p>For a pinyin dictionary? Yes, just roman letters. Tones are noted by 1-4 numbers.</p>
<p>jia1 [家] for example is jiā.</p>
<p>Personally, I prefer stroke and radical dictionaries for Kanji (Chinese characters imported into Japanese).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The stroke/radical system is pronunciation-independant, so it's better for a Japanese kanji dictionary. In a Chinese dictionary aimed at Mandarin speakers, the pinyin system makes more sense than it otherwise would. Also, even a pinyin-sorted dictionary would have a radical index in case you don't know the character's pronunciation.</p></div>		</li>
