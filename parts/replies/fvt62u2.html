			<div class="markdown"><p>A knew a girl sold mechanical watches and high end leather wallets and belts, Gucci level belts, watches likely $500-$2500ish. Not cheap at all but not Rolex either. She said large chunk of sales were just dudes working high pay jobs that were also high stress and lots of travel and they always work long hours so the times between flights is a time they are forced to slow down and actually maybe observe the world around them. Suddenly they realize the slick mechanical timepiece they’ve admired on their boss is right there or the Gucci belt their wife has always hinted would really round out his good suits is for sale 3 metres to their left. These shops are offering items to people who are too busy to search them out but definitely do want them. It’s a weird intersection of a customer who can afford the item but not someone we’d call stinking rich, per se, but definitely someone who, once they decided they wanted a watch today, wouldn’t be trying to determine if the price listed was lower elsewhere. They would just purchase the one they wanted knowing full well they wouldn’t make time to go shopping for watches anytime soon, if ever, so it’s today or never. She’d get a lot of guys who’d say they’ve been wanting a watch since university but just can’t find the time to go watch shopping and now here they are with time to kill.
So it’s like you say in your comment, they had something there you wanted so you bought it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly my shoes are roughly $500 anyway. I fly heaps for work. Shoes are a consumable, I wouldn't even blink buying shoes at an airport. I love airport shopping - less people shipping for fun and in my way. Better customer service. Also - I'm bored anyway and have time to kill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm tired all the time and I'm probably a lot older than you. I also went to uni for a bajillion years and was sooooo pooor during that time (no$ from parents)
My $100 shoes wear out too fast, so I have to spend $500. My worn out shoes ($100, 3 months old) got me some snide comments I overheard at work once. &quot;Is jaja not coping with life? Look at those shoes&quot;. I don't have time to shop.
My $400-600 shoes last for fucking ever and are so comfortable. Totally worth it for me</p></div>		</li>

<p>It’s one of my favorite places to be and I try to be there three hours before my flight departs</p></div>		</li>
