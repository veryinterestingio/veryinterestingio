			<div class="markdown"><p>And some trackers are just plain terrible at it. I'm a restless sleeper, and when I used to use a fitbit, it was decent at differentiating between deep and light sleep vs. awake times.
My current tracker, a Garmin something, can't tell that I'm lying awake in bed trying to sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are sensitivity settings that you tweak when you start using it. Mine has me confirm the times it guesses each morning and it learns from that. We run into issues still when I’m reading a good book because I get super relaxed and don’t move, but otherwise it’s pretty accurate now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have the same issue, but only in the morning. It almost always nails my fall-asleep time (as best as I am aware), but when I am reading or on my phone in the morning, it thinks I’m still asleep. Apparently my heart rate doesn’t go up to even my awake-resting level until I actually get out of bed. This actually tracks with some other things I’ve measured over the years, like when I tracked BBT, as well as things like hunger pangs and bathroom needs. </p>
<p>The most useful thing mine does though is tell me when my sleep heart rate was elevated. This can be an important early indicator of illness so it’s important to know! So far though the two times I’ve gotten this notification, the culprit was the amount of alcohol consumed the night before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember that I went to ER one night because I got stung by a scorpion, they hooked me up to a monitor. It was late so I tried to go to sleep but every time I would doze off my heart rate would go below 50 and the machine would beep loudly, which subsequently woke me up. Was really fun.</p></div>		</li>
