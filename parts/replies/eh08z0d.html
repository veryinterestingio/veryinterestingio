			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this imply that, if we had four or more types of color receptors, the configuration of our color spectrum would have to be something more complicated? It seems that the three color components kinda form a triangle which is sort of a distorted ring. But if we had four types of color receptors, would we need a sort of tetrahedral geometry for our color spectrum?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but it isn't really as cool as it sounds. The short version is that they have a much faster, and lower energy cost method of processing color in the brain, but the tradeoff is it's pretty rudimentary. We have 3 cones and our brain combines the input, the mantis shrimp's brain doesn't do that, they can only see the specific wavelengths associated with each if their cones, and not all, but most of their cones fall within the visible color spectrum. However, when it comes to depth perception, their eyes are truly amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a physical issue. Different colors of light have different physical wavelengths.
Our receptors for color are only stimulated by certain wavelengths of light.
Just because your eyes are little biological cameras doesn’t mean physics isn’t highly involved. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>But that's just the thing. I distinctly remember primary and secondary light colors being presented as a physics concept - probably as an extension of prismatic refraction. But you are correct: yellow corresponds to a specific wavelength and there is a specific wavelength that is &quot;yellow&quot;. There's no mixing of green and magenta there, and in fact there's nothing about the physics of EM radiation that even hints at a concept like &quot;secondary&quot;. The fact that a mix of green and magenta looks yellow is because it happens to stimulate the color receptors in our retinas in the same way as pure yellow - a biological issue that really doesn't have more than a descriptive basis in physics.</p>
<p>Same issue in a different way: What is it about magenta, cyan, and green that make them &quot;primary&quot;. Nothing that EM physics alone can explain, because they are just 3 arbitrary points on a smoothly continuous spectrum of frequencies. The only thing making them primary is that our three varieties of cone cells are tuned to those three particular wavelengths.</p>
<p>All of which goes back to OP's question. Although the spectrum is linear, a color wheel is circular and puts high wavelengths (violet) adjacent to low wavelengths (red). The linear nature of the EM spectrum suggests those two next to each other should be a strong contrast. That doesn't happen because a color wheel isn't mapping the EM spectrum, but rather the patterns and combinations in which our cones get stimulated by different wavelengths along the spectrum. Sure physics is intimately involved, but there's a lot of stuff here that is biological in origin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but color perception requires both sides (physics and biology/perception)... I mean, if you want to be reductive, you could just frame it all as physicalist phenomena, but it's not particularly helpful and instructive to helping us truly understand the phenomena - just as the point of the guy you're replying to - it's not that helpful to <em>only</em> characterize it as a lightwave length phenomenon.</p>
<p>What they don't teach you about color/lights in highschool (or at least not mine) is that people can have a dramatically different perception of colors based on their color receptors - i.e. color blinds and tetrachromats (people with 4 different color sensitive cone types) exist and will be able to see things differently. Bees can see into the UV wavelength.</p>
<p>Even among normal humans - the number of color sensitive cells can vary in proportion, and over time as they age.</p>
<p>Suffice to say - colors are the perception that result from light of different wavelengths striking our color sensitive cone cells - and aren't necessarily representative of reality... anymore than the ability to see only one side of something at a time means that the occluded backside of the object stops existing.</p>
<p>But to be fair... this is more a symptom of the way modern education divides education into strict tranches of knowledge - you get less cross-pollination of information between, and it becomes something that an individual has to seek out themselves (and in most cases fail to do so).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the complicated reality is that it's both. I do agree with you, though, that in primary school it should be taught as a biological effect, and only <em>later</em> be intertwined with the underlying concepts of photon wavelength/frequency. How a mantis shrimp sees in eighteen primarily colours will be relatively easily understood as well.</p></div>		</li>
