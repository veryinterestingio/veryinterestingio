			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition, humans evolved to find symmetry attractive in people because it implies good health. We grew to find symmetry attractive in other things, as well.</p>
<p>Edit: Just want to mention that this inclination towards symmetry didn't develop in humans; rather, it developed long before humans existed. I mistakenly worded my comment in a manner that suggested otherwise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this, symmetry is not just a quirk of good genetics... it is a sign of well functioning biological system.</p>
<p>Your body doesn't have DNA coded for &quot;right cheek&quot; and &quot;left cheek&quot; its a general alignment of structures it was coded to produce. Symmetry represents not only desirable genes for, say, bone structure, but also desirable genes (as well as good overall health) that allows the system to produce the same effects twice. </p>
<p>Incredibly precise abilities to replicate bone structures of cheeks is quite impressive, from a genetic engineering point of view. &quot;Average&quot; levels of symmetry are not a sign of concern (although not a point of attraction, either), while dramatically uneven amounts of asymmetry indicates poor genetic function, terrible nourishment/development or severe injury, none of which are good predictors of reproduction and proper mate selection.</p>
<p>All in all, symmetry and the Golden Ratio is what catches our eye and it has good reasons, at all species, for doing so. Creatures that have genes that create proportions for the Ratio are genetically capable of the precision involved, which speaks volumes for their ability to also have high degree of functions at the cellular level. This is true of predators, prey, pets or mates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is the only reply in this whole post that touches on WHY symmetry is attractive.  Others have said its a sign of good health or genetics but they haven’t noticed why.</p>
<p>Symmetry is one sign of good health because producing the same structure twice is a check on the process. If your body can accurately produce a left eye and a right eye that are identical, that means the development process is working properly. Asymmetrical features mean you can’t be sure which is the “correct” eye, as one or both of them developed with “errors”. Symmetrical features allow one to confirm that the feature was produced correctly because it was done the exact same way twice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think symmetry can also imply good health in many of the things we eat.  Not sure how well that translates to more nutritious food or absence of diseases or parasites, but I can't imagine it hurt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps. But a lot of the foods we eat have been modified by humans for thousands of years. For example: a perfectly symmetrical, uniformly red roma tomato. It may trigger some evolutionary trait in us that makes us think it’s healthy and disease free. Whereas <a href="https://www.smartseedstore.com/products/tims-black-ruffle-heirloom-tomato" target="_blank">this monstrosity </a> might illicit a negative response. </p></div>		</li>
