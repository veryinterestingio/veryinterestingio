			<div class="markdown"><p>God I wish people on Teams meetings would keep this in mind and use headphones instead of those shitty overpriced &quot;sound bars&quot; where the speaker and mic are literally 1 inch apart.  Those things are almost guaranteed to blame for most of the echo you hear on a call.  I cringe every time somebody says &quot;hey I just got a new sound bar!&quot;.   It's like motherfucker, you have just doomed us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect anything other than a headset causes this problem, unless there no lag on the network. </p>
<p>My ex-boss's iPad would echo irrespective of the network he was on though. I would take my headphones off when I talked, just so I didn't hear myself on delay. </p>
<p>I rarely use Teams, but Google Meet takes a second or two to automatically cancel out the lag (not that it helps, it's easier for the looping device to stay muted).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do. When you spend a shitton of time in meetings and shit it's about a bazillion times more comfortable. And frankly, I just find it looks and feels a lot more professional and natural.</p>
<p>Buuut</p>
<p>So all the audio from my voice apps is routed through a virtual audio cable into a processing app which runs a super-aggressive compressor (volume normalizer) over that audio, that's then piped out to my cheap bookshelf speakers on my desk.</p>
<p>This solves for the problem of having to crank your volume up because there's one dude trying to talk through a cardboard tube ten feet away from his microphone, and then half the rest of the people on the call being loud as shit. So all the audio coming out of my speakers is a reasonable, consistent volume regardless of what other people are doing.</p>
<p>My microphone's a supercardoid, so it's highly directional. It's facing away from my speakers so that already cancels a good chunk of what they could pick up from the speakers. It's on a boom so I can get it close-ish to my face, and has a shock mount so tapping on my desk/typing/etc isn't picked up directly by the microphone.</p>
<p>That's then run through a pretty damn amazing noise filter (RNNoise), and then through a noise gate. The noise gate alone basically solves the problem since I've physically got myself a high enough SNR (more than 30dB) I can separate the signal from noise, but the noise suppression is there for all the other noise and to mask any noise while I'm talking (like typing, my dog walking across the hard floor, etc).</p>
<p>The microphone is less than 10&quot; away from my face, but my camera is facing kinda angled across my desk at a 45 degree angle and cropped so I'm about 1/3 of the way into the side of the frame but the microphone and everything else isn't. Just me against a wall.</p>
<p>It's friggin' flawless. I've had my dog sit two feet away from me and whine and bark or run around the room throwing a cow femur up in the air and letting it hit the floor, my kid banging on the roof over my head, wife yelling down the stairs at me to ask if I'm still in a meeting (?!), etc. Nothing.</p>
<p>It took a couple weeks of watching my voice indicator like a hawk and tuning and tweaking, but now none of it comes through but it picks me up when talking at a lower than normal speaking volume perfectly clearly.</p>
<p>But yeah, if it's acceptable for you to be using speakers in a voice call you'll <em>know</em>. Otherwise put on some damn headphones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly how I sound using a speech jammer app on my phone! I'll try to say &quot;Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers&quot; and the way I say Peter Piper sounds like I'm drunk as hell then when I get to the first pickle I can't stop saying pickle over and over. I showed it to my family and we had the time of our lives for about an hour trying to say tongue twisters. Interestingly it affects people very differently. My girlfriend can talk just fine no matter how much I refine the delay but with me my brain turns to mush</p>
<p>edit: I actually made a recording of me trying to say it</p>

<p>Don't mind the creepy recording after it. My brother suffers from severe sleep paralysis and I recorded him literally begging for me to wake him up in his sleep without his lips moving to document how crazy it can get for some people. He has done a lot of terrible things in his youth (former gangbanger) and says demons taunt him every night for the stuff he's done</p></div>		</li>

<p>I can be immune to the effects of a speech jammer if I focus on what I'm actually saying and kinda &quot;close&quot; my ears and ignore what I'm hearing back. It's possible she's just doing that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Um, no, I'm definitely not going to ignore that. Did you wake him up? Does that work? How? Does he remember you just recording him and not helping him out?</p></div>		</li>
