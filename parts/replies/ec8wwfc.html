			<div class="markdown"><p>I started chewing mastic gum every day for about 3-4 hours straight to chisel my jaw more. I already have a good jawline, but I just want more of a chiseled look. My jaw muscles get fatigued and sore so I guess it's working? I started growing a beard at the same time so I can't really see the progress. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be careful about something like that... Your TMJ has a cartilage disc in the joint that can get worn out, resulting in chronic pain, and even episodes of &quot;lockjaw&quot; dislocations.  If you already have a good looking jaw line, why not be happy with it and work on something else?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indirect work can do a lot. Since going to the gym, my neck has really thickened out even though I don't do anything specific to it. I think it's because I have the habit of flexing my neck really hard when doing any exercise, especially big compound ones like deadlift. I think the answer to someone who wants a bigger jaw is just to do more compound work.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think this sounds a bit misleading. The traps are a back muscle that can contribute a bit to neck size. There’s muscles in the neck that people target when they want to grow their neck, but those don’t grow much from most typical exercises.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes sense that your neck has thickened out, but I also would expect that it wont continue to grow at such a rate. When you started going to the gym, that was a very new exercise for your neck, but now it has built up the muscle and endurance to handle your workout better, and I'd expect it to slow down in growth considerably.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A 1 rep max, a movement done at maximum effort and for which you can only lift it once before you are totally gassed, is the most specific to building strength. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus may be a dumb question but, to build strength you have to have a full movement of the muscle? </p>
<p>So chewing increasingly tough chunks of rubber would be better bite strength training than buying down as hard as you can on a chunk of wood that has no give? </p>
<p>Why is that? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Easy to overlook factor isn't so much the toughness of the food, but the leverage.</p>
<p>Biting through something thicker and less tough may be harder than something thinner and more tough, as your jaw mechanically isn't optimized for the large bite motion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot of evidence showing a longer effective range of motion is better for building more muscle and strength, and would ensure all muscles involved in chewing get trained. So actually moving the mandibular joint is better than just contracting really hard. It doesn't necessarily make a muscle stronger, which I should have clarified, it makes the movement stronger. So technically, a stronger masseter doesn't mean a stronger bite, because all the other tissues and muscles need to be able to support that biting force too.</p>
<p>It would ensure that all the relevant muscles and connective tissues get worked adequately essentially, which is why full ROM in strength building, injury prevention, longevity of joints etc.</p>
<p>Also chewing a piece of wood would likely be too tough and subject to splintering. This is likely too risky to be considered viable. It would be useful to maybe occasionally chew down on a tough, incompressible non splintering substance, which would build strength as an adjunct to the full repetitions. This could help overload some of the muscles that might not get a full amount of work done by regular reps because they are quite a bit stronger than the others surrounding it.</p>
<p>This is also a technique used in the strength training world called isometric holds. To build a good squat, some lifters just stand up with a much heavier than 1rm squat on their back and hold for say 10 seconds. But this would always be secondary to full range of motion squats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is highly controversial but to add to this, I've heard of some experts recommending to train the lower back over a certain range. Most people never do more than isometric training, which is what the vast majority of people recommend.</p>
<p>But I find it makes a lot of sense to train the back in a rounded position. It is inevitable that one will find themselves with a rounded back lifting something from the ground, shoveling, or tying their shoes. If you have no strength in that position, it makes sense you'd be more prone to injuries.</p></div>		</li>
