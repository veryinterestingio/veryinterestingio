			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the more famous cases is that of 'Kuru' among the cannibalistic Fore people of eastern Papua New Guinea which was rampant in the mid-1900's. The means of transmission was from 'transumption' or the eating of deceased relatives as a ritualistic way of honoring their dead loved ones. Interestingly, while the men mostly ate the muscle tissues, women and children ate the brain hence aquiring the disease much more commonly leading to the death of disproportionately more females, sometimes making 1:3 females to males.</p>
<p>The practice was heavily discouraged by the Australian's which lead to the prion disease's eventual decline.</p></div>		</li>
