			<div class="markdown"><p>I always assumed they could move the internals around a bit so the plug would sit above/down far enough to access the other plug, but they just didn't want you using another plug for whatever reason. Is there merit to this or is it just manufactured without taking the other plug into consideration?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the latter. If they displaced the components vertically relative to the socket, well there's an issue right away: suddenly you need &quot;top&quot; and &quot;bottom&quot; oriented <em>plugs,</em> because if you plug something displaced below the socket into the top socket, well you've just blocked off the bottom socket super thoroughly.</p>
<p>You could displace it left and right, but then you have an issue with small spaces.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not trying to be irritating or anything but their socket antics have bothered me for decades it just wasn't something I really thought about until I saw it on Reddit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>what about putting the converter inline with the power cable itself? Like 5in of high gauge AC cord, then tiny converter box, then 6ft of DC cord?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that doesn't even slightly explain why you'd offset the transformer up and design one with little plastic wings such that it covers all four potentially adjacent spots (and where shifting it about 5mm in any direction would fix this).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Shouldn't cost much at all, just a little soldering.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That space can be built into the device (making it larger and outputting more heat)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That also means you need to deal with electrical certification requirements yourself rather than just buying wall warts from someone who has already done that work.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is especially of great benefit to smaller manufacturers who would never be able to design, build and have certified power supplies for all the necessary regions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And here is the most right answer. Dealing with high voltage certifications inside your iPhone would be ridiculous and impossible given the form factor phones have nowadays. Putting it in the charger makes sense but takes up space</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's talking about &quot;wall wart&quot; power supplies.  You need a physically large circuit to convert 110 V to the 5 V that your phone or tablet can handle.  If you put the power adapter inside the phone then the phone has to be much bigger both to contain the circuit and to have a plug socket that can take 110V.  So you want the adapter to be separate and somewhere between the wall and the phone.  The alternatives are: at the wall end (with the plug prongs sticking right out of the case), at the phone end (docking station) or somewhere in the middle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The power coming out of wall sockets is higher voltage. This is good for powerful loads like space heaters, kitchen appliances, vacuum cleaners etc.</p>
<p>But things like cellphones, laptops, radios, and other electronics need a low voltage, safe supply.</p>
<p>You need a converter between the two. You can put this in the appliance, but they're quite big so this might not fit. It's also really important that they're safe, so it's easier to use one that's already certified safe than to make your own and pay to get that certified. DVD players, TVs, and other larger appliances usually do this because they make lots of them and there's lots of room inside.</p>
<p>The cheapest way is to put that bulky converter in the plug. It makes your plug bigger, but that's generally OK.</p>
<p>If the converter needs to be too big for a plug, you can put them in the middle of the cable like most laptop chargers, but that's annoying and costs more because now you need two cables.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Side question: any idea what the hard plastic cylinder is on some power cords usually located about an inch or two before they plug into the machine?  Its on laptops and other electronics.  It's about the size of stack of about 25 pennies, but hard black plastic, and the power cord runs straight through the middle of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two types of electricity, steady and wobbly. We get strong wobbly into our house. The stuff that need steady electricity need to change the wobbly into steady itself along with making it not so strong so we have the square plastic bit with stuff inside to so it for us.</p></div>		</li>
