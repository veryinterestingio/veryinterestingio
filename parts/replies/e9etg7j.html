			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't underestimate how easy higher life forms are to manipulate. Take rabies, for instance, one common symptom of rabies is hydrophobia, a fear of water. Which sounds like a complex behavioural change but it's really just the result of the fact that rabies causes extremely painful throat contractions that make it impossible to swallow while also causing excessive saliva production.</p>
<p>The disease makes mammals irrational while liquids cause them extreme pain, which results in a fear of liquids.</p>
<p>Or look at how easily alcohol makes us more impulsive. Fatigue makes us more irritable. Extreme deprivations like famine can make us far more violent in the pursuit of our needs. Our behaviour is extremely malleable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Impact on humans is debated.</p>
<p>It does seem to be correlated with entrepreneurial behavior for example and a few IQ points loss (relative to demographic controls).</p>
<p>Nothing clear though as I understand.</p></div>		</li>
