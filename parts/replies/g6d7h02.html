			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to mention the pizza example. ;-)</p>
<p>To add: often times restaurants/venues have cooking setups which aren't easily replicated at home, or take too much effort, which improve or change flavor and texture. That's sometimes what you're paying for. A few obvious ones are deep-frying, smoking and movie theater popcorn. Oh, and pizza!</p></div>		</li>

<p>A pot, oil and spider/tongs is all you really need.</p>

<p>You can buy movie theater popcorn seasoning. It is called Flavacol put it in with your oil and cook any way other than air popper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, many deep fry at home, but in my experience it's generally more work and mess than the average person wants to invest.</p>
<p>As for popcorn, you're leaving out theater oils like red palm, using very fresh kernels and using ghee as the butter topping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup pizza ovens at restaurants tend to be around 700-800 degrees Fahrenheit. That’s part of the reason people struggle to make pizza at home that replicates a pizza from a pizzeria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only difference between movie theatre popcorn and regular popcorn is the butter salt. Honestly depending on the chain, you should be able to go to your local theatre and just ask for a little plastic container of butter salt and they’ll just give it to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to add a few more examples:</p>
<p>Chinese cooking with a wok goes up to 700 F. Wok cooking was developed over 1000+ years with wood stoves that are difficult to control the temperature outside of blasting heat.</p>
<p>On the other hand, many indian curries were developed over 1000+ with no good heat source other than a low open flame.</p></div>		</li>
