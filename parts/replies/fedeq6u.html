<p>As far as the empty space in an SSD case, how does this scale with the capacity of the drive? For example, is a 500gb SSD twice as large(internally) as a 250gb drive? Or do you get more efficient as the capacity increases?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering how small these memory chips are, you will barely notice any difference inside the casing. They simply either pack more chips in the same board or just use higher capacity chips. A 1TB SSD doesn't look much different to a 128GB one since they have managed to squeeze more capacity into a single chip.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So it sounds like most of the size is on the supplementary side. Like all of the connectors and “piping” in and out. </p>
<p>SSD’s really are a leap forward. I can definitely see them being a staple of computers for a long time with how efficient and stable they are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>M.2 drives are not necessarily faster, there's three things that are different about newer SSDs which you're lumping together. Form factor: 2.5&quot; to M.2, Interface: SATA to PCI-e, and Protocol: AHCI to NVMe. Many cheaper M.2 drives such as the 860 Evo or MX500 use SATA and will perform the same as a 2.5 inch drive, all SATA drives use AHCI which is a protocol designed with mechanical hard drives in mind. Then there is PCI-e SSDs, these have a straight connection to the CPU rather than going through a SATA controller, PCI-e connections can be made through M.2, actual PCI-e slots, or U.2(a cable that connects to a 2.5&quot; drive) the later two are found mostly on enterprise grade SSDs e.g. from Intel. The vast majority of these use the newer NVMe protocol but it's not a requirement, I believe the Samsung 950 pro still used AHCI.</p></div>		</li>
