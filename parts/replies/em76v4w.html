			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, ethanol seems to inhibit both the beta oxidation process (fat to energy) and the ATP process (energy for muscles.) So alcohol also basically makes less normal energy available for the body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Calories are weird. The original definition of a calorie is whether it will burn and heat water. But burning something is not the same as your body using it for energy.</p>
<p>Current calories are calculated by... estimation. They just see how much of the food is protein, fat, fiber, and alcohol and just... estimate.</p>
<p>Since fiber and alcohol are weird and complicated they just sort of guess their caloric effect and call it a day.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Less harmful substances like fat or something else? I presume you can still get fat from alcohol if you managed to drink enough and not die?</p></div>		</li>
