			<div class="markdown"><p>What are your thoughts on an mRNA vs a traditional inactivated virus vaccine ? What makes COVID-19 different from other viruses that necessitates the use of just the spike protein as the antigen instead of the whole virus? I‚Äôve taken a few graduate level courses on immunology but I‚Äôm not understanding why this is the course of action for this vaccine. </p>
<p>You‚Äôve addressed the improbability of reinfection but do you think there is any danger from articles from journalists insisting that covid reinfection is a serious issue based on personal stories from outliers ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP but also have a PhD in molecular pharmacology and work in R&amp;D at a major vaccine company developing a COVID vaccine, so I'll weigh in. The spike protein facilitates membrane fusion and the dumping of viral load into the cell, so if you create a vaccine that generates neutralizing antibodies to the spike protein, you prevent cellular infection. This is the same as the Flublok influenza vaccine which is just a bunch of influenza HA protein, which is the protein that allows influenza to fuse to a cell and dump it's viral load. When you use an inactivated vaccine you're basically just letting the macrophage or other antigen presenting cell digest the virus and present the antigens, in this case the spike protein, so this is a more efficient way of generating the most immunogenic antigen, and theoretically a very safe way. I hope that answered your question!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes thank you ! That answers the spike protein as the antigen question. From my understanding of original antigenic sin , if the initial antigen epitope that is recognized is the spike protein then if the virus makes any mutations to the spike protein then the immune response will not be mounted against it . Then if new vaccines are developed against the mutation, the body will only generate an immune response against the original epitope and not the new structure . </p>
<p>So with original antigenic sin taken into account would it not make more sense to allow professional antigen presenting cells to break down the whole virus so that an immune response can be mounted even if there is spike protein mutations ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So would this mean that a vaccine targeting a specific antigen allow targeting one that is more susceptible to immune response, whereas a whole-virus vaccine would be more &quot;luck of the draw&quot; and could result in immune response targeting a less &quot;vulnerable&quot; antigen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My father used to develop vaccines and was one of a handful of people that did protien folding when he started working on them, so I have a vague idea of what he did, but I was never able to fully wrap my head around it all.  He passed about 15 years ago, otherwise I would picking his brain rather asking someone on Reddit, but here goes:</p>
<p>Is it possible that person A inficted with the virus (vs vaccine) may develop a different immune response than a person B?  And can the immune system develop multiple responses to the same virus?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a paper by Jeyanathan on the different vaccine strategies for covid. And classical methods as well as new vectored and NA methods are all being utilised. To my knowledge the reason why all of the vaccines covered by the news now are mRNA or viral vectored is simply because they are the quickest to develop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a vaccinologist, but from what I have seen and read mRNA vaccines definitely have less chance for adverse side effects due to their simple design. Honestly for me I would support whatever type of vaccine works and it really seems like the mRNA vaccines are the way to go for the future if this ends the way it appears to be heading. As far as the immune response goes the mRNA vaccines have the advantage that the mRNA itself is immunogenic and can act as it's own adjuvant, limiting the addition of additional immune stimulation that can lead to adverse side effects. Also it maybe could be more like a natural infection but I'm not sure that matters.</p>
<p>In general we try to target specific parts of the virus when generating vaccines. Even when we give whole inactivated virus the immune response is still prioritizing certain proteins which we know ahead of time. We want to generate antibodies to surface proteins so that it increases the chances that the antibodies actually prevent the virus from infecting and lead to neutralization. The use of mRNA vaccines though necessitates the choice of a single protein since you are choosing what is encoded by the vaccine. In this case the spike protein seems to be what the natural immune response attacks after infection and it is also what the virus uses for entry so it is a perfect vaccine target.</p>
<p>I think it is very difficult to accurately portray scientific topics to non-scientists because the general public interprets our use of words like &quot;may&quot; &quot;sometimes&quot; &quot;could&quot; very differently than other scientists do. I have seen a lot of what I would consider dangerous misrepresentation of scientific data both in the news and highly upvoted on popular subreddits and it's just impossible to provide nuance to everyone.  The most dangerous thing to me in my opinion has been the tribalization and politicization of this response that has separated people into people that care and people that don't. It makes it impossible for public health experts to accurately communicate and make suggestions. Right now it's the people that don't care that are wrong, but I also envision a time in the near future when the virus spread slows due to the vaccine that people are going to refuse to believe health experts telling them that they are safe. Overstating science is dangerous and creates a lot of problems, don't trust any scientist who doesn't mince their words and pretends like they know everything</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>About that last sentence, one of the patterns in journalism that really angers me is this one:</p>
<p>- Scientists release a statement which is carefully phrased to not state more than they actually know.  The statement is full of qualifiers and careful conditional clauses which weren't there just for the fun of it.  They were there because they're part of the  minimum necessary phrasing to avoid lying.  A shorter statement with the qualifiers and conditions missing would have been a massive overstatement.</p>
<p>- Journalists in the public sphere (I'm talking newspapers, not science journals) find the statement interesting but just too ugly and complex for public dissemination, so they simplify it when writing headlines about it.  They remove all the important qualifiers the scientists put there *for a reason*, transforming the truthful statement into a lie.</p>
<p>- The public finds out later on the statement made by the Journalists wasn't true, or seems to be contradicted by later reports, when the original careful statement the scientists made was true and still is.</p>
<p>- The public blames &quot;the scientists&quot; for being wrong, not the journalist, because they don't know the newspaper article's claim is *not* what the scientists actually said.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The more time you spend learning and the more time you spend in a discipline like scientific research the more you realize the world is not binary.</p>
<p>I am always saying ‚Äúkind of‚Äù ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù ‚Äúsort of‚Äù ‚Äúsometimes‚Äù... and such and when I‚Äôm speaking to people who aren‚Äôt trained scientists often get frustrated that I can‚Äôt give them a black and white answer in a couple words that is 100% true.</p></div>		</li>
