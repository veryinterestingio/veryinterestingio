			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to start a religious war, but the information you have about the system is the specification of it's macrostate and the entropy of the system is a measure of the amount of additional information you would need to completely specify the microstate. The more you know about the system the less information you need to specify it's state.  This seems less magical to me than phase space evolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course to me that is the definition of temperature ... But basically when two systems are in contact, the number of paired states across both systems is the product of states available to both systems, so the log of products is sum of logs.  It is more important though that e.g. thermal contact in equilibrium is an additional constraint on available microstates, i.e. if I know two systems are in thermal contact at equilibrium, then I have more information about the state of the system.</p></div>		</li>
