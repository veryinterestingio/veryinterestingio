			<div class="markdown"><p>Boxing is exhausting for a bunch of reasons, but an underrated one is the amount of energy needed to control a missed punch without opening yourself up to crushing counter attacks. Those heavy crosses and haymaker hooks suck to reign in when they miss.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The two things that tripped me out the most when I started boxing, my arms have weight and keeping them up is tiresome, my feet were weak and skipping rope made them hurt. It's an interesting first month or six.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've only sparred a few times (never been in a real fight). What surprised me was there was very little pain from being hit. Even when I was hit hard, it never really hurt even though it had me seeing stars and staggering as if I was drunk</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Genuinely, when I started boxing my friends (who don't box) took the piss out of me when I told them how tough it is just to keep your hands up for a whole three minute round. I did a fight a couple of years ago and after the first round I almost felt like I had to give in, it's the most exhausted I've ever been.</p>
<p>The best analogy I can use for what an actual fight feels like it imagine doing sprinting-level intensity for three whole minutes. Sparring is a little lighter obviously, but it's still incredibly tough.</p></div>		</li>
