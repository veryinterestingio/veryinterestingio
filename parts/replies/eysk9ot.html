			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha thanks for asking! I’m researching communication strategy for wild tiger conservation in the US*.A number of variables are being examined but we’re using something called moral foundations theory  to test whether better, more targeted rhetoric in the form of a strategic message has any influence a person’s likelihood to engage in tiger conservation-related behaviors. The hope is that my research may be used in other conservation areas, not just with tigers (I go to Clemson University, hence the tiger connection.)</p>
<p>*edit to clarify that there are no wild tigers in the US, but people in the US are a largely untapped resource</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For mobile sea life, most go deep enough to avoid waves or the strong push and pull of internal waves. If it can't go deep, it will hunker down inside mangrove forests, or crevices in coral reefs. Marine mammals have it a little rougher, but dolphins and whales are able to dive deep enough and hold their breath long enough that surfacing occasionally isn't too hazardous. I believe seals and the like try to haul out and weather the storm. Manatees take refuge in the mangrove forests.</p>
<p>Non-mobile sea life just has to take the brunt of the storm. I study corals, and reefs can often be pulverized by hurricanes. However, this is a natural cycle they are adapted to, and in places undisturbed by humans, the reef will be recolonized and on its way back to normal within a few years.
Unfortunately the Caribbean is heavily impacted by humans, and reefs there that experience natural disturbances often experience a &quot;phase shift&quot; where what was once coral is now covered with algae.  This is likely due to overfishing because fish herbivory is a natural check on algae growth that would otherwise overgrow corals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The eye is the safest area (on land/above water). Its possible he meant the eye-wall which is the worst of it. I've also heard that the eye can be the worst in the water because all the waves going in different directions converge in the middle and cause big, essentially rouge waves. (not sure how true this is but it would make sense)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>we do this when tubing behind a boat. drive in circles and get the waves converging and they become huge and then you whip the person on the tube through it with sometimes spectacular results.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It certainly packs a surprise punch on land. If the eye moves onto your location, the wind and rain make a remarkably abrupt stop, and the uninitiated think the storm's over. So they come out to look at the damage, and the opposite eyewall catches them in the open.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is true that the eye of a hurricane is frequently calm, but that doesn't make it &quot;safe&quot;. If you've heard this, you either misheard, or someone miscommunicated what they meant.</p>
<p>If you find yourself in the eye of a hurricane, it means that one eye wall has passed over you, and the other one will at some point in the future. Since the eye wall is the most violent part of the hurricane, the eye cannot be considered the &quot;safest&quot; area. In fact, many deaths associated with hurricanes occur because people go outside thinking that the storm has passed, yet they're only in the eye. When the other eye wall passes over, it doesn't build gradually like the first eye wall, it comes quickly. This can catch you off guard.</p>
<p>I've been through three hurricanes that had direct impact, and I'm about to sit through Dorian on Florida's treasure coast (Indian River County). We rode the very top edge of the eye wall for both Frances (2004) and Jeanne (2004), with <em>maybe</em> a 5 minute break as the eye passed over (because we were on the edge).</p>
<p>The time scale of a hurricane is something that is difficult to convey. Both Frances and Jeanne seemed to take forever to pass, but one of them (I can't recall which) sat on us for like 18 hours. It takes almost a full 8 hours for the first eye wall to make it to you, and then it is suddenly calm within 10 minutes. When the second eye wall comes, it doesn't take 8 hours; it's right there. You go from relative calm to epic shit storm in moments. It's crazy how quickly it comes.</p>
<p>So yeah, eye of a hurricane is not a &quot;safe&quot; place to be. It's just relatively calm when compared to the rest of the storm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The eye is regarded as the safest area because winds are calm there (wind goes on opposite directions on opposite sides of the hurricane, so winds need to be zero right in the middle. </p>
<p>However, subsurface ocean motions can be extremely violent there, and will grow vertically within 1/4 of an inertial period (7-10 hours) after the eye passes by. At that time, the ocean surface will quite literally split apart and allow deep, cold waters to emerge from below and take its place. </p>
<p>This is not a consequence of high wind speeds near the eyewall, but instead happens because cyclones drag water in all different directions. Because ocean motions triggered by storms move in circles and not in straight lines, the orientation of these surface currents will eventually point away from each other (divergent flow). When that happens, deep water is sucked up to fill the void that oscillating surface currents induce.</p></div>		</li>
