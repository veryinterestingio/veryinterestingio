			<div class="markdown"><p>Well im pretty sure that when we sleep the brain is trying to decide what's important to forget so maybe that's what happens when the brain doesn't clean house properly. </p>
<p>You have a bunch of stuff on your mind and your not taking it off as fast as your putting it on so maybe your attention span shortens since all these different things are competing for your attention. </p>
<p>And then suddenly your really enjoying the chance to escape your full mind and relive some old nostalgic memory.</p>
<p>But im just theorizing and hypothamizing or something lol im not a psychologist though i would be in some classes if i could afford them.</p></div>		</li>
