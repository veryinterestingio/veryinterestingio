			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi there! Thanks so much for watching! We definitely tried to identify science experiments for the at-home segments that used materials you would hopefully have around your home (for the lava lamp, you could just use water, oil and salt and that would work great!), but of course my experiences in the US will make the &quot;materials you have around the house&quot; assumption a bit US-biased. I'm recreating many of the experiments on my instagram (www.instagram.com/thespacegal) and including a materials list along with it! You can find all of these in my highlights. If you find good substitutions for any of the experiments that are more widely available where you live, please let me know and I can share those with others as well! Thanks so much for watching!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I second this Emily! Would love an instructional website. </p>
<p>My daughter also loves your show! We‚Äôre already on our 10th time watching the season. Is there another season in the works or at least talked about? I want to keep her interested without burning her out yet on season 1!</p></div>		</li>
