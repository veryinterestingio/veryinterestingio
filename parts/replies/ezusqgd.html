What were the scientists that discovered CMB looking for?
I grew up near a radio astrophysical place and remember there being signs prohibiting two way radio use in the surrounding area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were two sets of scientists, actually. One set was working on an unrelated project and didn't even know about the theory, while the other was setting out specifically to find it.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_of_cosmic_microwave_background_radiation" target="_blank">In 1964</a>, scientists Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson were working at Bell Labs on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Echo" target="_blank">Project Echo</a>, the first passive-communication satellite experiment. It consisted of two metalized balloon satellites designed to passively reflect microwave radiation to a 6 meter horn antenna. In order for this to work, they had to eliminate any possible interference, and they were almost able to, save for a mysterious, very powerful source coming from outside the Milky Way.</p>
<p>At the same time, Robert H. Dicke, Jim Peebles, and David Wilkinson, astrophysicists at Princeton, were about to conduct their own search for this radiation. They reasoned that the Big Bang <em>must</em> have released a tremendous burst of radiation, which would have been redshifted into the microwave band.</p>
<p>Before they started, however, a physics professor at MIT, Bernard Burke, told Penzias about one of Peebles' papers on the possibility of such radiation. Immediately, Penzias and Wilson suspected they were onto something, and started working with the Princeton team, eventually releasing a joint paper in 1965.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting to note that the capture effect that you speak of only exists o. FM not AM.  If you had an aux to AM converter, if such a thing existed, you'd hear both stations.  You can observe this in a drive between cities.  At a point somewhat halfway between, the FM signal will start mostly swapping from one station to the other, with a bit of nonsense in between.  This could happen several times as you go in and out of coverage, say passing in the RF shadow of a hill or building or something.  If you tune in to AM, you'll instead tend to hear one station with another faintly in the background, and if you drive (the typically much longer distance) between transmitters, they would tend to equal out and then swap in audio amplitude over time.</p>
<p>This is one reason the air bands are AM, one plane can break in over another and the listening party would hear both; if it's ATC, they can act immediately.  If it's another aircraft they can relay the message to ATC, or simply stop responding to allow the other traffic to be passed.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Not always, sometimes you get a bad heterodyning squeal.  But it's enough to know that two planes were talking at the same time and ATC or another pilot can say &quot;block&quot; and people know to back off and retry.</p></div>		</li>
