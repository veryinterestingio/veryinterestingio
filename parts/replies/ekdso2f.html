			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a great design feature. See, the heart creates blood pressure. In a squishy octopus, that pressure fills up the octopus and pushes on it's extremities, similar to filling up a floatable lounge chair with air. Now when the chair is full of air it doesn't deform and floats. Whereas, when the octopus is full of pressure, it's arms and legs (yes some of them are biologically legs!) Are restricted and it can't move at it's full potential. It's evolutionarily beneficial to be faster to escape predators. So those octopuses with the ability to lower their blood pressure so they can move their limbs more quickly and escape, survived and that's why modern octopuses have that trait.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you know where I can find one of those diagrams that color-codes body parts comparing an octopus to other animals?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wait up hang on mate you can't just say things like that and not elaborate</p>
<p>What makes them biologically legs?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To disprove intelligent design, all you have to do is look carefully enough at nature. There are tons of examples like this that are hilarious. </p>
<p>Another good one is that many squids have an important ganglion that wraps around their esophagus. So, if they swallow something too big, they accidentally brain damage themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love how evolution works sometimes.  It's like, millions of years of survival of the fittest, clearly an indefinite work-in-progress, but to look at systems like this it's as if some invisible hand just said &quot;Eh, you can breed, and maybe nurture your young long enough to give them a chance of success...if it ain't broke...&quot;.</p>
<p>I can't tell you how many times I've encountered this type of thought in my (non-science) career.  Sans the breeding, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To make an analogy with <a href="https://humananatomylogy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/circulatory-system-of-octopus-octopus-circulatory-system-circulatory-system-of-octopus-circulatory.jpg" target="_blank">human circulatory systems</a>, the <a href="http://images.slideplayer.com/11/3234750/slides/slide_25.jpg" target="_blank">systemic heart of an octopus</a> is somewhat equivalent to our left atrium and ventricle (taking in oxygenated blood, and pumping it around our body), while the branchial hearts are basically equivalent to our right atrium and ventricle (taking deoxygenated blood and sending it to the lungs, or in this case gills).  So while these two parts of the circulatory system are physically separated unlike in humans, they are still both essential rather than redundant.  Though it might be possible to survive with only one branchial heart/gill as you say, I'm not sure.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So you're saying the secret from moving Octopi up the intellectual chain is to fix their hearts so they can be endurance swimmers?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Biggest problem is their sort lifespan of only about 3 (smaller) to 5 (bigger species) years and the fact that they die shortly after mating (male) and after laying eggs and caring for them for a while (female).  Every octopus has to learn everything from scratch. They are not getting taught by their parents like in some other similarly intelligent species. Just imagine what would happen if they were able to pass on knowledge to the next generation.  You have to remember that octopuses can be as smart as dogs, which is completely crazy given they are mollusks. They actually have their own personalities and can tell people apart from sight and taste (their suckers are taste sensitive) and can develop affection and aversion against  some of their handlers at big public aquariums.
Also their blood is copper based to better carry oxygen in cold water. Downside is this makes them tire out real quick. So the real problem is actually the copper based blood. This also is the reason their blood is actually blue.
Fun fact: even though their blood is copper based, even VERY small trace amounts of copper in the water can be lethal to them.  Aquarium owners lost Octopuses because they had used copper-based medications in their tank before.
Seriously there’s so much interesting stuff about these creatures that I just could keep on writing forever. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I've heard that's due to hormones that get pumped out which drive the mating cycle and cause them to starve (they become unable to digest foods when exposed to sex hormones.)  There have been experiments where they remove the sex hormone producing glands after they mate and they can resume digesting food and live a lot longer, though don't have a reliable source on how much longer.</p></div>		</li>
