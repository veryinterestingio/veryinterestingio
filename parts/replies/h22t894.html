			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no destruction of fat cells in fat loss, unfortunately.  (One guy was looking into ways to make it happen chemically, but said he had concerns about triggering auto-immune conditions, or maybe lupus?  By having all the dead fat cells in the bloodstream.  I think he abandoned the project.) </p>
<p>However you <em>do</em> get new fat cells if your existing ones are full.  Like massively obese people don't have godzilla-sized fat cells (though they are large), <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3319901/#:~:text=As%20a%20consequence%20of%20their,can%20increase%20throughout%20adult%20life." target="_blank">they actually have developed many more fat cells than smaller people</a>, in the process of becoming that large. </p>
<p>I have no idea why that process doesn't work with people who've had liposuction; my completely ignorant-ass guess would be that new fat cell creation can only take place around existing volumes of fat cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting! But here in Taiwan in many beauty clinics, they offer fat burning IVs, that claim to destroy the fat cells chemically, and then makes it out of the body after being metabolized by the liver. Ngl was pretty moved by their adverts, cuz actual surgery is so darn scary and some fat on the body just won’t budge regardless of how much exercise and diet you do sigh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My un-scientific assessment is that the full fat cells divide and then can absorb more fat. But once liposuction happens there aren't enough cells to divide or it doesn't happen fast enough to absorb all the excess fat so it's stored elsewhere. This is a pure guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding was that when the triglycerides are gone out of the cell, the cell breaks down, turns into water and carbon-dioxide then gets breathed out the lungs? I remember reading this in an article. But it would have been without context so just curious how that process fits into reality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well thats not really a opinion.</p>
<p>beeing overweight isnt healthy. removing fat cella isnt healthy either because your body cant store it there.</p>
<p>so yes eating healthy and excersing is the hard but correct part to a healthy body and mind.</p></div>		</li>
