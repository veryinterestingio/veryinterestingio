			<div class="markdown"><p>What I learned in my engineering courses (might be more complex than that, I'm not sure) is that it boils down to the ratio between the volume of the metal vs the volume of the oxide. If the volume is significantly higher or lower than 1, the oxide coverage sucks and it doesn't protect the metal. Like steel, for example, is well over 1, so when it oxides, it bubbles up and crack as the oxide takes more more volume than when it was a metal.</p>
<p>But aluminum, even if it oxidizes really easily, the volume ratio is close to 1. The oxide takes roughly the same volume than the metal, the oxide coverage is almost perfect, so the oxide efficiently protect the metal underneath.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Presumably this is somewhat less helpful specifically in the case of aluminium cans - the wall thickness can be as little as 0.097 mm. A tiny scratch exposes enough bare metal that the walls of the can turn to oxide fairly quickly. The ends and the ring where the top and sides overlap can last a bit longer but modern cans keep getting lighter with less metal. I suspect the 100 years to decompose figure at the top level comment is for older cans stored in a dry environment. I've definitely picked up cans only a year or two old thrown in ditches and seen corrosion has started.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but even still pure aluminum is pretty useless. Almost everything you know as aluminum is actually aluminum alloy, or a mix of metals mostly being aluminum. A pure aluminum soda can would probably explode under it's own pressure. </p>
<p>Aluminum's oxide doesn't expand as much as iron's, so it doesn't really rust away, but it also doesn't stop oxidizing with time. It's just a logmaritic curve, rapidly grows an oxide layer at first, then rapidly decays but never truly stops. It also depends on the environment, an acidic environment might accelerate the growth. A basic environment will erode the oxide, and eventually corrode the entire piece.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have that backwards. Relatively pure aluminium is more corrosion resistant. Alloying gets other properties at the expense of corrosion residence. I do believe there are 100+ year old roofs of &quot;pure&quot; aluminium.</p>
<p>This is opposite of steel where you very much need more elements to gain courtroom resistance.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Could you explain this one a bit more? Are you saying that inert pure aluminum has some kind of internal pressure?</p></div>		</li>

<p>We can make Plastics that are easy to decompose. Compostable plastics are available, do a Google search for them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Compostable plastics are widely misunderstood because most of them don't break down like people might expect. Lots of bioplastics are labeled as compostable because they're made from corn or sugar, but they usually have a higher carbon footprint during production due to land and fertilizer needed to produce the materials. They also can't just be thrown away because after ending up in a landfill, almost nothing degrades at all due to lack of air and moisture. Even if properly disposed of, they would most likely require a high-temperature industrial composting facility to break down, of which there are only 200 in the US.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This needs to be more widespread information. Sadly even products that explain the caveats of their compostable plastics do it in a hidden place with very fine print (I have a package around here somewhere that has it in such fine print with such low resolution that it's impossible to make out.)</p>
<p>Most compostable plastics in regular everyday products that I've seen require either chemical processes to initiate biodegradation, or disposal at a facility that specializes in biodegradable plastics. </p>
<p>Companies don't want to point that out on their packaging because it removes a lot of the fuzzy feelings that you're a good person for buying it as soon as you realize that it's only better for the planet if you put in more effort than you're realistically ever going to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a company selling a journal made of &quot;environmentally friendly stone paper&quot;. Never mind the fact that paper is about the single most environmentally friendly product humanity produces (95%+ comes from renewable tree farms or recycled sources, and it all decomposes on its own), this stone paper was actually powdered rock fused with plastic! It could only be recycled by a specific recycling method that most people won't have access to! I am still flabbergasted by such a dirtbag product.</p></div>		</li>
