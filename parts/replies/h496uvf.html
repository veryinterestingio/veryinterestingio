			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree about the ineptitude of commodore's leadership, but not about amiga's price. Amiga MSRP was half of a Mac. And since amiga used the same CPU as a Mac you could also run MacOS in the amiga. And the amiga would actually run MacOS faster than the Mac could so technically you got 2 computers in one for half the price of a Mac.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember the joke in 1995 was that Windows made a PC &quot;look like a Mac&quot;.  Everyone rolled their eyes when they saw the &quot;Recycle Bin&quot; instead of the &quot;Trash&quot;.</p>
<p>But PC's were much cheaper than Mac's at the time.  Corporate offices liked PC's because they were cheaper and with Windows, you no longer needed to be a computer geek to use a PC.  So, the Windows PC took over the market.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The biggest reason is they could still run their DOS business apps and you had Excel and Word.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but Macs were nonexistant in many markets due to their hefty price compared to IBM compatible computers, I never knew anybody that had a mac computer growing up, most markets in Europe went from 8-16 bit microcomputers like Spectrum, c64, or Amiga to 2-3-486 IBM computers. Only people that worked in graphic design would have macs (if).</p>
<p>Windoes was the OS that introduced the mainstream population into easing the use of computers.</p>
<p>Macs were more expensive, have a limited source of software and 3rd party hardware upgrade. It was a no brainer for most people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was referring to your last sentence. For PCs, yes, for personal computers in general the Mac was 8 years before 3.1 was released in 1992. </p>
<p>Win95 was a big deal because 11 years later MS finally released something close to what the Mac was for the previous decade.</p></div>		</li>
