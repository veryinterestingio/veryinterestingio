			<div class="markdown"><p>So how come they can recoup the lost time so quick? It seems as if they do 16 hours of work in just 8 hours if Monday is a federal holiday. Do they work a long shift on Tuesday, or do they just have so much down time that making up for a closed day is no big deal?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The files don't have to be processed or sent out on that Monday. They could just spin up the mainframe and let it run a bit earlier than usual on that Tuesday and let it run a bit later to finish up with Tuesday's batch processing or something. Just a guess tho.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if all they do is &quot;spin up the mainframe&quot; and let it run longer than usual, why not just have it run 24/7?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, the work isn’t really “made up” it’s just moved to a later date. Batch cutoff and funding times don’t change, no matter the day. Sundays are also days this work isn’t completed, but Mondays aren’t made into 16 hour days each week because of that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holidays that coincide with paydays are a bigger deal to recover from.</p>
<p>Paydays are often on  Friday and most federal Holidays are Monday.  Social security payment are on Wednesdays, which is rarely a Federal holiday either.</p>
<p>If a payday overlaps with a federal holiday, the bank can shuffle around other maintenance programs to leave as many resources available as possible to finish the post by the morning.  Banks also have contingency computing resources they can use that are supposed to be for emergencies.</p>
<p>There are set processes and routines to make up the time after a holiday, like with garbage collection.</p></div>		</li>
