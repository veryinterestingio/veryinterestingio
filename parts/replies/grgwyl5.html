			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this mean that if we were able to freeze time (to keep all other variables the same) and move around the rainbow, we'd see a visible change as the alignment of these angles change?</p>
<p>I suppose that's obvious but I've never sat and thought about rainbows enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what you mean here, but in reality when you move the rainbow moves too: there will always be a straight line between the sun, your head (where your eyeballs are) and the center of the rainbow's arc. That's the easy way to find them, turn your back to the sun and look where the shadow of your head would be, and that's where the rainbow's center is. </p>
<p>It's also why &quot;somewhere over the rainbow&quot; and the pot of gold at the &quot;end of the rainbow&quot; are impossible to reach, because each rainbow is individual to the viewer and changes any time their perspective or position changes</p></div>		</li>

<p>just bring the water closer to you, like a garden hose sprayer instead of distant rain.    boom!  instant riches!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im not sure what the original asker was asking but I think they mean like of you change your position relative in the triangle of eye sun water would the rainbow change colors?</p>
<p>Like if there was a glass elevator that went up and I was watching the rainbow would I be able to watch as the &quot;rungs&quot; changed color as I affected the angle by moving vertically</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hmm that's an interesting one. Theoretically, isn't time already frozen for all photons? Since they travel at c, they don't experience time and their entire journey happens instantaneously...I guess it's then a philosophical question whether freezing time would also freeze photons?</p></div>		</li>
