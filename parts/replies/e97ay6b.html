			<div class="markdown"><p>Production checking in (as none seem to have done so yet).  In practice, op's concern about accuracy of content quantity is essentially a non-issue in the years I've done commercial manufacturing of biologics in a SF Bay Area biotech outfit.  My department is very downstream, where rejection is more costly given the already sunken cost of production at that stage.  But reject it we do - at very stringent standards.  In rare severe cases, we've had particulate contamination (from equipment shedding bits into the product stream).  However, even cosmetic issues of packaging or labeling that doesn't affect efficacy or potency are sufficient justification for rejection.  Common sense would conclude such rejections are frivolous and one might even advocate &quot;repackaging&quot; for &quot;alternative markets&quot;.  However, due to contraband concerns that could tarnish the brand, all such rejects, even &quot;harmless&quot; ones, are marked for destruction.  </p>
<p>Such is the extent of adherance to the FDA's cGMP guidelines most organizations like our operate under.  My exposition may be slightly off-topic from the original question of quantity guarantee.  But it lends itself to an emphasis about how seriously drug quality and safety is taken in the US. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely.  I’m in medical devices, mostly lab tests. What might look to the consumer like a minor error in packaging can actually represents a major fuckup with failures on from production and QC.  The average population has no idea how stringent the regulations are and how low the threshold is for a recall on something that sounds trivial.  To the consumer- if it isn’t perfect- call and report it.  It’s not a ‘complaint,’ theres a system failure somewhere we need to know about.  Random ‘flukes’ in packaging or labels just aren’t supposed to happen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked in a large data center for a really large IT company that handled a couple of Pharmaceutical accounts.   FDA certification and the processes and procedures we had to adhere to were nothing short of paper work hell, but it was necessary to ensure every step along the way from parts to production was audit ready.      </p>
<p>There's no taking shortcuts... that's for sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When it comes to FDA and HIPPA requirements it's no joke. Worked for a company that monitored servers and electric equipment. In my job, I would have 0 access to anything with patient information. But, because I did have access to our servers, which would interact with servers with patient information, I had to receive HIPPA training so that our company could pass HIPPA certifications (a requirement to work with these medical companies). This was even though the servers I had access to had nothing to do with medical information. Our servers recorded network speeds, server downtime, etc... and did root cause analysis (6 servers and a switch went down, oh, all those servers are on that switch? the switch is probably dead)</p></div>		</li>
