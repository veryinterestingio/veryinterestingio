			<div class="markdown"><p>This probably considers that the Earth is travelling linearly. Im not too sure as im not familar with the calculations yet </p>
<p>However, the Earth is orbiting around the Sun</p>
<p>Does this mean that the Earth will always move in a spiral until it crashes into the sun if it experiences air resistance?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not going to travel at constant velocity and then suddenly come to halt.</p>
<p>You need to come up with formula for the drag force as a function of velocity, write a differential equation and perform integration to determine the velocity as function of time.</p>
<p>Then solve for t where v = 0</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Drag coefficient of a sphere is based off the CS area, not surface area. Also, the number you cited is based off a certain reynolds number that definitely isn't at the scale of the earth.</p></div>		</li>
