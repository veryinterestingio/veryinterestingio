			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people game at 1440p now, which is even more intense than 900p. Still begs the question, why 1440p instead of 1800p. Even if it was a 4:3 ratio for the first TV, I don't get why it wasn't 400x300.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That ratio exists actually. For some reason very uncommon though. However I believe it is the best ratio as Windows will just add a 125% zoom on 1080p by default on 15.6 inch screens.</p></div>		</li>
