			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a little person as in achondroplasia/dwarfism, but some people are little because of growth hormone deficiencies. It depends on the diagnosis, but gennnnerally (take this with some salt) the little people that respond to HGH have a different physique, almost childlike, whereas some LP born with achondroplasia will have a more stout body, larger head and hands etc because they don’t have a problem with making growth hormone. </p>
<p>basically, achondroplasia is a genetic disorder caused by mutation in cartilage and bone formation. pituitary issues like gigantism or GH deficiency can be treated with hormone suppression or replacement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe dwarfism is caused by stunted growth specifically in the long bones which is why they typically have a proportionally longer torso and short limbs. HGH would not discriminate between the short and long bones so you might get the long bones to grow a little but you’d also have bigger shoulder blades, pelvis, vertebrae etc so all in all it’s pointless as you’re just shifting the problem.</p></div>		</li>
