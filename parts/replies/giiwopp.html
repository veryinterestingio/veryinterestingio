			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't the full story. As you get closer to a surface the behaviour of the fluid it interacts with changes (called the boundary layer), right next to the surface is a thing called the laminar sub-layer where the relative fluid speed approaches zero. Because there is no relative fluid speed this allows dust to stay on the blades that have been attracted by those electrostatic forces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there's both good answers. I like the electrostatic version because it explains why the dust seems to settle MORE on the fan than anywhere else (in a computer for instance)</p></div>		</li>
