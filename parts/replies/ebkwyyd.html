			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I delved into this thread to find. Speech jammer was a complete mindfuck the first time I tried it out. Had no idea it won the If Noble though. Makes sense that it would.</p>
<p>Iirc you can alter the delay and tune it to the person who is doing it, it simply stopped talk... Like a brick wall. Really interesting phenomenon to experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall it was on a friends iPhone (using an app), with in ear headphones, perhaps one in or at least one partially in. Simple as that really. Probably available on the app stores, not got accounts to check out on iOS but it's on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.icechen1.speechjammer" target="_blank">play store here</a> for those not trapped in the Apple ecosystem.</p>
<p>Edit: Just installed it on my android phone to play with on the long drive home tomorrow, see if it works on the handsfree in the car... guess it's similar to headphones, kinda massive, immersive version. argh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any device that produces live &quot;echo&quot; can be tuned to jam speech. Even older digital phones where the earpiece volume could be adjusted had this issue if the ear piece was set to be too loud (and thus the microphone picked up the speech.)</p></div>		</li>
