			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't agree at all that they demonstrate what he wanted.</p>
<p>Lets take the intro melody to No Surprises as an example. It starts by plucking notes on a D-major chord. This part <strong>does</strong> sound light, happy, careless, everything we'd expect from a major chord/key. It also primes us to expect the song to be in the key of D-major.</p>
<p>Then it plucks the note sequence G - B♭ - D - E. The G - B♭ step is a <strong>minor third</strong>, meaning it's a G-minor chord, while in the D-major key there is instead a G-major chord. This does two things. More obviously we now have a minor chord, which does sound heavy, dark and somber. Also, more subtly, it re-contextualizes the D-major chord as a VI-chord (F-major key), meaning the sequence is a VI-II, which is a chord progression which builds tension, which would normally be resolved through a V-chord to the I-chord. Instead the sequence repeats, and we get all tension, no resolution.</p>
<p>I don't have the time to analyze the whole song, but skimming it it seems the same kind of arguments hold throughout the song. So no, the song isn't sad by using the major key, it's sad by using minor chords and tension without or with delayed resolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Melodywise, No surprises is a happy little tune, and it does sound like it if you remove the lyrics. Same with Misery from The Beatles: C major, super happy tune, except for the lyrics.</p>
<p>My point is, when talking about sad or happy scales you should consider the music only. Lyrics can be completely dissociated from the melody.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wasn't talking about the lyrics. There are little details throughout the song that make it sound miserable. Of course, this is all subjective, but the synth in the middle of the song sounds so dreadful, it's as if it sounds like it's getting harder to breathe, which would make sense with the lyric &quot;a handshake of carbon monoxide.&quot; Another thing is the vocal melody. Thom Yorke usually comes up with these beautiful vibrant melodies, but in No Surprises it's overwhelmingly simple, reflecting the life that the narrator is living, but doesn't want to live. Overall, the non-theory related parts of the song sound like they've had the life sucked out of it, especially when compared to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipEO8Eq5uYo" target="_blank">the live version.</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Only tip is to give Kid A some time to marinate if you don’t immediately vibe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally I'd say The Bends is a much better album to start on. First of all I personally prefer it to Kid A/Ok Computer, and second of all it's a bit less out there, less experimental/art music, making it easier to get into.</p></div>		</li>
