			<div class="markdown"><p>Anesthesia is a fascinating subject for me. When I had my wisdom teeth removed, it took me longer than expected to go under and I surprised the nurse when I woke up (although that may just have been because I was incredibly mad coming out of the anesthesia for some reason). I remember the moment I woke up, the nurse looking startled, me angrily flailing my arm around - I couldn't speak and I wanted my glasses - and then falling asleep again with my glasses on my face. I was a very displeased fourteen year old.</p>
<p>General anesthesia makes me angry, I guess.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I got angry at the dentist for binning my teeth and asked for multiple stickers. I am a 27 year old woman. </p>
<p>I came to halfway through eating a jacket potato at my mums house. My mum said she could see the moment it happened. I had 6 kids stickers on my t shirt. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same thing with me. Last thing I remember the dentist saying was &quot;Fentanyl 100&quot; and then everything started moving like the ocean in front of me. I could hear them talking at certain points but I didn't feel a thing and for the most part I don't remember it. I just know I wasn't completely out, I just couldn't feel anything and I wasn't in my regular state of consciousness. Best dental work I've ever had, apparently I &quot;didn't like the needles&quot; they had used to numb my mouth after the sedative tool effect.</p>
<p>Is fentanyl used as an IV Sedative or did I mishear what the dentist said? It was an Army Dentist btw.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh.  I don't wake up angry but I take a lot of anesthesia to be knocked out, and I'm a small girl.  Like, the last time I had surgery the anethesiologist kept asking &quot;You tired yet?&quot; &quot;You can close your eyes, maybe?&quot; &quot;Any time your eyes feel heavy go ahead and let them close.&quot; I have a family full of blondes, no red hair as far as I know.  But I do have a good chunk of Scottish ancestry, so I wonder if that's why.  Of course, I'm also an anxious potato so could be subconsciously fighting it or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My experience has been that pain killers aren't as effective, but pain isn't as bad either. Sure, I may be home with a kidney stone, but it doesn't hurt <em>that</em> much, and the Vicodin isn't helping anyway, so why take it? </p>
<p>I am a little concerned that it will kill me one day. It took 3-4 days for me to feel in pain enough to go to the doctor to get looked at for an abdominal ache. He looked at it, I drove to the ER, and 6 hours later I had my appendix removed. I sometimes think about what would have happened if I hadn't gone to the doctor because the pain wasn't bad enough?</p>
<p>I had a dentist refuse to pull 2 of my wisdom teeth because with the first two even the maximum amount of Novocaine he used wasn't sufficient to properly deaden the senses. It wasn't particularly painful, but enough to make me wince and react when I shouldn't have felt anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was supposed to have my second surgery to reconnect my extensor tendon on my thumb, which I cut with an angle grinder, but it got postponed.
The put me under general anesthesia each time for this.
But when I was younger, my mom got kicked by a horse on her forearm, it broke in 3 places and they had to put a plate or 2 with pins in. But instead of anesthesia, the gave her a (beta?) blocker, which just numbed her entire arm for a week. When I asked my doctor if this was an option, they told me that would be over kill?
Could you explain why? I know it takes a great deal of effort for you to anesthetize people, I would just assume a block would be easier?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did it really stay numb for a week? That seems unlikely, a nerve block would normally last around 6-12 hours. This type of anaesthetic is called regional anaesthesia - you block the area that surgery is performed on whilst then remaining awake. Sometimes we do it just for pain relief and still do a general or sedation, but with a good block you can do entire surgeries with an awake patient. A good example is a Caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia, where they’re numb from about the nipple level down.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons for doing a block over general. General carries more risk unless you’re unfamiliar with performing the block in question. If you have any underlying heart or lung conditions, it’s often favourable to do a block as the awake patient has the least disturbance to their circulation/ventilation. A block also provides excellent pain relief post op without the need for sedative painkillers like opioids.</p>
<p>It’s not an overkill to do a block, but it requires specialist knowledge and technique. Every anaesthetist can perform a general but only some are good at blocks, especially peripheral ones like arm and leg. It also takes time to work - at least 20-30 minutes. A hospital needs to be set up for this so that the block can be performed and someone can watch the patient whilst you’re getting on with something else. Otherwise that 20-30 mins is wasted time, if you get me. In most cases it’s just easier to get someone off to sleep if they’re healthy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a nerve block done for removing hardware from a previous ORIF surgery. Removed a plate and some screws and a &quot;k wire&quot;. They poked me in my shoulder area and my arm was legit dead weight until I woke up the next day. </p>
<p>I was actually surprised at how much arms actually weigh and how much we unconsciously hold our own bodies up.</p>
<p>I don't remember the surgery because they gave me some feel good medicine. They said they didn't put me under general but I still felt nauseous when it was over so maybe they lied. The last thing I remember is being in what I assume was the surgery room (i don't remember how I got there) and saying &quot;its really cold in here, how do you guys work in here?&quot; Then weight put on me which I assume was blankets and then I &quot;woke up&quot; in the recovery room. </p>
<p>Did they bamboozle me?</p></div>		</li>
