			<div class="markdown"><p>im not into chemistry that much but is more a physical thing right?  I understand that gallium enters into the spaces between metal crystals (like capillary action) and that makes it weaker, please correct me if I'm wrong</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The line between physics and chemistry gets a little blurry for the properties of solid materials, but describing the matrix that forms when two metals combine to make an alloy and investigating the energy barrier of the transition are both as much chemical questions as anything else. The thermodynamic behavior is guided by how much strain alloying puts on the matrix, in comparison to the native strain of the pure metals, and the kinetics and activation energy are determined by the work functions of the two metals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your understanding is better than the (currently) top-rated answer by Cerian_Alderoth. As discussed by Sakai and Koizumi in &quot;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705811002955" target="_blank">Time dependent embrittlement of poly crystalline Ag by liquid Ga</a>,&quot; for example, gallium diffuses into aluminum via the grain boundaries (which are always regions of relatively poor bonding in polycrystals) and further weakens the bonding, reducing the energy penalty of breaking those bonds
entirely and creating a new surface, which is the defining characteristic of brittleness. In fact, the authors note that ductility returns after the gallium diffuses into the bulk lattice of the grains, again in contradiction to the other answer but consistent with your understanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010938X14001838" target="_blank">An investigation on the effects of chemical etching, heat treatment and their interaction with gallium-aluminum embrittlement</a> similarly found that subjecting gallium-aluminum alloys to alkaline chemical attack (preferentially eroding the aluminum and therefore enriching grain boundaries with gallium):</p>
<p>1) only caused embrittlement at temperatures above the melting point of gallium (showing the reliance of the behavior on the presence of liquid gallium as opposed to gallium in solid solution);</p>
<p>2) only caused embrittlement for alloys above a particular gallium concentration (somewhere above 100 ppm of gallium) adequate to produce high concentrations of liquid gallium at the grain boundaries;</p>
<p>3) caused embrittlement that could be reversed after heat treatment (in this case at 600 deg C), which allowed the gallium to diffuse back into the aluminum lattice</p>
<p>Also of interest is that they <em>also</em> found that embrittled grains of Al had a substantial reduction of surface Ga concentration after 12 days of storage at room temperature, agreeing with Sakai and Koizumi that room-temperature diffusion is fast enough to relieve embrittlement within a &quot;reasonable&quot; amount of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good reference. The return of ductility is demonstrating the solubility of Ga into Al nicely.</p>
<p>Do you have a good visualization in mind for the mechanism with which Ga &quot;diffuses into aluminum via the grain boundaries&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Metals form mixtures with other metals, and the products are called alloys (e.g. brass, pewter, any gold that's less than 24 karat). Alloys are formed by melting the metals and mixing them together. Gallium and Mercury are liquids, so they can do this at room temperature. The resulting alloy will lose the strength of the original metal and be brittle.</p></div>		</li>
