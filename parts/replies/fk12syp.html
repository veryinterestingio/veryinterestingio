			<div class="markdown"><p>It implies the possibility of an infinite universe. With our current technology we have no way of actually knowing. Part of the issue is that beyond the &quot;edge&quot; of the observable universe, there is enough space that is expanding between us and the edge that the matter is moving away from us faster than the speed of light (relative to earth). So the light from that matter will never reach us no matter how long we wait. Until we can overcome that hurdle, we will likely not have an answer to the size of the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. There are closed manifolds that can be flat.</p>
<p>If you consider 2D manifolds (surfaces), a torus is such an example. A 2D torus embedded in 3D is always curved. But you can embed a 2D torus in 4D in such a way that it is everywhere flat.</p>
<p>Similarly there are closed 3D manifolds that are flat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it doesn't.  If the universe was curved that would imply a finite universe, but with all evidence pointing to it being flat, we don't have any way of telling if it's infinite or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed we don't know. We are able measure lower limits of the curvature. And  from this we know at least, if it isn't infinite it is muuuuuuuch bigger than then observable.</p>
<p>A principle of practical physics is, if we don't know for sure, we take the mathematically simpler case as truth (for now).</p>
<p>And since we only know curvature is zero or a very tiny number. Assuming zero makes everything simpler.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While assuming zero simplifies everything and we like simplification, wouldnâ€™t even the smallest departure from zero change the universe from flat to curved, and should therefore not be ignored?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As soon there is proof able evidence for, yes. Otherwise it's no.</p>
<p>Physics is in the end just &quot;this is the simplest way to describe the things we are observing&quot;.</p>
<p>Take it with Einstein, &quot;Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler&quot;.</p>
<p>However yes, I agree sometimes when people say &quot;the universe is infinite&quot; it's a little cut short. There are even more interesting things, like alternatives to general relativity, that would change things in extreme cases dramatically (like insides of black holes) however unfortunately, with all currently doable experiments/observations, they yield the same results... and until then the mathematically much simpler general relativity is considered to be the true one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We may never know for sure, but we can have higher and higher degrees of confidence as we make predictions based on the assumption that the universe is flat, and those predictions are then tested. It is possible that the universe is just insanely, incomprehensibly big but not infinite.</p></div>		</li>
