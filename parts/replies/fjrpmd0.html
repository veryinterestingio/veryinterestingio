<p>Don't think that is entirely true. Perhaps it varied by state or region. I lived in Washington state in the mid-50s. I would get on my bicycle and ride roadsides looking for bottles that I would pick up and turn in for the deposit. When living in Texas in early 60s, we would go to the ice house to by a softdrink and peanuts. The ice house guy would not charge us the deposit if we drank the softdrink there and put the bottles back in the crate.</p>
<p>Now recently, our waste management company has announced it will no longer accept glass as part of recycle pickup. I mentioned this at the grocery store to the guy that stocks the beer. He had been wondering why bottled beer wasn't moving but canned beer was.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that while we are recycle conscious we have not really developed a strong recycle infrastructure.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In British Columbia, Beer is still largely sold in the &quot;Industry Standard Bottle&quot; (a long-neck screw-top beer bottle), and the bottles are collected, cleaned and refilled. A typical beer bottle will make it through the system 10 to 15 times before it fails inspection, gets lost, or broken.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They had been rinsed and refilled so many times that every bottle had wear marks around the waist and bottom where they lightly touched the assembly line rollers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not true. In the 70's they became required by law in some states, but some bottles in the 60's also had deposits. They were washed and refilled.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is 100% false, in fact it is the opposite of the truth, up until the 70s almost all bottles were returnable for a deposit. </p>
<p>Source: I used to collect them in the 60s, when I was a kid for candy money. Any grocery store would take them.</p></div>		</li>
