			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard of something like this. Something like, while running, the timing between your leg stretching and you exhaling, which causes your diaphragm to move back up, possibly stretches a connecting tissue. Perhaps inhaling, thereby dropping the diaphragm, while your leg extends to hit the ground, provides extra slack for the connecting tissue to stretch. It's always been my right side for me, can't really say if that works or not.</p></div>		</li>
