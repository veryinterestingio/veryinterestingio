			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s also mostly bumpkis.
Both in terms of accuracy and clarity.</p>
<p>There are various causes of “random pains” but they’ll generally have to do with molecular noise and threshold of response.</p>
<p>For your typical person I would expect that the excess noise is more likely to come from the periphery.  Though there are certainly examples that show that central noise can trigger pain experience (e.g. phantom limb).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm honestly not sure if you're trying to correct what the person you replied to said. But you honestly just explained exactly what he said, but in a weird, obtuse and arrogant way. The only real honest answer anybody can give for OP's question is &quot;we don't know the full answer&quot;. But the answer the previous person gave quite nicely and simply explained one facet of the reasons.</p>
<p>edit:</p>
<p>If anybody wants to know what this man just said this is it. Noise in this context refers to any signal coming into or going out of the nervous system (NS) that your brain doesn't really care about. Example very light wind blowing on your arm, can be considered noise to your sensory NS and your brain can kinda just tune it out. When he said periphery he just meant peripheral NS, which just means not your Brain. Central (brain) noise refers to signals coming from the brain example emotional feelings that are being sent as signals throughout your body that can create some 'noise' that may affect other sensory nerves. Threshold just refers to the fact that your neurons won't transmit a signal unless the voltage difference of that signal is high enough. He honestly just explained what the first commenter said.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. I went to the Dr. because my heart was hurting multiple times a day, occasionally to the point where I was wondering if I was going to have a heart attack. I would also feel random pains in my left arm too so google convinced me I was going to have a heart attack. The Dr. checked everything out and said my heart was fine and it was most likely caused by anxiety/stress.  It still happens today but I just have to tell myself it’s stress, which can be pretty hard to do </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What helped me about this was I eventually said &quot;fuck this.&quot;  And set out to convince myself it was in my head/stress related or just random pain for whatever reason.  I went on a 4 day backpacking trip at the bottom of the Grand Canyon.  The hike out of the canyon was 3 miles uphill in sand.  I was wearing 30lbs and at the end I was sucking so much wind and my heart was like a double bass drum for 2 straight hours when the end of the hike became switchbacks and really intense.  I survived and the next day never felt better about my health.  It gave me the peace of mind that no way was my heart weak or it would have exploded.  Also intense workout is a huge stress reducer.  I rather would have had a heart attack and died and just got it out of the way than live every day paranoid that I was having a heart attack.  It's funny too because I used to HATE flying... but again I just force myself to do it and in my head basically say &quot;I'd rather do awesome shit and maybe die in a plane crash and all my worries be over rather than live in fear and never confront it and be 80 and shitting myself and dying of cancer or something prolonged and awful and just full of regret from never leaving home and just waiting to die.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol this is exactly what I'm going through. Weird chest pains. Heart beating fast. Getting winded easily. Doc said everything is good. I'm about to say fuck it as well and go back to working out. Waiting for the life insurance policy to kick in first though lol. Glad you are feeling better. The anxiety of it is a real bitch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was literally hooked up to an ECG yesterday for chest pain which is either constant or just comes in waves. Everything was fine. By the time I got home from the doctor's office it was radiating down the left side of my torso, together with constant flowing gases and gurgling sounds coming from my digestive tract at almost all hours of any given day. I'm trying to convince myself everything's cool but as you said can be pretty hard, especially when the pain feels so physical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel a lot  like this when I eat something I’m allergic to. I don’t go into anaphalaxis, because the allergy isn’t that bad, but my stomach gurgles, bad pain comes in waves, usually as a sharp cramp on my left side, sometimes I get nausea, headaches, and I get mentally kinda fuzzy for a while. Sometimes it will make my heart hammer, but it has also made my blood pressure drop. </p>
<p>Eaten anything weird lately? Everyone’s a doctor on the Internet!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the exact same thing go on yesterday, except for the gurgling sounds. Doc said it was spasms in the muscles between my ribs. Wacky stuff can go on in there that you just don't think about because you're not physically in control of those muscles. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer. Neurons meet and exchange information when they aren’t supposed to sometimes. If some neuron happens to intersect with another neuron connect to a pain receptor (nociceptor) then you might feel a very slight and inexplicable pain.  </p></div>		</li>
