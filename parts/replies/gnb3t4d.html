			<div class="markdown"><p>It's definitely a bad idea to ignore a cavity...the fixes only work when the cavity is relatively minor. If it goes all the way through to the interior of the tooth you're at much higher risk of losing the tooth and infection...and infections in your jaw are extra bad because of proximity to your brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Infections in the jaw are generally bad not so much because of their proximity to the brain, but because of their proximity to the airway. An infection that is left alone for too long with nowhere to drain can cause ludwigs angina, which is a swelling of the submandibular soft tissue that can close of your airway and kill you</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The honest answer is that we didn't used to understand how much dental health affected the rest of our health. Dental work was seen as a purely cosmetic item, and so wasn't covered as part of normal healthcare.</p>
<p>Now that we understand how the role of oral health affects our bodies as a whole, the reason dental hasn't become merged in with the remainder of healthcare is a combination of inertia and a resistance of profitable companies to becoming less profitable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Cavities are permanent because you don't regrow enamel...it's not like bone, it can't heal. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It actually does. Your saliva contains minerals that re-deposit onto your teeth all the time. Under a natural diet, this is enough to replenish what's lost to the small amounts of acid produced by normal oral bacteria.</p>
<p>But in a high-sugar modern diet, the erosion due to acid greatly outpaces the rate of healing. It's more like if you kept your arm against a piece of moving sandpaper 24/7 - it's not that your arm can't heal, it's that it can't heal <em>fast enough</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it can't repair damage that destroys the actual crystal structure of the enamel (because it has to deposit on top of that existing structure). But the breach is caused by erosion outpacing deposition for a little while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weirdly enough, even though they say it doesnt, plaque actually protects your teeth. I saw something on tv about it once and there was a family, the father and son got plague buildup very quickly, and a lot of it, more than average, but the mother never got it, they all have good oral hygiene, but get this. The mother had a shed load of cavities, and the father and son, not one. The dentist on the show explained that it's the plaque that's protecting the teeth because it's hard it can withstand a lot of grief. He said if you get it though, dont just leave it there forever, always get it removed once every six months, if you do this then the parts if the teeth under the plaque build up actually stay protected because of it. I get it at the back of my bottom teeth, I think its cuz of the fact that's where the saliva in my mouth is the most, but I'll admit, that part of my teeth are crazy healthy compared to where u dont get it. This father and son though were an extreme case, like it would come back within a couple weeks I think after removal and theyd get it on the tops of their teeth, where they meet, you know like where you chew and are more likely to get cavities. The presenter of the show then went to a museum to see the skulls of people from the past, cavemen etc, and not one of them had cavities, these was shown skulls of people from around the time sugar was introduced, cavity city. I remember the presenter saying how crazy it was that a caveman had better teeth than she did, and shes always at the dentist and trying to look after her teeth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was actually recently wondering the opposite question. My grandparents (now dead/over 100 years old) lost all their teeth by their sixties and had full dentures the last thirty plus years of their lives. But my parents, now about seventy, don't have major teeth problems and may never need dentures.</p></div>		</li>
