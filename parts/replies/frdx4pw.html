			<div class="markdown"><p>when does the potato grow tho? I don't know much of farming, but my understanding was that you get a potato you cut it in smaller parts and plant those part and they grow more potatoes, but for that the smaller parts should grow to potato size at some point in that process, no?</p></div>		</li>
