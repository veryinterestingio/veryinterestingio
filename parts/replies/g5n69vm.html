			<div class="markdown"><p>I am someone who tends to have anxiety and this seems pretty accurate to me. I have never understood why people liked caffeine - it has always made my heart race, cold sweat, anxiety shoot up, etc. It's a terrible feeling. And it's not all just in my head (whatever that's supposed to mean), there have been occasions when I consumed something that I didn't realize contained caffeine, and a few minutes later I started to feel weird and notice my heart racing. I couldn't understand how some people could drink several cups of coffee, let alone just one, without their heart exploding or going into full panic mode. It's nice to see someone else say that it really is affecting my body differently. You wouldn't believe how annoyed/defensive some people get when they find out I don't drink coffee. It's the same sort of reactions I get when they find out I don't drink alcohol. I guess people like sharing their vices with others, and they don't seem to believe me when I say that caffeine and alcohol make me feel like total shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Truth told, I was one of those people. I never understood why someonw would not love the rich joy that is coffee, and could easily go through 6 cups in a day.</p>
<p>Then i sort've started losing it to anxiety and at first, I'd start clenching my teeth and be tense.. then later, full blown &quot;am i having a heart attack&quot; panics. Had to stay away from coffee.</p>
<p>However, I am very contrary by nature.</p>
<p>I realized that humans are the only animal in the world that can cause themselves anxiety. No other animal would waste its time.</p>
<p>I realized anxiety is just my brain talking shit about me because I cannot get my way. Me raging and stressing over things I have no say in or control over.</p>
<p>Basically me being a whiney little bitch. And avoiding coffee is just mitigating the symptoms, not fixing the problem.</p>
<p>I won't judge you for avoiding coffee and alcohol. I can't say I understand why you'd deny yourself an experience, but then I don't know your life.</p>
<p>What I WILL say is if you have so much anxiety that a single coffee will put you over the top, caffeine is not your issue. Talk to someone and use it to learn to let go what you have no control over. Life is just way too short to live it being afraid and thin-skinned all the time.</p></div>		</li>
