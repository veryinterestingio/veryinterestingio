			<div class="markdown"><p>Ophthalmologist here; to add to the answer about chimerism (which has been observed in eyes and genetically confirmed with unilateral retinitis pigmentosa) a more commonplace scenario would be lyonisation. This occurs in females, and involves effective silencing of one X chromosome in each cell. In general it is random and so the cell population should end up about 50:50 for each of a female's 2 X chromosomes. In some people it favours one over the other in different parts of their body. Red and green cone photoreceptors both derive their wavelength sensitivity from genes on the X chromosome, and these genes are highly variable. (Blue cones are chromosome 7). If a female has a good X chromosome and a colourblind X chromosome then the one eye colourblind situation could arise due to uneven lyonisation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool.  This answers my question.  It is outside my area of specialty... but knowing about X silencing and that some of the photoreceptor genes are on the X chromosome had me wondering if that could happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could be twin chimerism (as described above) or optic nerve damage (as described in other replies). Another possiblity is a different type of chimerism in which the mother's cells invade a developing fetus, creating a patchwork of cells mixed throughout the body. Another posiblity is that you are XX male. This occurs when the genes (especially the SRY gene) for sexual development cross over from the Y to X chromosome during meiosis. In that case, you'd have the same X chromosome deactivation described above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m a chimera but I am not colorblind in either eye, although I’m right handed and left eye dominant, and my right eye literally sucks ass at picking up light in extreme darkness (pretty much goes blind in the dark if I game too long or stare at my phone).</p>
<p>Aside from eyesight I’ve got two different eye lash colors and my stomach hair is lighter on my right side and darker on the left, which really makes the “line” in the center of my abdomen look easily apparent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would have sucked, I’m not even sure that’s entirely possible, but it’d be terrifying and interesting all at the same time.</p>
<p>Either way, the biggest thing about eye dominance for me was hunting with firearms and archery. Left eye dominant but right handed looks weird when holding a rifle, so luckily my own father had a left-handed bolt for his 30-06 which kicked ass in comparison. I thought I was a bad shot until I just realized my eye dominance is wildly off</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Chimerism usually splits down the middle of the body</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was under the impression that chimerism in animals could also be a mosaic condition, i.e. different patches occurring in different parts of the body. Searching for images of chimeric mice turns up patchy-looking creatures (healthy looking too) but no left/right split.</p>
<p>I've also seen the pictures of the gender chimera birds and insects that <em>are</em> half and half, but I thought mosaicism was the more common of the two.</p>
<p>Is this wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mosaicism is two genetically distinct cell lines that arose from one zygote. Chimerism is from two zygotes. So an ophthalmologist gave an example of lyonisation of the X chromosome as an example above. If you are female and have color blind genes on one of your X chromosomes, you end up with color blindness in one eye due to inactivating the ‘good’ X chromosome in that eye. The other eye inactivates the ‘bad’ X chromosome and you end up as a mosaic of one normal eye and one color blind eye. But all the genetic material of the person came from one zygote.</p>
<p>As for ‘sides’ that really depends on when and where the cells join the zygote. They are going to take on an identity of their location. For instance if you put a cell into the mesoderm of the gastrula then you’ll find those ‘foreign’ cells in muscles throughout the body. How far they extend depends on timing of insertion. At gastrula stage, you’d probably find the ‘foreign’ cells on a single side of the body. If you added a foreign cell to the embryo during the early morula stage when there’s fewer than 32 cells, that foreign cell will probably be widely distributed (depending on the class of the organism, i.e. animal, plant, fungus and their division patterns).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mosaicism is a little different. It's when you get populations of cells with different genotype/phenotype, however they all originate from one initial cell or cell population, and become different through some form of mutation or cell division issue during development. Depending when that happens the patches will be of different sizes. In the case of one colourblind eye, there would have to be a colourblind causing mutation in a cell whose fate is to differentiate into the cells of one retina and not the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get what you're saying. My use of &quot;mosaic&quot; in this context was wrong, and I have seen the other answer about different X chromosomes activating, making a person's two eyes end up with different qualities.</p>
<p>But back to chimerism in general, is it really the case that chimerism is more likely to be left/right split than &quot;patchy&quot;? And what are the correct terms for both of those variants?</p></div>		</li>
