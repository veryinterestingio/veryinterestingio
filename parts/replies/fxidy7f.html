			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds awful, I hope you are doing better now! I lost my dad last Christmas after a long, painful decline in his health so we could prepare - I cannot imagine what a sudden loss like this must feel like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly its taken me awhile. I had a few cycles through the grieving process over plenty of years. But I finally accepted it and I'm doing good. I'm sorry about your Dad. The slow decline is just as hard. I imagine probably very tiresome. Holidays are even harder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah well, I dreaded it for years and the last months were just in the ICU, with endless repetitions of hope and despair. It made me mentally prepare for the worst. But the end was just as sudden, now that I think of it. He was recovering from a dangerous life-saving transplant, but suddenly deteriorated within 12 h due to pneumonia. It was a cruel end to an emotional roller-coaster.</p>
<p>Glad to hear you're doing better now! I don't know when or how I'll get over it, I can only hope to do so as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A much beloved cousin in law was diagnosed with stage four cancer six weeks ago.  We’re old.  Three weeks ago he died of a heart attack while in the hospital to try to get his first chemo.  We were and are in complete shock.  Mourning is here.  But the cruelly sudden diagnosis followed by the sudden heart attack feels cruelly “unfair” and surreal.  Partly we mourn for the endearing love between my cousin and cousin in law.  Very saddened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, surreal is the right word. With my dad he actually seemed to have beat the odds and recover after a dangerous double-transplant that could save him. We actually wanted to congratulate him and celebrate Christmas together - then on Christmas eve we got the message that he's in bad shape with pneumonia. 12 h later he was gone. Just... hard to comprehend. </p>
<p>I hope you find the right way to deal with the loss of your cousin in law, especially when it was so sudden. But it'll hurt for a while, I guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And sometimes the opposite? I can’t tell you the day my dad died; and I have to do some mental gymnastics to even tell you the month. I don’t know if it’s my ADHD, or my brain just wants to forget. But I still remember the pain so vividly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only during times when we loose someone people react that way. Rarely anyone asks a simple question &quot;would you like me to keep you company or do you prefer to be alone&quot;. Everybody copes differently with suffering and sadness, but there is always at least one person who thinks that she/he knows better and does basically what's in his/her opinion best way to deal with those kind of emotions</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So true. It's when the cards, visits and phone calls stop when people really struggle. When people are left alone to sit with their thoughts. Your right everybody has their own way of coping with things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My grandma had this exact response when my grandpa died. She was inconsolable at first, and of course, everyone is coming over and calling. I stayed with her for a few months so she could get used to being without him (they were married for 58ish years) and she had gotten married to him at 16 (it was the South in 1960, different time) so she literally had only known life with him and had been with him longer than she had been with anyone. She spent her formative teen years as a young bride and mother, so to have that ripped away by a combination of dementia and general failing health when she was 76 nearly destroyed her. </p>
<p>When the calls stopped, that was almost like the greiving started again, but it was more of a sadness than a despair like it was in the days after he died. </p>
<p>When she just had time, the unyielding time of life to think about everything, it was rough for her. </p>
<p>She's doing alright now, it's been a year, but some days are still rough for her. She can talk about it without breaking down now.</p></div>		</li>
