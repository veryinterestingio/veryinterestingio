			<div class="markdown"><p>The post has been deleted, but I already know the video that was linked. Technology Connections is a great youtube channel. </p>
<p>He's got a dry delivery and discusses some minor tech in detail, but it's interesting. </p>
<p>He turns anything into a pretty good story. The other day I watched the FIVE part series on RCA's CED (failed competitor to LaserDisc/VHS) and LOVED it.  He's also made me hate my toaster. Amazing.</p></div>		</li>
