			<div class="markdown"><p>“Gordon Murray, creator of the McLaren F1, originally saw his creation as the ultimate road car, with no intention to take the car racing. Although the car used many racing technologies and designs, it was felt that the car should be a road car first, without any intent built into the creation of the car to modify it into a racing car.”</p>

<p>Track cars are different beasts then road cars.</p>
<p>Track cars don't normally deal with oncoming traffic, only overtaking traffic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve driven a British (steering wheel on the right) car in France. I can confirm that overtaking is scary unless you have a passenger acting as spotter. You have to put most of the car into the oncoming lane before you can see if there is anything coming.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My brother had a RHD car here in eastern canada, and after going through he McDonald's drive thru backwards, they actually got mad at him, said it was dangerous and kicked him out of the drive thru. I thought it was kind of impressive having a few sharp turns in there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You either have to have a trustworthy passenger, or just accept that you won't be doing much overtaking. If you're stuck behind something slow, do the courteous thing, and leave plenty of space for other drivers to overtake you.</p></div>		</li>
