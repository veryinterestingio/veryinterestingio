<p>Given the enormous complexity of the brain and the unique role that experience plays in shaping it via its plasticity, can you say something about what strategies to take in order to figure out how it works? Even modelling individual neurons sounds dauntingly complex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While reading your excellent overview I was wondering about mimicking this model computationally and there are few questions I am left with.
What determines axons being exhiliary or inhibitary - is it their chemical properties or neuron itself knows that?
Also, are axons binary - either exhileratory or excitatory- or analog, eg some scalar that inhibits being negative or excites being positive, but has greater effect for being larger scalar, zero having no effect in either direction?
Does neuron fire equally into all outgoing neurons or it can vary some signal parameter into each outgoing axon?
Can new axons be formed and if so how often does it happen? Or if all axons are created with new neuron, then is it just outgoing or incoming ones?</p></div>		</li>
