<p>Maybe itâ€™s load specific, but Iâ€™ve heard of drivers getting fired for stopping and picking up something stupid from the side of the road and changing the overall weight of the load.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The average weight of the product for a full load of sweet corn is around about 44,000 lbs. I've never seen any product with 25,000 lbs of ice. Too much ice can damage the product and not enough, well I'm sure you see where that's going.</p></div>		</li>
