			<div class="markdown"><p>Plastic pulled out of the ocean should be worth more than plastic from a recycling bin as it's not mixed with a bunch of other shit. From what I gather sorting the trash it what makes recycling it so expensive unless labor is virtually free.   </p>
<p>A lot of the oceanic trash comes from a few sources A lot of countries can't afford the public works infrastructure for dealing with garbage as well as using more single serve plastic due to buying things like shampoo a week at a time vs giant bottle, it is slowly getting better as they become wealthier  and more responsive to international criticism <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/06/90-of-plastic-polluting-our-oceans-comes-from-just-10-rivers/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/06/90-of-plastic-polluting-our-oceans-comes-from-just-10-rivers/" target="_blank">https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/06/90-of-plastic-polluting-our-oceans-comes-from-just-10-rivers/</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please read your own link. This study has been misquoted many times. The study estimated the quantity of plastic entering the ocean from rivers. It does not estimate total ocean plastic, nor the percentage of river plastic to total ocean plastic. The misquoted figure actually states that of all the plastic entering the oceans from rivers, 90% comes from 10 rivers.</p>
<p>It does not state that 90% of plastic in the oceans comes from 10 rivers, regardless of the title. The author of the study, Christian Schmidt, has clarified this himself.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The funny thing is. Western countries send their trash to &quot;3rd world countries&quot; or similar for &quot;recycling&quot;. But they end up burning or dumping it back into thr natur. So sadly it's possible that in the end nothing was gained :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is likely to have been a greater legacy of dumping waste in the ocean compared to now i.e they will likely have better waste management thus less will end up in the ocean now potentially, so its worth collecting rubbish.</p>
<p>Also, if you have a tourist economy it pays to have clean beaches even if the next tide is going to bring in rubbish again.</p></div>		</li>
