<p>If it helps understanding what I meant in my question, it's origin is a conversation with my friend about the possibility of randomness, and during it came the question &quot;if the time is a dimension and the world a static object, randomness couldn't exist, as for it to exists the world would have to change outside of time&quot;</p>
<p>Now I don't know how much of it even makes sense, it's probably mostly wrong, but it did make me think if the world is a 4th dimensional stability object or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes one can describe the entire universe as a complex 4d structure if the universe indeed has 4 dimensions. And one can make the argument that time as we experience it is just a consequence of how memories work.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day this is just philosophy and we can't really &quot;prove&quot; it scientifically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Space and time are one &quot;thing&quot; called spacetime to the best understanding of modern physics.  It's not a question as to whether there are at least 4 dimensions to spacetime. We know this to be the case for a few reasons, but general and special relatively demonstrate this conclusively. </p>
<p>There might be more details and it's always subject to revision based on new data, but spacetime is one &quot;thing&quot;.</p>
<p>You can't make the argument that time is a trick of memory, again, because of relativity. Time does exist as one dimension of spacetime. </p>
<p>This is not philosophy, this is physical reality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, I guessed as much. But it still is very interesting and informing to all the different takes on the topic and the different proofs to support each stand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We experience time independent of memory though, no? Isn’t it anachronistic to say that the “present” is only understood by virtue of recalling the past? </p>
<p>I would think that “past” and “future” conceptions can only stem from experiencing and understanding the “present”</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>But... again, static means a reference to time. So if someone were &quot;outside of time&quot; they wouldn't see anything moving, anyway, because... there's no time for anything to move.</p>
<p>Again, it's like if you shrunk the world down to just a flat surface and things could only move left or right or up or down, not towards or away, it would be like asking, well then would nothing be moving towards or away?</p>
<p>If you're &quot;outside of time&quot; then there isn't time, and the idea of something being static &quot;in relation to time&quot; stops making any sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm trying to understand your question. If you're asking if someone can scientifically prove whether or not destiny exists, I don't think there's an answer.</p></div>		</li>
