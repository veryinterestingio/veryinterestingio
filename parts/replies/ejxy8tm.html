			<div class="markdown"><p>How is it that every other sport uses referees to do the same thing, then? Or the fact that we have police in civil society and don't just resort to vigilante justice? </p>
<p>It's because fans like to see the fights. Full stop. Quit trying to justify or ennoble the practice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Referees police in hockey as well. The main difference is that it’s a lot harder for someone to get a serious injury while fighting on ice. These guys are strong for sure, but ice doesn’t have much traction, so their punches won’t land as hard.
Compare that to football, if those guys with cleats got in fights they could do a lot more damage</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the rationalization, not the reason.</p>
<p>The enforcers have always been the dirtiest players. They don't prevent dirty play, they engage in it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I strongly suggest anyone interested in this topic watch Ice Guardians, a documentary about hockey enforcers. </p>
<p>Essentially, fighting is necessary because the NHL is notoriously bad at punishing players for dirty hits. Bad hits are the cause of most injuries in hockey, especially concussions. Fighting is a relatively safe deterrent (very rarely are guys injured in a fight) to dangerous hitting. If you shove someone head first into the boards what will teach you not to do it again: the NHL slapping you with a 1 game suspension or an insignificant fine, or the biggest guy on the other team kicking your ass? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because in many cases the referee can't really tell the boundary - essentially, only the two guys involved really know how it went, so informal measures can work, while formal measures will work only at the extremes where a hit was clearly okay or clearly not okay, which isn't an effective deterrent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that’s on the NHL to start properly punishing dangerous play, something they’ve historically been very bad about.</p></div>		</li>

<p>LOL. This is was the mainstream excuse used before we started to understand CTE. If the number of enforcers abusing drugs and alcohol, and even committing suicide later in life doesn't tell you something, I don't know that to say.</p></div>		</li>
