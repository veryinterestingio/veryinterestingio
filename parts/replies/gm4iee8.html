			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s even more confusing when you look at their definitions of moderate and severe:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>severe COVID-19 disease included laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and one or more of the following: signs consistent with severe systemic illness, admission to an intensive care unit, respiratory failure, shock, organ failure or death, among other factors. </p>
<p>Moderate COVID-19 disease was defined as laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and one or more of the following: evidence of pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, shortness of breath or abnormal blood oxygen saturation above 93%, abnormal respiratory rate (≥20); or two or more systemic symptoms suggestive of COVID-19.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BOTH of those sound pretty severe, especially compared to how other vaccines define a case?</p></div>		</li>

<p>SinoVac for example, was deemed 51% effective because Brazil was very strict about “effectiveness”, so because some people tested positive and had very light symptoms like a headache, those were included against efficacy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only that, the sample was fully frontline health care workers who were much more exposed to viral loads on a daily basis, not a normal sample. Both, the fact that they were strict about effectiveness and that they used the most difficult sample were left out in the media, so now people don't trust the efficacy and compare them to 95% moderna.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The important thing is, not a single vaccine so far has failed to prevent or significantly reduce death and hospitalization</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have they not? Or have they just not <em>proven</em> they do so?</p>
<p>I honestly haven't kept up on the stats, but it seems hard to reconcile the idea that a vaccine that is &quot;95% effective&quot;, no matter how the numbers are fudged, could have no effect whatsoever on death rates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The data isn't out on whether or not they've reduced those rates. Out of the few who got the vaccine and got COVID, I don't think many (if any) died from it.</p>
<p>That being said, many other things are lowering those numbers. If you look at worldometer, the rate of death is not increasing linearly with the rate of infection. It went up, sure... but no where near the level in which case rates did. </p>
<p>From April to June we peaked at 35k cases while deaths peaked at 2751. About 8%. However in January we peaked at 308k cases on the 8th. 3 day rolling avg peaked at 285k. 8% of 285 is 22,000. However, the <em>actual</em> death 3 day average peaked at 4200. </p>
<p>The mortality rate dropped from 8% to 1.5%. </p>
<p>I checked the Mass.gov (I'm from Mass). Our hospitalization rate didn't hit where it was in April of last year despite our daily case count dwarfing April of last year.</p>
<p>While the numbers aren't good still, the vaccine will only make them better. Right now, 10% of the pop has got at least 1 dose.</p></div>		</li>
