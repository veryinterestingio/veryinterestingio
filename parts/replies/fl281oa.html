<p>one factor is that, once people are infected, they become (im simplifying) either dead or immune.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this because the immune system can recognise and attack the virus faster?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cells are literally called memory b cells which remain in the body for decades and they remember which antibodies are effective against a virus after the primary infection. This means upon reinfection, as soon as the memory b cells come into contact with the virus they promote the correct antibodies to come and deal with it, so if working correctly you wouldn't even notice that you've been reinfected. </p>
<p>There are mechanisms some viruses have to surpass this. And viruses which mutate fast can also get past this mechanism (see influenza) but we're not sure if SARS-CoV-2 will do this yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, in the first stage the body takes a while to identify the foreign object as harmful(antigen) then it sends a bunch of different Attackers to kill it and takes a mold(antibodies)of it for future reference in case it sees it again.<br />
The second time that it encounters the virus it recognizes the antigen using the antibodies and gets to the attack and destroy phase much quicker...before the virus can multiply.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be extremely unusual. They are already developing a test to measure anti-bodies for this virus, which means anti-bodies are created, which means immunity or at least much more resistance. </p>
<p>It just not how the body works. Now there are some anti-bodies that don’t stick around forever, so it’s possible that immunity is temporary.... nevertheless, it would be immunity for a good chunk of time. Enough to get through the remainder of the pandemic this year.</p></div>		</li>
