<p>1) EARLY MARS. Mars was probably never wet and warm climatically for any substantial length of time. Instead, what was wet and warm early in the planet's history was the ground (from frequent impacts and very active volcanism), not the climate.  The climate was probably always frigid and Mars had vast surface ice covers earlier in its history. I proposed this &quot;Cold Early Mars&quot; hypothesis some 2.5 decades ago based on our fieldwork in the Arctic. It is still not widely accepted, although it has been slowly gaining support, probably because it takes time to change deeply entrenched ideas that came first (Early Mars being &quot;Earthlike&quot;, its climate being wet and warm, with &quot;oceans&quot;, etc.), especially when these ideas seem more appealing. Climate modelers actually have a hard time making Mars' climate warm early in its history, mainly because the sun was (25%) fainter back then. The problem they face is known as &quot;The Faint Early Sun Paradox&quot;. My answer to them is good news: there's no actual paradox. Early Mars' climate was cold. Don't sweat it.</p>
<p>2) SEARCH FOR LIFE ON MARS. What we are actually hoping/wanting to find on Mars is evidence for ALIEN life, that is, life that would have had a separate origin from life on Earth AND would not fit onto Earth's &quot;Tree of Life&quot; (the genetic tree that connects all life on Earth). The only way to establish that life found on Mars is alien would be to do genetics on it and show that it does not belong to Earth's Tree of Life. In order to do genetics on it, we have to find it alive (or dead only very recently; not fossilized). The only place we are likely to find anything alive on Mars today is underground, where its gets wetter and warmer as you go deeper. Until we explore the interiors of Mars' volcanoes (lava tubes) and/or drill deep (kms) into the Martian subsurface, we are unlikely to find any signature of life we can establish as ALIEN, which is the main point of the search to begin with. No amount of fossil finding at the surface of Mars will tell you for sure that you've found ALIEN life.</p>

<p>Our next steps include evaluating more exploration scenarios with robotic systems in the field, and also testing the smart glove in a pressurized spacesuit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But wouldn't it be very interesting to find non-alien life on Mars since that would be evidence that life didn't develop on Earth?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it would be either way... Yes. But finding alien life would significantly increase the chances of alien life being elsewhere in the universe. We only have a sample size of one right now, which only tells you it's possible instead of how probable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How are the chances you think that we would recognise totally alien life? I think there are good chances that it wouldn't use DNA like earth life and much off our methodology for analysing it just wouldn't work. Of cause of we found life that alien we could be reasonably sure that we actually found alien life and not some sort of contamination.</p></div>		</li>
