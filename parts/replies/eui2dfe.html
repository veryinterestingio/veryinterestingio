<p><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B004N1P3GI" target="_blank">Smitty's Glass Wax</a> might do well but not 100% sure it's safe for bare (matte) flatscreens — I'd guess it is — nor if it might leave things a little shiny.</p>
<p>Works great on glossy touchscreens and sometimes on glasses though I've found it's more of a pain than it's worth to use on optical lenses more than occasionally. Does seem to cut down on fingerprints etc and make fingers glide better for a while.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Haha no, but I have a dell xps 13 non touch and with the really thin bezels whenever I open it it leaves smudges on the top of the screen. also, on my other laptop these smudge circle spots apear and there are so many of them it's damn near impossible to clean</p>
<p>Here are the smudges and spots I'm talking about:</p>
