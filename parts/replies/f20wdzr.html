<p>TIL. How engineers came up with this idea puzzles me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Automatic: Your engine isn't connected straight to the wheels. The engine turns a sort of fan in this thick goopy stuff that blows on another fan. That makes the second fan turn, and that one is connected to the wheels. So when you stop the wheels only that second fan stops.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For completeness, there are three kinds of automatic transmissions (that I know about anyway):</p>
<ul>
<li>Torque converters, as you say</li>
<li>Dual clutch transmissions, which are a lot closer to manual transmissions except the clutching is done automatically; these will slip the clutch similarly to a manual if the car is going too slowly, or open the clutch entirely if the car is stopped</li>
<li>Continuously variable transmissions (CVTs), which I don't really know how they work. :-) (There's a belt or really probably chain between two spinning components and the diameter of one of them is changed to vary the mechanical advantage, but I don't know how.)</li>

<p>As usual with CVTs, the answer is cones! It can be either a belt or a chain kind you're describing, which is called a variable diameter pulley transmission. The belt connects two pulleys. Each pulley is comprised of two conical wheels with the points facing each other. As the cones slide apart the belt rides closer to the center. As the cones slide together the belt is forced away from the center. So one set of cones slides apart while the other set slides together, which changes the ratio of radii while keeping the belt tight.</p></div>		</li>
