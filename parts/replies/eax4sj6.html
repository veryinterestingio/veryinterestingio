			<div class="markdown"><p>That really doesn't explain anything though, because plenty of near-sighted people are in the -0.00 to -2.50 range and proposing glasses in that range would cover a large part of the population. Whether people had good or bad eyesight before is irrelevant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It a demand issue. Everyone will get presbyopia and nearly everyone will see a benefit from readers.<br />
Only a small portion of the population have both eyes the same power and within a small enough Rx to make glasses out of without needing a fancy material to keep the glasses from being ridiculously thick and heavy. </p>
<p>There is too many variations of myopia, hypermetropia, and astigmatism.<br />
There are very few variations of presbyopia (+1.00 to +2.50).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You actually <strong>can</strong> buy off the shelf glasses in fixed diopter increments. And they're absolutely awesome. Only these aren't regular everyday glasses; they're swimming goggles. I normally wear prescription glasses, and I bought cheap Chinese-made corrective swimming goggles.</p>
<p>They obviously don't match my eyes as closely as my regular glasses do. There are all sorts of obvious shortcomings. But none of that matters for this application. You can never get perfect vision through googles anyway. And it sure beats the hassle of contacts for swimming.</p>
<p>So, yes, I could imagine a small market for off the shelf glasses in a fixed number of strengths. But they would never be suitable for all day use. They'd be amazing for emergencies (e.g. lost my &quot;real&quot; glasses) though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Drug store glasses are for reading- they are not meant for distance vision. With reading glasses it is a lot easier to figure out which one is right for you. With distance glasses people could easily overminus themselves resulting in headaches. Or not get the right prescription resulting in poor distance vision which can then lead to things like car accidents. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the only answer that makes any sense. Tons of people use -2.00 glasses or less, it would make great financial sense for a drug store to carry them (just not as large of a selection as the more widely used reading glasses). The only risk I see is buying the wrong prescription and getting into an accident.</p>
<p>But there really needs to be a cheaper way to get basic glasses and I still feel like regular stores should carry them (maybe still require a prescription to buy them?). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>EDIT: read absynthekc's correction to my comment, below</p>
<p>Nice write up. Just to add, people that are truly near or far sighted are so because the shape of their eye (or retina) is deformed, which distorts images. Prescription glasses are needed to adjust for this deformity to allow them to see at all distances. Age-related presbyopia is due to essentially a thickening of the retina which prevents the eye from focusing on close up objects. To fix this, glasses don't need to adjust for any deformity or anything, they just need to magnify an image at arms length since the eye can't focus closer. If someone with true far sightedness tried to use store-bought glasses, it would only magnify a blurry image, as these glasses do not &quot;fix&quot; the distortion in the image, only magnify it.</p>
<p>Also, not being able to see at distance is more of a hazard for driving, so there is an added benefit to ensuring that people with near sightedness get the exact right prescription.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, here’s a little more info, that might contradict some of your preconceptions. The total refractive power of the eye that constitutes vision has 3 modifiers: the cornea, the lens and the retina. Refractive errors (aka prescriptions) are a compounding result of those three structures. Like many have said the corneal shape plays a role, it is essentially the window to your eye, the lens is another structure that is suspended behind your pupil by many small strands that help flex the lens, called the zonule. Lastly, The retina is where the image coming into your eye is projected upon. </p>
<p>Myopia and hyperopia are affected by cornea, lens and back of the retina, as well as overall length of the eye. </p>
<p>Presbyopia is ONLY related to changes within the lens that do not allow it to accommodate, or flex/change shape that is needed to change focus. NOT thickening of the retina. These age related changes effectively leave the eye in focus at only one focal length. That focal length can range from a small distance from your face all the way up to infinity. The folks that are left with a focal length at infinity can see from about 3-4 feet away and further clearly. They are the folks that will need reading glasses to focus on anything closer.</p>
<p>I want to keep it simple and understandable. There are other factors at play such as astigmatism etc that I am deliberately not addressing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait. If presbyopia is an unavoidable, well-known consequence of aging, why do books for adults have a smaller font than ones for kids and teens? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Presbyopia usually doesn’t set in until the age of 40+.  Kids are also developing their reading skills and may have more trouble when the pages are too information dense (cognitive process not vision issues). There are also large print books for adults with poor vision. </p></div>		</li>
