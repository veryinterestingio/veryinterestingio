			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. It's also why mood disorders often have physical effects in the body despite being an &quot;invisible&quot; illness of the brain. Intense emotions of any kind can wreck havoc on the body, especially the abdominal region, if done continuously and without relief, and it's one of the theorized reasons why mood disorders often create eating disorders of some kind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacking on this comment to say that while we know pretty little regarding the relationship between specific neurotransmitters and resultant physical responses in the larger scheme of things, we do know that serotonin regulation is related to feelings of anxiety, and between 80-95% of serotonin receptors in the nervous system are located in the gut/bowels.
