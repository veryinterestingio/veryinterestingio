			<div class="markdown"><p>The antiperspirant deodorant also causes the yellow pit stains in your clothes. I donâ€™t really have a sweating problem, so I always avoid antiperspirants and my shirts last much longer because of that. My white shirts that are two years old still look brand new and have no pit stains.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it would matter how prone to sweating you are. I regularly wear arm and hammer antiperspirant and I work as a manufacturer, I almost never get moisture in my armpits. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever had a sweat stain</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends too on application. People really cake that shit on, which results in much worse stains but also ironically undermines its effectiveness.</p>
<p>It doesn't take much, folks. Just a light layer of coverage--one good swipe, two at most.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't strictly true. Some antiperspirants can cause yellowing, but yellow stains on clothing are also directly from human sebum in sweat. A molecule called squalene in sebum deposits on cloth and over time oxidises leaving a yellow fatty deposit which is really hard to wash out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I dunno. My shirts all had out stains then I stopped using deodorant and no stains. I even wore those shirts to the gym. I donâ€™t sweat a lot in general so thatâ€™s probably why I only have issues with antiperspirants ruining my shirts.</p></div>		</li>
