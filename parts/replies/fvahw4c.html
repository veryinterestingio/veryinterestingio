			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much this. In simpler terms, you’re temporarily relieving your muscles which feels great. However, over time those muscles will shrink and be unable to support your spine. This won’t happen in days or weeks, but over the long term the more you slouch the weaker you get and the better it feels - it’s a cycle.</p>
<p>Edit: the best way to build your muscles back up to normal is just to focus on standing or sitting with good posture. It would be considered “exercise specificity” to just use your spinal stabilizer muscles as they were intended. It will feel uncomfortable for weeks or months relearning how to stand and sit. </p>
<p>Actually, Kelly Starret has a good book about it called “Deskbound” it covers all of this at length and is very simple to understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Passively: sitting on chairs that don’t have backs to lean against, being conscious of your posture when you sit and stand, and stretching and changing position regularly so you stay flexible and no one part takes the lions share of the strain every day. </p>
<p>Actively: look into exercises for your core and back. Body weight work is enough to get you healthy, so you can do it without any massive buy in. Yoga is a good place to start.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For beginners : bridging, planking (not the dumb fad, a core exercise plank), bird-dogs, and supermans. For advanced: sit in a chair, feet wide apart, and hug / hold a weighted object close to your body. Starting in an upright position, slowly lean forward at your hips, keeping your back straight and tensed as well as your abs tensed, and then slowly sit back upright applying the same principles. Think about leaning forward slowly for roughly 5 seconds to achieve a full forward bend, and 5-10 seconds to return to the starting position. As always, if there’s any concern consult a doctor before beginning a more strenuous exercise routine if you’re new.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, it depends on the amount of time you’re sitting. If it’s over an hour, using lumbar support probably goes a longer way. No matter how strong your low back is, it’ll fatigue when trying to support you for hours. Strong low back muscles are more important for lifting heavy loads from the ground, and more acute bouts of strength. Arguably it’ll be helpful for shorter bouts of sitting too.</p>
<p>Also, sitting with “good” posture isn’t military posture (full lumbar lordosis), but probably around 10% forward flexion from that. If you go too far the other way from slumped posture, you end up “hanging out” on the facet joints. Your body likes neutral positions, not end range positions.</p>
<p>Also, what the other commenters said for strengthening is great!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an older person with back issues, I can confirm this.</p>
<p>REALLY enjoy sitting, but the more I sit, the more back pain I have when standing. </p>
<p>Gotta actively stretch/exercise to keep they cycle balanced (and keep the pain away.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes so much sense. So then the goal is to keep your muscles strong enough that they can support good posture for long periods? Is that a realistic goal?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hopping on this to say that there is no evidence to suggest that 1. 'bad' posture causes back/neck pain and/or that 2. practicing 'good' posture helps back/neck pain.</p>
<p>Strengthening + graded activity are the only 'proven' prevention strategies and treatment.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it helps, after literally born on a computer and consoles, I started working out, PROPERLY, since 2014 and that was the only thing legitimately helped in any quantifiable manner. </p>
<p>Again, different strokes for different folks, but for me and my partner and a lot of my friends, working out was the catalyst. </p>
<p>But just before i end this comment, these workouts are not a cookie cutter solution too. I responded really well to swimming+weights. My partner basically fixed her slouch with yoga. Another one of my friends did it by switching to bicycles and another with pure weights. It will depend on what feels best to you. And contrary to popular belief, trying workouts or sports to figure out if they work is really fun! It's like trial runs of winrar if winrar gave you better health everytime you said no to the donate button. ʘ‿ʘ</p>
