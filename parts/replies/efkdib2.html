			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not 100% accurate.</p>
<p>The Wii used the same CPU uArch as the Gamecube, but that is not why it was less powerful than the competitors hardware.  It was less powerful than the Xbox 360 and PS3 because it was designed to be.  It ran at a lower clock speed, had less memory, and a weaker GPU than the competition.  But the underlying CPU architecture was PowerPC, the same CPU uArch that the Xbox 360 did (and partly in the PS3).</p>
<p>Nintendo has had a history of making consoles that were based around older and lower end parts.  They do this for a lot of reasons, but it mostly comes down to a corporate belief that games are good because they are good games, not because they are using the latest in graphics and CPU technology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The non-PR reason is that Nintendo wants to remain price competitive with their competitors' hardware, but do not want to take a loss on hardware sales like their competitors.  Cutting cost is the only way to satisfy those two requirements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Remain baaaaaarely current-gen enough to be seen as a tolerably contemporary console, at a minimum viable level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree to the hardware. Nintendo have consistently been able to turn profit on new release consoles every time (AFAIK).</p>
<p>However, they are <em>losing</em> money on Joycon sales even at the price tag of $70AUD for one or $120AUD for two. Whereas XBox and PS4 controllers are sold at profit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your entire comment doesn't demonstrate parent wasn't accurate. He said &quot;it's usually not cost effective.&quot; which is simply true. There may be other reasons. Even better reasons. Makes no difference</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use a my pc as an emulator for nostalgia purposes, but my games glitch too much. For instance, on SSX Tricky my character keeps disappearing until I reboot the emulator. Sometimes it draws my character half way into the ground, etc.</p>
<p>Gregg Hastings Max’d Paintball has some weird behaviors too, but I can’t remember what they were.</p>
<p>I’d rather just buy a PS2 :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man where do you live? On ebay, the first non-bid backwards compatible PS3 is up for $125 buyout, and at my local game stores they go for $100 min, and the two I've bought in the past few years have YLOD'd and broken within months of purchase. Even pawn stores by me know to sell the backwards compatible models for 50+, and you have a 50/50 shot that it doesn't work at all.</p>
<p>Honestly was more cost effective for me to buy an XRGB mini and a PS2...</p></div>		</li>

<p>I wouldn't have thought I'd be wanting to play older games back then but we didn't have all the scummy lootboxes and microtransactions and all the rest of that back then as well.</p></div>		</li>
