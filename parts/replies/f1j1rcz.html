<p>And why doesn't it have a name yet? When do astronomers name an object? Only when they image it directly?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sagittarius A* works well enough and most things in astronomy don'y have names.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>For things in our solar system they can be named once their orbit has been determined. That said since there are over half a million known minor planets most of them don't have names.</p>
<p>Outside our solar system stars tend to be known by catalogue entries (Wolf 359, Gliese 710).</p>
<p>Black holes also tend to have catalogue entries as names (V404 Cygni, GRO J1655-40) although supermassive black holes are often refered to simply as the supermassive blackhole in whatever galaxy they are in.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So it is like as if &quot;Saturn&quot; was the name of the rings and not the planet?</p></div>		</li>
