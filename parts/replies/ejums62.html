			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to say the same. The Mohave is a “high” desert over 3000 feet, but the Colorado/Sonora desert is low elevation desert.</p>
<p>There are different plants and flowers too, at different times of the year.</p>
<p>Mohave has Joshua Trees. Sonora has Saguaro and Organ Pipe cactus. The Colorado (CA) has more sagebrush, similar to the Great Basin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is sort of true. but large swaths of the mojave are under 3000' (i live near twentynine palms at 1400') and likewise plenty of the sonoran is above 2000-3000'. has more to do with seasonal weather variables, soils, and plant life. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Responded to this above.  Death Valley and Badwater are part of the mojave.  definitely not over 3k ft.  More like 300 ft BELOW sea level.</p></div>		</li>
