			<div class="markdown"><p>Paper is like cellulose powder on a small scale. Cotton is actual cellulose fibres.</p>
<p>Imagine a tangled knot of metal cables glued together vs a big pile of metal ball bearings glued together.</p>
<p>Adding water effectively dissolves the glue.</p>
<p>You can see why the cables would stay together wheras the balls would just fall apart.</p>
<p>This is why cotton has to be woven as well. If you taken cotton fibre straight off the plant you can pull it apart easily. It only becomes strong when you weave it into cloth</p></div>		</li>
