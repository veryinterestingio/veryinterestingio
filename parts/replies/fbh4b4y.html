			<div class="markdown"><p>Was originally open to the Atlantic.  Then around 5.9 to 5.6 million years ago the Straigts of Gibraltar closed and it was cut off from the Atlantic ocean.  Over a few thousand years it slowly dried up leaving basically a massic salt dessert 10's of meters thick and 3 to 5 km below sea lvl with a few pockets of hypersaline lakes like the Dead Sea.  All that evaporated water would have caused a several meter increase in ocean levels</p>
<p>Then 5.5 million years ago the climate became wetter amd fresh water rivers running into it filling and diluting them into just extra salty, brackish, seas.</p>
<p>Then ~5.3 million years ago the Atlatic ocean broke through and flooded it entirely, known as the Zanclean Flood.  In fact the Mediterranean is still saltier than the rest of the North Atlantic. </p>
<p>For a time reference.  This all happened millions if years before the Homo genus came about.  Around the time of our last common ancestor with Gorrila and Chimpanzee</p>
<p>The Straights of Gibraltar are expected to close again with the north migration of the African plate (geological time scale)  Eventually it may even completely destroy the Mediterranean as it collides with the European Plate</p>
<p>Note:  Thanks u/NiKoAZ for peaking my interest and getting me to look more into this as I only knew the basics before</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was the best reply to one of my comments I have ever read. Thanks for typing all that out. Now I want to learn about the colliding plates closing again. If it dries up, could you imagine all the ship wrecks and history throughout the civilizations that thrived there being uncovered? Thank you again for this!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be amazing.  All those wrecks would also be perfectly preserved in salt as well.  Only have to wait ~600,000 years! Haha.</p>
<p>Happy you enjoyed it, I certainly did!</p></div>		</li>
