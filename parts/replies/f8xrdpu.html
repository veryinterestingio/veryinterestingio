			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but chemical reactions are so inefficient at releasing energy from mass that it's basically nothing. Minutephysics made a video about how we could get the most out of this using antimatter or black holes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean yes that's true, but its better to think of it as the energy having been stored as mass.  All potential energy has an  equivalent increase in mass because there is energy stored.   Nuclear fusion and fission both get thier energy not from obliterating a particle but from a more efficient arraignment of the atom itself. While mass does get lost its really just the loss of stored energy in the atom(think water going down stream/through an generator turbine)the nucleus actually shrinks. It similar to the way the electron orbits give off energy when they fall to a more stable state(also gives a loss of mass). This is why as something approaches the speed of light it increases in mass(momentum i.e. energy is being added).  Something else to consider, at the moment matter hits the event horizon of a black hole, it is traveling at the speed of light and also simultaneously disappears from the universe. Its given up ALL of its potential energy at that point and hits the lowest possible state that can be achieved , the same as matter antimatter obliteration.</p>
<p>TLDR; Energy itself has Mass</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically energy and mass are the same thing (or in other words mass is a form of energy).</p>
<p>For example , a covalent molecule, the energy in the bond contributes to the mass of the molecule. The molecule weighs more than the individual atom would due to the bound energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And even then we're still hazy on certain details.</p>
<p>In our model of the Big Bang, an equal part of Anti-matter and Regular-matter would be created... thus instantly annihilating each-other and creating a neutral state. Somehow this didn't happen. Somehow there was actually a break in the unbreakable rule of physics.</p>
<p><a href="https://home.cern/science/physics/matter-antimatter-asymmetry-problem" target="_blank">Cern</a> mentions it as the matter-antimatter asymmetry problem. Part of the LHC studies is trying to figure out exactly why there was an imbalance. Right now theories range out from there just being some sort of unknown force causing some of the anti-matter to become matter (About 1/1,000,000,000 of the big bang's total matter), or if perhaps the rule wasn't just technically, but completely broken and matter was created by the big bang. Given if it's the latter, it's understandable why conventional physics wouldn't have an answer easily, given that it's not exactly easy to recreate the sheer incomprehensible environment of the big bang.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly you should say, this is a very speculative hypothesis in theoretical physics that is all but the mainstream standard model.</p>
<p>It could be that way, but it's all but certain. Standard model is the total energy of the universe is constant and has always been the same since big bang. Where that came from, we have no idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, then, could it be accurate to say that the universe was created when this “0 energy” was divided, or forcibly separated somehow, into positive and negative portions? Still doesn’t answer the question of how that happened though.</p></div>		</li>
