<p>Edit: NVM a dude withstood 46.2 G's at one point. And with a slow enough increase, people can spend time at higher G forces</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why fat and reasonably active people who lose weight fast end up very strong - their body is so used to lifting an extra 10lbs of arm every time they move. It's like they lived with wrist weights all over their body for years, and now that it's gone, they could hike for a year with the reduced weight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that to try and replicate fat guy calves, sometimes people will wear a weighed vest for a long time. Does this do the same thing or are fat guys' calves better prepared to hold their weight since they'd have more tissue in their calves?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've noticed this a bit myself. I lost about 20% of my body mass in 6 months, and the most noticeable difference was how easy and effortless it was to run upstairs, and I can just do it again and again with no real strain. Just judging by looks, I have bigger calves than many people that actually go to the gym (my arms on the other hand look pretty thin), and all I do is run once a week.</p></div>		</li>
