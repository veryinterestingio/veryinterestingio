			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you sure about that? I mean, in science nothing is really known for certain, we just operate under hypotheses until enough evidence accumulates to show that the hypothesis couldn't possible be correct, so in that sense yeah we don't reaaaalllly know if that's what's going on with adhesions.</p>
<p>But my own experience and a review of medical literature suggest adhesions are reasonable explanations for certain types of joint immobility, and mechanical treatment based on that assumption usually clears the problem up...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very important detail: a registered massage therapist (RMT) is not the same as a masseuse. RMTs have way more training, and are like physical therapists that can help fix problems. A masseuse is often an &quot;oil-pusher&quot; who does general massage, and does not target and resolve specific medical issues. </p></div>		</li>

RMT is for Canada, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. And the Canadian license is more stringent, with more hours required in general. </p></div>		</li>
