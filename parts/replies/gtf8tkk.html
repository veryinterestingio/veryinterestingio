<p>Years ago I worked at a grocery store with a guy who claimed to be a part of a group that would drink each other's (auto correct wanted this to be escorts. I almost left it because it was funnier) blood.</p>
<p>I was always skeptical, mostly because it was gross, but now I am doubting it because of this post. Maybe he/they didn't drink enough to get sick. Or throws up at least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It takes more than a little bit. Bloody noses are usually not enough, and/or not fast enough. Like the person saying that they would suck on wounds... It would take a major wound to leak enough blood to cause nausea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That hasn't been my experience at all. I've cut my hands or arms and sucked on the wound to try to clean it up when I was younger. Additionally I've had tons of bloody noses from picking at it (terrible habit I know), and I've never vomited from ingesting blood</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nose bleed dripping down the back of the throat, that can cause some barf action.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the amount of blood. Iâ€™ve lost enough in some nose bleeds to require transfusions, and have understandably thrown up the portion of blood which flowed to my stomach. </p>
<p>Vomiting blood is a deeply ingrained reflex (similar to drinking excessively salty water). If you swallow enough you will throw it up.</p></div>		</li>
