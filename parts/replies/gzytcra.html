			<div class="markdown"><p>We once drove through a roadside “safari” in western Virginia. You can buy food in buckets and feed it to the various animals. There are all sorts of animals, including elk, which are normally the kind of animal you don’t want to be near, but the only warning signs we saw were for the zebra. </p>
<p>There were signs <em>everywhere</em>: “DO NOT FEED ZEBRA!”, “DO NOT APPROACH ZEBRA!”, “DO NOT LOOK ZEBRA IN THE EYES!”. Just kidding on the last one, but dead serious about the others. </p>
<p>The person we bought food from was like, “Yeah seriously, don’t go near the zebra. They will definitely attack you.” According to the same person, the only time they’ve ever had to call an ambulance is when a zebra managed to kick a guest through the enclosure fence. The guest got out of their car and tried to pose for a photo next to the zebra. Next thing you know… YEET!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard about a story of this one gal's mom who worked on one of those safari things, just about every time she drove in the zebra was waiting for her on the middle of the road and would not move for any reason, it'd kick at her car and bite at her if she tried to shoo it away</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given where Zebras live and the natural predators they have, they would absolutely need that temperament for survival. </p>
<p>The horses we domesticated came from a very different ecosystem. I’ve actually read that the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius caused a very rapid climate change that made the steppes of Asia ideal for horses that were tamed by the mongols. They might have had a more “tamable” temperament because the ecosystem changed too rapidly for a bunch of predators to move in (layman’s speculation).</p>
<p>Edit: there are of course eccentric rich people who have tamed zebras, look up Baron Rothschild, but he did not ride them. He used them to pull a cart.</p></div>		</li>
