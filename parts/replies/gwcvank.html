			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned about how my own biases influence my thoughts constantly. The way I talk to others and the way I think about the world is all influenced by my perception of myself and the view I want to project of myself to others. </p>
<p>I learned that I was holding myself back by always wanting to do things my way. I needed to be more laid back and more open to new ideas. I always liked being the leader in my friend groups, the one that calls the shots and brings people together. But I was too controlling and I needed to let other people take the lead sometimes.</p>
<p>As the shrooms were wearing off, my ego slowly came back, and I could think about each &quot;piece&quot; of my ego as it returned. Which parts I like and which parts I could do without. The main thing I learned here is that I had a lot more learning to do with psychedelics. This first experience gave me a framework to work with though, as it let me know what to expect. It let me know how malleable I am as well. I choose who I am each day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How much did you take? I’ve recently taken mushrooms and I swear that I came close to the Heroic door. I’m so grateful for my experience though I didn’t feel any ego death at all. One thing that struck to me was going through some sort of flash backs and seeing peoples faces: friends, love ones, my wife and dog who passed last year. And all I felt was happiness. I cried a lot during my experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone's brain is different. If you were seeing vivid hallucinations, it's likely that you took enough. I was seeing things as extra colorful and seeing breathing and wave motions where there wasn't any motion. But no crazy hallucinations. It was a much more mental experience for me.
I believe I took 3.5 grams. My friends with me also didn't experience ego death to the same degree I did. </p>
<p>Any drug I take tends to give me more extreme effects than most people I know. Marijuana has made me hallucinate before, and it always makes it hard for me to form complete sentences even as my friends can keep smoking bowl after bowl and talk normally. One regular dose of Advil or ibuprofen has always completely solved my chronic migraines, despite the pain being debilitating without it. And when I drink my cup of coffee in the morning... I FEEL IT. </p>
<p>So this is all really to say that my dose isn't the norm. Eating 3.5 grams of mushrooms is not enough for most people to experience ego death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting. Thanks for sharing. The concept of “ego death” came up in the context of a conversation about microdosing psychedelics as a treatment for severe depression, and one of my friends (a corporate lawyer) mentioned that the experience absolutely changed her and made her feel more “free” in a way that had lasting impacts. I didn’t quite grasp what she was saying, perhaps partially because I was interpreting the term “ego” as having to do with the inflated or fragile egos that lawyers can have, rather than the more broad sense of self attached to brain function. </p>
<p>I’ve never done drugs, and I’m not sure I would, but the way she described feeling unburdened sounded so appealing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given that you're saying you're not sure if you would, I have some advice for you if you start leaning in the direction of trying it. </p>
<p>Plan it all out well in advance. Do not just do it on a whim one day when it feels right. </p>
<p>Research which drug you might want to try. Think about what time of day makes sense. Think about how much food you'll want in your body beforehand. Think about what the environment is like. If you want to go outside will you be able to? Will you get insecure if your mom comes home and she doesn't know what you're doing? </p>
<p>You should really make a full plan in advance and set aside a full day for the experience. If you want it to change your life, you have to take it seriously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this advice! Good tips for sure, but I think I’d have to have some major shift in my life in order to be open to it. I’m too much of a scaredy-cat in terms of what permanent side effects it could have (even if rare), plus I’m in my 30s and just too much of a square. </p>
<p>I’d be very confused if my mom walked in on me since she lives on the other side of the country. In fact she’s in her late 60s and probably more likely to try something like that than I am :)</p></div>		</li>
