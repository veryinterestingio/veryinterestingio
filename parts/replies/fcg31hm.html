			<div class="markdown"><p>Dehydration is also a part of it because
Alcohol prevents a hormone from being released which tells the kidneys to hold onto water. So you pee a lot and end up being dehydrated.
And dehydration doesn't feel nice either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I routinely neck a pint of water when I get home, I never get hangovers. In my mind, 99% of a hangover is just dehydration, atleast the headache part. Still feel groggy but that's manageable without the headache.</p>
<p>If I forget to drink said pint of water, I wake up with a massive headache. Whether scientifically correct, or just a placebo effect, it works for me and always has. </p>
<p>10/10 would reccomend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. During the evening I drink 1:1 and when I get home I drink plenty. The only hangover I get is the same as if I had slept really poorly, because I have... Alcohol disrupts sleep cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I’ve seen and read a lot of quotes from people lost in desserts or rain forests. They described after about 3 days of sweating with no water they started to get what felt like the worst hangover ever. Nausea, dizziness and loss of motor functions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is true, I added a reply to a comment further down on here. Dehydration plays a role in how you feel in the morning and the way it makes you feel overlaps with some of the symptoms of hangover caused by alcohol. </p>
<p>However it is not the main cause. This is the reason hangovers will still occur with appropriate hydration and why they don't go away by rehydrating (like the symptoms of pure dehydration would do).</p>
<p>It's generally considered that the effects of dehydration often occur concurrently but should be considered separately to effects of the alcohol.</p>
<p>It certainly adds to the crappy feeling in the morning though!</p></div>		</li>
