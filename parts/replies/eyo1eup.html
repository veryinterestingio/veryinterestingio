			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll expand on it. </p>
<p>Your heart gets &quot;better&quot; at pumping blood, pump efficiency. Your heart also doesn't need to work as hard, so your resting BPM declines steadily. It takes progressively more and more intense routines to get your heart rate up to a certain point where it took little before. </p>
<p>You also get, literally, more veins and arteries, as new, bigger pathways are built to support larger, more efficient muscles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The body actually produces new veins and arteries? or do you mean the current ones get bigger?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The part where he says “your body extracts oxygen from the blood more efficiently” implies better heart &amp; lung efficiency. </p>
<p>Since you extract more oxygen from blood, your lungs don’t have to work as hard breathing in more air. And your heart doesn’t need to pump your blood around your body as fast. Both your heart and lungs will work less, thus conserving energy, and allowing that energy to be better focused towards other muscles (or just longer endurance).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would imagine that it also grows your relevant muscles (legs, etc).  Not as much as intense resistance training but your legs surely get stronger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but they’re unusual and their increases in heart size are fairly mild compared to either their performance gains or the increases in the size of other muscles from exercise.</p></div>		</li>
