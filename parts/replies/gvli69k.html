			<div class="markdown"><p>If your team was like mine, most practices take place in the morning or late afternoon. The worst burning hours are 10-2ish, give or take a bit depending on your location and weather. I’ve never heard of an outdoor team practicing at noon</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve never liked this explanation of “because you are using energy.” Okay, then if I eat a sandwich I’ll be all better? What about two sandwiches? Not enough? Then what about three sandwiches?</p>

<p>Nothing specific to you, but everybody has this same answer and it doesn’t jive.. at least not on its own.</p></div>		</li>
