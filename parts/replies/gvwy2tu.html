			<div class="markdown"><p>I have the same problem. The middle toenail on each foot gets really thick. The higher mileage I'm running, the worse it gets. But if I get injured for an extended amount of time and quit running, they go back to normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also some preexting conditions can lead to unusally thick nails (which can also compound with the age thing)</p>
<p>Like psoriasis, as if it wasn't already hard enough to wear shorts and sandals out in public. Or onychotillomania (I mean not <em>directly</em> but if you pull your toenails out enough times because of it they're going to start growing back weirdly).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah damage to nails most definitely leads to strange toenail shapes after a while.  Both my pinky toes grow out into a triangle point which is super weird because no matter what I do I just can't get it to look right.  Years of stubbing them bastards on things have really done the pinky toes in</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dunno if it's right or not but I always heard that once you get fungus in your toes, it will never go away. So ofc older people, having been in more places, are more likely to have caught fungus on their feet.</p>
<p>Edit : I don't know if it's been mentioned elsewhere in this thread but : People usually get Fungus on their toes by walking in dirty and fungus loaded water such as... swimming pool &quot;feet-cleaner&quot; areas near the shower, dirty showers with stagnant water, you get the idea.</p>
<p>Never, ever, walk and stay a long amount of time in a still and dirty water, period.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can attest. I keep my feet looking nice, but I’m almost 50 and nothing works. I can’t take the pill for it due to my liver numbers. </p>
<p>Always, ALWAYS treat athletes foot immediately. I waited and it moved to my toenails. I regret that choice so much. No matter how much I maintain my feet, I secretly know what’s under there.</p></div>		</li>
