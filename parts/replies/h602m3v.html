			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a 4 part mini series made by The Discovery Channel called <em>Human Body: Pushing The Limits</em> in 2008 that has cool graphics and goes over this in the first episode. </p>
<p>It was a really interesting and well made miniseries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The extra oxygen delivery gives you increased stamina but not strength.  The epinephrine/stress/fight response gives you strength over what you’d normally expect.  It’s most likely a combination of the increase in calcium release and increased signal potential ion that allows for more muscle to be recruited.</p>
<p>When non active people start going to the gym,  most of the strength gains in the first month are due to increased regulation that allows for more nerve firing to recruit more contraction.</p>
<p>Epinephrine most likely increases strength from a combination of allowing stronger signals for contractions and the increased calcium resulting in stronger than normal.</p>
<p>Epinephrine is known to cause calcium release in smooth muscle to increase tone like in the vasculature to increase blood pressure but it’s skeletal effects are less studied.</p>
<p>Oxygen delivery in and of itself isn’t going to make you stronger in absolute terms but allow you to continue force production over time instead of rapidly dropping off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not even close. Something like 5x as strong.</p>
<p>Gorillas and other non-human primates have different musculoskeletal structure (as in, the locations where their muscles meet the bones are different) and this lends itself to strength rather than the fine motor skills we enjoy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I read somewhere that that’s why NHP’s often appear to be quite clumsy and rough acting, particularly in human environments, because they aren’t really adapted to finely tune their movements because as much as 67% of their muscle mass is “fast twitch fibres”, to which they owe their phenomenal strength, compared to 40% in humans—hence our ability to perform delicate tasks.</p></div>		</li>
