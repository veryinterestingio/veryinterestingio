			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Anxiety puts us in a constant state of fight/flight which historically was meant to help us in physically dangerous situations, but now we can be anxious about a million things. Anything we can do to ease that anxiety allows us to leave that state of fight/flight, where we no longer physically feel the effects of that stress. Depression and anxiety can also lead to thoughts getting stuck in a loop in our heads, where you go round and round, obsess, and are really only having a one sided conversation. Adding another person to that conversation breaks that loop cycle and allows another more objective person into the conversation which could also lead to relief.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course! I highly recommend reading further about this topic if you’re interested. A lot of it relates to the sympathetic nervous system (flight/fight) versus the parasympathetic nervous system (rest/digest)  and how one drives our anxieties and the other helps calm us down, understanding what’s happening within our bodies can help us better understand how to help it out!</p></div>		</li>
