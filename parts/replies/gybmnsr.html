<p>It always seemed like it'd make more sense to make a square so you aren't wasting shit on the outer edge.  But I don't know enough about the process to know if there's a proper reason for it or not</p></div>		</li>

<p>Figured it was just poured into a mold/mould or something then cut... thats very interesting</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™ve always found it impressive that they are not only able to manufacture chips but that they are also able to analyse, debug and sometimes even fix (through focused ion beams, FIB) them. Bonding hundreds of extremely thin wires to the chip also looks impressive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CDs start as a flat disc and the laser burns the holes in one by one. That's the disc burner</p>
<p>Then the reader uses a weaker laser and a light sensor to read the data. If the laser bounces back to the sensor then there's no hole, and it it doesn't then there is a hole that the laser escapes though</p>
<p>Those yeses and no become ones and zeros</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a difference between a pressed/&quot;stamped&quot; CD and a CD-R and a CD-RW</p>
<p>But a similar thing applies...laser melts a dye to change the reflectiveness of the surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe CDs are usually stamped. The holes are small but not impossibly small. It's actually pretty amazing how well a physical mold or stamp can work, even at small scale. You can lookup the &quot;applied science&quot; video on YouTube about holographic chocolate for an example.</p>
<p>Writable CDs are different. I think they have a chemical on them that is sensitive to certain types of light. Your burner has a laser with that light and blinks at the right time to darken certain areas.</p>
<p>In either case, the reader looks for the lighter or darker spots.</p></div>		</li>
