			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not sure what community you hail from or what the demographics of the interested group might be.  I’m going to guess 60+.  Is the interest related to end of life care and advanced care planning (ACP)?  Another way to describe advanced cared planing is though its fundamental question, “How do I want to be cared for in advancing illness, age, or frailty?”<br />
There are ACP tools such as the “Five Wishes” booklet which facilitates living will conversations.  I would consider seeing if there is a palliative care consult service at a larger hospital in the region.  Not hospice, but palliative care.  Hope this helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh my group is all about the five wishes. </p>
<p>Actually the vast majority of people attending are middle aged. We probably have more millennials than we do boomers.</p></div>		</li>
