<p>Why is the price of housing so stubbornly high?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're leaving out a major factor here, the explosion of &quot;investors&quot; driving up prices on real estate. Sure, it's probably always been present to an extent, but especially with the popularity of TV shows glamorizing it the number of people flipping houses has gone through the roof. This prices out low income buyers who would buy and fix up their own house but can't afford to buy after someone paid cash, put a few thousand dollars into the house, then doubled the price. And then on top of that you have the effect that comes from AirBNB of people buying houses they don't live in for the sole purpose of using them as short term rentals.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When I was looking for my house, this annoyed the <em>everloving</em> <strong><em>shit</em></strong> out of me. I could only find two types of houses: those that were under my price range because they were dilapidated shit holes that needed tens of thousands of dollars in repair, and those that were above my price range because they were &quot;renovated&quot; by a flipper.</p>
<p>The thing that pissed me right off was that it was obvious that the renovations were done by people who had no business swinging a hammer, and using the absolute bottom of the barrel materials. Ikea cabinets and countertops were everywhere. Tiles were never straight or level. Dry paint would rub off on your clothes if you leaned against a wall. Meanwhile the roof, air conditioner, water heater and appliances were all at the end of their life expectancy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The housing market is my guess. How do housing prices not go down when 25% of homes are in default? We live in crazy town where everything happens to suit the banks. They have taken over the government.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am, but the &quot;investor&quot; argument is tricky, because at some point, you need to realize your gains and sell to someone (or rent it). I'm not sure the innovations of REITs or house flippers would be all that pernicious if there was sufficient supply to meet demand (in those markets where there is a functional economy). Nobody's flipping houses in Detroit, as far as I know, where there's a glut of houses, to the point where the city is bulldozing lots to save their infrastructure budget.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So much this. It is practically impossible to build new highrises in most major cities. Unsurprising - San Francisco is probably the best (worst?) example. Some of the zoning committee's reasoning reads like something from The Onion.</p>
<p>They refused to let a guy build an apartment building because it would slightly shade a schoolyard... a schoolyard which was already shaded by a giant tree.</p>
<p>It's largely the current residents pushing for little/no extra construction, as it keeps their property values high.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the fight against highrises that's the real issue, it's the inability to build the &quot;missing middle&quot;. There are plenty of residential neighbourhoods in American cities that would be perfectly well served by allowing duplexes, triplexes, and small apartment buildings.</p>
<p>If you look at a lot of European cities that have better higher order transit and higher density, it's not all high-rises, it's a lot of low-rise apartments, townhouses, rowhouses, that create this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair enough - it's all apartment buildings which are having zoning difficulties, not just high rises. I suppose that I was focusing on the extreme case.</p>
<p>Actually - the example I gave was only for a 3-5 story building I believe. Hardly a high rise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live west of Chicago and see the new housing developments taking over the corn fields. They do not build anything but giant, monster-sized atrocities of 3,000 square feet or more priced at $500K and up. These are right next to trailer parks and a single Casey’s, it’s so bizarre. But also there’s no way anyone who works locally could afford one of the houses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, you’re not wrong.  My wife and I did not have kids and lived well below our means for 15 years while waiting for our careers to establish.  We recently moved into a wealthy neighborhood and got on the civic league email list.  What we thought would amount to a neighborhood Craigslist is instead nothing but a forum devoted to property value.  And their biggest issue is shutting down a proposed new neighborhood down the street.  Every 3-4 days it’s a new rumor and doomsday scenario.  As a first time homeowner it’s extremely nerve wracking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. My city has tons of new construction (fastest growing in this part of the country), so that's mostly not an issue. My neighborhood message board is mostly people complaining about teenagers doing minor offenses and asking about contractors.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is a reason people want cities to have sunlight. We are not short of room in the US. Nor horrid lying psychopathic billionaires that lie and steal just because they like to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are wrong. Entirely different circumstances. The guy was local and just owned the laundromat which was planned to remain the first story of the building.</p>
<p>And while the USA in general is not short of room - many major cities (notably San Francisco) are short of room.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Absolutely right and these laws will stay arcane and complicated as long as they continue to benefit the wealth holders. Why would you want to increase housing density when doing so would lower the value of your assets(since people use property as an asset) by raising supply and thus lowering demand.</p></div>		</li>
