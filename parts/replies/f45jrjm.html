<p>I'm not an expert here but it seems as though the founders of large companies very rarely own a majority of the shares.</p>
<p>They may have had control at one point but it usually takes a lot of investment capital to grow into a billion dollar company. Often such people will remain as the single largest shareholder. But they would have fallen well below 50%. This is, after all, how the board of Apple was able to fire Jobs, as an example.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That said, usually, the founders of a company own the majority share since the founders decide how much stock is sold off. Most founders would keep enough shares to retain control.</p>
