<p>I want to throw in here in case it hasn't been mentioned that RSSI can be a very poor indicator of signal strength, depending on the situation. And in many cases that's all you're seeing. The problem of course is that it's only the <em>received</em> signal strength, and sometimes (especially with handheld devices that might have weaker output), you might be receiving adequately but be unable to talk back.</p>
<p>In an enterprise/industrial setting, we actually ended up deliberately reducing the power of our wireless access points and redeploying in a tighter grid to help deal with this problem. The APs were too damn strong! I am oversimplifying of course, but the guy that designed it in the first place didn't know what he was doing.</p>
<p>News to me that devices are using a mix of factors for the wireless bars, that's good. I always thought it was just RSSI, which is not great.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct.  When people tell me I need to turn up my AP signal output I just sigh.  We run a high density deployment so channel and power planning is critical to getting things to work right.  High power output is why residential wifi in apartments is such crap.  Everyone blasting over everyone else and the small antenna on cell phones don't have the gain or power to match the outputs of the APs.  Leads to getting a good RSSI but terrible data rate because the BER is high.</p></div>		</li>
