			<div class="markdown"><p>A little bit of nuance: Being unemployed is not a bad thing.  You might be taking a couple of months off to rest or pursuing higher education to improve your position in the job market.  You might even leave the job market altogether to raise a family.  That's why you can't just say that everyone over the age of 18 who doesn't have a job is unemployed and should negatively impact our view of the health of the economy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>“Residual Unemployment” is roughly the English concept that it would translate to, and there have been a few studies regarding this idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Under the Keynesian model of economics (and how the United States government measures unemployment) that would be still be zero unemployment. </p>
<p>The unemployed are people who want a job, and are seeking a job, but don't have one. </p>
<p>People who don't have a job but also aren't actively seeking a job are not unemployed. Your stay at home parents? They aren't considered part of the labor force, or the unemployed, as they are choosing to be at home with their children. </p>
<p>This gets a bit wonky when you have a situation where people have been unemployed for so long that they give up looking for a job. These people are considered Discouraged Workers, and are typically not included in the standard unemployment numbers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>more like in Keynesian everyone works as much as they want to or will be working as much as they want to before they run out of savings, while in classical every works 40 hours a week.  </p>
<p>So you might want to work 0 hours a week (because you're full time parenting) while your spouse works 60 hours a week at the hospital and your cousin george works 20 hours a week for Uber, all of you are happy with the amount you earn.   </p>
<p>In classical that scenario is 50% unemployment (1 full time job, 1 part time job, 1 unemployed), in Keynesian that's 0% unemployment (0 people want to work more.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s unlikely you will be able to stop working the old job the day before you start the new job. Someone who just finished college may quit their job now so they have more time for interviews and such. Also, people often have to move where they live which takes time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you've been working at walmart while going to college in Florida, you graduate with a degree in computer science, quit your job at walmart, and move to california, where he quickly lands a job with a game developer that starts in 2 months.</p>
<p>Are you employed during the 2-3 months after you quit walmart and before you start that game dev job? Keynesian says no, classical says yes. In that same scenario but you were a full time student instead of part time, you've haven't worked at a job for 4-5 years now while you were in school, but Keynesian still says you aren't unemployed.</p>
<p>Essentially classical only has two states - actively working, or not actively working, while Keynesian has three states; actively working, not working (students, full time parents, between jobs, independently wealthy, etc.), and unemployed.</p>
<p>This is very nice for statistical analysis and such, because people who are not working won't fill created job openings, while unemployed people do. So if you have a 10% not working and 1% unemployed population, the government knows not to bother generating jobs near you, while if you have 1% not working and 10% unemployed, the government will send business subsidies to help promote hiring new workers. Meanwhile the classical system just says 11% unemployed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Shouldn't that be unemployed? Neither claims you're employed, just Keynesian doesn't count it towards unemployment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In classical full employment, everyone has a job. In Keynesian full employment, everyone who wants a job has a job.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some people don't want to or can't work. The reasons for this are varied: some are independently wealthy and don't need to work in order to earn money, some are disabled and literally can't work, others are lazy and don't want to work. They are saying that under Keynesian full employment, these people don't count as being unemployed, but under classical full employment they would.</p></div>		</li>
