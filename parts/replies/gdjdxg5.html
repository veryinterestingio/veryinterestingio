<p>edit: OK, so the &quot;air&quot; part is actually air, and not some marketing thing. Once <strong><em>activated</em></strong>, they must be used. Thank you all!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a mini RC car, the Micro RS4. It had multiple battery options, but most people (including me) ran it on the 4 AA option. </p>
<p>Running it on standard, disposable cells resulted in slower acceleration and slower top speed than running it on rechargeables. It also had lower run times, even with brand name batteries. </p>
<p>With rechargeables, it was like driving a different car. Better throttle response, better brakes, longer run times, and faster top speeds, even with the lower voltage. These were standard AA rechargeables that I picked up at Sam's Club. </p>
<p>Overall, rechargeable batteries do best in high drain devices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You were probably using Zinc-Carbon batteries, those had really bad capacity and internal resistance which means they didn't even work properly in some high drain devices. Alkaline batteries on the other hand have good capacity and low internal resistance so it's pretty much same as rechargeable NiMh battery (except you can't recharge them).<br />
There were also NiCd (there still are, but not used as often) batteries which had even lower resistance so they were used in cordless tools and high performance RC cars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rechargables (NiCad or NiMh) are preferable to alkaline batteries for camera flashes.   The flash will recharge the capacitor much faster with rechargables.      The only downside to modern rechargables is that there much less warning that their charge is exausted.</p></div>		</li>

<p>At around 1.2V standard alkalines are pretty much dead while NiMhs still have about 40% of capacity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>NiMH has practically 0 voltage drop while it has any capacity remaining. You cannot reliably measure remaining charge in NiMH by measuring voltage (if you want to know how much charge is left, you basically have to start at known full charge and then measure used power). The only time NiMH won't be 1.2 V is when they are fully discharged (there is a rapid voltage drop at the end).</p>
<p>Also, most manufacturers specify about 0.9 V as suggested cut off point for alkaline cells, but there is a lot of shitty electronics that isn't designed to go as low</p></div>		</li>
