			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to piggy back on this with an aside. Another example of a non-economically feasible power plant is a solar updraft tower. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_updraft_tower" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar\_updraft\_tower" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar\_updraft\_tower</a></a>)  It's nearly free to run, doesn't use any rare materials or toxic processes to create, and generates power with no greenhouse emissions. The problem is its very expensive to build and would take potentially decades to pay for itself selling the electricity. Hypothetically, we could have thousands of these all over the place and use some sort of ceramic materials or even just water under the greenhouse to store heart so the effect will work long after the sun goes down. This would give us substantial power generation for 12-15 hours a day depending on the season. The problem is a natural gas power plant would pay for itself within 10 years. It's just economics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The efficiency compared to solar panels just doesn't seem to be there either though. Looking at the efficiency section it looks like best case they only expect 1%, where solar panels are currently in the mid-20s (and rising).  They mentioned plants generating power for 200,000 homes, but it seems putting a handful of solar panels on each house (or better yet, parking lot canopies to reclaim underutilized, already developed, space in suburban areas especially) with some batteries may be a much more economical solution.</p>
<p>Considering the sizable footprint of these towers (theoretical discussions involve a 7 km diameter for solar collection) I can kind of understand why they generally have not been pursued so far. The main benefit appears to be the thermal velocity carrying over power generation into the night, theoretically generating 24 hours a day in certain areas.  I'll admit this aspect could be useful if we don't find better power storage which is currently a huge problem in green energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something that offsets the land usage element- when they built a half (or less, I don't recall exactly) scale version for testing they found the area under the collector produced a green house environment, suitable for growing plants. We could get use out of the foot print besides collecting solar thermal energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is the big advantage. As long as it used materials that I have a lot of thermal inertia, you would always be generating power. Coincidentally, you would generate the most power when the most is needed, during the day. In the late afternoon you would still be generating a lot because it's still quite warm. </p>
<p>Also you wouldn't have all the issues with using rare earth materials to make solar panels. (which aren't that big a deal). It's literally just a greenhouse which can be made of plastic sheeting or glass and a tower that can be made of anything structurally strong enough. It's really simple, and it would last for thousands of years with minimal maintenance. Where as solar panels are only good for 20 to 40 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of factors here. For one, solar energy only generates power during the day. A solar tower can generate power 24 hours a day because of thermal inertia. It would generate the most at the middle of the afternoon and generate quite a bit in the evening and drop down at night before starting to pick up in the morning again which actually lines up with normal power usage. You can also use terrain that isn't valuable to us. For example steep terrain is actually great for a solar updraft tower. You could just build it along the hill and then build a tower at the top and artificially extend the high of the tower without having to build a very tall structure. </p>
<p>A perfect solution to energy production is no one solution. We could have solar panels on every home to offset the majority of their power usage and have solutions like this to give them extra current at night along with nuclear power and hydropower and geothermal power and other solutions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you say economics you really mean thermodynamics.</p>
<p>A power generation plant &quot;paying for itself&quot; means, at root, that the energy cost of building it is made up by the productivity of the plant within a certain amount of time.</p>
<p>Whether you represent that cost in watt-hours or dollars or some other metric mostly doesn't mater.  A plant that takes longer than its own maintenance cycle to recoup its initial energy cost is an absolute loss, no matter how you measure it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, they calculated that already and posted it on the wikipedia page.</p>
<p>&quot;Net energy payback is estimated to be 2–3 years.&quot;</p>
<p>I actually meant the economics of it. Power is sold per kwh to customers that pay for it. This plant will generate X power for indefinite time with minimal maintenance. The maintenance costs are trivial compared to the money generated by the operation of it, but the construction costs are quite heavy. This is if you compared it to a natural gas plant that would break even financially in a fraction of the time, but it would run at a higher cost because you have to buy the gas to burn and consume more maintenance. At some point in time, a solar updraft tower will beat a natural gas plant economically, but that crossover point probably wouldn't be for decades. People just don't invest at that scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the towers were 1km tall they would be pretty wide at the top, wide enough you could likely run an automatic kite off each corner with low risk of tangling? Put satellite equipment on the kites and distribute high speed communications? Use them to monitor ground shift and other low-orbit duties?</p>
<p>Heck if they constantly make updraft and you could build them in a line, you could have unmanned drones largely just gliding along the airstream creating a very cheap and expedient aerial conveyor belt for light goods?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that kite would flutter until it fell apart, endangering the structure as a whole.</p>
<p>If you need a tall structure to mount antennas to, a radio tower 1km tall is a (relatively) cheap thing to build, or you know, launching 40k satellites into LEO would do the trick too</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only thing I’ll add to is existing bore holes rarely can be leveraged for anything other than data. Oil and Gas rely heavily on formation pressures or induced pressures to lift gas and liquids to surface. To pump fluid for purpose of geothermal a pump needs to be run down hole which usually means a much wider borehole is needed than the 4.5 inch production casing. (At least in my area)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have much direct experience with drilling for either petroleum or geothermal, but various papers on the subject do suggest that in some settings the same bore holes can be used (e.g., <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920410518304042" target="_blank">Wang et al., 2016</a>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m no scientist but I’ve drilled.. another reply mentioned the smaller production tubing (4.5inches) commonly used in well strings. </p>
<p>Think about how finicky your ikea furniture is. Take a 50-60 year old wellbore.. eighth inch to 1/4 inch steel casing, underground, for thousands of days? The headaches involved with that.. not impossible. But.. what a clusterfuckering fuckshow. Drill it again. The right size. Newer cement technology, better logging tools to verify groundwater isolation. Do it right. </p>
<p>You might like pallet furniture for a coffee table or your side tables. But it sucks. And the novelty wears off</p></div>		</li>

Well cost tends to increase non-linearly down hole and depends on an array of factors (hence the different curves making different assumptions). In their most extreme variable model, as an example, drilling down to 4 km costs 10 million Euros (and is quasi-linear between 0-4 km), but the cost to get to 6 km is closer to 50 million Euros.</p></div>		</li>
