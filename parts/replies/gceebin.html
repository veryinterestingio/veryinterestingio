			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually youtube keeps the original file saved and use the compressed encoded videos to stream. Thats why videos uploaded in higher resolution before that resolution was added to the website gets updated to higher resolution when youtube starts supporting that resolution.</p></div>		</li>

<p>From my understanding, they still compress the “original” file before storing it on their data centers. Hypothetically, if you uploaded an 8k video, that video would still be stored as an 8k video on YouTube servers but in a compressed format.  That original file is then downscaled for users viewing in 4K, 1080p, 720p, and so on. Upon addition of 8k to more YouTube devices, the YouTube servers would then push the original compressed 8k video, but not the original file.</p>
<p>It really wouldn’t make any sense for YouTube to keep the original uncompressed file. For 4K videos this would take up a ridiculous amount of space. Approx. 375Mb/minute of uncompressed 4K footage is nonsensical.</p>
<p>Edit: Also, in MKBHD’s video he downloads the videos from the creator studio. I would venture to guess that if YouTube was keeping the original uncompressed files, those would be the ones made available to download for the creator. Given the results of the video, this is quite clearly not the case.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ofcourse uncompressed raw video would take too much space but most people upload compressed mp4. 3kliksphillip said that he was uploading 60fps videos when youtube only supported 30fps and when youtube started to support 60fps, his old videos automatically got updated to 60fps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Google Takeout used to let you download all the original files. They now only offer that for a limited amount of time, but I would be <em>very</em> surprised if they actually started deleting the original files, because that would hurt their ability to improve their codec implementations and add new codecs in the future for existing videos. I suspect they only did that because few people cared, and because probably one or two smartasses somewhere were abusing the system to store non-video data embedded in videos and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Either way, most videos are uploaded to YouTube decently compressed already (almost everything a typical user is likely to export will come in h.264 with mediocre quality settings); they would not get more than a 2x or so improvement on average, I reckon, even if they were deleting the original files.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's less simple than identical frames of video.  It looks at much deeper patters than what you see in the video.</p>
<p>It certainly is much more effective at certain datatypes, and can be set to be optimized for certain loads (SQL, VDI, general, and others), and it's efficacy will vary, but sometimes it can work very well. For example, on my server I store video, and some videos report taking no space at all because they have been completely deduplicated. It will definitely be more effective the larger the dataset is though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be honest... why?
Storage is DIRT cheap nowadays.  </p>
<p>I have entire storage arrays from yesteryear that have been replaced by 1 (well 2 for redundancy) hard drive. </p>
<p>Compression will make it look worse.  I'd rather keep it uncompressed.</p></div>		</li>
