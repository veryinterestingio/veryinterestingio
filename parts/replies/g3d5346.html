			<div class="markdown"><p>You probably need to slow down. One of the biggest mistakes new runners make is going too fast. The natural pace your body wants to run at is too fast for you to keep up with long distance, you have to force yourself to go slower and you will improve your pace over time. It takes effort to go slow on purpose and feels weird and counter productive but it’s the key (and makes it much more enjoyable)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This absolutely. I started running only 4 weeks ago and couldn't do more than 2 km, because I was running at 11-12km/h. I've slowed myself down to about 8km/h since then (still too fast) and can now go 5km with big improvements between each session.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You both may be going too fast. If you have a watch that has a heart rate monitor you can keep track of that to judge how hard you are working. It varies by person and age but if you are in the 180’s + HR while you run, you are going to wear yourself out if you are not in shape. You may have to slow WAY down to a gentle jog in the beginning. It may seem very slow. But do that slower speed for longer distance. Once that is comfortable, start doing some intervals at faster speeds, gradually increasing the intervals. OR go with the interval strategy all the way- walk run Ie couch to 5k method.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I first started jogging to get in to shape, I had to literally walk most of it for a few months. I wasn't even large or anything - just way out of shape.</p>
<p>I say this to mean... Don't take having to walk pretty quickly in to a jog as a bad sign. It probably just means your body needs a lot more practice!</p>
<p>The other response described what to do excellently, so I won't rehash.</p>
<p>If your knees give you trouble though, don't feel bad for doing anything but jogging. Also, learn to run on the balls/front of your feet instead of landing on the heel. It really saves knees and hips, even if you don't run as a primary cardio exercise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly start at a trot-jog your first several times and work your way up. I still basically jog, although I refer to it as &quot;running.&quot; I never come close to a sprint.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember when I started running in college I got on the treadmill next to a girl about my size and looked at her speed on the treadmill. It said 6.0. I set my treadmill to that. I was dying after .75. I was so discouraged! It took me FOREVER to get up to 1.5 miles at that pace. I was a freshman taking some intro to sports med/athletic training  classes and we learned training principals and other exercise basics. I quickly learned what I was doing wrong. I slowed way down and did 3 miles that day. Now I’m a PT who has run a few full marathons and I’m a little embarrassed I didn’t know better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably going too hard. People fall in love with idea of intensity, makes for a great 80s movie training montage...but it's a bad idea for anyone who wants to get started on getting fit.</p>
<p>Intensity matters for intermediate athletes. But for beginners consistency is king. Oversimplified example, let's rate workouts 1-100. If you give 100, 100, 0, 100, 0, 0...in that first week, you've put in 300 in total and you feel like shit and you don't wanna do the next workout. Instead do 70, 80, 75, 80, 70, 80, 75...you're keeping it in the &quot;fun&quot; zone of effort, and you're not psyching yourself out of doing it more, and your actual training volume completely dwarfs that of someone going 100 and is missing days due to exhaustion or injury.</p>
<p>Next time you try running for distance or time, try to actively AVOID running hard. Slow way down, slower than you think is needed. Find the pace you feel you can hold for hours and hours and train there instead. You can learn speed and intensity later, you just need to spend more time building a base first by training comfortably.</p></div>		</li>
