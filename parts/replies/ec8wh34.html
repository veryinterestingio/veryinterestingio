You can use magnets to reduce the &quot;impact&quot; of something jostling around on your back, but you can't reduce the amount of static weight you have to carry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just a university contest, there are no links or anything, it was just a live presentation from fellow students. The prize isn't that big and it's not that important of a competition I'm just surprised they got there.</p>
<p>And how can you reduce the impact? What do you mean by impact?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Magnets would be a terrible way to do that. Magnetic force falls off with the square of the distance. That means that your magnets would do almost no work until they get very close to the plate. It would still jolt very hard. What you need here is good old-fashioned springs. Their response is linear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it's an entrepreneurship and innovation competition, so it's focused on building your own company with a project that has to be &quot;doable&quot;. It's not focused on marketing but on innovation. Anyways it doesn't really matter they didn't win anyway, I was just surprised that this physics was even accepted, and making sure that I knew my physics right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, forces always coming in pairs whose vector sum is zero. If something’s exerting an upward force against your textbooks, that force is going to have an equal, downward force on whatever’s doing the lifting. </p>
<p>But even without this, I’m confident that any permanent magnet strong enough to lift suspend anything mid air will be made out of something much denser than textbooks. And textbooks aren’t ferromagnetic. So you’d have to rely on diamagnetism or paramagnetism, which means you’re looking at massive superconductor coils like what they use in MRI machines. </p>
<p>This idea is not a winner. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or you'd have to make a large magnet in a bucket shape, so you can put the books in it and place it above the other magnet. All you're doing is carrying around more magnets, but at least it doesn't require superconductor coils</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this brings up another question.. what is the weight of a box with say 200 flying birds? i assume they are pushing down for lift and therefore the box weighs the same, but during lifting their wings, wouldnt it weigh less?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming they wouldn't try and glide down (no lift), and ignoring the small amount of air they'd be pushing towards the box (I'm imagining them dive bombing the box like a hawk), then for the period of time when the birds are in free fall, yes I believe the box would weigh less, whatever the box's weight is.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I think this is the key though. You <em>can't</em> ignore the air that they push towards the box, because that is exactly what allows them to fly. Heavier than air flight is achieved by pushing air downwards, this will ultimately create a force downwards on the box, so it should weight the same whether the birds are flying or not. At least, that's what I think. It is an interesting question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well... you specified very specific conditions where the box would weigh less, but I can specify just as narrow conditions where the box weighs more:  </p>
<p>At the immediate moment a bird takes off, it needs to exert a downward force (wingflap) to accelerate upwards. This force contributes to the force the box exerts on the surface below.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If all 200 birds take off at the same time, the box will be heavier than before.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>On average, the box remains the same weight, esp. if a box contains 200 birds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This could be a fun demonstrations to do with a quadcopter. Shouldn't be that hard. </p>
<p>Of course the answer is you would feel the weight of the birds / quadcopter. But it could be fun to show. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That assumes that the motion is quasistatic.</p>
<p>Unfortunately with EM fields, the forces applied are not on the same order of magnitude as material deformation at the surface. So you may not experience all of the weight all at once. </p>
<p>If you move the plate, AND the object being suspended magnetically eventually gets to the same relative position, THEN you will have done work on both objects, eventually. But at any given instant you may not.</p>
<p>To more intuitively grasp the same thing, if you have an object on a surface, with a spring on top, and another object on top of that spring compressing it slightly, then if you were to jerk the surface object up it would compress the spring without moving the top object. This is basically how a car suspension works. Hitting a bump doesn't necessarily lift the whole car the same amount, that's the point. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, in a later comment I suggested that the prototype might instead be used to smooth out impacts instead of actually reducing weight.</p></div>		</li>
