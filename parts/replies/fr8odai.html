			<div class="markdown"><p>You are 100% right and I don’t think people understand how important latent heat exchange is. It takes 2256 kJ of energy to complete a vapor/liquid phase change of 1 kG of water. When going from water to vapor the change requires energy to occur. That means it has to get the energy from somewhere, which is the environment around it. Since the environment is not making a phase change itself pulling that energy from the environment requires a change in temperature. So while the phase change is occurring the environment around it is cooling. This is also how sweating cools us. Secrete water -&gt; water evaporates -&gt; energy needed for evaporation comes from our body and the atmosphere next to our skin -&gt; body cools.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Latent heat exchange is the energy that is released (or in this case absorbed) by a substance when it changes phase. </p>
<p>Ice has less energy than water which has less energy than steam. </p>
<p>Why is that? Well, it's how much the molecules are moving around. Ice molecules hardly move at all when compared to water molecules. Water molecules hardly move around compared to steam molecules.</p>
<p>So, you have to add energy (in this case heat) to liquid water to get it to be steam. A LOT of energy. </p>
<p>So, even though the water only went up 1 degree, it took a lot more energy away from the fire because the water transformed from liquid -&gt; gas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw the first sentence of your reply and was gearing up for a fight. I will admit latent heat is a very hard thing to get your head around without actively trying to learn it. Even the name hints at this. Latent means hidden so this heat or heat exchange is hidden from us. When we think of heat we think of temperature, and though heat and temperature are related they are not the same thing. </p>
<p>A great example of the differences between temperature and heat I used to use when I taught at a university is for the students to conduct a thought a experiment (because actually doing this would cause injury) where you would turn your oven on to 400F let it heat up and then stick your hand in the oven. Put your hand in the oven for one second and then remove it. It’s hot but when you pull your hand out its temperature is only slightly increased and otherwise unharmed. Now turn the stove on and put a pot of water on it until it comes to a rolling boil. Now stick your hand in the pot for 1 second. Typically after saying that last sentence the students would cringe and I would get a few audible “oh hell no”’s. I would then ask them why not? The water is about half as hot as the air in the oven. The reason is heat, specific heat specifically, which is the amount of energy to raise an object 1C. It takes less energy for the air to reach 400F than it does for the water to reach 212F. Now think about steam. Once that pot boils we get steam which is water vapor. So to get that pot of water from room temperature to boiling it took a whole bunch of energy in the form of sensible heat. Once it reaches boiling it stops changing temperature so that sensible heat exchange stops. It’s now latent heat exchange. Instead of changing temperature that heat is being used to change water’s physical state. That energy from the boil is still there though and once the water completes the phase change to vapor it now has a total heat of the sensible heat + the latent heat. This is why you don’t stick your hand over a boiling pot of water the steam is worse than the liquid. </p>
<p>Teaching things that did not have a physical manifestation were much more difficult to teach than something I could show a picture or movie and show how each part of the system is interacting. If I made my students watch ice melt it would not help explain what’s actually happen because the process,  by definition,  is latent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya so I am going to give this a try.</p>
<p>I looked up reference numbers so most of these are averages or just what I could find. I can not verify if they are truly correct.</p>
<p>Let's assume the couch is made of cotton canvas and wood with no metal (for simplicity). The specific heat for wood is 1.76 kJ/KgC and for denim is 1.34 kJ/KgC. Given a 3-cushion couch weighing 68-kg it can be expected to have about 28 kg of canvas and 40 kg of wood. The flashpoint of canvas is listed as 400C while the flashpoint of wood is listed at 300C. I will note that I am unsure of the listed flashpoint of cotton canvas as estimates varied widely. This number was the one I saw pop up multiple times and was listed as more in line with denim or canvas than normal cotton used in clothing. If the couch starts at 20C (roughly room temperature) then to ignite the cotton 14031 kJ of energy is needed, while 19931 kJ of energy is needed to combust the wood. So given equal application of heat to the entire surface in such a way that everything combusts all at once it would take 33962 kJ of energy. </p>
<p>Equating this to water. That would be like taking 21.5 gallons of water and heating it from just melted and 0C to about to boil 100C. It would also be equivalent to taking about 4 gallons of water and completely evaporating it. So go grab a 5 gallon stockpot and fill it with 4 gallons water. Heat that water to just below boiling. Once it's there boil off the water until none is left. From the point it started boiling to when no liquid water was left you used the amount of energy necessary to combust a couch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add context to this. Heating a kg of water 1 C require 4.2kJ of energy. That means the fase change require 537 times the energy heating the water 1 C.
Love the the answer, just think most people know what the specific heat capacity of water is. Or what that even mean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No you are right I should have include the difference between raising water 1C and evaporating that same amount. I did reply to someone else who replied to my original comment because they wanted me to equate it to how much energy needed to cause a couch to spontaneously combust.</p></div>		</li>
