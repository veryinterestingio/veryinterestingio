			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be different for different diseases. An asymptomatic carrier of a bacterial infection can go on carrying and spreading the bacteria for an indefinite amount of time without ever experiencing symptoms. </p>
<p>With viruses, it’s a little more tricky. Generally, you’d expect to see symptoms at some point. Herpes is a good example where it can stay in a person for a decade before they ever have an outbreak, but can potentially spread it. HIV can be asymptomatic for years. These viruses never leave the system and <del>no antibodies are made</del> antibodies are made but unable to clear the virus. With COVID-19, it’s too early to tell. From what I’ve read, it seems that most people become symptomatic eventually, but many may have symptoms so mild that they don’t even know they’re sick, or think it’s just a little cold.</p>
<p>Edit: trying to do too many things at once and I made an error about antibodies with HIV. Thank you u/NobodyImportant13 for pointing that out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not true.  Your body makes antibodies for HIV within weeks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Way more dangerous. Read about <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3959940/" target="_blank">Typhoid Mary</a> as a classic example. (The Drunk History version is also pretty good if you can find the episode). Asymptomatic carriers don’t know they’re sick and they go around infecting others indefinitely. An extreme case will end up quarantined, or potentially die, and not be able to infect others as long. Also, because they know they’re sick, they will (usually) take measures to not infect others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm imagining the question was in relation to themselves. Especially given the last sentence above on &quot;true asymptomatic carrier&quot; having possibly hijacked immune system and thus no symptoms.</p>
<p>I'm guessing that by definition &quot;asymptomatic&quot; would mean there are no negative symptoms either so there's no danger to oneself.</p>
<p>I'm also guessing the &quot;no symptoms until it's too late&quot; case isn't really considered asymptomatic but just an incubation period.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If someone hadn't brought her up, I was going to, but yeah typically once someone finds out they are a carrier, they will isolate themselves. Mary was understandably reluctant to her having  <em>Salmonella typhi</em> because of her lack of symptoms plus the era she lived where such things weren't as well understood by most, even professionals in the field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With Coronavirus it is unclear currently. There just hasn’t been enough time to study it. Iceland has tested the highest number of people per capita, and found that half of the people they tested were asymptomatic. We don’t what percent of those people will eventually show symptoms, or only have mild symptoms. They also found that there are around 40 different strains, so it’s possible that some strains only produce only mild symptoms or that it’s different for different people. We just don’t know yet.</p></div>		</li>
