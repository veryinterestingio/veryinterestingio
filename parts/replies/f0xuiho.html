			<div class="markdown"><p>As a nice classical picture we can think of electrons orbiting the nucleus much like the earth orbits the sun. But electrons are charged particles and therefore this corresponds to a current - Current is just the rate of change of charge with time. Currents produce magnetic fields(in this case called magnetic moments) which point in a direction depending on the rotation direction of the electron( this is not exactly true, but magnetism is a quantum effect which you can't really ELI5 as it requires spin, which has no classical analogy, and no, electrons do not spin actually spin). Now at high temperatures these tiny magnetic fields point in random directions averaging to zero, and hence no magnetic field( generally there are clusters pointing in the same direction called &quot;domains&quot;). Note that in iron the temperature for this to happen at is ~1,000K (Kelvin - 1K =1°C) that is why iron is magnetic at room temperature. You can apply a strong magnetic field to such a material and force all the moments to align producing a net magnetic field. Anyway this doesn't explain why neodimuim magnets are so strong, but others have mentioned why, I just wanted to expand on the &quot;poles&quot; point.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just to expand on this, the magnetic domains also average to zero at room temperature which is why not just any piece of iron is a magnet itself, they can only become aligned under the influence of an external magnetic field. The curie temperature is the point at which these domains are no longer fixed in place and become disorderly, if it was magnetized with aligned domains it will no longer be a magnet anymore.(note: it's \~1000 K, one zero less).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct, it is infinitely susceptible to becoming magnetized, by an application of an infinitesimal field. I didn't really want to go into domain pinning as this is an ELI5, but thanks for the clarification of the incorrect temperature, I will edit my post.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I thought I read that you could magnetize an iron bar by striking it against an object, and sort of shake the atoms into alignment.</p></div>		</li>
