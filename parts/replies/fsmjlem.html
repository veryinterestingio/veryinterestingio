			<div class="markdown"><p>This is partially correct and probably left a bit ambiguous for the ELI5 but it’s not just a lack of reflex that is being examined for. Hyperreflexia is also indicative of a neurological lesion and can be tested with a reflex hammer on the patellar tendon(knee).</p></div>		</li>

<p>If the issue is above a certain point, it causes extra strong reflexes. If its below, it causes lack of reflexes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a few reasons why. I will try to Eli5 it. </p>
<p>Yes it’s part of a general Neuro exam to isolate an injury to the nervous system to a specific area. </p>
<p>HypOreflexia indicates a lesion peripheral to the spinal cord!
HypERreflexia indicates an issue within the brain/spinal cord. </p>
<p>Furthermore, one can use the stretch reflex to isolate a peripheral lesion to a specific “myotome” spinal cord level (ie. lack of reflexivity to the patella tendon stretch reflex indicates a peripheral lesion at the level of L2-L4 spinal nerves). </p>
<p>Hope that was eli5 enough. It gets way more complicated!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This in itself is interesting to note. We're so conditioned to assume that we're all alike and identical, that nobody is &quot;special&quot;. That's not necessarily bad, but it can be problematic:</p>
<p>I was born with bilateral clubfoot and thanks to numerous surgeries I am able to walk, run, etc. However, I was pretty deep in my 20s before I realized that when people say their feet are &quot;tired&quot; and I say my feet are &quot;tired&quot;, we're not saying the same thing; they mean their feet are achy, level one or two pain max. When I say mine are tired I'm usually talking about level five to eight pain and that's perfectly normal for me to a degree that I'm used to it. For much of my life I thought that was fairly normal and that after a long day on their feet, everybody was having that level of pain and just wasn't mentioning it because it's &quot;normal&quot;. Also didn't realize that the average person, when standing at attention barefoot, will have the balls of their feet touching the floor while mine don't.</p>
<p>Someone aging with an undiagnosed ailment thus makes perfect sense; we're conditioned to assume that we're not especially unique. If a person notices &quot;pins and needles&quot; sensations in their feet chronically (for instance), they might not mention it to their doctor because they'd just presume that everyone experiences that as they age. Same with other symptoms that impair but that aren't acute enough to obviously be a major malfunction. This would certainly apply to issues that creep up gradually over time. That could get labeled as &quot;well, I am getting older&quot; quite easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find it so interesting when I discover, now and then, that I experience something I think everyone else does, but I'm wrong. Like sneezing when seeing a bright light, or the day I found out when people talk about imagining something, most people can actually &quot;see&quot; an image in their head, and I can't, at all. I thought it was just a figure of speech.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s actually not the case here. Reflexes are controlled by a “circuit” (referred to as an arc) that enters and exits the spine at the same level, so it doesn’t actually give us any information about the rest of the spine. </p>
<p>Other types of sensory testing, such as those for temperature/vibration perception, do utilize the entire length of the spine as you mentioned though.</p></div>		</li>
