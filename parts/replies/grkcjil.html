			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if you are joking, but if you really don't feel rested after waking then I'd recommend getting tested for sleep apnea. I used to be constantly exhausted regardless of how much sleep I got, but once I found out that I had apnea and started using a CPAP machine I immediately starting getting better sleep and actually woke up feeling rested.</p></div>		</li>
