			<div class="markdown"><p>In Ojibwe we have silent letters too! Most people don’t write them, because we don’t have a unified writing system (and how would you know we have silent letters if we never wrote the language), but the silent letters become heard when you start to conjugate the noun/verb ( for example: by changing it to past tense or pluralizing it).</p>
<p>For example: “nmadbin” is the command to tell someone to sit, but we don’t pronounce the first n until we conjugate the verb to be a locative command “bin-madbin”, the bi is the only sound we are adding, but it blends and makes the n audible.</p>
<p>So, for some of us, we keep writing the silent letters to make the noun/verb more recognizable when we start to conjugate it, because “new” sounds start appearing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that you need the approval of some dipshit on the internet, but it's just fucking amazing that indigenous people have been so resilient about trying to maintain their culture and language against such incredible odds. </p>
<p>Thank you for sharing, and you keep on keepin' on, you beautiful shining star, you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ll take the complement!</p>
<p>We also have traditional mathematics systems as well. That has been a lot more difficult to articulate and integrate into the Educational world for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>I try to tell academics that even Bohr realized the wealth of our knowledge and studied with the Blackfoot people in Alberta.</p>
<p>We efficiently built things! We had measurement and geometry, just not the metric system and not Euclidean Geometry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My fiance is ojibwe and was never taught his culture growing up. Hes now 27 and has only recently been able to learn his culture and history through local events in the city that the natives put on. </p>
<p>But he is striving every day to make sure his culture is alive and thriving in his family. His 8 year old daughter is in an ojibwe immersion program at her school and speaks the language better than he can. They go to powwows every time theres one near them, and she dances in them. </p>
<p>He recently had a son about three months ago, and is following the ojibwe beliefs as closely as he can. They had a ceremony for him where he touched the earth for the first time, but I just learned yesterday that he is not able to touch the water yet and there will be a ceremony for that a little later. </p>
<p>Every day during bonding time with his son, he speaks the words he knows, so his son can hear them. He names animals, gives praise, counts as high as he can, and just rattles off vocabulary words and what they mean. Sometimes supplementing it with pictures for his son to look at.</p>
<p>My fiance hopes his son grows up to be a grass dancer. His daughter is a jingle dress dancer, and while he himself doesn't dance, he says he likes to imagine he would be a mens fancy/traditional dancer. </p>
<p>Its amazing to watch him thrive in a culture that was almost wiped out. I am so proud of him for immersing himself in any way he can, and refusing to allow his culture to slowly be forgotten. He teaches me so much every day, to the point where I now know more ojibwe words than irish words. (My own culture that I'm learning)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The language, but also so much more has been passed down orally. We have oral knowledge of the giant animals that used to live here, notably the giant beaver. I heard the stories as a kid, then one day in my later years I found out that giant beavers used to roam here about 10,000 years ago, and Indigenous people are said to have been here for 12,000-15,000 years.</p></div>		</li>
