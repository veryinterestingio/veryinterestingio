			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a skydiver so I've fallen through a lot of clouds. It varies a lot - the small white fluffy clouds are like being in fog and are only slightly damp, the big black ones hurt as you hit the rain (we fall faster than the raindrops so it's kind of like sticking your head out of a fast moving car driving in the rain). The worst ones are the ice clouds, they really hurt.</p></div>		</li>
