			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely agree.  And if your Arabic or even just your fusha isn't great, it becomes almost impossible.  MSA is very nuanced and the measure system makes it really easy to lose the thread quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Written, MSA Arabic is already like English sentence in the OP's title. Without any ḥarakāt (short vowel markings) or other diacritics, it's possible to read a word in multiple different ways. </p>

<p>The measure system? Is this referring to the &quot;Forms&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Even with short words, like form I verbs, switching two letters could totally change the root. That said, I believe some dialects actually do switch letters, like متزوج in Fusha and متجوز in Egyptian. Correct me if I'm wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thats like the difference between asking a question and aksing a question.</p>
<p>Just because it happens doesnt mean its correct grammar.</p>
<p>In Arabic if you switch 2 letters around it could end up as gibberish or with a totally different meaning. So to answer OP, no you cant do that with Arabic and keep the same meaning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can read it easily without the dots on the letters if you’re a native arabic speaker, like so:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is known by many but the issue arises when you actually scramble the letters. I don’t think that’s possible because of the structure of the language.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Urdu uses a similar  script to Arabic, but don't usually use the short  vowel sounds ( such as بِت vs  بَت ) and because of hindi/hindustani roots, words are pronounced exactly as they are written. The volvels are placed in the long form with the cksntonants. You could switch the vovels around a bit and sentences could still make some sense.</p></div>		</li>
