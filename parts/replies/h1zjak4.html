			<div class="markdown"><p>You are absolutely right on the whole, but I will push back just a little against how you describe specialization in a PhD. While all academics specialize in a discrete area of their field, the process of acquiring a PhD is cumulative, and the work of PhDs is not limited to their narrow speciality. Most people with a PhD in a particular discipline will have a comprehensive understanding of their discipline's building blocks and a high degree of familiarity with topics adjacent to their own. Having a broader understanding is both built into the training and reinforced as part of the job through teaching, peer reviewing, conferences, and working with colleagues. </p>
<p>Many PhD programs require students to pass one or more qualifying exams before they can advance to candidacy. These are generally comprehensive tests about the field, or at least a large part of the field. For example, if you are studying economics, you may plan to write a thesis on the effect of microfinance on labor markets in India, but first you will have to pass qualifying exams on the topics of development economics and econometrics (for example). So generally we have to have a broad understanding of our corner of the discipline before embarking on the highly specialized path. </p>
<p>People with PhDs also often teach undergraduates. A person with a phd in chemistry may specialize in studying nanofabrication of new polymers, but she probably also teaches Introduction to Chemstry and an undergrad survey course in Material Science. </p>
<p>Finally, while each academic's or scientist's own contributions will typically be very narrow, she or he will always be part of a professional community that expects a broad familiarity with their discipline. It is sort a professional requirement that you keep up to speed on the field as a whole, otherwise you cannot fulfill your other obligations like advising phds, peer reviewing, hiring, etc. </p>
<p>Of course this will vary from discipline to discipline. My sense is that some fields require you to read more &quot;widely&quot; (for example, in political science you might also follow research in economics and psychology) than others. But I think, generally, while a person's PhD research will necessarily be very narrow, their knowledge is actually quite extensive within, and perhaps beyond, their field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In general terms, a very high-earning patent lawyer will have at least a master's (for the high-earners, usually in a STEM field), as well as a juris doctorate (at a top law school). You can earn a quarter mil out of school via that path, but the work is grueling, the education expensive, and the hiring process competitive.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I was looking for a patent lawyer traineeship when I graduated with a Master's and most (think like 80%) of those in the traineeship had a PhD (the rest a Master's). All of them in some physical science.</p>
<p>I went to a few interviews and they explained it as &quot;It is easier to teach a scientist law stuff than to teach a lawyer science stuff&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
