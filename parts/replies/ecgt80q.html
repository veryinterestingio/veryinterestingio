			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for sharing. Is the threshold for the acoustic reflex adaptive or absolute? I can get it from hammering a small nail ( not particularly loud but perhaps my body perceives the action as being loud), knocking on a door, playing with a drum machine through headphones ( bass or snare will trigger the reflex ). I don't think any of these sounds are particularly loud, but perhaps I've lost sensitivity and am actually causing damage ? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The threshold is different for different people, but itâ€™s typically around 90 dB HL. It increases with increases levels of hearing loss, and goes away with about 50 dB of hearing loss. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some Mercedes play a blast of pink noise to trigger the stapedius reflex and protect the ear if the car detects an collision is about to occur. I don't know enough to say if it seems effective, but it sounds like a good application of the protection is short-lived.</p>
