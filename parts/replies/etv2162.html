			<div class="markdown"><p>I was like this all through my 20-30s; and then around 38, I started having memories all the time.  I can't call up specific events until out of nowhere *boom:  water park, 1986, I was scared of the tall slide, so I rode the raging rapids tube river all day.  My locker was 86, and the gift shop had the coolest rainsticks I ever saw.  Now I can pull up those memories on command, but not others I've not recalled yet.</p>
<p>I'll just be doing some random daily thing and *boom:  Christmas at 6, I got a Lee Major Fall Guy stunt plane and a sled that I used on the town's big hill, all day.</p></div>		</li>
