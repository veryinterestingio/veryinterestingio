			<div class="markdown"><p>One point to add, the heart actually <em>does</em> grow larger and stronger, given enough regular high intensity load over time. It’s called Athletes Heart and usually presents as a slower resting heart rate, and larger heart muscle. There seems to be some contention on whether or not it is a medical condition or a benefit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry I wrote that badly. I meant to say that the heart doesn't grow if it isn't exercised.</p>
<p>I too have heard that larger heart can cause problems as well as having benefits.</p>
<p>What I actually meant was the heart can be trained to push more blood per pump or pump faster for longer periods of time but I wrote it completely the opposite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that not exercising can also cause the heart to grow larger due to buildup like cholesterol restricting blood flow and making the heart work harder. Besides the risk of blood clots, does this reduce the lifespan of your heart?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's fascinating. After I began running I realized I would sometimes have a resting heart rate at \~48bpm. And generally (or lately - I may be slacking) it's in the mid-50s. Never realized this literally came from an actual size change (or muscle increase) in the heart itself. I kind of assumed the rest of the circulatory system was just running more efficiently so the heart didn't need to work as hard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well actually all your muscles get more efficient at what they do the more you use them. In body building, it's called 'the plateau' and when this level is reached, weightlifters begin multivariate exercises in an attempt to 'confuse' the muscle groups, and try to promote growth. So, you may have an increase in mass in your heart muscle, but more likely your body has adapted to your exercise level and become more efficient at pumping blood. They're kind of 2 sides to the same coin in the end.</p></div>		</li>

<p>and it pumps less blood per pump, which can contribute to high blood pressure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That seems counterintuitive, could you explain more? Wouldn't less blood per pump translate into less blood in vessels, therefore less pressure in vessels?</p>
<p>I really liked the answer btw!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think he means to say a weak floppy heart <strong>requires</strong> a higher blood pressure to function(which is does). Having a higher blood pressure can cause other issues and strain on blood vessels.</p>
<p>Check out an autopsy of an obese person and check out the the differences in heart size, shape and stiffness compared to a healthy heart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uh... What you said makes sense. I went back for sources on what I said and the sources seem weak.</p>
<p>In general, low heart rate is indicative of being fit but not always and low heart rate itself may not have a health benefit regarding blood pressure ... I will edit. Thanks for pointing that out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As i understand it, you are correct.  A larger heart has thicker walls and thus smaller ventricles with less capacity.  The heart thus provides less blood flow with each beat.</p>
<p>However in athletes this isn't a concern because the effect is modest and the rest of the cardio pulmonary system becomes more efficient with exercise which results in an overall lower resting heart rate.</p>
<p>In individuals with high blood pressure, this can be a problem as it can lead to a feedback loop causing the heart to become ever larger and work ever harder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! I had those in the original post... but then edited them out because it was getting too long and I didn't feel comfortable ELI5ing. But they are some of the most common/severe diseases in the equation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Arteriosclerosis</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, studies have shown that &quot;chronic&quot; exercising can increase coronary arteriosclerosis... even though chronic exercisers have fewer cardiovascular events: <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.044467" target="_blank">https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.044467</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Diabetes mellitus</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Guilty. I thought about putting that in too, but there are so many &quot;Genetics&quot; and &quot;We Don't Knows&quot; that I didn't feel comfortable including it. But yes, diabetes is the poster child for the body not handling excess energy correctly.</p></div>		</li>
