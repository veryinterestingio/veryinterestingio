			<div class="markdown"><p>You are completely right - for topics like sea level rise (or anything related to climate), long and continuous data sets are absolutely key. As well as this, mutliple altimetry missions are key for ensuring best coverage of the oceans. Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich builds on a legacy of altimetry missions, including the Jason series, Cryosat, and the Sentinel-3 missions. Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich will be used in combination with other missions that are currently flying, such as Jason-3, Cryosat, and Sentinel-3A and B. Sentinel-6 is a continuation mission for the Jason series, and there is already the commitment for a Sentinel-6B mission, as well as for Sentinel-3C and D satellites that will also help to continue the measurements made. - H.E.K.</p></div>		</li>
