			<div class="markdown"><p>Those trippy art style that will say a word in a few colors. So FOCUS is in all white, than blue and red to highlight it. This is what lsd looks like for the patterns you see in everything. Plain white carpet you see all the patterns, looks like a tall field of grass that blows in the wind; with the same color as FOCUS.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry to get you excited. They exist inside your nervous system. There is a never ending supply of false information from misfiring cells and false patterns reported by low level vision subsystems. </p>
<p>These inputs exist in your brain because our sense organs are somewhat error prone. Not because they are outside of your head.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Iâ€™m not saying the hallucinations are real, but that your sense organs are producing wired patent a and false information all the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the hallucinations, you're wrong. Because they do not change based upon your relation to the object. At all. So there's some etherial field that doesn't work in 3D space which I've yet to see any evidence of (that shit Ted talk isn't proof of jack) or this is simply not true.</p>
<p>I am requiring more evidence to consider the claim.</p>
<p>Edit.. As hard as you want to believe it, you've just done science a disservice. Your incorrect but &quot;it would be so cool if it were true&quot; opinion is gaining popularity.</p>
<p>Great work. Awesome.</p></div>		</li>
