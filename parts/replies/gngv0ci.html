			<div class="markdown"><p>So it seems like you know a bit about teeth, so I got a question.</p>
<p>As far as I remember I started having issues with my teeth when I was around 7-8 and I still have issues at 23. In Norway we call it “ising” which basically means icing (probably jot a real english word, so closest might be freezing). I presume it’s the same as teeth sensitivity.</p>
<p>Basically every dentist I’ve been to have said I’ve got little enamel, and that’s the cause. But the thing is I only get this after consuming a lot of acidic(?), i.e sour candy and soda. For me it has nothing to do with temperature of the food, but when I chew something that is “too” solid, potato chips is the worst offender.</p>
<p>This feeling persist for 1-3 days depending on how severe it got. The feeling makes it very hard to chew food and I also get goodebumps.</p>
<p>So my question basically is; do I have teeth sensitivty or something else?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m going to preface this by saying I’m not a dentist, and what I say shouldn’t be taken as medical advice. Use at your own discretion.</p>
<p>If you have thin enamel it could be caused by multiple factors. Like poor oral health habits, acidic diets, fluoride in water, and just bad luck. When I say bad luck I mean not everyone is born with the same set of teeth. There is a difference in thicknesses of enamel, difference in number of dentin tubules, and different sizes of the tubules. </p>
<p>What OP is referring to is dentin hypersensitivity. Which is characterized by a short, sharp pain caused by an external stimuli. The stimuli being thermal, osmotic, chemical, tactile, etc. </p>
<p>If you have rebound pain which is pain after biting down it could be a cracked tooth. Without being in your mouth, it’s very hard to nail down what it is. Best course is to tell your dentist and let him/her diagnose you. </p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the original commenter.</p>
<p>To answer your question, it sounds like sensitivity, but there could be many causes, including an abnormally thin layer of enamel. </p>
<p>Sometimes when eating something too chewy/crunchy or when grinding your teeth you can irritate/inflame the periodontal ligaments of your teeth. I usually explain as like a &quot;bruise&quot; in the ligaments that creates temporary sensitivity. Often I see this with patients that clench and grind their teeth a lot. The resolutions are avoid super crunchy/chewy food, wear a night guard at night, and be mindful of teeth contact during the day. Your teeth should not touch together at all (not even rest together) except when chewing or swallowing. If they are resting together this means you are clenching.</p>
<p>Another potential factor is like the other comment that states you could have a crack in your tooth, but this is usually specific to one tooth. </p>
<p>Years ago I had a rather deep filling that was close to the nerve chamber, and for years it would be sensitive with overly crunchy foods, but over time has gotten better. Also a common cause of crunchy food sensitivity. </p>
<p>Without knowing more info about your specific situation, these are some potential reasons for your sensitivity. </p>
<p>Good luck!</p></div>		</li>
