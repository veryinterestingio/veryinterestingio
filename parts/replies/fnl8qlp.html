Here in the UK rules have just been (slightly) relaxed to allow lone visitors to see those who are dying in hospital and care homes, with visits being very carefully managed with PPE etc. Before this there have been lots of reports of families doing Facetime with people in ICU, to say goodbye, or to see them as they near the end of their life. I can only imagine how upsetting that may be - to say goodbye to your Dad as he lies incapacitated on a ventilator. Having said that, from my experience of ICUs, they are not necessarily places where families congregate around the individual for endless hours. ICUs can be relatively calm but measured, careful environments, where decisions are made incremently over a period of time, discussions are discreet and considered. There is not necessarily the drama that you might assume around very, very unwell people. So, in answer, my advice would be to 'see' the person if you can and want to but recognise that not everyone does, and that if you don't you can do other things with their belongings, or photos, to say goodbye. Rituals at the end of life don't need to exist solely at the bedside.</p></div>		</li>
