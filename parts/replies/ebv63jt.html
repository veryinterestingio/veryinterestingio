			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I'm aware the absence of the normal zeitgebers such as light, temperature and chemical composition of air/water <a href="https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/53/1/50/629499" target="_blank">correlate to a loss of organization of biological clock functions</a>. While many cave-dwellers do retain certain clock function seemingly for metabolic purposes, the loss of pigmentation/vision seem to be correlated with a loss in circadian rythm in several examples of convergent evolution, which appear to suggest that the primary rythmic que is light, with some minor support from temperature and chemical fluctuations.</p>
<p>It might interest you that certain yeasts <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/107/5/2043.long" target="_blank">retain a heavily dampened biological clock</a> in the absence of circadian ques.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seals sleep on the shore of water, the part which is underwater during high tides. I don't know if they have made extensive studies on this, but my own guess would be:
-They like to be on wet rocks
-They avoid sleeping where they are vulnerable to land creatures, and always have an escape route. The mobility of these animals on land is very poor.
-If they slept on normal circadian cycles, it would happen that they go to sleep at high tide, then wake up at low tide, thus leaving them with a very long path to reach water, making them vulnerable to land predators
-It can be convenient that water reach them, instead of them reaching the water when they wake up. </p></div>		</li>
