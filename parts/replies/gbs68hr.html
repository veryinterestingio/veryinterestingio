<p>Among other things, such as to not drain the battery too much, restart the compressor for a/c, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good news, your foot isn’t twitching. Your car’s battery management system starts the engine if it’s stopped too long. Usually because your other car electronics are consuming battery power while the engine is stopped</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have manual gearbox and my car still starts after się time by itself so this is probably not twitching. </p>
<p>In manuals it's starting if you press clutch not when you let go the break.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The car senses if things needing the engine are needed.</p>
<p>If the ac or heating is needed</p>
<p>If the brake pressure drops to low</p>
<p>If the engine gets to warm or to cold</p>
<p>If you press the accelerator</p>
<p>If the battery voltage gets to low</p>
<p>And on modern cars wich sense when the car ahead of you starts going, the engine might also already start, before you press the accelerator</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because getting the engine cranked doesn't require much power and therefore not much effective compression.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>mazda's system still uses the electric starter. The wiki page isn't entirely accurate. While most of what it says is true, it does this <em>in addition to</em> using the starter motor, not <em>instead of</em>. An ICE cannot hold compression for that long at all.</p>
<p>It works by stopping the cylinder midway just before full compression and then fueling that cilinder just before cranking so that chances are very high it will immediately fire when it l
passes top dead center. </p>
<p>To the driver it seems as if the ICE started all on it's own but in reality the starter motor definitely helped. A single blow of one cylinder exerts far from enough pressure to get the flywheel up to a high enough speed to keep the engine going. Otherwise cars could idle at in the neighbourhood of 50 rpm, but they need to stay above 650 rpm in most if not all cases.</p>
<p>Keeping the flywheel at a constant rate of angular velocity requires far less individual work from the cylinders than bringing it up to idle speed from zero.</p></div>		</li>
