			<div class="markdown"><p>The abstract does not mention the speed of reaction with hydrogen sulfide gas. Maybe it does behind the paywall?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In air, a silver object can tarnish owing to the reaction of silver with hydrogen sulfide (H2S). This is a gas found in the air as a result of some industrial processes and the decomposition of dead plants and animals. The reaction of silver with hydrogen sulfide to form tarnish is as follows:</p>
<p>2 Ag(s) + H2S(g) ---&gt; Ag2S(s) + H2(g)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the show, the Hydrogen Sulfide gas is at a concentration said to cause instant death. According to <a href="https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/hydrogensulfide/hazards.html" target="_blank">this OSHA article</a>, 700-1000 ppm will cause unconsciousness in 1 or 2 breaths, and anything above 1000 ppm is nearly instant death.</p>
<p>At this concentration, how fast would the reaction be?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>H2S will very nearly cause instantaneous death at much lower concentrations than 1000ppm, just to be clear for others reading this.  It's a neurotoxin that affects your central nervous system.  It's colourless, and <em>effectively</em> odorless, as above 25ppm (0.0025% by volume) it paralyzes your olfactory nerves so you stop smelling it. At 100ppm this occurs within 2-15 minutes.  So if you can smell sulphur for a second and then smell nothing, it is unwise to think yourself safe; never rely on your nose with H2S.  I believe up to 30ppm is considered acceptable for <em>only</em> up to an hour without immediate or serious affects to your health.  Working limits are less than 5ppm usually.  Above that, you are at risk of serious nervous system damage and/or death.  At 100ppm you'll be dead within 30 minutes, if not less.  200ppm you won't make it more than a few breaths.  200-300ppm, you are going to instantly pass out and be dead shortly thereafter as your nervous system is paralyzed and you suffocate.  1000ppm (0.1 vol%) for all intents and purposes is instant death.  No one is going to react fast enough to save you even if they can safely get to you.</p>
<p>H2S is heavier than air so it will sink and rest in low lying places.  It's highly flammable.  It's one of the most dangerous substances I encounter on a semi-regular basis at work, and for anyone reading this, <em>do not mess with H2S without a highly trained professional at hand</em>, and even then, be incredibly careful, have respiratory protection worn, etc.  If you see someone go down from presumed H2S poisoning, do not immediately go in to save them, you will fail and go down with them.  You won't be able to hold your breath and drag them out.  Call in actual rescue personnel trained for this.</p>
<p>Unless the reaction with silver occurs in literal milliseconds, which it probably doesn't, using it like they tried in the show to keep themselves safe is a very, very bad idea.  IRL you're just going to die.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/workshops-conferences/regional-workshops-conservation/understanding-silver-tarnish.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is an experiment where they mention sealing a silver spoon with a sliced egg (which would emit some trace amount of H2S).  The reaction is said to take some minutes for initial tarnishing (going black taking longer).  This is with low levels of H2S though, and it almost certainly would react faster at higher concentration.  Regardless, my guess is that the reaction would not be fast enough to serve as adequate warning though, especially if you're in an open air environment where the gas can move.</p></div>		</li>

<p>FWIW, in the show, they have it several feet in front of them, so assuming there's not much air disturbance or diffusion (i.e. there's a fairly thin mixing layer with mostly separated fluids), this would work, as long as the silver turned black fast within a second or two of entering the pool, since that would give you enough time to stop walking before you entered where the silver started tarnishing.</p>
<p>In addition, they had the silver at below head height, which, again, means more warning time. It's a terrible idea, but there <em>were</em> some attempts made to make it not unrealistic, and if the reaction is really that fast, it wouldn't require millisecond reactions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So I'd assume silver in a stream of high concentration hydrogen sulfide would turn black very fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aqueous vs gaseous phase can make a big difference.</p>
<p>Edit: Actually a paper I found suggests the mechanism is H2S oxidizing to S in water molecules on the silver surface, and then reacting with the silver, so in that case humidity is probably also very important in controlling the rate of the reaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the actual reaction requires oxygen, like this:</p>
<p>4Ag + 2H2S + O2 --&gt; 2Ag2S + 2H2O</p>
<p>The reason for that is that acids are not strong enough to oxidize metals like copper, silver or gold. Even worse, hydrogen sulfide only has the properties of an acid when it's dissolved in water. So on its own it'll never be able to oxidize silver for it to be noticed.</p>
<p>But oxygen is a much better oxidizer. And even though oxygen, too, is not strong enough to oxidize silver, the fact that we have Ag2S as the product - a chemical with near perfect and thus very stable lattice - means that the reaction becomes favorable enough to allow oxygen to be able to oxidize silver in combination with hydrogen sulfide.</p>
<p>And since oxygen is always there in the air, people just kinda forget about its role in this reaction, but it's still there. Plus, combined with the fact that your body constantly produces H2S through, ehem, farts, and so do the bacteria on your skin, it explains why silver objects slowly begin to darken when they come in contact with your skin, but not so very much when they just lie there on the table.</p></div>		</li>
