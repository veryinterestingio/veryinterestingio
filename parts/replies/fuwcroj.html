			<div class="markdown"><p>This was all super fascinating to read! It’s especially interesting to me that you mention some coronaviruses can cause the common cold, as I’ve heard that Coronaviruses are rare for humans to catch, though I heard that a long time ago and I don’t remember where. </p>
<p>That’s definitely good to know! I love microbiology and virology and I hope to study it in college, so I love reading all about this! Thanks for taking the time to write this up!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, specifically, (not including covid-19) the most common coronaviruses among humans are:</p>
<p>229E (alpha coronavirus)
NL63 (alpha coronavirus)
OC43 (beta coronavirus)
HKU1 (beta coronavirus)</p>
<p>None of them are serious if you catch them, and they are pretty commonly spread.</p>
<p>SARS and MERS are both coronaviruses as well, but they are very rare. SARS is extinct outside of a lab, and MERS is pretty rare in the middle east. (jumps from camels to humans) Both SARS and MERS are quite deadly. (Much worse than Covid-19)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, why do we not give everyone a coronavirus cocktail that gives us a miserable head cold for a couple weeks while also charging us with antibodies that suppress COVID-19?  </p>
<p>Could the fact that our kids are petri dishes and have been exposed to so many other coronavirus strains be the reason it has mostly affected them with mild or zero symptoms?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with the virus cocktail is it would kill people and spread to immune compromised folks.  Kid are most likely just less likely to trigger the deadly immune reaction that kills older folks.  In fact it might be more dangerous to older folks because it resembles an infect they had decades ago which may be part of what triggers a cytokine storm which is what is killing people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well this isn't confirmed about the other coronavirus. That's just my own personal hypothesis. If I'm correct, and we do figure out which strain it is, then we can decide whether or not to do that. </p>
<p>As far as kids go, we have no idea why they have such mild cases of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, the antibodies produced in response to cold-causing coronaviruses do not show any cross-reactivity with COVID-19. Therefore being infected with one of these cold-causing coronaviruses doesn't offer protection against covid-19. Some research suggests why children are less severely infected, including lower levels of general inflammation and less underlying conditions which typically worsen symptoms.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot; About half of a group of blood samples taken between 2015 and 2018 had immune cells that could fight the novel coronavirus. None of the people could have been exposed to the novel coronavirus during this timeframe, since it wasn’t yet found in humans. So scientists believe they could have immunity because they were exposed to the strain of coronavirus that causes the common cold.  &quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your last paragraph isn't totally correct. Up to 80% of people with the flu have mild symptoms or no symptoms. This is why it spreads so easily. The idea that you only have the flu if you're really sick is a myth. You only *know* you have the flu if you're really sick.</p></div>		</li>
