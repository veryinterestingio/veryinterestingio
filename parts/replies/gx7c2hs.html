<p>There are many different types of B cells that make antibodies but the thing that confers “lifetime” immunity are memory cells. There are also a couple different types of those… they don’t actively make antibodies but if they encounter the pathogen again they will right quick spin up a bunch of new B cells. </p>
<p>This is important because getting those B cells going in the first place takes a while but once they are made (and memory cells are created) the second time the antigen shows up the response it way faster.</p></div>		</li>
