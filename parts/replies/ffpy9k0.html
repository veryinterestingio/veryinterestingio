			<div class="markdown"><p>It sucks but app developers are shafted by a community who refuses to pay for entertainment.</p>
<p>If you've never spent money on a mobile game, you're part of the problem.  Spend money on the games you like and you'll see more games like them this isn't a hard concept.</p>
<p>Don't play the shit that shoves ads in your face.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciate when this is an option.  I get that they need to make money, and if I enjoy the game I don't mind paying for it.</p>
<p>What annoys me is when paying for it isn't an option, and instead I can pay $10 for something that would take me just a few minutes to earn in-game.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's called &quot;prestige pricing&quot; for a reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm - I used to work for one of these companies.  We had a group of people who would spend $150+/week on these games, which were biased towards players losing. It was a money pit, but they kept paying to play.</p>
<p>It was sad, actually. Most of these people were house-bound for various reasons, and had very little sources of joy in their day besides the occasional big wins and chats with other players.</p></div>		</li>
