			<div class="markdown"><p>Most humans will encounter irreversable health risks when their temperatures drop below 95Â°F for extended periods of time. You would have to sustain that low temperature for so long to kill the virus that the risk of you causing irreversible damage to the patient would outweigh the benefit. It's a double-edged sword.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a nobel-winning treatment for Syphilis that involved infecting the patient with Malaria. The increased body heat (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrotherapy" target="_blank">Pyrotherapy</a>)would kill the syphilitic infection, and then the patient would be cured of Malaria using Quinine.</p>
<p>There was a 15% mortality rate, and was obsoleted by antibiotics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't exactly the same thing, but the <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/Milwaukee_protocol.html" target="_blank">Milwaukee Protocol</a> has been developed to treat people presenting late in the rabies infection course - it involves putting patients into a chemically-induced coma to try and prevent the temporary brain dysfunction caused by the rabies virus from chasing death, while the virus is attacked with antiviral therapy.</p>
<p>However, it isn't really effective enough (8% survival rate, which admittedly is better than the 0% you'd get otherwise, but survivors can have severe neurological injuries) to be supported as a treatment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm almost positive that 8% is one person. Rabies cases are exceedingly rare and so it doesn't get tested often. And AFAIK it's only actually worked once without killing the patient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Influenza is actually a really cool example because we can look at two different mechanisms that control how  this species level restriction works. </p>
<p>First off, you're totally correct about sialic acid usage. Many influenza infections are zoonotically transmitted from fowl to pigs to human. Birds have exclusive a 2,3 linked sialic acid, whereas humans have exclusively 2,5 linkages. We could talk about the specifics but more important is that pigs happen to have both 2,3 and 2,5 linkages and therefore can act as an intermediate step for transmission.</p>
<p>Another restriction factor are the Mx proteins (MxA and MxB) which really effectively blocks  influenza replication. We don't really know how this happens if I'm being honest, but it certainly a major empirical factor in blocking flu spread. So to get effective spread of flu into a human host, you need the virus to bind both the proper receptor AND to be properly suited to avoid these restriction factors.</p></div>		</li>

So a combination of environment, metabolism, and this ratio would be the most encompassing answer.</p></div>		</li>
