			<div class="markdown"><p>Tbf, even before corn syrup, the high starch content in domesticated grains and their products would already contribute to increased incidence of tooth decay. Starch digestion starts in the mouth, releasing maltose, so consuming high starch foods would increase access to sugars for oral bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just the natural sugars of the corn, not from processing it inti syrup. It was domesticated in MÃ©xico's Central Balsas River Valley around 8700 years ago, and spread out from there.
It took the place that wheat has in European diets.</p></div>		</li>

This is the domesticated maize that spread out from Mexico and became an important staple crop for native populations in the americas</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another contributor was teeth being ground down. When grinding food, wheat, corn, etc., tiny pieces of stone would end up in the food and subsequently grind the teeth down over time. But this was more common in specific areas vs being a wide spread phenomenon. </p>
<p>Whatâ€™s really cool is being able to see the jawbone smooth out after tooth loss, the socket fills in with bone and itâ€™s smooth!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I still eat candy but not as much as when I was younger. I wasnâ€™t always big on brushing my teeth though it has become very important to me. I notice now that after just a few skittles my teeth feel weird, when years ago I could eat handfuls without the feeling. I also only drink water, so even with that it still only takes a few.</p></div>		</li>
