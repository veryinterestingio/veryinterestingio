			<div class="markdown"><p>One of three possible ways that atoms/ions can bond together to form a compound-</p>
<p>1) covalent bond- two atoms share electrons between them</p>
<p>2) ionic bond- two atoms/ions transfer electrons (with one of the atoms/ions losing the electron(s) and the other atom/ion gaining the electron(s))</p>
<p>3) metallic bond- electrons are shared among all of the atoms of a compound with three or more atoms (also referred to as a delocalization of electrons)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Atoms bond, as the previous comment said, in mainly 2-3 ways. </p>
<p>A covalent bond consists of two non metals that share outer electrons, while ionic bonds consist of a metal and a nonmetal (because of their ionization energies, or their ability to lose/gain electrons to/from other atoms that have higher attractive forces). In ionic bonds, elements exchange their electrons between each other. </p>
<p>The unit for covalent compounds are “molecules” and the unit for ionic compounds are “formula units”.</p>
<p>An example of a molecular compound is H20 (water, duh), CO2 (carbon dioxide), or CH4 (methane).</p>
<p>An example of an ionic compound is NaCl (sodium chloride, part of table salt), CaCl2 (calcium chloride, in “Tums”), and CuCl2 (copper chloride, found in blue fireworks).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not what they meant, covalent networks refer to the type of bonding in the material, not the structure. Glasses are also by definition non-crystalline.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No; &quot;crystallized&quot; means there is an organized, repeating structure.  &quot;Network&quot; means the atoms/ions involved in the substance do not form individual molecules, but rather one usually giant, unlimited in size, macromolecule.  A network can be crystalline, but can also be amorphous (with no regular, repeating pattern).</p></div>		</li>
