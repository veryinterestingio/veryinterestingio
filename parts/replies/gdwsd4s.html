			<div class="markdown"><p>Am I right in thinking one of the issues with going 100% renewable is the grid frequency?  Or is that just a UK issue with the National Grid? The UK had a windfarm trip last year I think and it took out most of East anglia and London? That's why there's a few old stations now being converted as inertia / balancing stations (Killingholme, bagman Bay potentially and also deeside). Its also why we still have coal and gas plants to supplement the demand and turn on in emergency situations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's still a problem outside of the UK but nowhere near as much as one, the shear size of the combined European grid and the larger amount of surviving heavy industry gives the grid much more stability. Having Lol that french nuclear and German coal also gives you tremendous inertia with all that spinning metal. </p>
<p>France once had their frequency move 2hrtz off and they didn't even notice for weeks as the transmission operator doesn't really care about it as it occured so slowly. In the UK it would have triggered a rapid risk of blackout. </p>
<p>All the UK batteries are being installed to correct for teh increasing risk of frequency events renewables cause.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, insightful! Hopefully more old stations can be retrofitted for inertia balancing as we move into more renewable sources. I recruit for the power sector so more projects = more work ðŸ˜‚</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that with France slipping 2 Hz down without the operator noticing is mind blowing! any chance you provide more info or a link?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. Nowhere in the world is 100% renewable yet and I have to tell people that way too often. It is closer than ever before but touting this place or that place stating it gets old for me fast. Especially as an environmental scientist who does care and wants this to go further. But people tell me I'm an asshole because it clearly states they are 100% in this headline and I must be against renewable</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah people here are weird. They downvote anyone who says 100% renewable isnt really achievable currently. Google makes everyone an expert.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah for sure. I think people just want it to be a thing so bad and they just don't fully understand. I also think just the stark opposition you get sometimes can drive people to just cement opinions with quick facts to have ammo to toss at people to support their stance. But we would all be a lot happier if we just looked into it more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are quite expensive yes. Starting and stopping them safely are incredibly delicate operations and while it can all be automated and done fairly quickly you want to very closely supervise it because of the potential consequences if something does go wrong.</p>
<p>Once you get it going there are fairly low running costs, the fuel rods last for 5-6 years before you need to swap them out so might as well just keep it running once you have gone to the effort of setting it all up. Starting and stopping it every evening to cover peak load just adds a bunch of wear and tear, meaning more maintenance costs.</p></div>		</li>
