			<div class="markdown"><p>At perihelion it's already close enough to burn up, which is prevented by the heat shield. But it wouldn't by any definition crash into the sun, because it would still be orbiting. I haven't looked into why the probe is being crashed into Venus rather than simply being left to collect data until it fails, but I suspect that there's a good reason.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To escape Earth's gravitational pull, you need a relative velocity of about 11.2 kilometers per second. New Horizons, the current escape velocity champion, left for Pluto traveling 16 kilometers per second. Parker Solar Probe's escape velocity won't top that of New Horizons—it will only be as high as 12.4 kilometers per second, depending on when in the 20-day window the mission launches.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as a comparison, New Horizons left Earth with a relative velocity of 16 Km/s and is going to leave the solar system.  Parker Solar Probe left Earth with a relative velocity of 12.4 Km/s and will only get kind of close to the Sun.  In order to get all the way to the Sun, you would need to almost double the current record set by New Horizons in order to cancel out all of the Earth's 30 Km/s of orbital velocity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could, but it would take a lot of gravity assists.</p>
<p>Gravity assists get more effective the closer you get to a planet, so there's a maximum as you'd hit the surface at some point.</p>
<p>We might be able to squeeze 1 or 2 km/s out of a Venus fly-by, but need to cancel about 40 km/s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could do that.  That is exactly what Parker Solar Probe is doing, just like the Voyager probes used gravity assists to get their escape trajectories.</p>
<p>The point of my post was just a raw comparison of the energies required to get to the two extremes of the Solar System.  You could get that energy from burning your engines or you could get that energy by stealing it from a planet through a gravity assist.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Only because it interacts with the (extremely thin) atmosphere of Earth. Without the atmosphere (or when it is negligible) things would stay in orbit basically forever. See the planets for example, they orbited the Sun for billions of years already. Satellites in geostationary orbit (e.g. TV satellites) will stay in Earth orbit for millions of years at least.</p>
<p>If we would just disable the Parker Solar Probe it is much more likely that it would crash into Venus at some point into the future before its orbit changes so much that it could reach the Sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m saying isn’t there a certain minimum speed required for orbit?  For example with earth something needs to have 5km/s velocity.   If it dropped to 4.5km/s would it fall out of orbit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eventually, yes, there is a non-zero amount of material the probe is orbiting through which would eventually slow it down. This would take thousands if not millions or billions of years though, because space is pretty empty. Like I said in the other comment I don't know why the probe is being decommissioned by crashing it into Venus, but presumably there is something they're achieving with that.</p>
<p>The reason why orbits around Earth slow down significantly on a human timescale is that a lot of our satellites are in low Earth orbit, which is about the lowest altitude you can maintain a stable orbit in (things are sent to low earth orbit because it's cheaper to put them there). Compared to interplanetary space though, there is still quite a bit of gas in low Earth orbit, which slows down satellites. If you put something in a higher orbit though, like geosynchronous orbit, I believe that those objects will probably orbit until the sun expands past the orbit of the earth and vaporizes them in however many billion years.</p>
<p>If you've ever heard of the problem of space debris, waiting for all the junk to slow down and burn up IS an option, but it would take a number of decades before the effect is significant, and nobody wants to wait that long.</p></div>		</li>
