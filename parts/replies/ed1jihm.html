			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a lot still. MarCO (Mars Cubesat One) was a tech demo what flew with the new Inshight Mars lander, and based on wiki info it only supported 8kbps:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The EDL information from InSight was transmitted through the UHF band at 8 kbit/s to the CubeSats, and was simultaneously retransmitted at an X band frequency at 8 kbit/s to Earth</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would depend on distance.  Pluto at its closest is a shade over 4 billion km away, Mars at its closest is 55 million km away.  Say 100x distance is a 40 dB delta in path loss.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also don't forget there is a huge amount of overhead information in each packet in the form of multiple frame-headers, FEC, CLCW etc. For a ground station just to lock and sync on a downlink takes up to an hour, if and when nothing goes wrong during the lock phase.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you seem to know this subject well.  would anyone be able to receive this data or is it somehow encrypted such that only NASA could receive and decrypt it?  Whats to stop an ordinary person (or other government) from sending it commands which would cause it to do something else?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Receiving data isn't the same as sending commands. Typically the commands are not only encrypted but also sent along with a timestamp to prevent repeater attacks. Repeater attacks are when somebody records your commanded transmission and retransmits your command. This has happened but now you have timestamps so that singular commands are associated with so a single command and can't be sent and received twice.</p>
<p>As far as decoding the the transmissions from the satellite itself. First you need a 34 or 70 meter telescope to have a high enough Signal to Noise(SNR) to see the signal. Once you had that you'd need to know their modulation scheme and and their decryption key. I don't know if it's public or not. </p>
<p>Many academic cubesats have their decryption code public so you can receive their signals and decode them for fun if you wanted. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amateurs have successful received and decoded data from the probes around Mars. However they were using a radio telescope at a university in Germany to do it.</p>
<p>For larger scale missions, you'll often get various radio telescopes on earth supplementing DSN. For example, when the Huygens probe landed on Titan, the signal was relayed by the Cassini orbiter. However, the big radio telescopes on earth were able to lock onto its carrier signal (though not decode) and do doppler measurements, helping to nail down the landing site.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>40m radio telescope, to be precise, right? And if I recall you can construct those with hardware supplies as it doesn't need an actual full-blown dish etc.? My knowledge of radio telescopy is extremely limited but I seem to recall that an array of radio antennae gives you the coverage of the distance between them or something like that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not super knowledgeable on this subject but do have a passing interest on communication technologies for space and afaik commands are encrypted with additional safeguards. Encryption on tansmission from satellites depends. They are usually encrypted now but there are many still out there that transmits recorded data freely. This is mostly try for satellites orbiting earth that are operated by NASA and other national space agencies around the world.</p></div>		</li>
