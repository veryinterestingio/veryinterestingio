			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't feel this answer is correct. It explains the mushroom, but the ring explanation is kind of all over the place, and vaguely wrong.</p>
<p>It's trying to say the cloud is formed because of convection, but it's not, it's caused by shock wave itself and resulting condensation</p>
<p>The answer below is much more accurate, and to the point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the questioner is referring specifically to Wilson clouds, while the answerer here is referring to something else entirely.</p>
<p>Wilson clouds are the “rings” that form around some mushroom clouds near-instantly as the shock wave hits them. They’re caused by the sudden very quick change in pressure hitting existing different of layers of air and prompting immediate condensation.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what kind of clouds this answer is referring to.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't.</p>
<p>The Coriolis effect acts on large scale atmospheric and oceanic structures that have a considerable difference in latitude between north and south edges. This is also the reason why the whole &quot;toilets flush the opposite way in the southern hemisphere&quot; is bunk.</p>
<p>A mushroom cloud is far too small for the Coriolis force to have any appreciable effect on its motion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't tangential velocity an important part of the Coriolis force? I'd argue that the lack of tangential velocity in the mushroom cloud would be a more important factor than the size in the case of the larger mushroom clouds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>None whatsoever. Mushroom clouds are local phenomenon, largely stationary, and generally short lived as well.</p></div>		</li>
