			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing that confuses me, is that google ads are allowing false advertising. Online marketing is part of my job, and you literally get ads taken down if you have too much text or some other small thing wrong with your ads. But somehow these ads exist without problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the mobile gaming industry is able to pull this shady shit because they move too fast, then ad tech is 1000% worse.  Digital ad fraud is <em>huge problem</em> and because there are so many links in the chain, it can be really hard to catch the bad actor in time to do anything about it.</p>
<p>The companies <em>you</em> work with are likely bigger, more earnest trading desks or some such, but there are plenty of BS fly-by-night outfits out there serving everything from false advertising to straight up viruses.  I recall one ad tech company I used to work for was building tech to detect whether the ad that's actually getting served live is the same one that was being displayed when our traffic managers were approving the ads to run in the network.</p>
<p>Because some fraudsters were finding ways to <em>switch which ad got displayed</em> once it was live.  Seriously, they were as intricate as choosing which ad to serve based on the IP of the device requesting the ad - if it was in the general area of our office, they served the &quot;clean&quot; ad to be approved.  Elsewhere, they served some belly fat shit which the publishers (website/game devs) <em>hated to see</em>.  We had to spoof our IP just to see what they were actually trying to run.  And that's just one example of the kind of stuff they tried.</p>
<p>I'm sure Google Ads is doing everything they can to stomp this stuff out, but &quot;mobile game misrepresenting its gameplay loop&quot; is not very high on the list of problems they're trying to solve.</p></div>		</li>

<p>At best, it's that, but at worst, it's footage stolen from a whole different game. Age of Empires is one game that gets used often for footage for an ad of a completely different game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have screenshots of 13 different websites advertising the exact same clothing line. It looks super fashionable and well designed. But you can never find any google reviews on them and there's literally a different company that pops up every few days /weeks. This is on Facebook and Instagram. The website template is the same usually, just a different domain name and brand name/logo... Shady af. When you do hear of reviews for the products, it's usually that they weren't as described, weren't the right size and took many months to arrive (if at all) she there's no way to contact them for returns... So there's an actual operation of some sort behind it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nailed it. I work for one of the largest companies in an industry which is all digital marketing based. The few big guys at the top get held to all the standards simply because of volume and ease of enforcement. The little guys don’t matter because it’s not worth the chase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's kind of how it works.  I create ads to send to customers who have explicitly asked for emails that include specials that we maybe do once every three months.  Our customers get mad if they *don't* get the emails.</p>
<p>The platform gets mad at me for too much text, and gets mad at me for not enough text.  Then it gets mad if there is too much text in the image.  Then the customer's spam filter blocks it.</p>
<p>Yet somehow, dick pill ads go right through just fine.  It turns out that my dick is small.  That's what the Internet says.  Those always get through all the filters.  The email from my bank that's important doesn't come through.  But at least I know I have a tiny dick.</p>
<p>No-one knows how any of this stuff works.  As soon as you get a bead on it, it changes and the old methods stop working. The best thing to do is just give up.  Unless you're selling dick pills.  Those are timeless classics.  </p>
<p>By the way, I'm selling dick pills if you'd like some.  Technically they're just Tic Tacs but at least they taste better than those &quot;fake&quot; dick pills.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They don't, not technically. <a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6020955" target="_blank">Misrepresentation is banned by Google's services</a>, and you can report them using a <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/troubleshooter/4578507" target="_blank">complaint form</a>. This also includes clickbait ads (including ads which use phrases like &quot;Click here to find out&quot;, or ads which use &quot;before and after&quot; pictures to advertise weight loss). In terms of specific numbers, I can find that Google banned at least <a href="https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/advertising/google-banned-1-7-billion-ads-for-promoting-misleading-content-in-2016/56807131" target="_blank">1.7 billion misleading ads in 2016</a>.</p>
<p>The same problem is as the above user said: there are a lot of companies, it's easy to make ads, and they fold before lawsuits can be filed. It's also difficult, seeing as we're talking about games and apps, to actually determine whether the ads are &quot;misleading&quot; within the span of 1 business day. Conversely, it's much easier to reject an ad for having too much text (which is usually an indicator of spam) since it's visual, and your average intern just has to take a look and make a decision.</p>
<p>Edit: If I had to hazard a guess, you personally are seeing more of your company's ads rejected <em>because</em> you're an actual company trying to advertise. Spam and misleading apps aren't exactly your way of life, so you're perceiving rejection more harshly than the scammers, who themselves don't really care and are just cranking out however many ads it takes to get themselves approved.</p></div>		</li>
