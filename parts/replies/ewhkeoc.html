			<div class="markdown"><p>Don’t forget fern prairies.</p>
<p>Basically replace the grass with ferns.  This is easy imagine as we still have areas with similar things, although generally not as extensive.  On the east coast of the US there are lots of areas where hay scented ferns are the dominate understory vegetation.  You can easily imagine how those areas would look if the trees were removed and the ferns remained.</p>
<p>All over the world in grassland areas there are large patches of bracken fern.  Just mentally expand those to cover a large area.</p>
<p>In tropical areas there are large extents of tangled climbing ferns that make dense mats.  Picture these less tall.</p>
<p>I’ve worked in all of these habitats and they’re all pretty interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if that would be right. A big part of what makes a forest floor the way it is comes from its proximity to trees (shade, constant source of organic matter, resistance to compaction, microbiology etc).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of it might just have been forest. Grass doesn't live on prairies because trees can't, there are trees that can thrive pretty much anywhere grass can, it lives there because it <em>outcompetes</em> the trees in those environments. Trees can't germinate in the thick roots of grass and while wildfires kill trees, grass survives it with thick tree-blocking roots intact. Wildfires which are encouraged by the yearly dying-back of the grass. In many ways it's that trees do well where grass doesn't, rather than the reverse.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For one, fuuuuuuuck that. But also how did they determine that termite nests could get to be that big when <a href="https://www.orkin.com/termites/colony/nests" target="_blank">this article</a> says that the &quot;largest recorded was 19 feet wide, and the tallest measured at 41 feet tall.&quot; Did they find fossils of termites along with empty nests or something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had trouble finding an actual source for 30 meter tall ones. This one:</p>

<p>Termite nests, from less than 1 m to more than 30
m in depth, reflect shallow to deep water tables in
proximal to distal alluvial and eolian-derived deposits in the Salt Wash, Recapture, and Brushy Basin

galleries and chambers (fungal gardens, storage, and
waste disposal) found deeper in the paleosols</p>

<p>Indicates 30m in <strong>depth</strong>, not height.. so??</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I hardly doubt Wikipedia nowadays despite what my teachers from elementary through college were telling me, it is possible that the writer meant the overall length or &quot;depth&quot; of the nest versus how tall it stood over ground. That would most certainly make sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, they found fossilized (sort of, preserved would be more accurate) termite nests 30 m in height. The nest is preserved in the rock, in this case an alluvial fan. I don't have the article in front of me but my guess is that the termites would keep the nest at a fixed height above the ground, and as the alluvial fan grew so would the nest. So you're not getting a 30 m tall nest sitting on the forest floor like a 10-story-tall termite apartment block. The nest probably got wiped out/killed by a debris/rock flow/fall. It would be interesting to know if the termites abandoned the lower layers as the nest grew, due to oxygen availability?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say that the nest could be said to be 30 meters tall even if mostly below ground. Even moreso when considering the nests are surely fossilized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That wouldn't be a good measure. The biggest termites I'm familiar with are the dampwoods, which have many fewer individuals and smaller nests than, for example, Formosan subterranean termites, which are considerably smaller than dampwoods, but have much larger colonies.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The latest evidence I've heard of puts angiosperms going back to at least 174 mya. In general with how often the date gets pushed back I wouldn't be surprised if they were around before the Jurassic as well.</p>

So in terms of functional ecology they would be somewhat similar as the horsetails (equisetum) we see today.</p></div>		</li>
