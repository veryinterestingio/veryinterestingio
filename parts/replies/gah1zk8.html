			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's not forget the coriolis effect.  It plays a major role in winds. </p>
<p>Basically, the earth is a merry-go-round, with the north pole in the middle, and the equator at the edges.  It's spinning at about a thousand miles an hour at the equator, but it's still, just rotating slowly in place at the poles. </p>
<p>The air over the equator is moving at <em>about</em> the same speed as the land, so there's not much wind.  The air mass just drifts along at 1000 mph, the same as the land.  But, as it drifts north from the equator, the land is moving slower.</p>
<p>What it means is that northerly winds tend to curve to the east as they get to higher latitude, and southerly winds tend to curve to the west as they get to lower latitudes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cpt. MacMillan: “The wind's gettin' a bit choppy. You can compensate for it, or you can wait it out, but he might leave before it dies down. It's your call. Remember what I've taught you. Keep in mind variable humidity and wind speed along the bullet's flight path. At this distance you'll also have to take the Coriolis Effect into account.”</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why is Wyoming so windy?  Because Utah blows and Nebraska sucks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's not forget about mountains causing winds too. Cold air naturally wants to descend, so when you have cold air in high altitudes at the top of the mountains it rushes down the mountains creating winds.</p></div>		</li>

Math says that no matter how you work it there simply has to be a place on earth where there is no wind (if only for a few moments).</p></div>		</li>
