			<div class="markdown"><p>In subatomic scales, gravity is so weak that it is a good enough approximation to say it has zero effect. Thats why the standard model (the modern theory for subatomic particles and the three other fundamental forces) works so well without needing to explain gravity.</p>
<p>However, once you go small enough and high energy enough, general relativity, (the modern theory of gravity that we know works for astronomical scales) starts to say weird things like &quot;subatomic black holes should spontaneously form if we try to look at things smaller than the planck length&quot;. </p>
<p>We don't know if general relativity is correct in subatomic scales though, so we don't know if this prediction is correct. We need a combined theory to figure out whats really going on. String theory is one possibility, but there are others, and no consensus yet on if any are &quot;correct&quot;. Welcome to the bleeding edge of modern physics!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just wanna mention that less and less scientists see much of a future in string theory. It uses to many assumptions about things we have absolutely no reason what so ever to assume and all experimental data over the past decade has made string theory less and less likely.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Look, we'd like to. We just don't know how.</p>
<p>One of the main problems is that our colliders can only investigate any force that's stronger than a certain threshold. It might seem that gravity is strong, but that would be ignoring how absolutely gigantic Earth is. For comparison, a dinky little magnet could defy gravity by sticking to a fridge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Standard Model is a theory that explains most of the world: the strong and weak nuclear forces, and electromagnetism. General Relativity is a separate theory that explains gravity in terms of spacetime. However, these theories are in fact incompatible with one another--and it is supposed that either one or both of these theories is incomplete. The current holy grail of physics is a theory of &quot;quantum gravity&quot;, which unifies general relativity and the standard model.</p>
<p>The difficulty in constructing such a unifying theory is that these theories operate on vastly different scales. For example, it's not possible to measure gravitational effects experimentally at the scale of individual atoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably a dumb question, but is there a reason as to why gravity isn't taken into account in the Standard model?</p></div>		</li>
