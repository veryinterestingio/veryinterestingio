			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is gold more likely to pick up an electron than thorium, in spite of the table showing (and how it's organization implies what typically happens with regard to electron shell assembly and changes) based on the fact gold is in one spot and thorium is in another.</p>
<p>But as others have said, the table layout is a trend based thing with regard to this issue, not based on a guarantee</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair the topic isn't really ELI able below high school for the most part without many paragraphs. Can't go into electron shells without just saying very basic things, can't go into the forces involved, can't really talk about the table except in very basic terms because there's a bunch of &quot;why?&quot; situations that would just complicate the whole discussion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><h3>Context:</h3>
<p>There are lots of elements in the universe, each with unique properties. If you're really clever and line them all up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table#/media/File:Simple_Periodic_Table_Chart-en.svg" target="_blank">a certain way</a> you start to see patterns in those properties.</p>
<p>The way all of chemistry works is all the atoms of each element play games with their electrons. Sometimes they can be shared, sometimes they are outright stolen from one another. Some elements are more aggressive than others at stealing electrons (electronegative), others are more aggressive at trying to yeet their excess electrons away (electropositive).</p>
<p>IN GENERAL, in the periodic table, the closer you get to the top right, the greedier the elements get, and the closer you get to the bottom left, the more willing they are to give electrons up. The right most column, Group 18, is an exception; the &quot;noble gasses&quot; that are famous for not reacting.</p>
<h3>Question:</h3>
<p>Why is gold (Au, #79) greedier than thallium (Tl, #81) even though thallium is closer to the greedy side?</p>
<h3>Answer:</h3>
