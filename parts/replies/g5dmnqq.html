			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this is where I have the issue with understanding money creation.</p>
<p>So the fed create money, with interest to lend to a gov, who sell bonds for money created that gets paid back with interest from more money created.</p>
<p>So in essence money is just made up and the fed create it, charge interest on it and just keep doing that over and over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When the fed issues debt 2 things happen.</p>
<p>The fed issues money to the borrower, (a bank) but it also issues itself an equal amount of money, so the federal reserve is always equal to the balance of debt owed too it.</p>
<p>Once the debt is repaid, both the debt and the fed holding are erased.</p>
<p>Yes, money, fiat money, is 100% fake.  What gives it value is the faith in the ability for the us to repay it, which is also guaranteed by law.  If the us cant make a payment, the fed automatically issues new debt to pay the old debt.  This is why most of the world uses the us dollar.</p>
<p>Theres also the issue of the petrodollar.  Every dollar of oil that is pulled out of the ground creates 1 us dollar, because oil can only be sold in us dollars.  Once the oil is sold, that petro dollar then gets counted on the fed asset sheet until the oil reaches market.  (And also why russia, iran, and venezuela get into shit with the us, by trading oil in other currencies)</p></div>		</li>
