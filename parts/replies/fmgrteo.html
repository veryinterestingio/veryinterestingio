			<div class="markdown"><p>They said waking up for vacation which implies they’re waking up to travel to the destination. That’s pretty normal</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>...i wake up around four or five o'clock every morning, work or leisure, and haven't used an alarm clock since adolescence:  i always count out my sleep cycles so i awaken to my body's natural rhythm instead...</p>
<p>...bad nights i might only have time to sleep three or four-and-a-half hours, mediocre nights six, but typical full healthy nights are seven-and-a-half  hours of sleep (unless i'm recovering from couple of bad nights, then it's nine when i get the opportunity, or ten-and-a-half hours after a brutally sleep-deprived week)...</p>
<p>...i guess my point is that even when i'm sleep-deprived i never wake up groggy and foul-tempered unless someone unnaturally interrupts a ninety-minute sleep cycle, and i've cultivated a sufficiently-attuned sense of my sleeping rhythms not to go back to sleep when there's insufficient time for another full cycle before i need to get started for the day...</p>
<p>...my wife's pointed out a handy side-effect of paying close attention to my body rhythms:  i can typically estimate any time of day or night within a margin of less than six minutes absent any external stimuli, basically plus-or-minus a sixteenth of my natural ninety-minute cycle...</p>
<p>...being a walking clock has negative side-effects, too:  i'm acutely aware of how long i take after lying down to start hallucinating before i can fall alseep at night, fourty-five minutes on a good night, ninety minutes after retiring on a typically-dissatisfying state of affairs, and three hours on a particularly-restless night...i also suffer from hyper-vigilance; if something commands my actively-engaged attention after i've retired for the evening, i get one free pass to start over going back to sleep again, but after a second interruption i'm up for the night and it's a waste of my time to even try sleeping...</p>
<p>...my wife falls asleep the instant her head hits the pillow; i'm envious of that but she also awakens in a foul mood pretty much every time her alarm goes off...</p></div>		</li>
