			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact, that is the only answer. Exponents are simply a convenient notation for repeated products. The zero exponent has to be defined as 1 in order to extend the notation to negative integers. This is an example of an empty product in mathematics. The other people with their division analogy (which I assume is probably borrowed from one of those youtube videos showing maths by drawing on boards) is going a round-about way which is even wrong as demonstrated by the fact that their analogy fails for <code>0^0</code> which has no agreed-upon value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excelent point with 0. But if x^0 = 1 is just a convention, then it can't be mathematically proven?</p>
<p>I still think those explanations are good enough to intuitively understand why x^0 = 1 with x != 0  though.</p>
<p>Furthermore, do you have a case where 0^0 = 1 is absurd or at least problematic? I love this kind of things lol</p></div>		</li>

<p>What about exponents that aren't whole numbers? Or ones that are transcendental? Or imaginary?</p>
<p>This seems like a very limited understanding of exponents.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually, their analogy gives a reason why 0^0 has no agreed-upon value, because it comes back to 0/0.</p>
<p>Using 0^0 <em> 0^2 = 0^0+2 = 0^2 = 0 could still confuse someone into thinking 0^0 = 1, since 1 </em> 0^2 = 0^2 also.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the only true reply. The rest are cookie cutter calculations that end in x^0 = 1 that make it seem like it's a natural outcome when it's not, which is deceiving. </p>
<p>Not everything in math can be derived from a natural occurrence, in this case WE decide the rules for the outcome, and we choose 1 because it fits in with most of our other calculations, but in &quot;real life&quot;, 7 potatoes elevated to 0 don't turn into one potato.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Type mismatch.</p>
<p><strong>(7 potatoes)^0 = 1</strong>, with an unspecified unit. So it's just <em>one</em>, not <em>one potato</em>. This one is an implicit multiplier that's multiplying nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, in the entire thread this is the only right answer (among those I saw): every number to the power of 0 is equal to 1 <em>because mathematicians define it such.</em></p>
<p>All the other answers just explain why it is useful to do that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>is it really? if you just follow the progression of x^1, x^2, x^3 it always multiplies by x. if you go on the opposite direction it always divides by x.</p>
<p>you can use the same logic to justify x * 0 = 0.</p>
<p>btw, 0^0 is not 1</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's a relationship we expect to maintain so we define x^0 to be 1 so that it matches that behaviour. You said it yourself, you use that logic to <em>justify</em> defining it that way. On the other hand, some operations like 0^0 are undefined or rather are indeterminate forms, with answers dependant on the context. </p>
<p>Read up Wikipedia on how exponentiation is defined, it's rather interesting. In the case of positive and negative integers it's pretty simple repeated multiplication definition. In the case of rational numbers in general, rational numbers can be defined as p/q so it's splitting up x^(p/q) into two exponents. For irrational numbers, we notice that all irrational numbers as the limit of a sequence of rational numbers so we just take that limit for the rational numbers that approach the irrational numbers using our previous definition.</p></div>		</li>
