			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there are just too many variables. It‚Äôs easy for any guy to be concerned but it probably depends on a lot. Age, obviously but I bet how much you eat and drink before sleep and even how you sleep could probably affect it. Sleep with a lot of blankets so you‚Äôre sweating or do you like the covers half off with the window open? </p>
<p>I am not a doctor but they must all add up to something. What‚Äôs important obviously is that it works when you need it to and that you aren‚Äôt afraid to ask questions or be honest, at least online. When dick jokes start flying around guys it can be pretty damn silly. I know guys who are over 40 and overweight and if you asked them they would say there dick is hard all the time and you must have ‚Äúsome sort of problem‚Äù and I just never believe them. ‚ÄúYa I am overweight and smoke and eat like shit and everyone can see my vices from down the street but my penis is perfect obviously why you even imply otherwise?‚Äù</p>
<p>I am 34 have woken up with a raging hard on and then couldn‚Äôt get it up that night either because of alcohol or nerves. Isn‚Äôt the human body a mess? ;p</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No morning wood on its own is not likely to be an issue, but you might as well go to doc if you live somewhere with free healthcare. </p>
<p>Don't splash the cash otherwise though - unless you have other cock related symptoms you're almost definitely fine</p></div>		</li>
