			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, I don't know why throat swabs didn't catch on. I briefly was asking patients to give me spit in a cup along with their nasal swabs for a research study, to see if it could also be found in saliva. I don't know what came of it though. I can personally attest to the difficulty of getting nasal swabs. Patients have begun refusing them upon admission without consequences. When I administer the swabs, I need to hold the back of their heads to keep them from pulling away before I can get back there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, I think I misunderstood the term when I used it, after looking into it more I no longer think it applies to what I was describing. I edited my comment, my apologies. &quot;Fomite&quot; refers to an inanimate object that is contaminated with the virus, and can be a vehicle for transmission.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So my hospital was only actually using nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID diagnosis. The saliva tests were just used for research purposes and didn't go into the electronic medical record of the patient, so nursing never got to see those results.</p></div>		</li>
