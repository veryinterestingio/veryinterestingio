<p>Aren't they talking about now making it a two dose?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the downsides of the adenovirus based vaccines (jnj/azn) is that your body tends to get good at attacking other aspects of the adenovirus after exposure. Not necessarily the spike proteins they put on it. There's a lot of history with humans and that virus. So we are quite adapted to fight it. It would probably be in your better interest to get a different vaccine for the second dose.</p></div>		</li>

<p>On that note, would there be any downside to stacking additional vaccines on top of the one I got first?  Like, even if you got two dozes of Pfizer, to get an Astra Zeneca or J&amp;J later on if it was available to you for some reason, like a leftover dose that otherwise would be discarded?  </p>
<p>Or would that not reap any additional benefits?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can find a lot of articles from November about testing two doses of J&amp;J but not about the results. In recent months there is more testing of a combination of J&amp;J with a booster shot from an mRNA vaccine like Pfizer or AstraZenica because the protection against variants is less studied with J&amp;J. It seems like it could make it even more effective but at this moment I don't find hard numbers. In any case the advantage of a booster shot is much lower than the difference between unvaccinated and vaccinated.</p></div>		</li>
