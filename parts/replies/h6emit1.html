			<div class="markdown"><p>We couldnâ€™t afford neutering my pup until he was 10 years old. Everyone is so shocked at how young and healthy looking he is (now 14-15), all his friends born around the same time, have passed. Makes me question. Heâ€™s still healthy after neutering, so is his great health at his age due to late spaying? Idk</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh thatâ€™s interesting, may explain it :) </p>
<p>Unfortunately, he was nearly killed (close call) as a pup because he was so aggressive to large dogs (heâ€™s tiny). After, itâ€™s been far safer, heâ€™s more docile. </p>
<p>I guess at the end of the day, itâ€™s about balancing the benefits and risks, i.e. taking into consideration overpopulation in shelters. </p>
<p>But I canâ€™t say much on the subject as I simply havenâ€™t read any of the science thatâ€™s out there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Australia itâ€™s extremely expensive. My parents are on disability pension. We finally found a charity/VET that would do it cheaper.</p>
<p>EDIT: not to mention many years ago it was a lot more expensive.</p></div>		</li>
