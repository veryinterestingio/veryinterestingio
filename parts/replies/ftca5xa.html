			<div class="markdown"><p>For the most part, the sending country only needs to know which boat/plane/container to put the mail on to get to the other country. The rest is for the receiving country. Some postal systems that send a lot of mail to each other across a wide area, like USPS and Canada Post, may route a little more intelligently.</p></div>		</li>
