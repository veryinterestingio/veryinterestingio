			<div class="markdown"><p>Conservation is a multidimensional topic, where deforestation is one layer, social justice is another. The sovereignty of a country over rainforests is not the key issue. In this globalized world, where the consumption of a product in one country affects the demand in another (e.g. chocolate product of child slavery in the Ivory coast, coffee product of deforestation in Peru), we must find solutions that are global as well- Fanny</p>

<p>While forested lands are concentrated in specific countries and under the jurisdiction of those governments, every part of the world is connected to forests. Commodity drivers of deforestation, also known as forest risk commodities (FRCs), are produced out of certain places but then traded internationally. The processors, transporters, and consumers of these commodities also have a responsibility to engage in efforts to reduce deforestation. Supply chains are incredibly complex and fragmented, and transparency and traceability are fundamental to slowing deforestation. Of course, policies about land concessions and land use change which come from governments are also important, but without transparency, those who are cutting down forests or degrading land cannot be held accountable. Countries like China and the United States, and the EU as well, which don't have tropical rainforests of our own but import lots of FRCs, can contribute with policies, technology, consumer-choice pressure, and more to help the world achieve global net zero deforestation. But first, it requires that we choose to work together! - Rosie</p>
