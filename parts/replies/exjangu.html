			<div class="markdown"><p>I genuinely want to know this:</p>
<p>So the google homes and alexas are actually not listening to anything in homes despite the (fake?) youtube videos and articles saying so? </p>
<p>If so then in the near future, would it be possible for Google or Amazon to upload this information into their own cloud (aws services for example).
Follow up: is the only way that we can tell the mic is uploading everything it hears through user networks and routers, or can we tell from our own amazon/google accounts?</p>
<p>Thanks</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The devices &quot;wake up&quot; and start sending what you are saying when you say the words it's listening for.  So normally it sits in the background and is dormant until it hears the catchphrase, and then it knows that whatever you are saying after the catchphrase is what it needs to upload to the cloud for analysis.</p>
<p>One issue is sometimes people will say something similar to the catchphrase, the system wakes up, analyzes what it hears after the catchphrase and comes to the conclusion you did not mean to activate it.  It will go back to being dormant but the sentence(s) it analyzed has been uploaded to the cloud.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I've seen, there is no real evidence that the devices constantly listen to or analyze conversations unless activated by a keyword. It's likely just confirmation bias along with the fact that Google and Amazon already know everything about you, without having to listen to your home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how come when I talk about such and such a subject near my phone, Facebook (on my phone and in my browser) immediately starts advertising something related to that subject? Is that really not a genuine phenomenon, surely others have noticed this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have Instagram try talking near your phone about a specific software like Spotify or dishwashers. Or that you are really hungry for a specific restaurant. Something completely arbitrary from your life. Then scroll through your Instagram and pay attention to the ads. I've since removed my microphone permissions from every app that it isn't vital to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Y'all got some of dat evidence/sauce? </p>
<p>I kind of assume they did something like <a href="https://github.com/Picovoice/Porcupine" target="_blank">so</a> though 'closer to the metal' since amazon only cares about one keyphrase and they make so many devices.</p>
<p>Ooooo and chiggity-check out the top rated poster's <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/542121/hey-siri-apple-machine-learning-journal-april-2018/" target="_blank">article</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every phone and most Apple tablets since the iPhone 6s have had a low-power and always-on processor that continuously listens for the key phrase “Hey Siri”. That’s all this chip does.  <strong>This voice recognition processor uses a neural network that mimics the layout of a living brain.</strong></p>
