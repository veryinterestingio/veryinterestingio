			<div class="markdown"><p>What correlation do those numbers have to how long a person smoked habitually? For instance, I started smoking at 19 but fairly infrequently, and I'd get bored or disgusted with myself and stop after about six months. I smoked on and off for about 5 years, with 3-6 month gaps in between. Nowadays if I try and have a cig all it takes is one draw and I decide &quot;you know, this was a terrible idea&quot;. </p>
<p>Does the 15-20 years figure still follow?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are no good extrapolation data. Basically, we assess exposure by years of smoking and packs per day.
It's unknown if 30 cigarettes in one day is better, worse, or the same as 1 cigarette per day for a month.
With radiation exposure, we believe getting a single large burst is more carcinogenic than chronic low exposure. The rationale for this belief is that there is more time for the damaged cell to die or heal before getting exposed to more carginogen/radiation</p>
<p>As for your risk of lung cancer, based on your description, it's probably not much higher than baseline. Although keep in mind that nonsmokers can still get lung cancer. It would drop from #1 to #6 of lethal cancers if no one in the world ever smoked.
Cardiovascular health (like blood pressure) on the other hand, can be affected by a single cigarette.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For radiation there are a number of different theories about low dose rate to risk. As it's frowned upon to subject people to radiation for science most of our research comes from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Chernobyl and fukashima.
The most likely is linear threshold, meaning there is no risk up to a point, before it increases linearly. The reason for this threshold is due to the environmental dose that we receive. We've literally evolved in it. We can also see that different populations don't have higher cancer rates despite being exposed to a higher dose. E.g pilots, people who live in Cornwall, Aberdeen etc. </p>
<p>Like you've said non smokers suffer from lung cancer too.
As the environment we evolved in isn't free from pollutants and other potentially harmful airborne unpleasantries. I would assume that we have developed the capability to survive/repair to at least a certain extent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The last part is a little misleading, your cardiovascular health be will temporarily affected by just one cigarette, even one or two drags, but without chronic use it'll be back to normal in hours. Even with chronic use your blood pressure will go down quite a bit within days. So if you're considering quitting, but thinking to yourself &quot;why bother, it's going to be years till I feel better&quot;, you'll feel better in 3 days once the worst of withdrawal passes. The psychological pull of the addiction take a while longer though.</p>
<p>I quit 13 years ago after smoking for 20 years. All of my health markers have improved dramatically, and I feel great.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you more reading on this? I absolutely believe it, but I would love to see how it was estimated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Though cancer risk and lung damage are not the same thing.  Sure, statistically a smoker has the same chance of cancer after 15-20 years of having quit as a never smoker. </p>
<p>But, what about lung repair, efficiency, capacity, etc, compared to a never smoker?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So while your heart and circulation can recover the cancer risk will always stay higher as for a nonsmoker at lesst this is what the overview suggests.</p>
<p>15 years is a crazy long time, I didn't expect that.</p></div>		</li>
