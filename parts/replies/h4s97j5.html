Like a forcefield, trapping air inside while keeping earth outside, from the Earth's core to outer space.</p>
<p>Just like if someone asks you &quot;if you would win the lottery&quot;, the correct answer would be &quot;lotteries are voluntary taxations of the poor and low educated, that I refuse to pay&quot;, but that answer would neither be satisfactory, nor relevant to the question. &quot;I would use my money to make hunger history worldwide&quot; would be a way more satisfactory answer, and might win you a Miss Universe competition. Good luck with that, beauty!</p></div>		</li>
