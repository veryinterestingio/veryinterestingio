			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to add that many organisms (including humans) do generate short bits of dsRNA in the course of the regulation of gene expression via miRNAs. miRNAs are transcribed and after a lot of processing, you are left with a 22nt piece of ssRNA which can (in conjunction with some proteins) base pair with target mRNAs, inhibiting their translation and/or causing them to be degraded. More than half of protein coding mRNAs are regulated in this way. Kind of a special case, since usually dsRNA is treated as a sign of viral infection, as you pointed out.</p>
<p>Whole miRNA system was discovered quite accidentally by people doing basic research in nematodes and plants-just goes to show the value of funding that kind of stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't think it was so much of a didn't know, more of a didn't care.  I remember his response was that would make a good research paper.  It was an intro to Anatomy and Physiology, a 300 level class, don't think he wanted to be bothered explaining it to a newb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, RNA viruses use double-stranded RNA. Most eukaryotes have a double-stranded RNA triggered defense system that chops up the RNA and uses the pieces to find and chop up more RNA. This fights RNA viruses but also controls gene expression.</p></div>		</li>
