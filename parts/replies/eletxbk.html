<p>Some of them but not all.</p>
<p>Nickel has the peak in binding energy per nucleon: Something a bit heavier still has a very high binding energy, if it would split the products would be far away from the peak and have a lower binding energy. Niobium-93 is the first isotope where fission would release energy. Compare this to iron with a mass number of ~55: You need close to twice the mass of iron before fission releases energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahhhh - I didn't think about the fact that the resulting isotopes with ~half the mass need to have more binding energy so essentially need to be closer to the peak.  Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a physicist here, but someone with a bit of statistics background: aren't all the sub-atomar processes best described as statistical probabilities? If so, then there must be a non-zero probability that the sub-atomar components randomly align in a way that may lead to instability and eventually cause the atom to disintegrate.</p>
<p>This probability may be extremely low, but not impossible, and with a estd. 10⁸⁰ atoms in the universe, it would certainly happen to some of them within a reasonable time span.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did you mean &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_particle" target="_blank">subatomic</a>&quot;? If so, then not really. While it is true that physical processes on such small scales are random and can be described by probabilities, they still do have to satisfy certain constraints. One of those constraints is conservation of energy, and that outright forbids the decay of an atomic nucleus if the decay products would require more energy than the original nucleus. Of course, something from outside the atom could provide the needed energy, but then we wouldn't really call it a decay, nor spontaneous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The probability for a process that doesn't conserve energy is exactly zero (popular science articles get that wrong frequently). If every possible splitted state needs more energy than the original atom has then the atom cannot split.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fission of large nuclei produces two nuclei that are typically ~1/3 and 2/3 the mass of the original nucleus. It only happens with very large nuclei and it is usually a rare process unless you go to the very short-living elements that we can produce in accelerators. Compare this to alpha decay, where one nucleus has just 4 nucleons (and always 4) and the other one can have more than 200. It can happen with smaller nuclei and it is a common process with many nuclei.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What kind of decay is that considered? Most of the fission diagrams use neutrons as the particle that breaks the atom, but I had always assumed any type of radioactive decay could cause it.</p></div>		</li>
