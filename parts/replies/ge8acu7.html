			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting and is the first mention of this that I've seen.</p>
<p>Is it that the mRNA vaccine creates the initial response and is then itself broken down, leaving nothing in the body but the antibodies created in response?</p>
<p>If so, that would surely be a huge positive that needs to be more widely known, and particularly among anti-vaxxers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The instability of RNA in living organisms isn't a bug, it's a feature.</p>
<p>When a protein is needed, cell produces RNA to manufacture the protein.</p>
<p>While the protein is still needed, cell continues to produce more RNA to replace the ones that have broken down.</p>
<p>Once the protein is no longer needed. Cell stops producing RNA. Existing RNA breaks down to stop production of the protein.</p>
<p>If RNA was stable, unnecessary proteins would have continued to be produced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>RNA like ice cream. It gets melty. </p>
<p>Moderna is like dippin dots. They make less melty RNA. </p>
<p>Also, don’t believe your Facebook uncle who is spreading conspiracies about vaccines. RNA doesn’t last long in your body, they’re like James Bond’s exploding tapes anyhow.</p></div>		</li>
