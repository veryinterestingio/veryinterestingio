			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an anthropologist or an archeologist here. I still thought the same thing, it’s a bad question, we didn’t split from chimpanzees, we evolved into what we are while they separately evolved into what they are, we did however share a common ancestor, though I don’t know what that ancestor is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weird that you’re a archeologist and anthropologist and didn’t mention Australopithecus, as the closest most recent common ancestor, versus homo habilis or florensis? </p>
<p>That’s 20+ year old information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar background here.  <em>Habilis</em> is way too recent to be a chimp ancestor, and not for nothing, I've got a bottle of scotch riding on the bet that 'hobbits' will turn out to be a misidentification.  Haven't checked in on that in a bit but I may lose that bet.</p></div>		</li>
