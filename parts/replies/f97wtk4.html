			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you provide a source for the ACC being important for pleasure? I'm in the neuroscience field and I've never heard that before. Also hypothalamus is not the center for fight or flight, and neither is the amygdala.  Please do not share misinformation with the public (no matter how small, like a comment on a Reddit post) as it is harmful for everyone</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ACC and S2 were shown to be activated during an fMRI.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10943682" target="_blank">1</a> And ticklish laughter results in hypothalamic activity. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/23/6/1280/426218" target="_blank">2</a></p>
<p>As for ACC being important for pleasure - <a href="https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0416-1" target="_blank">3</a> [4] (<a href="https://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/jnp.23.2.jnp121" target="_blank">https://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/jnp.23.2.jnp121</a>) [5] (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5651145/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5651145/</a>)</p>
<p>The hypothalamus definitely plays an integral role in fight or flight as the hormone regulator. Amygdala -&gt; Hypothalamus -&gt; Pituitary gland -&gt; ACTH. This is so central (and kind of basic...) that I have a few doubts about you being in the neuroscience field. Unless you're just being picky as hell with my wording of &quot;center&quot;.</p>
<p>But I digress here is the source for hypothalamus being part of the fight or flight response.

<p>Hypothalamus and Amygdala is central to physiological activation/deactivation, you learn that in first year psychology.</p></div>		</li>
