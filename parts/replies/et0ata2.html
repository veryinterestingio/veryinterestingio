			<div class="markdown"><p>Note: this is for NHS nurses. Doctors work on average slightly more hours per week (often ~46 rather than 36) but with a mix of shift patterns over an ~8 week rota where every week is different. Some weeks you might work 50-60+, others less, depending on the rota structure.</p>
<p>For most departments this is 8am-5pm, 8am-8pm or 8pm-8am, but in A&amp;E you'll see a lot of 1pm-11pm and 4pm-2am shifts because fuck them having normal lives.</p>
<p>There isn't overtime per se for doctors, but you can work additional shifts in your own time if there are shortages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bear in mind you get paid for your time substantially more. (Admittedly with ridiculous college loans etc., although we're catching up).</p>
<p>We've seen a 20-25% paycut in the last 10 years from a much lower paypoint over here, and our pension/retirement age will likely be 70 years old before long (good luck patients).</p></div>		</li>
