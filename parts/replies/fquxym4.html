			<div class="markdown"><p>I always marvel at the people of the desert Southwest comparing where they lived (tops of mesas) with where the water and food was (bases of mesas). A &quot;daily stroll&quot; would make most rock climbers blush. I doubt they were the only peoples doubt series rock climbing.</p></div>		</li>
