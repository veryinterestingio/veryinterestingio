			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question -- and sort of gets to the heart of the matter. We're pretty sure we know what the players are in measuring distances using standard candles: the stars themselves, the physics of the stars, dust in the Interstellar Medium, technical aspects of how we do the measurements. I think it is unlikely that we are missing a genre of concern at this point!<br />
But we do argue a bit about if we are properly measuring the impact of the terms (e.g., was there enough dynamic range in the sample used to estimate this or that) or if we are using the terms properly when we measure distances (e.g., if we should assume a single &quot;best&quot; value or fit independently). </p>
<p>For instance, a recent paper looked at whether or not the dust in different galaxies have the same effects with wavelength. We have evidence that the properties of dust with wavelength can vary, but do we see that in the data? and does the data allow for it? That's sort of where we are as a field right now.</p></div>		</li>
