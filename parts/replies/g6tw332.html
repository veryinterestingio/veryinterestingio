			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotal, but I got my shoelace stuck in an <del>elevator</del> escalator as a kid. It was actually a really scary experience. It was an airport escalator so it was FULL of people meaning I was getting trampled on by a crowd while also trying to pull my shoe. My dad is physically pushing people away from me, meanwhile they can't stop themselves from moving forward and the people at the top of the escalator don't realize there's a problem until they've already stepped on. We ended up having to take my shoe off because neither me or my dad was strong enough to pull the shoelace out (very surprised it didn't rip but it didnt) and the last thing I remember seeing was my shoe go toe first into the metal and get absolutely teared to shreds</p>
<p>Edit: this really took off glad people are enjoying the story üëç a few people mentioned the emergency stop button. Someone did press it, I forget if it was my dad or a random person. But the whole story took place in a matter of 15ish seconds and by the time they pushed it it was already over</p>
<p>Edit 2: two people below me have much more interesting stories. Mine was just a scary close call. I almost feel bad that mine is getting so much attention when a woman got her dress rippled off any another guy got his hand mutilated.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I was bored inside a Macy's when I was like 7 and I saw the emergency stop button. I actually lifted the cover on the button and an alarm immediately sounded very loudly. I quickly ran away after that</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about the torque the motors in an escalator must have to lift the escalator plus all the cargo up. Now think about how a lot of the time that isn't needed because they have busy times and quiet times. What you're thinking of is a motor designed with a variable torque output that, if it meets resistance, will scale up and overpower it. Whatever goes into that motor is getting minced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My husband always makes fun of me because I basically wrap myself around my toddler any time we use an escalator and practically throw her over the step off point (she thinks it's hilarious). I'm not having my only child get sucked into an escalator, thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mechanism is suspended by necessity to allow the conveyer-like motion, the brushes on the other hand are attached to a band of metal which is grounded.</p>
<p>Static electricity can travel to generally nonconductive materials like Nylon, and is then conducted away by the metal band to discharge into the ground rather than into the fingertips of passengers and potentially delicate circuitry in the mechanism.</p>
<p>Many escalators also have grounded metal brushes under the floor at their base to do a better job of discharging static, but metal brushes are more fragile and expensive than nylon ones, and don't do as good a job at 1 and 2, so they aren't viable to run all the way along the sides.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do this for conveyor belts as well. Anything that rotates a belt will eventually build up static electricity. In one case, a coworker of mine designed a conveyor without grounding and nearly killed a worker in Korea because it built up thousands of volts electricity and discharged it right into the guys arm when he touched the conveyor. Sadly, the labor laws in Korea aren‚Äôt great so the guy was fired and replaced.</p></div>		</li>
