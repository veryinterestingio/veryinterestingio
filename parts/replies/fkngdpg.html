<p>“Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.”</p>
<p>Patients kept together increase total viral load, leading to worse outcomes. Imagine if you could see the virus in the air, like smoke. This is an airborne virus spread by breathing.  </p>
<p>N95 reduces load by 95%.  In a place with 20x the load, they are unprotected. This is why the length of exposure time matters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I reread this paper. The prolonged shedding actually refers to how long one should isolate. The risk factors for poor outcome did NOT refer to viral load. Those with poor outcome were predicted best by old age, high SOFA score (a measure of sepsis in medicine), and d-dimer (proxy for inflammation). I’ve been seeing a lot of “viral load” posts but very little evidence that your initial inoculum is relevant. I have a higher suspicion that doctors are predisposed to getting the virus and make up by percentage of age group a higher number of deaths simply because they are over represented in the age category. I would want people to verify that physicians have the appropriate denominator before saying they “have a higher death rate”. Most likely they have a higher death number because the number infected is higher.</p></div>		</li>
