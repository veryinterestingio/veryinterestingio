			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for asking the obvious, it's the best place to start! I could write a book just for this one question (and I kind of did, see SuperBetter!) but for the quick and dirty must-know tips: For social resilience, playing the same game as loved ones who are sheltering far away is the best way to have something new to talk about every time you check in, since most of us are doing less, it really helps to have games to talk about - what level are you working on now? What challenge are you trying to get better at? We all need more concrete things to talk about together, besides the stressful COVID19 reality, so get everyone playing the same games, even if it's not at the same time. For personal well-being, games are one of the best techniques to shut down negative thoughts and anxiety, ruminating on things that are outside of our control. Research shows that you can train yourself to shut down unhelpful and unwanted negative thoughts faster by having games you can turn to quickly for at least 10 minutes of play. And I may answer this in more detail in another question, but gaming in general strengthens the neurocircuitry that allows our brain to believe that something good could happen in the future. When we are anxious or depressed, this circuitry powers down. We can stay resilient by making sure it remains fired up so we come out of this still confident in our ability to make a better future for ourselves, our family, our community. And that was just question number 1! For 2, age 5 for sure, Pokemon Go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm hoping you're still around a little, but wanted to follow up on this a little further.</p>
<p>Do you have recommendations on how to not let gaming spiral out of control as well? We all know plenty of people who would fall under addicted to gaming, and possibly even more so now that it is a huge escape from the current world state. </p>
<p>Or maybe this is the better way to state the question: How can we best train ourselves to keep gamkng as a quick 10 minute destressor when many games are actively designed to increase playtime by feeding a stimulation addiction?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gaming helped me through a really bad time but became more of a crutch than a fix bc I never bothered to learn coping skills as well. Became addicted for about 1.5 years. Eventually threw my playstation away bc I was disgusted with missing out on opportunities. </p>
<p>Moral of the story: gaming to cope isnt for everyone; just like a glass or wine or beer after a hard day's work isnt for everyone.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think I can help..</p>
<p>I tackled this in two main phases: </p>
<ul>
<li>by constantly recognizing that gaming is virtual and provides no IRL successes (okay, SOME successes but not all of us can compete at tournaments with $100k at stake)</li>
<li>and then using actual playtime as a reward instead of using breaks in between games as the reward.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first point is situational. You're going to hit that point where someone, something, somewhere is gonna be like &quot;uhh, reality check? video games aren't your damn life.&quot; For me, it was breaking up with my ex because I realized we had nothing in common and no real future except video games. We didn't even like playing the same games or had the same goals with video games in our lives.</p>
<p>The second point is the kicker and takes the longest, because a lot of us play games to &quot;get away&quot;. The breaks in between games to use the bathroom, have some lunch, do some laundry, etc., aren't always fun or mind-numbing to the extent that going <em>away</em> from playtime has more of a negative effect because we're returning to a negative part of our lives where we actually have to get up and...well, live. Which IS hard, harder than having to make a virtual luxury home and craft a perfect life within a span of a few hours and feel like we can accomplish something.</p>
<p>When we have the ability and confidence to recognize that we need to tackle IRL conflicts and negativity FIRST because it won't actually go away the more video games we play, we can slowly work towards using playtime as a reward. </p>
<p>Start slowly. Do one thing productive and reward with gaming. The next week, do two things, etc etc. After you can do a few things before you fire up the console, start messing around with limiting how much total playtime a day you get. When I started this years ago, I made my goal to sleep at midnight as long as I completed XYZ tasks during the day. Then I made it 11pm. Then 10pm. And I was able to sleep by 9pm so I can get up in the morning to get to work everyday without feeling like I regret everything cuz I played games all night. And as you begin rewarding yourself with playtime, you find that you can &quot;limit&quot; how much playtime you give yourself BECAUSE you have started treating the game as <em>the</em> reward and not the &quot;easy-access island getaway.&quot; </p>
<p>Use timers! Set limits! But don't beat yourself up if you don't live up to what you expected. Shaking off the feeling of not being attached to something when that's literally what it's designed to do is <em>difficult</em> and you are 100% not alone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would love an answer to this question. Gaming can be an &quot;escape&quot; from reality which can be quite helpful but also addictive. Saying this as someone that might have anxiety, depression, and a borderline gaming addiction... Lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes so much sense to me. When my back is against the wall (still need to get better at long-term planning to avoid these situations and finding that optimism in non-crisis times), I have a rugged optimism that I believe was developed by playing Baldur’s Gate 2 in my late teens.</p>
<p>Preparing for a battle meant casting piles of spells, even the low level ones that gave a very slight advantage. Having the die rolls visible showed me how even +1% in your favour could make the difference between defeat or victory. </p>
<p>I also learned to try my best, but if something kept failing I would try a new approach. When the answers weren’t obvious, experimentation was next. All that being said, sometimes, your party just wasn’t ready for the challenge, they needed some self-improvement before trying again.</p>
<p>The most satisfying battles were the ones where you weren’t sure if you could make it, and you just scraped by. I played the mode that if a character was “chunked” they couldn’t be resurrected. Losing Keldorn was particularly memorable.</p></div>		</li>
