<p>Demographics: Large boom of Gen X teenagers, low secondary education rates caused by high costs and short supply of college, poor inner-city primary education, white flight, etc.</p>

<p>I'd actually like to point out that q lot of the crime was from Boomers, and one theory deals with boomers aging out of their 'prime crime years' </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's true that the <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2012/11/2012-us-birth-rate-00-04.png" target="_blank">birth rate declines in those years</a>, but <a href="https://www.childtrends.org/indicators/number-of-children" target="_blank">the number of children also rose</a> and the proportion of children peaked in the 60s (I can't find a chart that shows the proportion of teenagers, but it follows that teenagers would peak in the 70s or 80s). </p>
<p>Remember, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate" target="_blank">birth rate</a> is not simply the number of children born, it's the number of children divided by number of women or total population. As baby boomer women lived longer through the 70s and 80s, the denominator increases, lowering the the rate despite there being more kids. <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_religions_and_babies?awesm=on.ted.com_MacKay&amp;utm_campaign=tedspread&amp;utm_content=awesm-publisher&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=tedcomshare" target="_blank">Hans Rosling called this &quot;the great fill-up&quot;</a> (skip to ~10 minutes).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. &quot;Why was crime so bad in the 70s and 80s&quot;?</p>
<p>Because of people who were 10 years old back then.</p></div>		</li>
