			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed!  Although Destin's one shows how bad we are without pinnae.  One super-cool thing is that we can relearn these cues.  If you give someone fake ears to wear for 2 weeks, they end up with pretty much normal localisation.  Take the Spock ears off and you're again normal with your own ears.  Put them back on a few weeks later and you'll still remember those cues! :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And I bet the reason dogs are so bad at vertical sound and we are so good is because of evolution.  Dogs in the wild live on the ground, they only deal in front, back, left and right, where we, as tree climbers would need to know all directions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it's a relatively modern evolutionary change relative to our global population. Just in the past couple of hundred years, to be exact. Humans used to have mostly flat pinnae, and the change comes from the Australian aboriginal population which was then mixed into the gene pool once Australia was colonised. Most of the world, like dogs, only had to worry about front/back/left/right, but the indigenous populations of Australia had to be wary of drop-bear attacks. They evolved advanced hearing in order to more accurately hear the rustling above them as a sort of early warning system.</p>
<p>Here's a good video on the topic: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-51AfyMqnpI" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-51AfyMqnpI</a></a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm super confused because I had a classroom demo where I'd blindfold a participant and have people around them clap up high or down low.</p>
<p>People could easily resolve left, right, forward, back, but they had a hard time resolving up and down. Like just a little better than guessing.</p>
<p>The point of this was to show why Owls have one ear higher than the other, to better pinpoint the height of their prey, but now I'm learning that the pinnae can help you with up/down?</p>
<p>Does anybody know this demo/know what's going on?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This comes from point four in the list above - because our ears are a fairly weird shape, they subtly alter the sound reaching the ear from different directions. </p>
<p>This is usually pretty good at determining front/rear, due to the fact the dish shape of the ear is biased to the front (where we typically focus our attention the most), but less effective up/down where the difference is not so drastic.</p>
<p>In normal life this is where we depend on other cues - when you hear a noise to the rear, for example few people people will be trying to spot its directing accurately, instead either relying on not worrying (if you hear someone behind you where you are expecting a friend to be, you have no real requirement to pinpoint their location any more accurately than 'entering the room behind you'. The times you do need to nail their location, you well probably turn and face them, bringing to bear the more accurate front zone of your ears, but also things like your sight.</p>
<p>Interestingly, when you see a dog looking slightly confused and tilting is head back and forth, the issue is that they are gearing a sound that confuses then and they cannot pinpoint - by tilting their heads they are changing the position of their ears relative to each other and allowing them to figure out the position twice and compare the two.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's partly because the sound of a clap is so short that your brain can't build up a decent guess.  I could be wrong, but I suspect the fact that they were as successful as they were for front/back might actually have been echoes in the classroom, rather than the direct sound.  Try it outside next time and see how they get on when there aren't as many things for the sounds to reflect off of.  There's a famous paper where they measured sound localisation ability when <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/ShmJf5bEzXPy9v9t6" target="_blank">on the roof of the lab</a> to avoid reflections (before good anechoic chambers were a thing).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is perfectly written out, thank you for your effort and time. I’m an audio engineer and that is exactly how I learned it in school. To add a few points; binaural, 3D, or 8D audio is created either using a special binaural microphone or using software to replicate it in post. The binaural microphones are neat, some are shaped like a human head with actual silicone ears to mimic the pinnae and with microphones in the ears. ITDs essentially cause phase cancellation in the audio waves by time delays of the reflections off the pinnae. Our brain and body are amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m a sound engineer, not a hearing scientist but these principles are what use every day. You can trick human hearing very easily if you know what to do, creating the illusion of space, and depth with only a right and a left. </p>
<p>Our ears are great at decoding the information, and just as you said, tricks can easily be played</p>
<p>It’s almost always about reverb, delay and volume manipulation, and it’s remarkably easy, and satisfying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the early 80's I had a Hi-fi phase, and experimented with soundsources (from white noise to pure and mixed sinus waves) turning and moving around me.<br />
I found that the slight (but normal) asymmetries of my head and ears caused major distortion of the percieved audio spectrum - and that placing the speakers just right was worth more than a much higher grade of audio equipment...<br />
Nearby was a concert hall, and at the time the Danish Radio often made high quality recordings there.<br />
Some of my most illuminating hi-fi experiences have been from going to concerts, and later in the evening listening to the recording from DR P2.<br />
Once, at a concert for string quartet, I had my usual seat just under the 2 main microphones (some B&amp;K measure kit in x/y setup) some barbarians in the back of the hall opened a package of sweets during a silent passage.<br />
During the concert, the sound was irritating, but only just noticeable (the 'whoosh' from a hundred middle fingers being raised was subjectively louder...)<br />
But a few hours later, when I heard the recording in the radio, the crinkling noise overpowered the music.<br />
Later, the radio changed their microphone setup to a german artificial head, but ultimately they ended up using 2 mics a bit longer back in the hall, and backing them up with a series of mics along the stage edge + individual instrument mics.<br />
With some post-processing, that solved the audience-noise problem - but it ruined the finer details of instrument placement; before, it was obvious how each instrument was turned. After, it sounded like all instruments faced the audience...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple science fields regarding this. Where I'm from, hearing scientist would be a person in the medical or biological field. Someone studying sounds specifically in relationship with hearing as a sense. </p>
<p>Sound engineer is either the person you meet at a concert behind the mixing console (or recording studio) or academically, a person who is studying low frequency oscillations/oscillators from the physics perspective. </p>
<p>A third unmentioned field might be signal processing, which ventures outside hearing and sound and deals pretty much with any signal, be it sound, video or any other, but usually from a more mathematical standpoint.</p></div>		</li>
