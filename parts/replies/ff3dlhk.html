			<div class="markdown"><p>Very nice analogy. So water slows evaporation, helps penetrate to kill bacteria.<br />
Less water --&gt; evaporate fast, less agent to help with penetration to kill bacteria. Glad I asked this on ELI. Thanks !</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s less about evaporation (the alcohol will still evaporate from a solution) and more about how it interacts with what you’re putting it on.  </p>
<p>90% will instantly kill the outer bacteria (like forming a crust in a hot pan) and stop the rest of the alcohol from reaching the bacteria inside. Water is great at penetrating and dissolving bonds, so it gets between all of the bacteria and into the center, taking some of the alcohol with it. This then kills more of the bacteria.</p>
<p>You can still kill all the bacteria with 90%, but it takes physical scrubbing to break up the outer dead shell of bacteria so that the ones further in can be denatured/killed</p></div>		</li>
