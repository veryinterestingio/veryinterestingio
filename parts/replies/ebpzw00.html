			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not true. Muscular tissue is not the same as connective tissue( which makes tendons) and bone is a type of connective tissue, but so is blood, cartilage and a few others,so they are not the same thing, as you said. Tendons and ligaments are the both connective tissue, just in one case they connect muscle to bone, in the other they connect bone to bone.
Anatomically - every muscle fiber is surrounded by, as far as I remember, dense irregular connective tissue, and so are the fascicles and the belly and all these connective tissues at the end of the muscle basically join together and attach to the bone. But that doesn't make them the same tissue, nor gives them the same structure and function. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might have misread what I had said. They are all made of the same pieces of ground substance. The the forces that act upon them is what helps unravel that part of the gene sequence so that it is expressed as either bone, ligament tendon etc. I said there is no distinct break between any of those structures rather it seamlessly blends from piece to piece where there is a gradual change from one to the next. Look at Dr Andreo Spina and his “bio flow” lecture. Might be able to find pieces of it on YouTube.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well ... I mean in all honesty the whole body is made of the same ground substance, we are all a single cell that starts splitting and diversifying, there are only 2 types of tissues in the embrio that everything is made of later on, so . But I also only have basic college level knowledge, I'm yet to get into more specialized classes :)</p></div>		</li>
