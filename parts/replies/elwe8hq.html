			<div class="markdown"><p>Some websites use asshole design. I’ve encountered many since the new GDPR regulations that force you to manually deselect each of the advertising partners to continue to the site, but they make you do that every time you visit.</p>
<p>Obviously hoping one time you’ll get lazy and just click accept.</p></div>		</li>

<p>makes sense if you did not accept the first time, then they do not drop any cookies for legal reasons, so the next time you visit, they will still not have a clue that you have been there before until you accept and allow them to use cookies.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But unless someone gets fined for it, nobody cares.</p>
<p>I'd argue that GDPR has actually made the web worst to use.</p></div>		</li>
