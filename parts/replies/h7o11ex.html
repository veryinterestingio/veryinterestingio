			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this.<br />
That the simulation game doesn't feel like a jrpg orr tactics game comes from the fact that the &quot;turns&quot;, usually called ticks, are calculated several times each second. </p>
<p>This is often, but not always, tied to your framerate. So one tick usually lasts something between 1/60th and 1/30th of a second.</p>
<p>A tick basically means a full pass through all the things that make up the game logic to calculate how the game has changed from the last tick, e.g. if one of your players has moved a few cm, if the position of the ball has changed, if the announcer should comment on something etc...</p>
<p>When the tick is completely calculated, then your computer looks at the current state of the game and creates a new picture, or frame, that represents the new state of the game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An excellent point! For a great example of this in action we can look at Diablo, which was initially designed to be a turn-based RPG. They got a call from the publishers to make it real-time and they did so by changing turns from lasting until the player made a decision to about 20 times a second.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Dear god no. Competently developed games have decoupled logic from frame rate for decades now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends how you see it. </p>
<p>The game tick no longer depends on the speed of your computer and your speed in which you can put out new frames, but most games put out one frame per one game tick.</p>
<p>Also many games wait with their calculation of the game tick until the frame for the last game tick has been rendered, skipping game ticks and slowing the game down if necessary.</p>
<p>The most notable exception to this rule are client &lt;-&gt; server based multiplayer games where the game logic runs on the server and the client handles only input and output.  </p>
<p>Peer to peer based multiplayer games though usually wait for the slowest player to finish up their calculations if they are more than a few ticks behind.</p>
<p>Notable examples of this which I have played over the last years are Factorio and Anno 1800 where one slow client can make the game unplayable for everyone else.</p></div>		</li>

Are you saying Fromsoft is not a &quot;competent developer &quot; ?</p></div>		</li>
