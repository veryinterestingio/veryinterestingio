			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick addition:</p>
<p>The AM in AMOLED stands for Active Matrix, the transistor and capacitor couple u/Jnsjknn mentions. A screen consists of rows and colums and they are connected in series. To target a certain pixel voltage is applied to the row and collumn that intersect this pixel.</p>
<p>Without the transistor and capacitor the pixels around the target pixel can partially switch on, as the voltage is &quot;leaking&quot; through them. The transistor keeps these untargeted pixels from turning on when they are not meant to turn on and makes it possible to achieve much faster switching times. The capacitor is there to keep the pixel turned on between refresh cycles, on passive matrix, it falls off between refreshes.</p>
<p>Most displays used today are active matrix, such as LCD, as passive is now only used in really cheap screens that don't rely on fast refresh (LCD segment displays, clocks etc ).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a way, yes. There are no gaps in between the cover glass and the screen behind it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>When you have 2 glass planes they both reflect a part of the light. If there is a small gap in between them you get more reflections as light that bounces off the first one bounces again off the second one.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's one of the reasons TV makers stopped putting glass in front of the LCD panel to make the TV feel more &quot;premium&quot;. Sony at one point went so far as to fill in the gap between glass and LCD panel with a clear gel.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>When you see a phone with a &quot;traditional&quot; screen and you look closely from the side, you can see the digitizer grid. Some phones have the actual screen slightly recessed, in some it's just a layer backed on top of the screen. The additional layer shouldn't impact reflection much, but the air gap will.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Basically, if a screen (not necessarily Super AMOLED), is manufactured with no gap between the glass and the screen, reflections will be minimized. By how much effectively, hard to tell. I'm fairly sure the 80% is overstated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should look into the technical specifications. They usually say AMOLED if it's an AMOLED display. The name of a product or its description may only say OLED since it's simpler and AMOLEDs are still also OLEDs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In laymen's terms, organic means it's made from chemicals/materials containing carbon. (It gets its own category because carbon creates chains much more easily than most other elements, which means it's the base for many complex molecules.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost. For example carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are not organic.<br />
The differentiation between organic and inorganic is just a historical one anyway. Everything that could only be produced by living organisms was considered organic. CO and CO2 are also created by non-living things like volcanoes so they were considered inorganic.</p></div>		</li>
