			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s called an anechoic chamber. I was lucky enough to spend 50 seconds in one in UNI studying engineering. Big foam cones all over the walls and a dampened floor to remove vibrations. </p>
<p>Pitch dark. Well ventilated. But after about 15 seconds you become aware of your heartbeat, then the noise inside your ears. This was the blood pumping around. It grew and grew till my head was bursting with the noise my blood pumping was making. Started to feel dizzy and said the safe word to get out. </p>
<p>This was 20 years ago and it’s still a vivid memory. </p>
<p>I can confirm the body does make sounds when doing it’s thing. We just filter out this most of the time. </p>
<p>(Safe Word: “Open the f’in door mate”.</p></div>		</li>
