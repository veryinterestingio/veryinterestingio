			<div class="markdown"><p>TV commercials have to fit within audio specs of the CALM Act which limits dbs to prevent a jump in loudness at commercial breaks. The networks won’t let ads pass QC if they’re out of range. But, the regulations don’t apply to digital media (e.g. Hulu, YouTube) so it’s a bit of the Wild West out there still. However some services are requiring that audio levels now meet the same broadcast standards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to regulate. We experience sound over time and not really instantly. So there could be a max volume allowed but normal dialog won't spend all it's time at that volume. Commercials can use something called audio compression to essentially force everything to nearly the same volume. This makes them appear louder to us than the TV show or.movie all while technically not exceeding the max volume they are allowed to be.</p></div>		</li>

There are also AES/EBU standard algorithms for automatically managing this.  </p>
