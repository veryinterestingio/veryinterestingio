			<div class="markdown"><p>I never really cared for Bach. To me listening to Bach is like looking at a painting that I think is boring. Then someone comes up and is like &quot;But don't you know the painter was blindfolded for this piece? Don't you know if you mix the colors on the opposite sides of the painting it's always purple? Don't you know if you flip the painting upside down it's the same painting? Don't you enjoy the painting now?&quot; And no. Not really. I still don't like the painting. Which means I &quot;don't get it&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think Bach's music, while certainly not a &quot;slapfest&quot; anymore, can really only be appreciated within it's place in the musical canon</p>
<p>Yeah, Bach numerology is a complex and while fascinating probably coincidental study, but it's important to realize that the entire field of music theory was shaped around his writings. Like imagine if we based English Grammar off of Mark Twain's writing. There were other systems of music theory before him (Pallestrina slaps if you haven't heard him), but it's not the most risky thing to say that all classical music after Bach is derivative of Bach.</p>
<p>Big deal right? It still sounds busy. I would recommend listening to some pre-Bach music, and then stepping back into Bach's music. Sure if you were to start from Medieval chant and slowly work your way up, every step up would feel like a breath of fresh air (Plainchant is another world of music imo), but Bach is the first thing that sounds comparable to real, modern, music. Within its historical context, Bach is a breath of fresh air.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's an unsurprising hot take by someone who sat through a semester of Josquin, Leonin, and Hildegard to finally reach the end where he wept at the sound of Bach.</p>
<p>Yeah altogether he's kinda boring. Even his contemporaries thought he was old fashioned, particularly scathing commentary especially coming from his son, CPE Bach.</p>
<p>TL;DR from a historical context Bach is pretty darn good actually. Haydn did flex on him though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, Bach was a slap for me when I was a child, but except for that I agree with all you're saying (which is a relief, I was afraid to be mistaken :D).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, I understand, I feel the same for some painting and to some extend for John Cage (Yeah, you put some stuff in your piano, we know. Still, ugly noise!!).</p>
<p>But a few things do it for me in regard to Bach : </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I love the organ. It's a powerful, magical instrument. I do prefer Part over Bach, but still, Bach made me fall in love with this instrument. Imagine being a person at that time, going into a church, and suddenly you hear this powerful sounds coming up, rising like if it was god talking himself. You feel the bass vibrating. All this while you are in a church, with the statue of a man crucufied in front of you, maybe some memento moris. How impressive it must have been. At least it was impressive for 10 years old me!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beethoven and Mozart were tradition breakers, in a way (a very arguable one, I admit, he was quite creative too), Bach was a tradition setter. So we might like him or not, but its influence on the music made after him is really big. He's important not just because its music is good or not, but also because of his influence on western music.</p>
</li>
<li>He was really brilliant. Its works are structured, well-thought, full of contrasts and majestic. Again, maybe you don't like it, but it's also an inspiration and most piano/organ student have to play quite a lot of his composition and this way of composing is usually studied a lot. A bit like studying perspective ot the rule of thirds in graphical arts. You don't have to respect them, but you have to understand them. Still its influence is big!</li>
</ul>
<p>I can forgot a lot and I probably made a few mistakes, I'm not a professional, just passionate about organ playing, but I understand how you could not like it. Still it's easy to understand I think why he is so highly regarded! I think Douglas Adams talk about him in one of Dirk Gently's book, but I'm not going to spoil you ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People really like to prop up foundational figures in their field, and Bach did a lot for all of Western music. Bebop basically owes its life to Bach (Barry Harris will tell you himself, jazz is a natural extension of what dudes like Bach, Chopin, Debussy and so on were doing)</p></div>		</li>
