			<div class="markdown"><p>I was skeptical, but if I did the math right here then that's totally right.</p>
<p>0.5^33 (divide by half 33 times) * 7,800,000,000 (rough population of the earth) = 0.91 (number of people left after the 33rd question</p>
<p>Damn, that's wild.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exponential functions are hard to grasp. If the Earth had 16 billion people instead of 8 billion, you would just need 34 questions.</p>
<p>If you don’t know it yet, rice on a chessboard story illuminates the power of exponential functions: <a href="https://owlcation.com/stem/Rice-on-a-Chessboard-Exponential-numbers" target="_blank">https://owlcation.com/stem/Rice-on-a-Chessboard-Exponential-numbers</a></p>
<p>Start with 1 grain of rice on square one of a chess board, then double the amount of grains for each square. The last square gets 2^63 grains of rice - which is 1000x the annual <em>world production</em> of rice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Easiest would probably be region. IIRC Asians is around 60% of the population, not 50/50 but close. Other than that it'll probably need to be crafted specifically with compound statements for each path.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With Akinator it can drastically reduce the remaining answers by asking questions which reduce by way more than a half. &quot;Is this person famous?&quot; can get rid of most of the other 7.8 billion if they are famous (they usually are, most people know it's not going to guess their mate Tim so they give it a chance and pick increasingly obscure celebrities each successive round). </p>
<p>From then on it can afford to ask questions that won't necessarily halve the answers. There are lots of kinds of famous, but it might go for TV personality as a confident guess for example.</p>
<p>Obviously it can't guess your mate Tim if it doesn't have any data on him, but if he's been a bit part in some small production you might be surprised. If he's on Wikipedia or IMDB or in a band that's  had quite a bit of local radio play, then it's more than possible it can guess him, and freak Tim the fuck out if he's in the same room as you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe a synonym although I only ever heard the term bisection used in contexts where you don't want to split the graph in two, e.g. an important measure in networking is how many cuts it takes to end up with two separate networks.</p></div>		</li>
