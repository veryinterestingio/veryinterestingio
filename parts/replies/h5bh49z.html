			<div class="markdown"><p>Given that most organ recipients are taking immune suppressing drugs for life <strong>yes</strong>.</p>
<p>Organs donated by a German woman (who unknowingly had cancer) gave all 4 recipients cancer within a few years. Three of them eventually died. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29633548/" target="_blank">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29633548/</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool pubmed article. It kind of indirectly illustrates how nivo and ipi work to release the immune break, but with immunosuppressant termination instead of a nivo treatment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my training I was told every day there are about 6 potentially lethal DNA mutations (like a cancerous mutation) in your body, but the immune system is so effective that you clear them out and never even know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's more accurate to say that there are cellular mechanisms which when broken by mutation/damage become cancerous. Depending on the type of cancer it could be as few as one mechanism, or as many as 10 broken systems in parallel, even within the same tumor you get heterogeneous cell lines with different characteristics as error checking systems fail and new errors occur.</p>
<p>And yes you get cancer all the time, your body is just equipped to error check your cells and nip it in the bud. But as you get older those error checking systems don't work as well, or they get overwhelmed by stuff like smoking or repeated sun damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard cancers being considered as an immunological problem, as the reason they are allowed to develop is due to a malfunctioning immune system. I'm sure you're aware of this, but it's an interesting shift in perspective, that the actual mutations aren't really the issue, it's the body's ability to detect and nip them in the bud.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To put it in context as to how effective our DNA repair mechanisms &amp; immune system are at preventing cancer, there’s about 300 quintillion base pair replication events each day. </p>
<p>Given the sheer absurdity of that number, it’s remarkable that such a low % of the population progress to actually having cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a biology teacher tell me similar, and also that if you had, for instance, AIDS but were able to shield yourself from every other illness, eventually cancer would get you. It's just a matter of numbers; with enough cell division it's a statistical guarantee, and your immune system takes care of a lot of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, it is also a matter of our particular biology, medication and so on, there are a lot of large animals and long lived-animals with virtually no cancer, the probably per cell division is very different between animals.</p></div>		</li>
