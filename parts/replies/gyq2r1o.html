<p>The short of it is: we don't know. </p>

<p>While we don't know 100% for sure, we're now pretty confident that eradicating the small minority of mosquito species that bite humans would have no significant impact, as the myriad of other mosquitoes species would expand into their ecological niche, particularly in the food chain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah, for sure. I just know that even the smallest bit of uncertainty is a problem when you are talking about such a mass ecological change. I'm sure itll happen in our lifetimes though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The second, expanded round of testing, trials or whatever you want to call it, is happening now, in the wild, in Florida.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes and no.<br />
Mosquitos that bite humans tend to be food for spiders too, if we irradicate just 1 species , would be millions and millions of mosquitos, that would impact smaller spiders. Spiders being impacted and decrease population would impact the animals that feed on them, and so on..  </p>
<p>Every single specie that gets irradicated / extint (mostly, smaller ones) can / might trigger a snowball effect on the ecosystem.<br />
For example, Giraffes getting extinct would cause some changes, but if it was gazelle (the ones lions feed on too) it would create a bigger change</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are there any spiders that will eat the biting <del>spiders</del> mosquitos, but won't eat the other mosquitos that fill in the small hole?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Recall that vector borne diseases also affect other animals.  So now , you eradicate the ones bothersome to humans and you have an eplosure of the ones that bite birds.  And the stuff that preys on rodents get sick and you have an explosion of rodents.  this is obviously just an example.</p>
<p>So not only can we not be 100% sure that eradicating a species would have no effect, you are not thinking this through at all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Of course not. It's not <em>my</em> position, but the position of the most of the applicable scientific community.</p>
<p>Somehow, I suspect they thought of this.</p>
<p>In any case, part if the reasoning as to why it wouldn't have a significant impact is that the ecological hole that would be so small, even if a single other species filled it, it would be too small of an increase to be an explosion</p></div>		</li>

The issue is that it's non-obvious what problems might arise - that means ANY problem would be an unexpected one and by the time we notice it, there could be a large chain of interactions where simply reintroducing them would not solve the issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If mosquitos never existed and someone developed them, it’d be an act of genocide by any measure.  They’re not dependent on a single agent, they’re just a permeating vector that spreads multiple types of contagions.</p>
<p>It’d take almost nothing to reintroduce mosquitos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean you just said we don't know what would happen than said wipe them out. Mmm not a good idea. They are everywhere and although small are a big part of the ecology of our planet. One study on bats eating mosquitoes is not even close to knowing what would happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue is that we're weighing a guaranteed enormous benefit against an unknown risk.  It's not about itchy bug bites; malaria and other vector-borne disease kill millions of people and are a significant contributor to continuing poverty in third-world countries.  People's lives are at stake.  We are playing with fire here, but that doesn't mean we have to abandon the fire and go back into our caves.  We just need to be careful, learn as much as we can and see if the risk is worth it.  There is a small chance we will screw something up and harm millions of people, but there is a much larger chance that we won't and we'll save millions of people.  If peoples' lives are on the line on both sides, then the risk might be worth taking.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I was just being funny because, honestly, who doesn't hate mosquitos. I think we should take careful steps with this.</p></div>		</li>
