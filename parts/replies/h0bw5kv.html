			<div class="markdown"><p>There's more to it than &quot;hiding assets&quot; as a friend of mine found out. (Many years ago, so I don't know if tax laws have changed.)  His grandmother divided her cash up for her grandkids and handed it out while she was alive, granting them gifts in excess of $200K each.  She died within two years and it was decided that the 'gifts' were considered part of her estate for TAX purposes because she had done this within 2 years of dying. It was called something like &quot;In anticipation of death&quot; and is or was part of the tax code.  Each of the grandkids had to fork over a major portion of that cash gift to pay their deceased grandmother's taxes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea im just curious if something like this was even possible, i figured with actual money it would be hard to hide, but something tangible given as a gift might be easier to get away with without repercussions to the family</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Gifts in contemplation of death are often included in the estate and not considered gifts as the giftor intended (and therefore taxed as part of the decedent's estate). This is to prevent abuse of the estate tax by gifting all of your assets before you die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two things.  First, the creditors aren't stupid, they run credit checks and if they see a clear pattern like this, they'll stop giving you credit pretty quick.  </p>
<p>Also, they can't come after your family, but they can come after your estate, and they get priority over your heirs.  So your family ends up with some krugerrands, but the credit card companies take your house, your car, etc.  So long as they're careful about how much they loan you (see above), they won't lose much on the deal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And if you're careful in structuring your assets, you can keep these things out of your estate.  i.e. your house - if it's in a joint tenancy/entirety with your spouse, the ownership transfers to the survivor without passing through the estate, protecting it.  Similarly with trusts - if you transfer assets to a trust, that can avoid creditors.  Also gifts with retention of life estates or similar arrangements.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Legally, however it is standard practice to try and trick others into paying the debt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s what I thought.  </p>
<p>First, the estate pays any outstanding debts.  Second, remaining debts go to any living applicable co-signers (if there are any).  Finally, creditors have to eat the remaining debt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a former debt collector who's seen way too many people fucked over: NEVER cosign. Just do NOT. You may be trying to help your brother/mother/nephew/grandchild, but you're the one suffering when they default. In fact many &quot;co-signors&quot; seem to have been misled and signed as the primary debtor somehow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My old boss and his 2 siblings all got their new-build mortgages cosigned by their father at 20 years of age. But that's because Daddy is a multi-millionaire and the richest man in town.</p>
<p>So cosigning is fine for some people, so long as the amount of debt is inconsequential.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certain things, like life insurance, bypass the estate and go strait to the beneficiary.  However, if the beneficiary is also decreased then it goes back to the estate.</p>
<p>It is super important that you accurately list your beneficiaries anywhere you can, and that you keep them current.</p></div>		</li>
