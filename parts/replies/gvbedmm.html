<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491740/" target="_blank">basic emotion</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4419844/" target="_blank">associative learning</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3169673/" target="_blank">visual learning</a>, <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2014-05-22-fruit-flies-think-they-act" target="_blank">decision making</a>.</p>
<p>Drosophila (a fly) has been a model organism for a century and in the last 20 years has revolutionized our understanding of insect cognition, and it's time people stopped parroting the same assumptions that have been by in large dropped by entomologists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the links!  I've always thought bugs had complex memories just by observing them.</p>
<p>It blew me away when I realized the extent of certain spider's memory.  The desert spider that can take a &quot;screenshot&quot; of the horizon to use the stars as a GPS is WILD.</p>
<p>In my mind it gives credence to the DNA memory theory.  These organisms have the simplest processors, yet they can remember vast quantities of information in seconds.  Where are they storing this information if not DNA?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That isn't how DNA works.  Don't be surprised that insects can be quite intelligent - after all, we have some pretty impressive computers that aren't much bigger, and brains are much better at learning than microchips.</p>
<p>But there <em>are</em> some cases (such as the surprisingly intelligent Portia family of jumping spiders) that have scientists scratching their heads, as they are capable of much more complex planning than was believed to be possible with such a tiny brain.</p>
<p>One theory is that they are able to take a problem apart, solve each bit of it independently while storing the rest in a &quot;compressed&quot; format, and then link the solutions for each step together to come up with a complete plan.  This makes them think <em>slowly</em> compared to a larger animal, but the <em>complexity</em> of the problems they can solve is much higher than would otherwise be possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You gotta try playing memory against a five year old toddler. They sometimes don't even pay muhh attention to the game, still they memorize every card so easily. I like to think it is simply because their brain isn't cluttered with a life full of memories so there's more storage and a shorter search span for information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I figure they think you're playing with them, if you actually flick them off successfully, they'll get the message</p>
<p>(The trick, move slowly with finger locked in the flicking position, the fly won't react to slow movement and can't move fast enough to avoid a flick at close range. When I was a teenager I could actually grab them in mid air but my reflexes aren't anywhere good enough anymore)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually easy to learn to catch a fly! When they take off from a surface, they will move backwards and then up as they take off. If you put your hand behind them and try to scoop them up in a swift motion by swiping your hand at them from behind, they'll essentially &quot;jump&quot; backwards into your palm if you're quick enough!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I lived in Spain for a while, near a pig farm. These assholes didn’t have AC (understandable, that shit is expensive) and also somehow did not have screens in their windows, and didn’t have fly paper. BUT they did teach me how to kill flies by swiping at them from behind. Very effective. But not as effective as screens or fly paper Roberto!</p></div>		</li>
