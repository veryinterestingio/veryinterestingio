			<div class="markdown"><p>On one hand, yes, but on the other hand, it's not like they didn't have units for length, weight, volume, etc. Those just didn't make it because they weren't as useful. </p>
<p>The fact is that while time was formalized by them, the concept of &quot;a set number of minutes&quot; was pretty useless for the vast majority of people for the vast majority of history. Anybody besides the most powerful, eccentric, or academically/nautically inclined having access to timekeeping prior to the past couple centuries is pretty rare. </p>
<p>Hell, through the better part (probably the majority) of the 20th century, your average person didn't know what time it was at any given time. </p>
<p>But those other units? Normal people used those constantly, and adapted them to their situations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>12 is divisible by 2 3 4 and 6 so you can easily figure out half, third, quarter and sixth of something.  When everything is in your head fractions are natural. Imagine a merchant selling one large unit of grain for 12 coins.  It is an easy even price for all those divisions. Also you can buy 3 units of grain to divide easily in those ways and split the cost etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd imagine if you'd spent your whole life getting told how to do math in a base 12 system, you'd have a pretty good handle on it. I'd imagine this little fact comes from people who know both pretty well.</p>
<p>As to what the actual reason could be? Probably that 12 is divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 6. 10 is only divisible by 2 and 5. That would probably make certain math easier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Decimal lets you divide by 2 or 5 using a multiply-and-shift.  Dozenal lets you divide by 2, 3, 4, or 6 using a multiply-and-shift.</p>
<p>Since 2, 3, and 4 are the most common fractions, everyday math tends to be easier.</p>
<p>For example, instead of [0% 33.3% 66.6% 100%], we'd have [0% 40% 80% 100%], though we'd probably call it &quot;per-gross&quot; instead of &quot;per-cent&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not your head, your hand. Look at your four fingers (thumb is used to do the counting). Each finger has 3 parts (between the knuckles). You use one hand to count up to 12 and the other to count sets of 12, allowing you to count up to 144.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The number 144 is called &quot;gross&quot; because it the highest number you can count to using both your hands.  </p>
<p>It's also why we call 12 of something a &quot;dozen&quot;</p>
<p>Many imperial measurement units have a history based on this method of finger counting. </p>
<p>Another way of thinking is to imagine being a shepherd 1,000 years ago. There were no fancy electronic calculators, no clicky counter things... If our shepherd had a large flick then they needed a method of counting well in excess of 10.</p></div>		</li>
