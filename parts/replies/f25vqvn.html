			<div class="markdown"><p>So does the electricity behave like the dominoes through the logic gates? For example if you only knock down one of the starting dominoes in an AND setup, the falling dominoes blocks the other dominoes. </p>
<p>So does the same happen with electricity? i.e. if the electrons / electricity would only enter one gate of an AND setup, do the electrons or electricity split up and one of them reaches the nearest choke point before the other in order to block passage to the output?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, there is always a source and a gate control. The electrons flowing out are from the source. A transistor in itself is an and gate. It has two &quot;lines&quot; in and one &quot;line&quot; out. One entry is connected to the exit where electricity will flow through (line a riverbed) . The other controls a gate in the middle that blocks the flow if it is powered (like a flood gate). So if input 1 AND input 2 have electrons flowing in, there are electrons flowing out the other end from the source. If only one has electrons flowing in, there is nothing coming out, as there are either no electrons coming in from the source or the gate is blocking them from flowing through. But whatever is coming out on the output end is coming from the source input and not the &quot;gate&quot; input.</p>
<p>The gates he shows are more on a logical side than on a technical side (especially when you get to XOR, which will be put together from many transistors and he displays it as one gate).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but when you type Matt Parker into Youtube and don't hit enter it suggests things like &quot;Matt Parker Trey Stone acid&quot;. So I guess enough people made the mistake that I felt I should mention it.</p>
<p>If you hit enter after typing Matt Parker it does find the proper maths guy.</p></div>		</li>
