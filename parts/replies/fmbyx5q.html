			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, thanks for this explanation of what happens, but it doesn't tell us WHY. So I also tried searching... and it seems we don't really know why, but I did find some more info:</p>
<p>We call it &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_hypnotism" target="_blank">chicken hypnosis</a>&quot; but it's not the same as hypnosis for humans, it's more an extreme defence reaction to fear, probably closer to &quot;playing dead&quot;.  So we can easily assume that the chickens do not enjoy it.</p>
<p>And it's also <a href="http://www.hoaxorfact.com/science/chicken-hypnosis-by-a-simple-straight-line-facts.html" target="_blank">not that easy</a> to do, as it's a defence mechanism, you can get attacked if badly done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh that’s a good one. I remembered it because the word cations contain the “t” which resembles +, while anions contain the “n” for negative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, from what I've read about that stuff, rather than fear-potentiated, it is closer to a brain function limitation. I may be wrong though. Chicken brain is very basic and limited. The same happens when you turn the chicken upside-down and keep it still - it just goes catatonic, not for the fear for its life but rather because its brain is not designed to work in this position, it just 'hangs up'. With the line I would suppose the brain is trying to decide which eye to use to look at the line or rather the blind spot where it starts, because if you draw the same line to the right or to the left you will get no such response at all.</p>
<p>The fear response is a bit different - you can see it in some species of goats, for example - they go stiff if spooked, to the degree that they keep their posture for a bit, even when fallen to the ground. Compared to that, 'catalepsy' in chickens is much softer and can be broken with a slight movement or a loud sound.</p></div>		</li>
