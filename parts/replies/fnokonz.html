			<div class="markdown"><p>A phase 3 clinical trial is being initiated this year (refer to clinicaltrials.gov, study # NCT04200313) to test the iLet bionic pancreas in adults and children with type 1 diabetes (6 years or older).  Screening of subjects for enrollment into this trial began last month at 16 clinical sites across the US. The study is expected to take about 9 months to complete (of course, this timeline could be impacted by COVID or other factors).  Results from this clinical trial will support our application to the FDA for regulatory clearance of the insulin-only configuration of the device in that population. Once the FDA application is filed, FDA review of 510(k) market applications typically take up to 6 months.</p></div>		</li>
