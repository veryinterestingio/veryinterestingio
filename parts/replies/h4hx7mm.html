			<div class="markdown"><p>Tangential question: how do we know how well vaccines work against asymptomatic infection of variants, considering the general advice seems to be &quot;you don't need to get tested if you're vaccinated unless you're symptomatic&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the phase 3 study of 40k that was used to approve the vaccine tested those people regularly with RT-PCR, for like 3 months. Now in all of this it was very few that even got infected since the pandemic was going into summer.</p>
<p>The way you should think about it is SARS2 multiplies exponentially in your body as more and more cells burst of so much virus. The vaccine trains your body to put mittens on the spikes of the virus so it can't go into cells, then the garbage men cine and clean them up.</p>
<p>Normally the imune system has 3 mechanisms to fight viruses, antibodies, celular immunity and natural immunity. The asymptomatic cases all 3 work well, the vaccine only trains antibody production and at that specialized over a small part of the spike unlike traditional vaccines who have the whole virus but disabled.</p>
<p>But at least you get a lot of antibodies and they do last at least 4 months.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand this regarding the original virus/D614G that we had circulating last summer. But I believe the more pertinent question is:</p>
<p>How do we know that there isnâ€™t more asymptomatic or lightly symptomatic spread with the delta variant?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do we know vaccinated people are not just less PCR-detectable? To be PCR detectable people have to have virus in large numbers in their mouths basically and doesn't that depend on a lot of things anyway?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certain countries are doing a lot more broad scale testing, and even in countries like the US which is not recommending general testing without symptoms, there are subgroups like medical workers who are regularly tested regardless of symptoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Medical worker in CA. Neither of the hospitals I work at would regularly test us. That means risk that they have staffing shortages and reduce their bottom line.</p>
<p>Not saying this is universal, but most medical staff I know in and out of state are not (and have never been) regularly tested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't speak to the volume involved, but I'm both vaccinated and tested weekly through work as is the entire workforce I work with. No clue if the data would ever be made public, but I work for one of the companies heavily invested in covid testing, so data does exist and would absolutely be analyzed at higher sample rates than a lot of studies would have population access to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, I saw that reporting as well. The mid 60% number is hard to know what to think of, frankly.  The UK number was a fair bit higher, and Delta is more than 90% of cases in the UK.</p>
<p>Israel had so few cases overall that their % numbers could be erratic. It doesn't help that none of us has actually seen the data either, we get reports of reports, but no raw data. The secrecy is weird, frankly.</p>
<p>But regardless, the larger point that protection against severe illness continues to be robust is undeniable.</p></div>		</li>
