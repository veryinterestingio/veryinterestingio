			<div class="markdown"><p>Pressure wouldn't be a major factor as the bladder is incredibly elastic. On average humans can hold about 500ml (about half a quart) and when emptied the bladder returns to the smaller size. Holding a full liter/quart of urine is not unusual either. So with this elasticity the pressure would stretch the bladder rather than try to force urine out into the body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a nurse, the most I’ve drained from a bladder in retention was 2,100ml!! It made my eyes water let alone the poor patient. Yes the bladder is incredibly elastic, but 500ml roughly would naturally be where you’d need to have a wee urgently.  As for weeing between each pint, that’s not directly to do with how much the bladder can hold, there’s 2 reasons, a) alcohol is a diuretic which in a nutshell causes you to wee more. B) Alcohol reduces the production of vasopressin, a hormone which which basically tells your kidneys to reabsorb water rather than flush it out through the bladder. With the body's natural signal switched off, the bladder is free to fill up.  These 2 combined your bladder has a party! After that first wee there’s no stopping it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the fullness of the bladder that matters, but if the solute concentration of your blood becomes high then the water from your bladder gets pulled out to the cells. A hormone called vasopressin (anti-diuretic hormone) acts on your kidney tubules to make it permeable to water so it moves from your kidneys to your blood. It reduces your urine output, and doctors use urine output as a marker for normal body functioning. If you aren't excreting any urine, then there is something not working in your body.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not right!</p>
<p>The kidney <strong>is able</strong> to dilute urine to hypoosmolar relative to the interstitium. If it weren’t, we wouldnt be able to deal with a free water excess.</p>
<p>The kidney’s ability to dilute urine is the reason why were able to drink plain water without worrying about diluting our plasma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we weren’t able to dilute our urine, we would have to drink water that is <em>at least</em> as salty as we are. Otherwise we would introduce a free water excess.</p>
<p>If we weren’t able to dilute our urine, the water we drank would dilute us, because we wouldn’t be able to get rid of it. While the urine we made would decrease the total volume, it wouldn’t fix the salt/water balance.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p></div>		</li>
