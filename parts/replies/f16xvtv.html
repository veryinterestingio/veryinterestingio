			<div class="markdown"><p>My course on GR was quite a while ago and I have not worked in that specific field since then.  Is it truely an axiom? I always thought of it to be an assumption made to match observed physics. Similar to how nobody says you have to put the Ricci-Scalar into the Einstein-Hilbert integral, but it fits the observed physics. Generally speaking we can assume arbitrary metrics, can't we?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's an axiom that was created to match observed physics. It explains how the theory can be correct despite seeming different than reality at first. There was no proof at the time that it would be a manifold rather than just a Euclidean space. It had to be assumed as part of the theory.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, it is an axiom of GR that spacetime is a 4-dimensional smooth manifold with a Lorentzian metric. Sure, this axiom is inspired by observation, but mathematically it is an axiom for the theory. It is an axiom in the same sense that &quot;the wavefunction is an element of L^(2)&quot; or &quot;observed values are eigenvalues of Hermitian operators acting on the set of wavefunctions&quot; are axioms of quantum mechanics.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Well, not quite. For one, an axiom is that the metric is Lorentzian. So a 4-ball with the standard Euclidean metric is not a spacetime because that metric is Riemannian, not Lorentzian.</p>
<p>Also, some topological spaces do not have arbitrary allowable metrics. For instance, a compact, simply-connected manifold can have a Lorentzian metric if and only if its Euler characteristic is 0. So if we were, say, considering the reduction of GR to one spatial dimensional (and thus the spacetime manifold were two-dimensional), then automatically we could not consider the 2-sphere or the double torus since those manifolds are compact and simply-connected but have non-zero Euler characteristic. (The standard torus would be perfectly fine though.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Axioms are stronger. An assumption is just a reduction on the degrees of freedom for your theory for whatever reason, an axiom is stronger in the sense that it is a necessity for the theory to work in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

<p>i thought the fact that we have a local gravity field meant that spacetime was <em>not</em> euclidean.  i thought you could see this because the curved path of projectiles were 'straight lines' in spacetime.  is that not right?</p>
<p>(i thought <em>space</em> was euclidean, but not <em>spacetime</em>.  although now i write that, maybe it's impossible?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/d83cig/why_is_the_universes_local_geometry_eg_on_the/f19hdgf/?context=3" target="_blank">this comment</a>. You are confusing a topological notion (locally Euclidean) with a geometric notion (curvature). Spacetime is locally Euclidean for the very fact that it is a manifold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but OP's question is about geometry.  it says 'Euclidean geometry' in the question.  is there a confusion between two different terminologies here?  maybe 'spacetime is locally euclidean' means topology for whatever field you are in, but 'euclidean geometry' is perfectly well defined.  isn't it?</p></div>		</li>
