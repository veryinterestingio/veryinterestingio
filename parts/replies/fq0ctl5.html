			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting! Does that mean that if I had an object with no overall charge but a strong separation of charges internally, let's say a sphere with a strong negative charge on one pole and a strong positive one in the other, the electric field I might measure outside of the object would diminish with the cube of the distance or is &quot;dipole&quot; in this context fundamentally different from just having two poles?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. In fact, any configuration of charges such that the net charge is zero has zero electric monopole moment, so the leading-order term in its multipole expansion is the dipole term. At large distances, the higher multipoles all die away faster than the dipole term, so it will behave as a dipole if you're sufficiently far away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. I have never thought about it and I don't know why but for some reason I am fascinated by this. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, your comments here helped me understand another piece of physics. A follow up question:</p>
<p>Is this also the reason why we never talk about strong interaction field outside of the nucleus? Nucleons being tripoles must have their strong field die out fast, so it is unobservable on scale where it could be described as classical field?</p></div>		</li>
