<blockquote>
<p>Someone wants to be a asshole, so they take up all of Dyn's time asking for numbers they don't really care about.</p>

<p>A DDOS is much rather like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Someone wants to be a asshole, so they go ask all their friends to ask Dyn about numbers they don't care about.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, the &quot;friends&quot; were &quot;internet of things&quot; (devices with connection to the Internet) that were used to spam DynDNS.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really good. Can you explain a second question I have: why hasn't anyone messed with Dyn before like this, or hasn't been able to? He seems like a great target for people who want to disrupt stuff, and based on the explanations here it seems weird it hasn't happened already.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dyn gets targeted all the time, it's just the size of the attack (the number of requests per second) was much bigger this time and came from obscure and unexpected sources.</p>
<p>It appears that the botnet used in this attack were not malware-infected PCs, but hacked Internet of Things devices like internet-enabled DVRs, Webcams, thermostats and toasters. Yes really.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's even more hilarious is that the attackers sort of social engineered the average user - when they mash F5 asking &quot;WHY ISNT MY WEBSITE WORKING&quot; that only amplifies the attack.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm certain that attempts to attack it have existed in the past, only this time they must've come with a degree of sophistication to actually achieve to take it down.  The best thing to do is to have multiple DNS servers configured in case of attacks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's say that your friend Dyn gets tired of these assholes bothering him with silly questions all the time and hires a bunch of trained monkeys to answer their questions. The monkeys learn who the assholes are and either deflect their questions, ignore them, or answer some of the easier questions so Dyn doesn't have to. Now, these monkeys are all over the world, but they talk to each other and learn from each other so they know who's okay to talk to and who isn't. Dyn has used this network of monkeys (AKA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anycast" target="_blank">anycast DNS</a>) to distribute DNS queries to its global network to spread the impact of a DDoS attack and keep their service running.</p>
<p>What happened yesterday was, the attackers sent a massive flood of traffic, of a specific type that tied up Dyn's network. As far as I know, this wasn't especially sophisticated - just much bigger than the usual DDoS, and aimed at many more of their points of presence. </p>
<p>Hope this helps! </p></div>		</li>
