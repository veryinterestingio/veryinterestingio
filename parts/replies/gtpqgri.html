<p>And now I donâ€™t have to try to write something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question, I honestly don't know where it yould be easiest to start. This is a complex topic somewhere between physics and (mostly analytical) chemistry.</p>
<p>The electronic transitions observed here are related to UV/Vis spectroscopy, where the wavelength of these absorptions can be used to identify compounds and determine internal electronic structures.</p>
<p>In the end it all ties into the quantum mechanical description of atoms and molecules and for that I can only suggest looking into atomic and molecular orbitals. These are models for how electrons can only have distinct energy levels around their atom's core and how these levels change when we go into a full molecule. Electrons normally like to occupy levels with lower energy, but if a photon with the right energy comes along, an electron might make the jump to a higher, previously unoccupied energy level, thus absorbing the photon that matched the jumped energy gap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this! What happens to the object when the electrons jump to a higher energy level? Do they just &quot;heat up&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question. To my knowledge there isn't a popular-level book that teaches such things (if you find one let me know!). The book &quot;The Physics and Chemistry of Color&quot; by Kurt Nassau gets good reviews, and might be worth trying to find in your library system. I haven't looked at it yet, so can't vouch for the quality personally. It's very expensive to buy, and probably requires some undergrad-level physics and chemistry to get started.</p></div>		</li>
