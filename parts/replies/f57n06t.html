			<div class="markdown"><p>Not original poster but also doing PhD work in circadian rhythms. People with late chronotypes (&quot;night owls&quot;) are more likely to become addicted to drugs and also have higher rates of mental illness. As far as I know, it's not yet been determined whether this is a genetic susceptibility or whether our social environment puts late chronotypes at a disadvantage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a person with Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome, I’m guessing the latter. Society just doesn’t accommodate night owls, and assumes they’re just lazy. So then you find out that there are all these drugs that will knock you out at any time and it seems like a magic bullet. Until you need more and more pills to get the same effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d guess that the comment-or was studying the genes and there has been a lot of work linking certain genes to being prone to addiction, so trying to draw like conclusions from that topic to the topic of certain genes making people prone to being morning people or not would be a good read.
Just my two cents, but PhD come respond we’re curious!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not OP but I would assume that he's talking about epigenetic changes and not actual differences in the genome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two questions: first, where can I read your research? Second, my understanding is that human sleep cycles were historically quite different than they became in the modern period -- segmented sleep patterns being the norm previously. Though I'm aware there's a large body of work being done on contemporary sleeping behaviors, I am largely ignorant of it. Do you have any insights or reading recommendations on the genetic or biological basis for historical sleep patterns?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Long story about my different research projects but the short is we ran out of funding so I left to go work in industry. Yeah we have something called sleep pressure which has different peaks, one later in the evening and one during the day. There is a reason the afternoon siesta was a thing. We have an increase in pressure sometime around mid day to early afternoon. Sleep used to likely be more fluid and people slept when they were tired. Now we create social pressure to stay awake and sometimes when our clock gets messed up and out of line we can get something called social jet lag. One of my projects looked into this. Some great new work has been done on this subject I suggest you look up.</p></div>		</li>
