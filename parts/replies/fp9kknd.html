			<div class="markdown"><p>I've bartended for years at high end cocktail bars, and cooked for years before that, and have never seen that regulation. I'm in the states, so we just add a disclaimer to the menu stating that undercooked eggs, meats, etc may increase your risk of foodborne illness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Likewise a bartender, and from what I know - maybe you can weigh in also as a cook - most if not all eggwhite containing drinks contain a level of lemon juice (if not something generally acidic) which when mixed and dry shaked causes a chemical reaction between the eggwhite with everything else. My guess is that it's similar to the role lemon juice plays in ceviche, but I don't know for certain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah! Both the acid and the alcohol in the drink serve to partially denature the protein in the egg white. Important to note that this doesn't affect any bacteria that may be in the egg, but it's part of what gives the foam in an egg white cocktail its structure.</p></div>		</li>

I don't know if its diffrence between US and Europe, or just my country has weird laws</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look into “flips” they’re quite delicious. You use the whole egg. Cocktail companion came up with a sherry banana flip and it was a superb meal in a drink.</p></div>		</li>

I would recomend you Amaretto Sour or whisky sour on flavored alcohol (Jim Beam apple e.g.)</p></div>		</li>
