			<div class="markdown"><p>Pandemics aren't new. We should have masks , ventilators, and icu beds set aside for times like these. Or at least the ability to scale up at a moment's notice. What if it killed 20 percent instead of 2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are all these things set aside, but not in unlimited quantities. They cost a lot of money. Infectious diseases sending several percent of infected people to the hospital are are, and this is the first new one that spreads so well in 100 years. Some countries have larger reserves, some have smaller ones, but this pandemic is a threat to even the most well-prepared systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, even if we had 1,000,000 ventilators sitting in a warehouse unused the next bottleneck would be doctors and nurses.  There's a reason why a lot of nurses are from the Philippines; there's simply not enough people in the US that become nurses and doctors.  Secondly, even if we had 1,000,000 ventilators that sat in a warehouse for 10 years waiting for such a pandemic to hit it would have to be the same or very similar model that the nurse or doctor is used to using.  Finally, pandemics aren't new but they don't happen very often so we don't prepare for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a gamble with pandemics. How do you know what sort of medical equipment you will need and what numbers. The plauge for example needs anibiotics and no ventilation. </p>
<p>The difference here between SARS, MERS and ebola is the spread and scale of the problem.</p></div>		</li>
