			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that's the order of magnitude I got from my estimate as well.  Pretty cool that they're close given all the insane estimates necessary for this calculation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing that both of you are missing out on is that Cellular Respiration, and indeed any combustion reaction with organic fuel and oxygen produces new H2O. I'm not on ratios, maybe someone else can help us with that.</p>
<p>Reading above this appears to be the same for many geological processes as well.</p>
<p>Haven't done any calculations yet, but a large percentage of the water is possibly new water formed, and not water that has existed for millions of years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, you can nit pick estimates all over the place on this question....mostly because the number of guesses involved and rough estimates would make the margin of error on any calculation almost nonsensical.  So I don't think we're &quot;forgetting&quot; so much as ignoring because the real answer then is always going to be &quot;we actually can't calculate it&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The water created by respiration leaves the body as urine, and the food “fuel” burned to create it was made by a plant splitting water in photosynthesis.  These are in balance so water enters the biosphere via a plant and leaves via an animal with no net gain.  It’s temporarily not water in between, but that doesn’t change my math.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans are probably a bad choice for typical animals though as humans both drink and urinate quite a lot more than the average for mammals. Way above typical levels and the highest by body mass. </p>
<p>It's one of the more unusual traits we developed, along with having the least dense fur of any primate (just a thin downy covering) and a permanent blubber layer (something that is otherwise only found in aquatic and polar mammals - it was one of the big pieces of evidence for the now discredited aquatic ape theory).</p></div>		</li>
