			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok cool so is that low pressure area like a vaccum or something in that small amount of time before the water fills it in? Like is there nothing in that space or is there water vapor or whatnot?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The low pressure is explained by the Bernoulli Principle.  Not trail of emptiness behind a local high pressure zone.  </p>
<p>The water nearest the surface of the fast-moving object gets dragged along with the object by friction.  This thin film of water moves fast in comparison to the surrounding water.  The Bernoulli Principle states that as velocity increases, pressure must decrease.  (It's the conservation of energy.  Think of it as swapping potential energy for kinetic energy). </p>
<p>The fact that the pressure is low allows the formation of cavitation bubbles.  This is not empty or a vacuum.  There is still pressure there but not high enough to keep the water from changing to the vapor phase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whatever is moving through a medium pushes the medium out of the way as it moves through it. On the backside, a low pressure zone forms because the medium cant fill the void left behind fast enough that was occupied by the moving thing. In some cases, the medium is compressed on the edges of the moving object, which creates a high relative difference in pressures which amplifies any effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(this is how wings create lift! Bonus fact!)  </p>
<p>edit:  </p>
<p>lift works thusly - the wing pushes lots of air out of the way (big front end). The wing is angled such that this creates the low pressure zone underneath the wing. The rest of the air then rushes into that gap, and because it just rushed into the gap it is moving VERY FAST, so it has a lot of momentum. All this fast air, moving up into the bottom of the wing, runs INTO the wing, and pushes it upwards. (like a very strong wind pushing upwards on a horizontal sail).  </p>
<p>To make a propeller, take a wing and turn it sideways. Now the air, instead of pushing the wing upwards, is making the fluid(air, water, liquid nitrogen, whatever) push it forwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because pressure is static pressure plus dynamic pressure.</p>
<p>So if you got a moving gas at least part of its pressure comes from the motion and the static pressure obviously gets less because total pressure is whatever you surrounding medium has.</p>
<p>If dynamic pressure gets bigger than the total a vacuum forms. </p>
<p>It's a tiny little bit more difficult in but that's the basics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not unless battery technology gets a <em>lot</em> better. Now, if you can carry around a nuclear reactor, that does the trick. Many submarines do that. Batteries just can't store nearly enough energy to compete with the amount of air stored in a tank.</p></div>		</li>

<p>well maybe I'll do that then.</p>
