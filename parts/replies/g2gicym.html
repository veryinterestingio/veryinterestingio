			<div class="markdown"><p>Since as far as I know having a vertically oriented tail like fish doesnâ€™t provide a significant advantage to a horizontal tail, it would be very unlikely that a vertical tail would develop and replace a horizontal tail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was recently watching a video about sharks vs dolphins, and the horizontal tail of dolphins make them much more maneuverable than sharks,  so I would say that the vertical tail movement is an evolutionary advantage and there's no evolutionary pressure to switch to a horizontal movement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would require a much too rapid and significant change in their anatomy to even be possible. To evolve to that point there has to be an in-between, so what would that look like? Diagonal flexing spine/movements?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That... isn't really true. There doesn't *need* to be an in-between, if there's a signal or two in the developmental pathway that could cause the other orientation.</p>
<p>There'd likely be other anatomical issues, but if the change in direction were really favorable those could likely slowly adapt.</p></div>		</li>
