<p>A second reason could be that RNA can get spliced and make slightly different proteins. Perhaps by having different stop codons, you are giving a wider range for the “end” of a protein to be signaled. This could be helpful because you COULD possibly still have a function protein</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes sense until you realize that bacteria and prokaryotes in general that have no gene splicing and which evolved before eukaryotes did, also have the same stop codons. So this can't be the reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You may be interested to know that some bacteria do have introns, and some even have a lot of introns, including in functional genes. Typically the introns are self-splicing (Group 1 introns) or have some assistance from the cell (Group 2 introns).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that this reasoning does not apply to bacteria for spliceosome-related activities, but self-splicing does occur and stop codons do help regulate that.</p>
<p>Different species (bacterial and eukaryotes) do have slight preferences for which stop codons they will use (dependent on a variety of factors including chromosomal content). Thus, it’s possible that bacteria use stop codons dependent on the termination location and RF factors. This could have a similar role for translation.</p>
<p>Of course, it likely is just that eukaryotes keeping the 3 stop codons through multicellular evolution was because it was already there and there was no benefit/downside to changing it (or changing it was destabilizing, or the mutations never occurred).</p></div>		</li>
