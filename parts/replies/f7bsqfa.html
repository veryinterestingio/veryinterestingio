			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd need to ask a protein biochemist/structural biologist. I think it is possible, but in a different perspective. A slow change in conformation suggests numerous (ten?) closely related conformational states. I'd think that's quite improbable, as having ten discrete states might be too complex a model. What might actually be happening, as proposed by that same paper, is that the enzyme binds the ssDNA in the closed conformation state of a hinge-like architecture. p58 would recognize the template and p49 initiates synthesis. As the former binds the 5' end, p49 would get further and further from it while synthesizing. Then due to some deeper mechanism, at a given distance, p49 is no longer able to synthesize further.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible that the active site has a pocket that's big enough to accomodate up to ten nucleotides. And then some residues at the back &quot;feel&quot; a nucleotide against them, signalling a conformation change that breaks the enzyme-substrate complex.</p>
<p>This is just conjecture though, I haven't studied the enzyme in particular. So don't quote me on this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A counting mechanism is proposed here based off of crystal structures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surely another possible mechanism is that its affinity is such that it only is able to load 10-12 (15?) nucleotides before it falls off? I.e. it's processive but only for a certain amount of time bound.</p></div>		</li>
