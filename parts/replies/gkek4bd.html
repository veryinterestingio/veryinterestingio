			<div class="markdown"><p>Diesel cars are useful for long trips, such as if you commute to work. They're terrible for short, in-city driving. Driving many short trips tends to take its toll on diesel engines. So if you plan to mostly use a car in the city, go for petrol, if you plan to go longer distances, go for diesel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think with OP being from NI the commute to work would be a short trip, unless they live in the rural areas and travel far to work in one of the urban areas.</p>
<p>I'd say the argument for diesel is:</p>
<p>Financial: diesel engines are more efficient and use 15−20% less fuel meaning cheaper running costs. The cars historically have tended to have a slightly higher resale value too, but this is changing with time.</p>
<p>Environmental: lower CO2 emissions means that diesels from before April 2017 get a lower tax band than petrol engine cars. For newer diesel cars though, tax is typically higher than for petrol.</p>
<p>Driving experience: diesel cars offer more low-speed torque which means they have better overtaking power and towing ability.</p>
<p>Cons:
Financial: diesel cars usually cost more than petrol. Diesel fuel is more expensive than petrol and servicing or fixing a serious problem on a diesel car might be slightly more expensive. New diesel cars also cost more to tax than petrol cars, and depreciation is now slightly higher. There are a number of new charges, such as the London T-Charge and Ultra Low Emissions Zone, that will make it more expensive to drive some diesels in certain cities.</p>
<p>Environmental: despite lower CO2 emissions, diesel fuel produces tiny particles linked to breathing disorders such as asthma.</p>
<p>Driving experience: diesel engines tend to be slightly noisier, but this problem is improving.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, nowadays and depending on where you live, I'd go so far as to say if you plan to only drive your car in the city or with short trips to the outskirts, check if an electric car would fit your needs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also older disel cars produce more local particle pollutants resulting in some cities banning disel cars within city limits if air quality gets to bad (usually in winter).</p>
<p>At least it's been a thing here in Norway, not sure how common it is elsewhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Take this with a grain of salt. I vaguely remembered that diesel is more for long journey/motorway heavy commute. I ended up going for petrol because I live in city and don't drive too far normally. I think it has to do with carbon filter or something that can only work more efficiently if car is driven long/fast enough.</p>
<p>I hope someone else with knowledge clarify this though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im in no way an expert, but this is also the philosophy for choosing an engine type that my step-dad taught me. </p>
<p>I've owned both types. I used to do a 100+ mile journey once every few weeks but other than that just stay at work and walk to town when I needed something. Petrol cars were by no means terrible at this sort of work, but they got through a noticeable amount more fuel on the long journeys. The fuel gauge on my diesel cars would pretty much hold steady, slowly ticking down every hour or so on a long journey. But the second I was driving in city, they just ate through fuel as quickly as the petrol would on the long journeys.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I now own a hybrid petrol engine and probably wont ever go back to a non-hybrid/electric vehicle through choice. Hybrids seem to offer the best of both at the moment in the UK. No requirement to charge, they only burn fuel when building up speed quickly or going over 30mph, but even then, the electric engine helps the wheels spin on long journeys, making the fuel consumption feel more like a diesel on long journeys than a petrol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s true </p>
<p>Roughly do more than20k per year a diesel is more cost effective (better mpg ) however petrol hybrids have certainly muddled the waters a bit (much improved mpg)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Diesel is great for long trips, the cars generally use less fuel. Diesel is bad if it is colder than -30c. Diesel is worse to spill on hands/clothes, harder to clean off. Diesel is way less flammable, so less risk of fire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in my country it used to be FAR cheaper diesel than standard gasoline, even the expression &quot;ir gasolero&quot; meant to go really cheap. It may be related to the fact that in the 90s diesel wasn't taxed as much as gasoline because diesel was used by machinery in rural areas.</p></div>		</li>
