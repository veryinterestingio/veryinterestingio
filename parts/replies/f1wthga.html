			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone disregard this comment, as it is completely inaccurate.</p>
<p>First of all, the term &quot;dope&quot; is older than the discovery of dopamine.</p>
<ul>
<li>From 1851: <em>colloq. (orig. dial.)</em>. A stupid person, a simpleton, a fool. Also (<em>U.S. slang</em>), a person under the influence of, or addicted to, some drug</li>
<li>From 1886: Opium, especially the thick treacle-like preparation used in opium-smoking’ (Cent. Dict. Suppl. 1909); hence applied to stupefying drugs and narcotics in general, or to alcoholic drink. <em>slang</em> (orig. <em>U.S.</em>).</li>
<li>From 1900: A medical preparation administered to a race-horse for the purpose of affecting its performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Second, the statement 'dopamine is the how you feel &quot;high&quot;' is just dead wrong. There are a multitude of psychoactive substances that affect your central nervous system in a variety of ways. Psychedelics such as psilocybin and LSD primarily bind to serotogenic receptors. Alcohol and benzodiazapines work by binding to GABA-A receptors. THC binds to cannabinoid receptors. Ketamine is an NMDA antagnoist. And on and on. Not all drugs mimic, bind to, or release dopamine. However, the subjective experience/sensations of these drugs may feel pleasurable, thus releasing endogenous dopamine unrelated to the chemical action of the drug itself.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also we have no clue at all what causes depression. SSRIs treat it, but the neurochemical signaling system is so weird that they could be doing anything. In fact, they seem to decrease seratonin in some areas, perhaps by oversaturating enough that the brain stops producing as much. Pretty much any neurotransmitter will carry any information, including the opposite of its popular conception. It all depends on the incredibly complicated interplay between a neurotransmitter, other neurotransmitters, hormones, and the neurons themselves, which we are only beginning to understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP is talking out of his ass, that isn't why drugs are called dope. Opium started being called dope in the 17th century when it was often extracted in a viscous liquid form, hence 'dope', which also means viscous liquid. It was also linked to the 'dopey' fashion that the users had after getting high. Nothing at all to do with dopamine.</p>
<p>Not why OP had to lie there, but he did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey man, no need to call him a liar. He's wrong, but that doesn't automatically mean he's lying. He could just believe that's the honest truth, happens every day.<br />
He also said &quot;contributed&quot; not &quot;Is the sole reason for&quot;. Give the guy some slack.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Soldiers called opium “dope” during the US civil war. This would be ~100 years before dopamine was named.</p>
<p>Dope to mean a drug is hardly even slang. The dictionary definition of “dope” is an adulterant, or chemical used to make something impure. <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_(semiconductor)#Group_IV_semiconductors" target="_blank">This is not even an archaic word!</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I looked up the etymology and it used to mean thick liquid/paste. Since opium was commonly sold as a paste or thick tincture at the time, you can see why it got the name.</p></div>		</li>
