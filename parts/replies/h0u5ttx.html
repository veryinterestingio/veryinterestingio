<p>Pogonomyrmex occidentalis and Pogonomyrmex badius use depth within the nest to stop germination (Lavigne, 1969 Tschinkel, 1999; Tschinkel, 199a)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an interesting aspect. How do the seeds know they are too deep? Temperature?  Something else?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would imagine temperature and pressure are the predominant factors. I'll read the associated papers and let you know what I find.</p>
<p>Edit: I have read the paper fully. He does not discuss it, although it is stated that temperature data was taken at all deciles (depths as a proportion of total nest depth) </p>
<p>I will reach out and see if he still has the data 30 years later. (The experiment was performed in 1990)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wouldn't a seed that rolled 50 feet downhill be under the same pressure?</p></div>		</li>
