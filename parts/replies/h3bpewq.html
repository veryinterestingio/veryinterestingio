<p>Reykjavik gets basically all their hot water, building heat, and electricity from that geothermal plant.</p>
<p>I'd sell my left testicle to live there.  Visited once, saw the sights.  10/10 will go again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm we built an Integrated heat pump system for clients with tesla roof, tesla wall battery home system. They don't pay to heat or cool their home until it's 5f outside and the oil burner kicks in to ensure the home stays at 65. The first year after we installed it the oil burner kicked on twice in the winter using about a tenth of the fuel as they usually did. It was also 65 inside during July peak heat with enough extra power to charge the car from the solar. Downside... it was expensive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>None of these are effective at even moderately high temperatures. Just ask all the PNW people how that's going right now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have a feeling after this week I'll get a lot less snide comments about my AC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I moved from Maryland and was absolutely flabbergasted that it was just expected an apartment had no A/C unless they specified otherwise. But everyone was adamant you didn't need it. Lasted two years in a place with no central and windows that made portable and window units impossible. Back to central A/C now. Never again.</p></div>		</li>

I've been in MIA for three years now and every week have to walk myself back from the ledge because people here are so awful. I'd be curious to know about cost of living too, if you can spare the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in Portland and bicycled into work today (because that's how I get everywhere, plus Lyfts started at $30). It was 110f.</p>
<p>I got a towel wet and froze it last night, and draped it over my shoulders just before leaving the house, and it was dry in five minutes. The air <em>hurt to breathe</em> and burned my skin, like I was standing in front of an open oven. My brake levers felt like the buckle of a seat belt in a hot car. </p>
<p>And last night, even with getting my cotton blanket wet and an aiming a fan directly at myself on high and draping a wet towel on my neck, it was hard to sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It looks like Portland is pretty low humidity right now, so try a swamp cooler. You can make them yourself if you're creative. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHbQYajfGqM" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHbQYajfGqM" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHbQYajfGqM</a></a></p>
<p>The little humidifiers you get at walmart/target/etc are the same thing. They pass air over a fabric/paper/etc that evaporates water into the air.</p>
<p>Down here, we have A/C and just don't go outside during peak hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fellow Wilamette Valley resident here. Jesus that sucks, I definitely get how painful air was to breathe. But hey, sub-70 right now. Thank god it seems like this monday was the peak because fuck, all of that. I stayed indoors with the day off. Went out briefly to get groceries. Its difficult to fuckin focus, and I drove a car. Using my bike sounds like hell.</p>
<p>So yeah uh, A/C in my house. Fuck people who act like its for wussies.</p></div>		</li>
