			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's just so that we don't stretch out the periodic table too wide? And let it fit well onto any standard paper size.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/pOcO0gr.jpg" target="_blank">here's Wikipedia showing the full periodic table without that &quot;large group&quot; of lanthanides and actinides separated</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_(periodic_table\)#f-block" target="_blank">f-block</a> and they actually do fit in the periodic table. They’re just down there to make it more friendly for printers and paper. The thing is so wide it barely fits on a page. Moving them below helps them fit on a horizontal piece of paper (whether a book or a poster).</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Periodic_table_blocks_spdf_(32_column\).svg" target="_blank">Here’s what it looks like when they’re in place</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, another good example is Hepatitus A, B, C, etc. It just means &quot;inflammation of the liver&quot;. They just took every disease that mainly inflames your liver, and gave them all letters. That would be like taking every disease that gives you a sore throat and calling them Sore Throat A, Sore Throat B, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aren’t lots of diseases and viruses named after the symptoms it creates, okey yeah hepatitis A and B have a different pathology but they both infect the liver, what indeed is the meaning of hepatitis. The common cold is mainly caused by rhinoviruses, we just gave the disease another name but it could also be called as rhinitis, what would just mean “infection of the nose (mucosa)”. Another example could be Streptococcus pneumoniae. A bacteria that if it infects someone is mainly causes pneumonia, but of course it can also cause other diseases. I find this very different naming then the categorising of vitamins.</p></div>		</li>
