			<div class="markdown"><p>For those who don't know, if you fire the same signal out of lots of little antennas with the right angle of phase shift (time shifting the wave emitted or received) calculated for each antenna you end up sending the signal at an angle that adds to the dish's current angle. </p>
<p>Edit: prepositions and stuff. Still not perfect, diagrams are better than words for explaining these things in my opinion</p></div>		</li>
