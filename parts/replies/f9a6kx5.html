<p>Humans aren't really operating under the usual selection pressures that other species are (things like predation, disease, and starvation aren't really a threat to us any more), and thus sleepwalking isn't liable to kill us, and can be passed on.</p>

<p>Are you under the assumption that humans only started sleepwalking recently, in our post-technology, community-oriented evolution? Because you'd be wrong. Sleep walking might not be as risky to people as it is to others because we live in communities that can stop us from doing dumb things while sleeping, but I assure you we were sleep walking when &quot;predation, disease and starvation were still a threat to us&quot;, because that's literally <em>now</em> in some places, and it was yesterday for the entire species in terms of evolutionary time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure I'm buying this without a source, particularly the idea that somehow selection pressures like lack of predation have caused humans to evolve the phenomenon of sleep walking. </p>
<p>So somehow, we've lost the selection pressures to be afraid of predators, yet everyone knows what to do if they're being chased by a lion, or what to do if they're standing in the middle of a road and a semi is heading at them at 120km/h. Somehow humans have also lost the selection pressures of disease, which doesn't explain why people will instinctively avoid going into a room that smells like rotting meat. </p>
<p>As for claiming things like starvation aren't a threat and therefore not a selection pressure, well, <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/series/maternal-and-child-nutrition" target="_blank">three million children</a> die every year from undernutrition/starvation. Like the TV ads say, that's a kid every 10 seconds. That seems like a pretty decent selection pressure, unless you're going to claim that these people also don't sleep walk, which will require a source in and of itself?</p>
<p>It doesn't add up considering modern humans still have the vast suite of reactions to these exact pressures you're claiming don't exist.</p></div>		</li>
