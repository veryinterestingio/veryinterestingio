			<div class="markdown"><p>Most bacteria can't tolerate salt above 3-5%. Seawater does have some bacteria, but most of those are helpful, like the cyanobacteria that produce oxygen.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Unrelated sort of but interesting when I kept saltwater fish a common treatment for some parasites were to bring the salt concentration down to much lower than what you would find in the the ocean (approaching freshwater) and it would kill the parasites.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what he meant is that changing the salinity of the natural environment that bacteria/parasites/lifeforms-in-general can kill the organisms. So for the bacteria thriving in your throat, where there isn't a high concentration of salt, flushing the environment with salt makes it a toxic environment. Similarly, if you take a saltwater fish and immediately introduce it to a freshwater tank, it can kill the fish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Frankly I'm not 100% sure either that was based off of the fact that I know salt(s) can help to breakdown and dissolve different things in particular organics which is why it's one of the oldschool home remedies for a clogged drain. </p>
<p>I hadn't thought about the regular water irritating the sinus passages but that does make sense and is honestly probably a better explanation. Thanks</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mucus membrane is a semi permeable surface. This means water can flow across it but the dissolved salt doesnt. The mucus membranes have salts in them (potassium, magnesium, sodium, etc. Are all salts). Water will flow towards the higher concentrations of salt. If you put water with no salt in your nose, it will be quickly absorbed by the sinus walls in excess and be painful. Too much salt will suck water out of the sinus wall and be painful. Correct amount of salt and water will flow back and forth evenly and not be painful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're close, but not quite right. You're not likely to kill much bacteria with the salt rinse, at least not any more than are killed through the process of having less mucus produced for a while. There simply isn't enough contact time to actually kill them, unless you're using a supersaturated solution that's going to hurt more than it helps. There's a few benefits from the salt rinse:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you rinse away some of the colony of bacteria, leaving less for your immune system to deal with</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you clean out a lot of the snot/mucus, dead bacteria, and dead cells of your own, leaving less 'garbage' that your body has to clean up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you use a hypertonic solution, you relieve some of the swelling by drawing water out of your tissues, easing the pressure and relieving the soreness, allowing even more stuff to be rinsed out. IME you can rinse until nothing comes out, and then rinse 10-15 minutes later and even more will come out. </p>
</li>
<li>you're rinsing away some of the debris (food, dead cells, etc) that the bacteria feed on, slowing their growth</li>
