			<div class="markdown"><p>This really isn't proven. Not taking a full course of antibiotics really isn't detrimental to their effectiveness. </p>
<p>Antibiotic resistance comes from over use of antibiotics, keeping people on them for extended periods of time allows for natural mutation to occur and resistance to grow.</p>
<p>You don't see animals evolving to be resistant to rare natural phenomena like lightning or volcanos. But you do see them adapt to persistent threats like weather, toxic plants and other predators.</p>
<p>No. Antibiotic resistance is from the over use of antibiotics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Others mentioned the same thing, but just to drive it home using the above analogy:</p>
<p>That 5% fire won't necessarily be the ones that got barely missed by the water, it's the fire that <em>doesn't mind being slightly wet</em>. Then if that fire spreads, that fire won't mind being slightly wet either. Repeat this enough times, you get fire that's really hard to kill with water.</p></div>		</li>
