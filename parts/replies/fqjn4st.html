<p>Tossing the diplomat into prison or torturing them until they agree with whatever you want isn't acceptable to the country they represent. This means that minor transgressions are generally overlooked in the interest of diplomacy; if the diplomat parks in the wrong place and would otherwise get a ticket it is just ignored.</p>

<p>I know you know this, but I want to make it clearer to the reader: the idea is to make it impossible for governments to harass/pressure foreign diplomats by telling their cops &quot;follow this guy around and ticket him for everything you can think of&quot;.</p>
<p>We Live In A Societyâ„¢ where everyone commits minor offences on a daily basis, and if all laws were actually enforced everyone would be either in jail or bankrupted from all the fines. Targeted overzealous enforcement is an effective bullying tool, and diplomatic immunity prevents governments from using this tool on diplomats (however, governments can and do use this tool on their own citizens).</p></div>		</li>
