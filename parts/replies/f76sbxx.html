			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel bad about asking for random medical info on Reddit, but the only actual clinic for girl stuff around here is... really bad. Like, hands out pamphlets saying condoms are only as effective as pulling out bad. And they openly insulted me, right in front of me, just for existing I guess. I don't really trust any info from them, so...</p>
<p>If someone wanted to go on birth control for painful and heavy periods, but is sensitive to stuff and didn't want to mess up their hormones too bad, would estrogen or progestin or both together be best?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! Medical student here - I'm so sorry to hear that the clinic isn't providing you with adequate care or counseling on this topic :(  - it's a really important topic, and they really should not be judging you or insulting you..</p>
<p>Just wanted to plug Planned Parenthood and the Mayo Clinic sites as wonderful online resources to get some first-line information; <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control" target="_blank">this Planned Parenthood page</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/birth-control/in-depth/best-birth-control-pill/art-20044807" target="_blank">this Mayo Clinic page</a> could be helpful places to start.</p>
<p>Combination oral contraceptives (both estrogen and progestin) are great for managing period symptoms, and many patients will have lighter periods and less pain when using a combination pill. A progestin-only pill (the &quot;minipill&quot;) can also stop your period, but some patients choose to use the combined pill instead because the progestin-only pill is less forgiving and *must* be taken at the same time every day to be effective at preventing pregnancy.</p>
<p>(In case you wanted to learn more - some patients will also choose to get the birth control implant or the hormonal IUD because those often make your period much lighter and less painful. For many patients, their periods will even stop entirely - I personally have had an IUD since 2016 and haven't had a period since!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the info! The minipill is sounding really appealing. Preventing pregnancy isn't a big concern for me since I'm a wait until marriage kind of person, so the minipill is sounding like all positives and no negatives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you happen to know if the hormones in the combined pill could make migraines worse? I’ve been on it for a couple years and when I stopped briefly a month or so ago, it was the longest I’d gone without one in a long time. Started again and had one a week after. Purely anecdotal but it made me wonder?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know the specific answer to your question, but I went on an estrogen+progestin combo partially for heavy/painful periods and it’s been a godsend. </p>
<p>I used to be bedridden for at least a day and up to three every month. Now I barely have to take Advil. I’ve had minimum side effects from the pill, mostly involving sexual function. It didn’t really hurt my libido, like some people though. </p>
<p>Overall, I don’t feel like it’s really messed up my hormones. I’m not super moody because of it, I haven’t gained weight, and it helped my acne. I’ve thought about switching to an IUD, but my experience with the pull has been so good that I’m not willing to mess with changing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't sound like a women's health clinic but as one of those Christian organizations posing as one (usually called Crisis Pregnancy Centers). </p>
<p>For preventing period cramps your best bet would be a progestin only pill, commonly called the minipill. For the minipill consistency is crucial (take every day, same time every day) otherwise it's less effective for pregnancy prevention. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/minipill/about/pac-20388306" target="_blank">https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/minipill/about/pac-20388306</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I wouldn't be surprised if they weren't a real proper clinic. I figured they must be since my doctor referred me to them for getting birth control, but when I got there the entire thing looked very unprofessional. </p>
<p>Thank you for the info!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 3 groups are estrogens progestogens and androgens. The subgroups contain for instance, estradiol, progestin, testosterone.</p>
<p>It's progestogens and not just synthetic progestogens in form of progestin.</p>
<p>From wiki : Progestins are synthetic progestogens and have similar effects to those of the natural hormone progesterone</p></div>		</li>
