<p>I remember being a child and seeing this on TV when it happened. I didnâ€™t understand it, of course, but it stuck with me.</p>
<p>And to think this encounter happened the day AFTER thousands of people were murdered. This manâ€™s courage is unfathomable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>nsfl: I don't know if there ever was a settle estimate of the deaths from the protest, but a British diplomatic cable put the death toll at around 10,000 people.</p>
<p>It's said that the tanks rolled forward and backward over the protesters until they were turned to mulch. The remains were collected by bulldozers, incinerated, then washed down the drains with hoses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Australian Prime Minister at the time read out the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-06-03/bob-hawke-tiananman-classified-cable/100184916" target="_blank">Diplomatic Cable</a> sent by the embassy in Beijing. His report said their bodies were incinerated with flame throwers. It was, however, retracted not long after, and considered an exaggeration of events. It's suspected that a single informant went around the embassies with that initial story, because a lot of countries recieved similar information</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most horrifying thing is that there were people, who would no doubt consider themselves good people, who woke up that morning with &quot;drive tank over protesters&quot; on their list of things to be done that day. They had their morning coffee and bagel then went off to do just that.</p>
