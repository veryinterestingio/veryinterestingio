			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm afraid I'd be punching above my weight class if I tried to answer your question. I'm not the author of the paper I linked - I came across it when I had a similar question a while back. </p>
<p>Reading it again, the theoretical model looks like it incorporates too many variables to be as elegant as a Maxwell relationship, but this is just speculation and your question has me shrugging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, me too. I was thinking of all those different ways you can manipulate unmeasurable derivatives into measurable quantities, like coefficient of thermal expansion and heat capacity. Maybe they could be made to interconnect in some way. I was going to look through my textbook to see if the authors did this but then I got busy at work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might not be sufficiently meaningful but the thermal expansion coefficient is related to the difference between heat capacity at constant volume and heat capacity at constant pressure by</p>
<p>Cp - CV = VT a^2 /K  </p>
<p>where a is the volume thermal expansion coefficient and K is the isothermal compressibility. </p>
<p>There are Maxwell relations/other relations that say some partial derivative = expression that includes heat capacity and thermal expansion coefficient. I believe this includes derivative of temperature w.r.t to volume with entropy fixed and internal energy w.r.t to volume with pressure fixed.</p></div>		</li>
