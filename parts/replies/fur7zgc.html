There's plenty of fillers and additives and reinforcing products in plastics, but other than not using certain materials that negatively affect health there's really no rule against using any kind of additive for reinforcement, to give it some other desired property, or simply as a filler. There's many different reasons for additives such as:  antimicrobial, uv resistance, electrical conductivity or insulation, rigidity or flexibility, friction addition or reduction, noise resistance, and resistance to heat/cold. Some are there to help the material flow better, some just help keep the pellets dry. What you're likely thinking of is the most common additive calcium carbonate, but it is used to help strengthen the part and reduce cooling time, not to reduce material. There's always coring for that, or you just charge the customer more per part. Some parts can see a profit margin of 50%, some as little as 6-7%. Material is a negligible cost that is covered by the customer along with everything else, there's usually a buffer included in the profit margin for scrap, OT, unexpected machinery repair costs, accidental mold damage and repair, etc. that the customer isn't expected to pay for. The most profitable jobs have the machinery and molds paid for already, and have loose tolerances (can use regrind, can be reworked, can be much shorter/longer or heavier/lighter, can have certain defects, etc. The best way is to produce many parts in shorter time, as in multi-cavity molds like a 64 cavity tool making bottle lids vs a single cavity tool making a lawn chair. The additive you're describing would only be used during initial qualification, or if something changed and had to be investigated further.</p>
<p>If additives weren't allowed, metal injection molding of medical parts wouldn't be a thing. You can't inject metal without a binder material that is usually wax or polypropylene. In this case it helps the metal powder to keep its shape, especially during the debinding and sintering processes, unless someone out there has an injection molding machine that can melt and cool metal a few parts at a time and still remain profitable.</p>
<p>It's stress. Some materials have an additive that change the color when the part is stressed to more easily catch defects, but this is actually really only used to find out when/where the stress is caused as it is usually more expensive or changes the properties of the material too much to use in production and its only really used when the part normally wouldn't show stress marks. I ran into this making a cupholder bezel out of PC+ABS because the paint was cracking/flaking off of the substrate. We had to use an engineering grade of the same material and found out that the part had molded in stress at a point where after painting while in the oven to cure would cause the part to release that stress and warp, causing the dried paint to crack. Before we sent the mold to get worked on we had to make a LOT of those parts, and before painting them we had to take a blowtorch to them lightly to anneal them before painting. Eventually they stopped painting them altogether and just used a slightly different grade of the material for more gloss and UV resistance since it would no longer be painted.</p>
<p>Especially in the case of polypropylene that is cooled and then bent you're taking a semi flexible rigid plastic and elongating it along the direction of flow. You can see this in rubber bands, and balloons get more transparent under stress. In this case it's more like taking a 2x4 with fairly straight grain and pulling it while applying pressure against the grain. It will crack and splinter, only with plastic the materials used are packed much more densely so the stress is microscopic and instead of seeing cracks and splinters you see the difference of a glass window in the frame and on the floor in the sunlight. It's reflected/refracted light caused by stress. Some parts do this, others don't, some don't stretch much at all and just snap, but even most of those you can see the stress marks at the edge. </p>
<p>I've been in injection molding for 7 years, mostly automotive, but some medical and recently metal injection molding. </p>
<p>They use different grades, but it has nothing to do with the affect being described by the OP. The different grades are simply different, sometimes more controlled, compositions of materials. For example a high spec part in some piece of manufacturing machinery could be as much or even more stringent than medical grade, the only difference would be perhaps the one for the machinery used a temperature stabilizing additive where the medical part used an antimicrobial one, that slight change makes it a new composition and therefore a new grade of that plastic, and since both have very specific tolerances they're referred to as engineering grade so they can charge more for their consistency and more frequent and stringent QA testing.</p>
<p>Most medical plastics are made autoclaveable (temperature resistant, hydrophobic, and non-porous) and most have a secondary process to sterilize with gamma radiation, as injection molding isn't exactly a clean room environment anywhere. This limits your material selection, and the medical grades they have need to go through many types of tests before being approved, but really before the secondary radiation process you could see the same material composition used in school lunch trays or food processing equipment at McD's, they just don't have to hold the same tolerance even if they need the same properties and as stringent testing. Also worth mentioning that regrind material is not used in medical devices because it changes the material properties and isn't allowed.</p>
<p>Again, there is a foam material for showing defects, but it costs more when defects could easily be hidden or removed in automotive work and molders generally don't pay more for material unless they have to. Even then, some of these materials require a catalyst to show the stress visibly. Why would someone want defects to show up when they're non-critical parts like a bezel for appearance in the automotive industry, and not when it matters like in the medical industry? Why would you pay more for a material you'll make less money on?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You said a lot and Not a lot to do with the question but the foam or blowing agent reduces part weight and packing. For single cavity molds with huge weight. Reducing cost but making the part lighter and decreasing voids. So it really does save money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did say that there are additives that reduce cost and weight, whether it's a blowing agent or foam doesn't matter. I also did respond to the question, it's stress. You're referring to a specific set of circumstances even without combining them:  thick walls and/or heavy weights. This is something that is typically avoided in the design stage if it can be helped. The crumbly looking part of a plastic if you cut it would be the core of the part, the outside the skin. The skin is cooled faster, is more compressed, and retains its shape more easily because of this, the core is still hot for a bit longer and doesn't maintain the direction of flow and needs to be packed in under pressure to avoid sinking or voids. Here's a relatively decent link below to a video on youtube describing the laminar flow of plastic being injected.</p>
