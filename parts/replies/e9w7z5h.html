			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a problem. I try to give this explanation as often as I can, as I too wish it were more general knowledge and clearly accepted. The survival of hundreds of millions of people depends on it, as does the survival of future generations in general. Yet, here we are, doing next to nothing (here in the US at least). </p></div>		</li>
