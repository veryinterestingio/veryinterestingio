Also stabilizers so the proteins keep their shape for longer time, as well various simple chemicals to keep the solution the right pH (acidity level) and salt concentration. Anything non-active in the vaccine is called and excipient, and by now there quite few well known, well studied, proven-safe ones that formulators can try with their viral protein. This routine.</p>
<p>The most time consuming part is verifying mass safety through clinical trials, to make sure most of the population won't get an adverse immune reaction to the vaccine. You def want to do this went innoculating hundreds of millions of people. </p>
<p>Fyi whole virus vaccines (either heat killed, or heat attenuated) are not really used anymore because it's too risky should an active virus survive, so now we just use the specific proteins we know the immune system can recognize (viral surface proteins). Also safer to manufacture as you don't ever have the whole virus laying around. This allows for even more massive production of vaccines, as well exactly known constitution of the vaccine.</p>
<p>Isn't science grand, polio used to kill a lot of people and an oral vaccine was developed with no barrier to administration and now polio is all but wiped out. Vaccine costs pennies to produce. Who knew studying physical reality would pay off .</p>
<p>Source: I studied how to manufacture vaccines in my MSc. Almost worked for big pharma then said fuck it lol</p></div>		</li>

The viral nucleic acid is exposed inside the cell, how is an antibody going to work there?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice post. Just one correction though: B cells make antibodies. T cells help B cells (T helper cells) and/or kill off infected cells (Cytotoxic T cells).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great explanation of a very complicated topic. I'll try to give a little more ELI5 level (or maybe ELI10)</p>
<p>Some vaccines <em>are</em> actually just the killed pathogen, and others are live but harmless versions. I think what OP is asking about is called a conjugate vaccine, here's (sorta) how it works</p>
<p>Your immune system actually has several different specialized divisions to fight all kinds of different pathogens. For example, some of them are very good against bugs that float around in the blood. Others specialize in finding bugs that hide away in your cells. </p>
<p>One division of the immune system is sort of like the FBI. It specializes in intelligence and storing information so that we can efficiently dispatch other divisions of the immune system (effectors) to take care of the problem, should it reoccur. However, just like in real life, we don't get the FBI division involved with EVERY criminal activity, just particularly heinous ones. And some really dangerous bugs are just really good at flying under the radar of what the FBI looks for. </p>
<p>The goal of a conjugate vaccine is to get the FBI division of our immune system involved in something it normally wouldn't bother with. The way we do this is we attach a clue that the FBI considers important to the thing we want them to recognize. To give a real life example, lets say the house across the street is a running a small illicit drug selling operation. Now you could just call the local cops and say &quot;they're selling drugs across the street&quot; and they would take care of the problem short term, but it didnt bring NATIONAL ATTENTION to what was going on. This is sort of how the killed vaccine works. </p>
<p>Lets say, however you leave an anonymous tip that CHILD PORNOGRAPHY is being distributed there. This tricks the FBI to start a big operation and dispatch agents there where they don't find child pornography but do incidentally discover the minor drug operation that normally would have flown under the radar.</p></div>		</li>
