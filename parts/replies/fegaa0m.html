			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the comment! So basically they only need to have enough cash to pay invoices and installments on their debt as they arrive, and they keep getting more loans because they have so many assets to guarantee them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can work with loans, most companies, especially at that scale have huge agreed overdrafts that they can dip in and out of to cover small differences in timing between income and outcome. But loans are mostly used for large, long term things like equipment, and at the scale of netflix even that is unlikely.</p>
<p>For most things, credit is just agreed between supplier and customers.</p>
<p>I used to do credit control before shifting to management accounts. I’d invoice a customer, and they’d get a time that something was due in. So for small, high frequency customers they were generally on net 14 days - basically, from my invoice date, they had 14 days to pay.</p>
<p>For larger value customers, I think the longest I’ve seen is net 180. So they get near as damn it 6 months to pay in. </p>
<p>From the customers perspective, that means they can plan effectively. A promptly sent invoice gives them time to plan. A payables team will know exactly what is due to go out on any given day. A receivables team won’t have such perfect info about future orders, but they’ll know exactly how much is due on a day from what they’ve already invoiced.  </p>
<p>This is reported up to management, letting them plan, meaning that the financial controller and CFO can plan based on how much they’ve overspent or how much they have to spend on anything they need. Combine that with knowing how much is in the bank and you can plan out the cost.</p>
<p>If they find themselves in a position where they need a sudden influx of cash that their overdraft can’t cover, a publicly traded company like netflix is less likely to go for a loan, and more likely to go for a share issue - they issue shares to the stock market. People can buy those shares and they then have an ownership stake of the company equal to 1/Xth of the company, where X is the total number of netflix shares there are. The more shares you have, the more say you get (though for most people, the amount they have is so small that they’ll never have any material control of a large company).</p>
<p>Netflix gets the money for those sales and can use it. Those shares stay in circulation until netflix takes the decision to buy them back (imaginatively called a share buyback).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When a company undergoes a share buyback, from whom do they buy the shares back?</p>
<p>As I know that during buybacks, the share price and eps can go up, which is great for investors, that's a positive
But on the negative side, someone has to lose shares right, so who is that? A large investor?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, however they could face the issue where their asset values decline, or lenders decide not to lend as much to companies (we saw this occur during the financial crisis) which could result in a situation where Netflix has a massive amount of debt that is all due at once and they don't have the cash on hand or access to lenders to pay for it. Now this isn't something that occurs often, particularly with large companies like Netflix, but is a real risk when assessing the creditworthiness of a company.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  </p>
<p>The key strategic concept here is basically &quot;return on capital&quot; or &quot;how much money does Netflix generate per dollar they spend&quot;.</p>
<p>If Netflix can get loans at 10% interest rate, and Netflix thinks they can generate more than $1.10 in value (per year) for each dollar they spend on content, then it makes financial sense for Netflix to continually get more loans to finance expansion.</p>
<p>In the short term, that looks like keeping up with debt payments and invoices as you say.</p>
<p>(PS. The end state to this kind of expansion is when a company has so much debt that any kind of reduction in the company's growth rate will lead to them failing to meet repayments and getting into to trouble with creditors.  Because of that higher risk, creditors increase the interest on new loans. At the same time Netflix is predicting lower growth rates for itself as the company matures and eventually Netflix naturally stops requesting new loans)</p></div>		</li>
