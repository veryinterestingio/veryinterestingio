			<div class="markdown"><p>It is similar to external wound healing, except that it is on the inside. Any wound causes the release of many chemical signals that attract suitable white blood cells to come to the site to clean up debris and handle intruders (especially for external wounds) and also attract clotting factors to stop the blood loss. Of course, the bigger the wound, the longer it would take to heal, if at all. And rest is an important factor in healing.</p></div>		</li>
