			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome explanation!! I worked at MIT's Alcator C-Mod tokamak back in 2013, including with some of the authors on the divertor paper! I haven't worked on fusion since then, so this was a really nice throwback!</p>
<p>Shameless plug for my only paper on the topic: <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0953-4075/47/10/105701/meta" target="_blank">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0953-4075/47/10/105701/meta</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's where I worked as well! I was just a little undergrad at the time. It's great to see the field grow since I left fusion research roughly 7 years ago. Keep up the exciting work! Thanks for posting here and for sparking a mental trip down memory lane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope! Not a chance. It’s funny, although it seems extremely dangerous to contain something like this, fusion plasma is a very delicate thing. The slightest leak and the plasma would simply fade out. The impurities in normal air would smother the deuterium and tritium nuclei and prevent them from fusing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fission is self propagating or a positive feedback loop can occur.</p>
<p>As in if something goes wrong, it can mean the reaction keeps going and going out of control. Much like Chernobyl, and Fukushima.</p>
<p>Fusion is the reverse, if anything goes wrong, it fizzles out. Stopping the reaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also make fission reactors that are very much not self-propagating.</p>
<p>And you could theoretically make fusion reactors that are self sustaining, e.g. the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question. First of all, it depends how you define “working.” If working means “it makes a plasma and sustains it for a few seconds” - we’ve been doing that for decades. But I assume you mean a tokamak that makes more energy than it consumes. </p>
<p>Obviously, as someone in the industry, I’m quite optimistic. The tokamak I’m working on has a first plasma date in the 2025 time frame. Our goal is to produce twice the energy we consume (Q=2). So I think we’re within 10 years. The old “fusion is 30 years away and always will be” adage doesn’t quite apply anymore due to the recent breakthrough of high temperature super conductors which allow much, much more powerful magnetic fields in smaller, easier to build machines. With that being said, there could always be unforeseen physics once we start operating at higher power levels. It has happened before, and we’d be naive to assume it couldn’t happen again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting! Do you know if these newer technologies are going to be incorporated on the ITER reactor? My feeling is that it's construction is taking so long that by the time it is ready it's going to be outdated</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, can you be a little bit more specific on the high temperature super conductive material you use? I wanted to read up on it, but the wikipedia page for it says that high temperature super conductors were discovered in the 80's. What is the recent breakthrough that allowed these materials to be used in fusion reactors?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had an undergrad physics professor who worked on nuclear fusion before he became a professor. When we asked him about the likelihood of nuclear fusion being commercially viable his response was that we would likely have long careers without ever seeing a Watt of power produced by a commercial fusion power plant. This was more than two decades ago, so you're admittedly optimistic timeline makes him look prescient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Working fusion is the dream but short term i.e. the next couple of decades these school bus sized micro nuclear reactors that are completely sealed systems and designed in such a way that they are incapable of melting down are extremely promising and they can be linked together for scaling The only site requirement is that you just have to have a body of water to throw it in. They are so safe that the residential exclusion zones are like whole orders of magnitude smaller than around traditional reactors</p>
<p>If you want more information just google search small modular reactors or SMR</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention the decentralization of the reactors is great for homeland security efforts. They provide much smaller targets (physically and metaphorically) than a single nuclear plant, and therefore reduce the risk of attack from malign actors.</p></div>		</li>
