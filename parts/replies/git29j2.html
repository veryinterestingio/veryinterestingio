			<div class="markdown"><p>People argued about impeaching Nixon too. Most republicans (people not actual politicians) didn't care about any sort of political cover-up and thought there were bigger things to worry about. Republican politicians on the other hand... its hard to say. In the end they didn't have to vote to impeach cause he resigned</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before the last month or so of Nixon’s presidency, what you say might be tru. But by the end of July 1974, articles of impeachment were drawn up and passed out of committee, and would certainly have been passed by the full House. Within a week, it became clear that Nixon would be convicted in the Senate. The only reason that neither happened is that Nixon resigned. But he only resigned because he knew his presidency was over no matter what he did.</p></div>		</li>
