			<div class="markdown"><p>FYI not that much is recycled.  There are limited processing facilities here and in most cases it costs more to ship than it is worth.  Some was going to china until recent trade issues.  Our landfills have designated areas for specific materials in case recycling should ever become profitable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As with most places, the real need is for source reduction (sometimes called &quot;precycling&quot; by enviro-geeks.) The less material that passes through the hands of consumers, the less there is that needs to be landfilled or recycled. Things that are now norms in society, like pint-sized plastic water bottles, plastic EVERYTHING for that matter, disposable diapers, goods that are sometimes double or triple packaged, overuse of packing material for shipping, etc., create lots of excess trash that then has to be dealt with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why in socialist California they teach (or at least used to) the importance of REDUCE, REUSE, RECYCLE, and in that order.</p>
<p>Reduce what you consume in the first place, reuse whatever you can (reusing something just once cuts waste in HALF), and recycle whatever the city will take.</p>
<p>Recycle was always dead last because it's less efficient, and because who knows if the stuff is actually being recycled. Simply using less is, as you say, the best way to reduce our footprint.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, I live in Hawaii and have to tell my family not to send me a stupid plastic candy cane full of m&amp;m's this year. I dont mind gifts but dont mail me waste. Seeing all the candy with unnecessary plastic just to make it Christmasy is dumb. I try really hard to not buy any one use plastic and if I have to, I make sure I use it for something else before recycling it. Its definitely a problem that needs funding, research, and futuristic solutions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Their economy is changing and they are transitioning way from trash processing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Recent trade issues and the fact that globally there is a huge problem with people properly sorting and categorizing recyclable goods. Lots of trash and non recyclable waste ends up in recycle loads.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember while visiting the Galapagos Islands and noticing a large smoke plumage, I pointed it out to our tour guide and he's all casually like &quot;yeah thats where they burn the trash&quot;.  I was a bit stunned, and asked &quot;<em>...really?</em>&quot; and he looked at me like I had two heads, of course they burn the trash, what else should they do with it?  I didn't have an answer</p></div>		</li>
