			<div class="markdown"><p>If you start with N atoms then you can only have N decays of a given type at most. If we look at the decay chain A-&gt;B-&gt;C then you can have e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>B-&gt;C releases more energy per decay than A-&gt;B. More than half of the total released energy comes from B-&gt;C.</li>
<li>A has a much shorter half life than B. After several times the half life of A most nuclei decayed to B, and now the activity of B is dominant.</li>
<li>A decays via alpha decay only, B decays via beta and/or with a gamma component. The radiation of B is more important behind some shielding.</li>
<li>With a long decay chain A-&gt;B-&gt;C-&gt;D-&gt;... most decays will be from daughter nuclei simply because there are so many types of them.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a poorly defined question. In terms of total radiation, no, because radiation/radioactivity is measured in decays per second (also known as Becquerels). The formation of daughters comes from the decay of the parent isotope, so the radioactivity of the daughter is bounded by the parent in your source. </p>
<p>The daughters can have greater specific radioactivity if they have shorter half-life than the parent. Specific radioactivity only considers the decay rate relative to the amount of a material.</p>
<p>It is also possible for a daughter with very short half-life to emit more total radiated energy per unit time than the parent if the decay is higher energy, this exists in some of the transuranic decay chains.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think that’s what I was asking. Thanks for the detailed explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Daughters combined do have more decays per second, obviously. There's like 8 unstable daughter isotopes in radium decay chain, so 8x more decays per second. Of them 5 emit alphas, and alphas are all about the same energy, so about 5x alpha, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a better way to think about this is: are there isotopes whose daughters have shorter half-lives than them? Because it's the half-lives that will tell you how &quot;active&quot; a given isotope is. U-238 has a billion+ year half-life and so is for many purposes functionally inert. Rn-222 has a half-life of 3.8 days so it discharges its radiation very quickly and so is much more acutely dangerous if you have a bunch of it together. The energy of the specific decays is not so important — if it's enough to be ionizing, then it's a biological hazard.</p>
<p>Anyway, the answer to this question is <em>yes</em>, and the examples I gave are examples of this (the uranium decay series). You can totally have things (like U-238) which have such long half-lives as to be almost regarded as inert, but over <em>long</em> time periods it can accumulate significant quantities of very short-lived isotopes that are a major hazard (like radon and its daughter products).</p></div>		</li>
