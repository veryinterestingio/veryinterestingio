			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple of solutions to this, for anyone who hasn't considered it before:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>phone apps like Sleep Cycle can monitor your movement during your sleep and wake during a window (mine is set as 30 minutes) prior to your alarm time if it senses you moving around (a sign you are at a light stage of sleep)</p>
</li>
<li>smart light bulbs like Philips Hue bulbs can be set to come on at minimum brightness and gradually get brighter over a set period, so your body wakes to light.</li>
</ul>
<p>I use a combination of these two and believe I sleep a lot better for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vouching for sleep cycle. It has a sonar mode which is able to detect movement even when my phone is 10 feet away. It typically wakes me up around 7:10, but my alarm is set to 7:30 at the latest. The 30 minutes of leeway really helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sonar mode? I really doubt that. Sonars emit loud high pitched noises and calculate position based on feedback, there is no way phones have it and you wouldn't be able to sleep if they did.</p>
<p>Probably just listens for when you move.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simulated sunrise with HUE bulbs is one of the best things I've ever done.  I wake up way easier with the light que.  There are pre-wake processes your body performs when it starts to detect light and whenever I accidently turn the lights off at night and wake up to my alarm in a dark room I'm way groggier than with HUE.  With the simulated sunrise I have it start 30 mins before my alarm (hitting full intensity at 30 min mark) and I usually wake up before the alarm even goes off, assuming I actually went to sleep at the proper time.  My alarm is also just bird noises that get progressively louder over 30 mins, so overall it's a really gentle wake up.</p></div>		</li>
