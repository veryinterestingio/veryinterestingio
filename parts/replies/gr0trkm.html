			<div class="markdown"><p>Another one is that diphenhydramine shows in both cold medicine (Benadryl) and sleep aids, depending on which effect (antihistamine vs. drowsiness) the producer is trying to market.</p>
<p>Or how acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is prescribed to people at risk of a heart attack, not to treat pain, but because it just happens to <em>also</em> be a blood thinner that prevents clots from forming, say, in the middle of your arteries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. The real issue, insofar as there is one, is that the body is so complex, and there is enough difference in how it works from person to person, that it is very difficult to introduce a substance into the body that will consistently affect it in one, and only one, way.</p></div>		</li>
