<p>Edit: Okay, now I feel like a fool. After posting this, I found out that sound is apparently edited in. Still, even if that isn't the original audio, the concept is still relevant, I guess?</p>
<p>Edit 2: Seriously? My first ever reward is for some boneheaded mistake? And one of my most controversial comments was when I said that children shouldn't hire prostitutes. I will never understand you, Reddit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a different thing there, as almost all of the risk of rot or decay in the utility pole is due to the ground contact, allowing it to rot from the inside out. You are knocking on it to see if the pole has voids on it, not to check moisture content. Moisture does affect rot and decay, as most rot needs at least 20% moisture content on average and water can move through the end grain of the pole faster than the side grain, but that isn't the reason for the knocking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point is still correct. Soft materials dissipate vibrations quickly. Heterogenous materials cause vibrations to diffuse. A hard, homogenous material will not diffuse or dissipate vibrations as much.</p>
<p>Other properties, such as shape and speed of sound (related to hardness) have a large impact on which frequencies are dissipated quickly vs which last longer.</p></div>		</li>
