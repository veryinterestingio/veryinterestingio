			<div class="markdown"><p>You can make it coherent with pinholes and filters, but laser light is more than just coherent. The photon count statistics for laser light have much smaller fluctuations in intensity  than coherently filtered sunlight even at the same average power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/jfizzix has it correct. There is a higher order of coherence that has to do with the rate at which photons arrive from the source. Non-laser sources tend to have photons released in bunches rather than as a steady stream. This is how you’d be able to discern a laser beam from light which is just really well filtered. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What would be an example of temporally incoherent light? Or, can you elaborate on that concept some more? Can you have spatially coherent light that is temporally incoherent?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay sure to make spatially coherent light take a good strong flashlight.  Or use the sun as the source.  For a small example use a cardboard box. Put a pinhole in one end and a matching pinhole in the other.   Shine your light source through and what light makes it through both pinholes has to be moving in a very narrow path.  Use a bigger box with holes further apart or smaller holes to increase the coherence of the light.     This would be spatially coherent but you'd be getting all the frequencies that the source put out more or less.  </p>
<p>To make it temporally coherent you'd use filters to achieve the band you wanted.  Say you wanted a nice solid green visible light so you'd allow only 425-435 nm light through</p></div>		</li>
