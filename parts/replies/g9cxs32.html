			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the main reason why it doesn’t go away.  It’s the excuse so many industries use for why something shouldn’t happen.  It’ll take away jobs.  Nothing was better than how PA does their state taxes.  Just a flat tax and I only ever owed on my savings account interest because the rest was always perfectly deducted because there was no Byzantine set of rules like in most states and for Federal.  It could easily all change to this but too many people benefit from it not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean that is true, but it's also not a correct answer to the question. The graduated tax makes it very difficult to predict total liability and most people wouldn't like paying 10% in January and 40% in December. Unlike tax prep people, graduated taxes are a good thing.</p></div>		</li>
