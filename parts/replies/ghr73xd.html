			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but what if Iâ€™ve already got a cold and then another variant of cold enters my body, will I be twice as snotty and bunged up or will my body just respond to both as one in the same? Could one cold require me to have a fever and the other cause me to have a headache or would my body just respond with both options regardless or whether either one requires both responses?</p></div>		</li>
