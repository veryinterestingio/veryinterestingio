			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. That's a wild statistic.. I can't imagine with all of the homes/hotels/restaurants built and remodeled each year all of that stone fitting in a sports stadium. In my mind it was (is?) a LOT more.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The highest estimate is a 50m x 50m x 50m cube.</p>
<p>Marble is a LOT more common than gold, it's basically just a pretty rock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that about gold, but I have a hard time comprehending it.  </p>
<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought all the gold contacts on electronics are... gold.  Are they not?  Or are they just copper?  I must be wrong...  </p>
<p>Because if they have even a trace amount of gold in them, it's like... think of how many electronics there are...  On top of all the jewellery there is.  I know most aren't close to 24K, but still...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind a lot of stone used for countertops and so on isn't actually 'marble'. You got granite, you got quartz, you got a bunch of other stones too. And those stones are super, super abundant in the earth's crust.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming that Wikipedia isn't lying to me about global marble production, but any time you're talking about a material that's mostly used in (relatively) thin sheets, it turns out to be a surprisingly small volume. One big aluminum mine digs up more rock than that in a single year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting thing to consider is that marble only exists on the surface of the Earth - because it forms from the husks of ocean life forms. Meaning Mars, the asteroids, all those moons around the gas giants won't have an ounce of marble.This means that the stone will probably be considered a status symbol and very expensive to procure for the future populations that will live off Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Add fossil ivory, gem quality jet, and amber to that list. Lithium will also remain relatively rare, even with asteroid mining - most of the lithium in the universe is trapped in cores of stars, and gets fused into heavier elements during supernova, so if you aren't making it through transmutation you are going to find it sparse out in nature. You can thank The Expanse books for that gem of truth.</p></div>		</li>
