			<div class="markdown"><p>this alone would likely ruin any profitability in a 2nd season.  Im sure this is important, but its only a small piece.  </p>
<p>Most of their subscribers likely are not binging numerous shows, they may only watch 2 or 3.  Thats just as important to see which shows have a unique viewership.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If a studio spends money on a show either at season 1 or 5, one of the few metrics that really matter to them is how many new subscribers did it bring to the platform. A secondary metric would be how many existing stuck around.</p>
<p>This type of product management isnâ€™t new. SaaS lives and dies by it. Instead of seasons it is new major features or capabilities. And before that traditional businesses used the same metrics.</p>
<p>As I said the first time, there are certainly other revenue streams, costs, and metrics to consider. But the most important metric to any service is, how many <em>new</em> customers does it bring in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>retaining customers is just as important, since it can be far more expensive, and difficult, to reacquire.  </p>
<p>Plus sporadic subscribing is an issue, so they also want to know how quickly you watched, if you subscribe 1 month a year and binge the past 12 months of content, they may look to see which show most closely times to your resubscribing as the show you cant wait to watch.</p></div>		</li>
