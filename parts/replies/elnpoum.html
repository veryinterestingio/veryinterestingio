<p>5 minutes later you notice you have like 10 text messages asking where the fuck you are and if you're alive cause you should have gotten home an hour ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the hardest part! It used to be a huge part of my job, and whenever people would ask me I would just answer honestly. &quot;Theoretically it could take a few hours, but it's literally impossible for me to give a time estimate because there are tons of variables that could impact the amount of time it will take and I won't know until I run into them.&quot;</p>
<p>Then they want an answer anyway, so I just say something ridiculously higher than what I expect. &quot;Idk, give me two weeks.&quot; Haha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Always overestimate... by a lot. That's what I have learned to do. My boss asks me to complete a task and unless she assigns me a due date I will overestimate how much time it will take to complete.</p>
<p>My boss might ask me to write a report that might take ~4 hours. I tell her I'll have it by close tomorrow. If I get distracted... which I am known to do, I still can usually get it done with plenty of time to spare, and if I turn it in early the next day, my boss gets stoked and usually thanks me for all my hard work.</p>
<p>Always better to overestimate and over-perform than to underestimate and under-perform.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do this all the time. Once I told my mom I'd get tortillas for dinner with the store being 15min away. I came back two hours later thinking I'd only been gone for half an hour.</p>
<p>I can make a schedule I'm actually pretty good at organizing large groups of people, but someone else has to help me follow it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My morning schedule is what screws me over the most. I get up a half hour before I need to leave  (which is more than enough time for me to throw on my scrubs, brush the toofers, wash the face and do my hair, and eat.) and I'll look at the clock after what seems like 30 seconds and it's been 20 some minutes. Its irritating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surely this is normal right? I’ve done this many many times. I had an ex claim I had some form of ADHD but I don’t believe it because I’m not hyper. I met some kind of criteria that she found like I can only focus on things I’m interested in and can’t perceive awards as a reason to focus on a task. Something like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hyperactivity isn't a necessity FYI. Hence ADD vs. ADHD</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hyperactivity is not a requirement for ADHD. ADD and ADHD used to be classified as two separate things, but they're both bundled under ADHD now. Hyperactivity is sort of just like... a sub-category of impulsivity. A person with ADHD can have hyperactivity/impulsivity issues but not always. And it's not always just a &quot;bouncing off the walls&quot; high energy thing. I'm fucking exhausted all the time. But if you get me talking about something I'm interested in, I will ramble until I physically cannot speak anymore because my mouth is so dry. But hyperactive is actually a specific sub-type of ADHD. Most people are mixed hyperactive/inattentive, some (like myself) are just inattentive type, and some are hyperactive.</p>
<p>My daughter has more classic hyperactivity symptoms, and I feel so bad for her because I have SUPER high sensory sensitivity. So she's constantly fidgeting and moving around and I'm constantly begging her to stop because I can hear and feel (if I'm sitting near her) <em>every single movement</em> and it's so distracting lmao.</p>
<p>ETA: Also I don't know if this happens to you, but in my above anecdote I legitimately <em>lost</em> that time. Like I wasn't daydreaming or fucking around, I was hyperfocused on my work. But I literally did not have a memory of that hour. I had maybe 5-10 minutes of it. I knew what the end result of what I had done was, but I couldn't possibly tell you exactly what I'd done for that entire time. It's actually kind of a scary feeling sometimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes those distractions happen normally, With adhd, those distractions are almost Standard Operating Procedure. Its not just the one thing you get distracted about, its 10 other things within a couple of hours, and 1 of those hours you literally spent studying the minutia of how milkshake machines work on wikipedia, because for a minute there it was really engrossing and then you lose track of time and now you're behind and know more about milkshake machines than anyone should. In another 2 hours you'll have forgotten half of the milkshake facts, and having gotten mostly back on task, you'll then get an e-mail about something you've forgotten to do. Repeat past 4 hours</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a spectrum disorder that's not that well understood; to some degree, it's an exaggeration of a normal human failing. Nobody is perfect at concentration. Whether it's a disorder or not is based on how bad it is and how much it impacts your life.</p>
<p>I didn't give it much thought until I was an adult -- it was much easier for me to adapt to school (up until grad school) than it was to work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think /u/soupsnek described it well in their comment. It can be normal distraction or it can be this complete absorption with something else. You are often completely unaware that it’s happened until you snap out of it and realize you’ve lost an hour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's me. I remember sitting in high school chemistry, I'd start daydreaming or doodling or something... All of a sudden everyone was standing up from their chairs and getting in groups to do a lab, and I had no idea what the fuck was going on. It was really embarrassing.</p></div>		</li>
