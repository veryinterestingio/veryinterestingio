			<div class="markdown"><p>Some citrus does.  Specifically Seville oranges (bitter oranges used in marmalade) I believe have the same, or at least a very similar, problem.  </p>
<p>I'm on daily cancer medication now and the list of forbidden foods/herbs are: grapefruit, Seville oranges, St. John's Wort, pomegranate and star fruit.  I don't know whether they all have the same sort of enzymatic reaction of if some of those create reactions in different ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>St John's Wort seems to affect other enzyme processes than the fruits mentioned; main side effect is making the prescribed drug less efficient.</p>
<p>(St John's Wort is rather scary, I think. It affects so many systems in your body and is still not treated as a prescription drug.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bergamot, the citrus used in Earl Grey tea, can also cause the reaction. It takes a few cups of tea to really be a problem because most tea has so little of the bergamot oil, but I don't think drinking a strong cup of tea to wash down pills would be advisable.</p>
<p>Seville oranges have already been mentioned. Pomelos and tangelos can also cause the reaction. I suppose the focus is on grapefruit just because they're so much more common. Most of the citrus fruit people consume today are hybrids so it depends on what was crossed with what to get a reaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it is certain chemicals that are found abundantly in grapefruit that other citrus don't have. Kind of like how jalapeños are spicy and bell peppers aren't, because jalapeños have the spicy chemical and bell peppers do not</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but lots of pepper varieties are spicy. It's unusual that one fruit has something specific that others do not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really strange when you remember evolution doesn't have a purpose. Sure, their might be a trait in one species that works for it, and maybe there was no need to evolve any more characteristics beyond that. Sometimes there is a need. Also, spicy peppers have also been cultivated by man into It's many varieties, whereas the grapefruit hasn't. And many other fruits/crops have also been artificially &quot;varied&quot; by man</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't actually unique to grapefruit, it is in several other kinds of citrus as well (pomelo, bergamot, Seville oranges, etc.). Though I think grapefruit is the worst of the ones that are very common. I think the analogy to peppers and spice was probably spot on.</p></div>		</li>
