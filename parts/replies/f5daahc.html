			<div class="markdown"><p>Bitwarden is one of the only open source ones. That means that we can be sure that they are not sending your password to the server (or adding a back foot to the encryption) as we can look at the source code for the program that is running. It is also very cheap at ~Â£10 a year for the premium (the free version has all the core features, premium has some nice extras).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your normal passwords are put into a locked box and made available everywhere in the internet. Your master password is the key to unlock the box.  </p>
<p>It is the box that moves, not the key. Because it's not a physical key you can use it in as many different devices as you want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best explanation, and is similar to what what finally got my dad to trust an online password manager.</p>
<p>At first I told him to think about a security deposit in a bank; they have the box with your stuff in it, but they can't open it without you because you have the key.</p>
<p>I then told him to imagine that rather than going to the bank to open it, you could call a security guard at any hour of the day to bring the box to you, instantaneously.</p>
<p>I finished off by saying the lock is unpickable and the case indestructible, and that people far cleverer than him or I are constantly trying to break into similar boxes to make sure they can't be broken into.</p>
<p>Seemed to convince him it was safe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>tacking on to this
If someone does find the box, they may be able to look at it, but without the password it is like a shredded document. It would be possible to guess the correct origionall arrangement but it would take millions of years.</p>
<p>The only way to un-shred the information is to tell it the exact way that it was cut up. </p>
<p>The only complication to this is that if you loose/forget your master password, all that shredded info in the locked box is gone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually he meant that your master password never leaves your system in which you decrypt. Here is an explanation -</p>
<p>To retrieve a password from any online password manager you first get your encrypted password file (you do not need to use master password yet). Once the encrypted password file has been downloaded to your computer, you decrypt it on your machine itself using the master password that only you know. Think of encrypted file as some kind of lockbox, so you first get your hands on the lockbox and bring it to your home, once you have brought it to your home (downloaded) you unlock it using a key which only you own (the master password). In this way, you never had to show your key to anyone and you can still manage to safely unlock the lockbox.</p>
<p>To add to this, there are only 2 ways to mess this up -</p>
<ol>
<li>You give your key to someone else (either by a scam/phishing/whatever). Now your lockbox can is not safe. The only way our of this situation is to transfer the contents of lockbox into another lockbox with a new key.</li>
<li>Some lockpicker decides to crack open your box by some means. This is where you trust security researchers. The current security-standard encryption algorithms are very secure and can not be broken* (as a matter of fact entire bitcoin business relies on this fact). This is to say that your lockbox is ultra secure and you do not need to worry about giving to anyone as long as you keep the key safe with you.</li>
</ol>
<p>* This is the current scenario. In future it is likely with the advent of quantum computers or super conductors that these algorithms may very well be broken and your lock box will not be secure. However, that is not for us to worry about in near future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that you still have to trust the online password manager in two ways, namely that they ... </p>
<p>1) didn't intentionally install a backdoor into their software that leaks your password. The company's management but also just one single developer could decide to do so.</p>
<p>2) aren't hacked themselves, which would allow the attacker to release an  &quot;update&quot; for the software, installing a backdoor that leaks your passwords.</p>
<p>Both scenarios happen all the time with all kinds of software.</p></div>		</li>
