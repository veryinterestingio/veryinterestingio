<p>It's somewhere between a 10 to 1 or 20 to 1 ratio of neutrons to protons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is absolutely fascinating and I had no idea until now. Do these protons, neutrons, and electrons organize into &quot;atoms&quot; of some kind, basically superheavy isotopes of some element? Or is the entire star one big soup of particles?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The description that I've heard is lasagna or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_pasta" target="_blank">nuclear pasta</a> rather than soup.  ... and the Wiki article is amusing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While nuclear pasta has not been observed in a neutron star, its phases are theorized to exist in the inner crust of neutron stars, ... . This semispherical phase is known as the gnocchi phase.</p>
<p>When the gnocchi phase is compressed, as would be expected in deeper layers of the crust, the electric repulsion of the protons in the gnocchi is not fully sufficient to support the existence of the individual spheres, and they are crushed into long rods, which, depending on their length, can contain many thousands of nucleons. Immersed in a neutron liquid, these rods are known as the spaghetti phase. Further compression causes the spaghetti phase rods to fuse and form sheets of nuclear matter called the lasagna phase. ...</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends where in the star you are. It's generally thought that no, nuclear molecules don't form in the core. But at the transition between the crust and core, where matter isn't quite yet at nuclear density, protons and neutrons do arrange in funny shapes we call <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/nuclear-pasta-1.png" target="_blank">'nuclear pasta.'</a></p>
<p>Basically, the short range strong force between protons and neutrons wants to pull everything together, but the long range electric repulsion between protons wants to push it all apart. As a result a sort of balance is struck by adopting funny geometries where protons and neutrons don't make spherical nuclei, but other fun shapes like cylinders and sheets which we call 'spaghetti' and 'lasagna.'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Details like that are mostly conjecture at this point. But it is theorized that there will be atomic nuclei in the upper parts of the neutron star, with increasing size as you go deeper, eventually giving way to neutrons.</p>
<p>Deeper still you might have more exotic forms of matter if neutron degeneracy pressure isn't strong enough to withstand gravity (just like you get a neutron star instead of a white dwarf if electron degeneracy pressure isn't strong enough). Technically that could be labelled eg. a quark star instead of a neutron star, but it would be difficult to tell the difference from the outside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Highjacking this comment to add a link to one more good video from the YouTube channel kurzgesagt about neutron stars:  </p>
<p>Neutron Stars - The Most Extreme Things that are not Black Holes<br />
<a href="https://youtu.be/udFxKZRyQt4" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/udFxKZRyQt4</a></p>
<p>It also discusses the different layers:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Crust of iron cores with electrons flowing around them  </li>
<li>Layers of &quot;unbreakable pasta&quot;  </li>
<li>Core of unknown &quot;matter&quot; because it is not really known how matter acts under such enormous pressure  </li>
</ul>
<p>So there are not only neutrons in a neutron star.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's a lovely channel for disseminating scientific concepts to your average Joe. Plus, the content has only gotten better over the years!</p></div>		</li>
