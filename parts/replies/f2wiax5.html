			<div class="markdown"><p>Bit* of a long shot, but would you happen to know of any podcasts that look at history and linguistics similarly to your comment? I listen to one on the history of English and love it, but itâ€™s limited to only English (plus Latin, French, Norse, etc and other languages that influenced English).</p></div>		</li>

<p>As a result, it uses clicks specifically because they don't sound like speech sounds to Lardil speakers, and they help make the avoidance register more distinct from 'real speech'.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are some other languages that have evolved/developed/whatever because of what's essentially an 'aesthetic' preference? Very cool write ups by the way, legit fascinating. Without people with interests that seem random to others, wikipedia would never be so well off!</p></div>		</li>
