			<div class="markdown"><p>Tardigrades are awesome, though you should read about Bdelloid rotifers, too (they have a lot of the same cool survival strategies, but after desiccation can repair DNA breaks with anything that was left in their gut.  So cool!).</p>
<p>I had a very unique journey to get to where I am.  When I started college, I was pursuing a double major in dance and English literature.  It took me a long time to figure out what I was passionate about, and it wasn't until my last semester of my undergraduate degree that I really got to have &quot;hands on&quot; experiences working with aquatic systems during several upper-level elective courses (wetland plants, aquatic macro invertebrates, and limnology [aka: lake studies] and limnological methods).  After graduation, I worked part-time as a technician to get as much experience as I could (as I said... so many hours on the microscope!), and then started graduate school.  For my MSc research, I focused specifically on one species and learned a lot about it; however, I really wanted to branch out and focus on acquiring skills that would allow me to look at many types of organisms.  Having gained many of these skills, I'm confident that I can learn about and work with a number of new systems.</p>
<p>I don't know where you are in your personal academic/career journey, so my advice might differ based on where you are at; however, even outside of academia, there are lots of opportunities to get involved in working with aquatic systems.  Many nature centers conduct &quot;Bioblitzes&quot; where they have experts identifying in a short period, or offer lectures on particular topics.  There are often local &quot;hobby&quot; groups for anything from mycology (fungi identification) to stream clean-ups, or community events.  In Florida, there are citizen science programs that incorporate people into collecting data on physical and biological properties of lakes.  All of these are great opportunities to get involved and make connections!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your insight! Rotifers, amoebas, mites, I just love being able to visually look at mini-worlds through microscopes! I have some work done towards a conservation major but biochemistry terrifies me if I want to get into microbiology... Really cool to hear how your path turned out, it gives me hope that I can make it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many routes to work with microscopic organisms-- aquatic ecology or stream ecology or limnology could be an avenue for this, particularly if you're interested in larger organisms like these.  There are always opportunities to develop identification skills for these organisms (and aquatic insects/macroinvertebrates).</p></div>		</li>
