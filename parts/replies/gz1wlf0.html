			<div class="markdown"><p>Anyone revving at any time of the day, unless it's somewhere 200 miles away from everyone, is a complete idiot. It's not fun. I don't care if Reddit downvotes me to hell, revving is such an awful thing. If you do this, fuck you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m sure someone will figure out how to mod an electric car to make the engine whine very loudly at some point.  Unfortunately I think loud car people will always exist.  Some electric cars already have external subwoofers so the car sounds more sporty (BMW i8 for one).</p></div>		</li>
