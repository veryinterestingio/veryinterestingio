<p>This, the word “revolutionized” is not an overstatement at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Back in the day when Toyota was truly at its peak of pursuing their mantra of quality improvement, they introduced the Lexus brand and its flagship product - the LS400 luxury sedan.</p>
<p>At the time, the consistent quality of this car absolutely shook the US Domestic auto makers to their core.</p>
<p>I read somewhere that upwards of 5% of the LS400 sedans sold in the first year were quietly purchased by other car companies so that they could be torn apart and studied to try and determine how Toyota had managed to do what they had done so well.</p>
<p>One memo that circulated around one of the Big Three at the time (GM, I think) basically summed up that they (GM) could not currently build a car this good using their current production methods, no matter how hard they tried or how much they spent.  It simply could not be done.  Yikes.</p>
<p>And if that wasn't enough for Lexus, a few early customers reported some minor, non-safety issues with their cruise control.</p>
<p>And by &quot;a few&quot; customers, I mean... two.  Not 2,000.  Two.</p>
<p>So Lexus recalled <strong>Every.  Single.  Car.</strong></p>
<p>And by &quot;recall&quot;, I mean that Toyota sent a driver with a replacement car to each and every owner for them to use while their own car was being driven back to the dealership and repaired, before being returned.  Detailed, with a full tank of gas.</p>
<p>And a small gift to apologize for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>Free of charge, of course.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate on why six sigma is. It's a way to measure defects out of a manufacturing system.  Instead of 1 per 1000 or 10000 or 100k.  Six sigma is less than 3.4 per million. </p>
<p>It stems out of statistical way of measuring standard deviation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. There is (was) a cord at each location, which any employee could pull in the event of a defect. Pulling the cord stopped the entire production line to allow the defect to be investigated and fixed. It's called an Andon Cord, and the idea is used in other industries today - Amazon adopted the concept a long time back, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned about this in a management lecture in university (note i just study engineering).</p>
<p>Also of note is that they were know for a design philosophy whose japanese name I dont quite remember (Kopaioke or something). It the practice of designing parts so its impossible to assemble them wrong, the worker would notice immediately.</p>
<p>Many of these special traits come from WW2 or the times after that. Where there was no shortage of resources in the US and inefficiency do not get punished as much, the japanese had to be extremely efficient to make anything happen really.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is known as Poke Oke. Pronounced pokie okie, and in the OEM I work for it has to be considered for every component. Mostly it happens naturally during component design, but sometimes it's necessary to add small features that prevent mis-fitting.</p></div>		</li>
