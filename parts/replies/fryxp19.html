			<div class="markdown"><p>We should definitely plant more trees, but it’s extremely unlikely that trees alone will provide enough negative emissions. Trees are relatively cheap, they do capture carbon, and they provide all sorts of other environmental benefits as well, like preventing soil erosion, limiting water runoff, and providing habitats for species. Fundamentally, though, we have taken hundreds of gigatonnes of CO2 out of the earth’s crust, and there’s not enough arable land to store it all on the earth’s surface. A good portion of it needs to go back into the crust via mineral or geologic storage. </p>
<p>All of the approaches we’ve purchased from have higher theoretical capacity than forests, but they have yet to reach that capacity today. As for efficiency, it depends on how you measure -- photosynthesis is staggeringly inefficient, but in some sense, that doesn’t matter because it’s powered by renewable zero-carbon sunlight. (If you’re curious, there’s multiple types of photosynthesis, C4 is more efficient (<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/photosynthesis-in-plants#photorespiration--c3-c4-cam-plants" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/photosynthesis-in-plants#photorespiration--c3-c4-cam-plants" target="_blank">https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/photosynthesis-in-plants#photorespiration--c3-c4-cam-plants</a></a>). </p>
<p>As for capacity, there a two main things to consider: </p>
<p><strong>Land use</strong> </p>
<p>With planting trees, the amount of carbon you can capture scales \~linearly with the amount of land you use. You’re also (apart from something like large-scale solar desalination and desert irrigation) limited to arable land. </p>
<p>We need arable land for growing food, and it’s not evenly distributed. We can certainly reforest some, but as the population grows, demand on arable land will increase. Alongside planting new trees, you can also try to preserve existing forests -- this is crucial for ecosystem preservation, but is more analogous to avoiding emissions than it is to negative emissions (if the forest would otherwise burn down, you’re avoiding those emissions. If the forest is mature, it may be close to its saturation point in terms of capturing new carbon, and it’s more appropriate to think of it as a standing carbon stock that can either be preserved or released, like a fossil fuel). </p>
<p><strong>Permanence</strong> </p>
<p>In the mineral case, it’s relatively easy to know exactly how much carbon is stored, and for how long. You measure the mass of carbonate and can safely assume it’ll stay in that form for hundreds of thousands, if not millions of years. </p>
<p>With biological systems, though, it’s significantly more complex. We estimate the amount of carbon stored in a forest system via Allometric Equations. What’s tricky is accurately representing how this changes over time -- the forest could burn down, suffer a drought or disease, land management practices could change, the country’s regime could change and impact land management, or any number of other factors. While monitoring and measuring these changes are not impossible, it’s complex. (Ryan, Stripe)</p></div>		</li>
