By “citizen” they mean general public. Anyone with an internet connection can help with different projects. I had fun and learned a few new things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello! High school students can help us because the human brain is AMAZING. We are still trying to replicate it in computers and we haven’t got there yet. One of the things the human brain is naturally good at is pattern recognition - it’s really important to know whether that’s a tiger in the grass or just grass. So, the idea is typically that we can teach you in a very short amount of time what you need to be looking for in the data, and then we set you loose! The power of the crowd means that we can get through many datasets much faster than if we tried to do it ourselves. Also, people are also much better at spotting unusual things. We can tell a computer algorithm what to look for, but it’s hard to say “And let us know if you see anything that looks weird!”. A “citizen scientist” is just what we call members of the public who do science! Not necessarily a citizen of any particular country. We have volunteers from all over the world who participate in our projects. Check out: <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/citizenscience" target="_blank"><a href="https://science.nasa.gov/citizenscience" target="_blank">https://science.nasa.gov/citizenscience</a></a> for a list of projects! - Jessie</p></div>		</li>
