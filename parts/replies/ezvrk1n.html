			<div class="markdown"><p>OK, so do you know what happens in strain hardening? And, something that's come up in my profession more than once, how many times can you plastically bend a piece of metal and not lose strength? For example, let's say I'm working on a bridge widening, and I have rebar sticking out of the deck in phase 1 to splice with rebar in phase 2. But the bars need to be bent out of the way to maintain traffic. Then they get bent back to their original, straight, shape. Is that OK? I mean, I know it becomes less ductile with strain hardening, but overall is there a huge problem with bending rebar twice?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strain hardening is a result of dislocation movement in the material. Deformation in metals occur via dislocations, which have preferential glide planes with which they move. After straining the material, all the dislocations move, but a problem arises when dislocations intersect with each other. When this happens, it is much more difficult for the dislocations to move past each other compared to when its just moving along a perfect crystallographic plane, thus the material becomes harder to strain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the details, but strain hardening (or work hardening) makes the material less ductile and increases the probability of the material failing under load instead of yielding. Metals are  complex because you're not just dealing with the bonds between the atoms, you're dealing with non-homogenous crystalline material with a granular structure and different kinds of steel crystals moving and sliding past each other, but still holding together. Faults typically occur on the boundaries between the crystals, that's why metal fractures have that characteristic grain visible on them.</p>
<p>Bending a steel bar does cause the compressed part (inside bend) to become strain-hardened, and then bending it back does the same to the opposite side. So it is fundamentally weaker, at least if it's cold-bent. Bending it under heat may be preferable and in some cases required.</p>
<p>I couldn't say off the top of my head how many times something like rebar can be bent, but there's probably <em>very</em> strict regulations on the rebar steel alloys, how many times it can be bent, and how <em>far</em> it can be bent, and for each different rebar grade and thickness.</p>
<p>There's probably just as strict regulations on whether they can be cold bent, or if they have to be heated. But if they're heated, then they have to be allowed to cool down slowly so that the steel becomes normalized again.</p>
<p>From some quick googling, it appears that it <em>is</em> permissible to bend certain rebar qualities up to 90 degrees and then re-bend them back to straight again. I assume that's something that is taken into account in the engineering calculations and structural load margins. So fundamentally? I don't think bending rebar is a problem when it's done according to regulations so that the yield strength isn't too badly compromised.</p>
<p>When it's done against regulations, or despite them, then it can become a huge problem indeed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why wouldn't I use every resource at my disposal to better understand structural behavior? Am I going to take this person's word for it and design everything based on his response? No. Am I going to take the answer and see if I can parse some jargon to yield better search results for scholarly articles and/or research? Yes.</p>
<p>ETA: Engineers generally aren't materials scientists. It's discussed in engineering school, but on a relatively cursory level. There are more advanced classes available, but generally at the Master's level or higher. I understand that strain hardening changes the stress strain diagram and decreases ductility. My mechanics of materials book has precisely one paragraph on it. They don't get into the crystalline changes in that paragraph.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I tried to keep it simple! I could've made the distinction between ionic bonds, covalent bonds, metallic bonds, van der Waal bonds in general and hydrogen bonds in particular... but that wouldn't really be ELI5 stuff.</p>
<p>I think it's fine to say that there are bonds between atoms and molecules, and that they can be different. That's kind of sufficient grounding for an ELI5 explanation, but trying to explain this stuff with no concept of atoms, molecules, or the bonds between them would be kind of tough.</p></div>		</li>
