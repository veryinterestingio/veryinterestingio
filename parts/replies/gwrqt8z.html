			<div class="markdown"><p>With millions of readers in the country it’s still pretty impressive imo. So easy to publish a book today, to actually sell more than anyone r
Else in your category for an entire week is a feat. Even being in the top 10.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, books and movies and music these days remind me of a commercial I saw where two people are playing tennis in front of an audience and suddenly everyone runs down onto the court and starts playing. Balls are flying everywhere and it's complete chaos. The narrator says something like this is what happens when you let everyone play.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, also, it's not an award. It's not exactly disingenuous to say that a book is on a list of weekly best sellers when it <em>was</em>. There are 1,000s of books out there being published, so being a best seller amongst them is a good sign the book is hitting with at least some audience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same, but the books making that list (though there are many) are still (usual) good. It just doesn't mean much when is everyone around you is also good, then your normal in that environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uh... if you made it to the Olympics you're a world class athlete.  I often joke in my old age that I went to State in the 1600m my senior year in high school.  I came in second to last, but I beat ONE guy!  And yeah, that's kind of a &quot;participation ribbon&quot; but I was honored to compete.  And beat the one guy.  LOSER!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and writing a book that can make it in that list still makes it better than the vast majority of books that are published as a whole. But when you pluck a world class anything and surround it by other things on the same level it's less special in that environment, though it is still impressive.</p></div>		</li>
