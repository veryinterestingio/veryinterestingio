			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have any suggestions for what to look for in the online programs? I'm also interested in going in to statistics and have a background in biochemistry and microbiology. I already have an MS in micro, but I've been thinking of moving more in to the data analysis side of research and have been considering what my best options are. I know of several reputable schools with online degree options. But, the options feel overwhelming. For example, I can do an MS in statistics, applied statistics, data analytics, bioinformatics, or applied mathematics with an emphasis on statistics. Could you possibly give a little context to help someone decide what the differences are between these options and how to chose the right one for the goal in mind? Do you have any advice on how to figure out if a program is going to teach relevant skills or if it's kind of a waste of money?</p></div>		</li>
