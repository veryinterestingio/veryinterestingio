			<div class="markdown"><p>Could it hurt to vaccinate even if you've had an infection?</p>
<p>As I've understood stuff in simple terms, vaccines provide stuff that mimics the concernedd virus in order for the immune system to learn to identify and combat the infection.</p>
<p>So if you vaccinate after an infection your immune system should just handle the &quot;pseudo&quot; infection without further complications?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on the vaccine, if you’re freshly vaccinated/infected the response to another trigger can be much worse than the standard vaccine reaction of a bit sore at the injection site and mild flu like symptoms due to the immune system still being “at high alert for it.
As a child we moved countries and in the new one the vaccine schedule was a little different so less than a year after I’d had my BCG for TB I was pretty much forced to have it again. My whole arm swelled up , hot to the touch, and extremely painful for a week or so. The reaction was so severe the school doctor thought I probably had TB already because he wouldn’t listen to me or my mum when we told him I’d already had it (and the distinctive hexagonal scar to prove it).</p>
<p>EDIT: I double checked with my Mum and had it slightly wrong. it was the Heaf test with the 6 needles to see if you are reactive for the TB vaccine. Because I’d been immunised less than a year before my reaction was extremely strong so they thought I had TB. I didn’t actually get vaccinated twice. Apologies, that’s what the 40 year old memory of a 6 year old will do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theres no point. Your immune system already knows what the virus looks like because it had the real thing already and learned from it. You dont get any more immunity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>...might want to mention other things a measles infection routinely provides. Don't want people thinking, &quot;Oh, I'll just see if I get it, because getting it is just as good as getting the vaccine. Genius!&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The #1 thing a measles vaccine provides is immunity against measles, which is a serious illness with a roughly 1 in 1000 death rate and other potential complications. It also has the charming feature of occasionally hiding out in a child's brain and reappearing and slowly killing them years later. And it's incredibly contagious. So it's most certainly a disease you want to avoid!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the USA you can’t get a measles vaccine on its own. The MMR-II also protects against mumps and rubella, and you can’t get them on their own either. So most people will need the MMR unless they were exposed to all three diseases.</p></div>		</li>
