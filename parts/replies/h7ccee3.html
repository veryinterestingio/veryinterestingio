			<div class="markdown"><p>Copy-pasta from NIST (I'm not faulting that). A proper graphic is a little easier to follow. Ignore the dotted arrows (they're uncommon decays compared to the solid ones but do sometimes happen), follow the solid arrows:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Decay_chain(4n%2B2,_Uranium_series).svg" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Decay_chain(4n%2B2,_Uranium_series).svg</a></p>
<p>Alpha decay is essentially kicking a helium atom's nucleus worth of particles (2 neutrons, 2 protons) out of the parent atom, so the atomic mass (the isotope number) drops by 4, and the atomic number (what element it is) drops by two.</p>
<p>Beta decay is a neutron (atomic mass 1, no charge) converting into a proton (atomic mass 1, positive charge 1) by ejecting an electron (effectively no mass, negative charge 1). That makes the atomic number (again, what element it is) increase by 1 while the atomic mass (isotope number) stays the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on if it’s beta plus or beta minus. You obviously know how to look that up so have at it. You also forgot the most important part of beta decay which is the energy that gets expelled as gamma waves. Bad for the general public as it’s considered unmonitored exposure. I won’t nit pick about the neutrinos you forgot too. </p>
<p>PS copy paste was just easier than digging out my charts of radionuclides. I used to have to do radcon math in my head during emergencies.</p></div>		</li>
