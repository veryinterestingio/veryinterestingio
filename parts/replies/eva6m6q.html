			<div class="markdown"><p>NASA also have issues that around selecting who get's contracts,  where facilities are based and what does and doesn't get funding.</p>
<p>Space X can make these decisions based around what's efficient and cost effective for the project. Nasa tries to do that of course, but more often then not has to go with whichever option is the most politically expedient. </p>
<p>For example if the rockets are built in California, space X are likely to put their testing facility nearby. NASA on the other hand might end up  forced to build it in Detroit in order to help tackle local unemployment.</p></div>		</li>
