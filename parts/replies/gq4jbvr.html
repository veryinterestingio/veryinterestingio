			<div class="markdown"><p>When you are in your mother's womb, the umbilical cord contains blood vessels to supply you with tasty goodness, and carry away some of your waste.</p>
<p>When you are born, you can do these things yourself, and don't need the umbilical cord or its blood vessels anymore.</p>
<p>The cord is cut, and drops off, but what about the blood vessels that reached INSIDE you? They don't have anywhere to go anymore, so they collapse down and form a kind of ligament - a tough, stringy thing.</p>
<p>There are other blood vessels in other parts of your body that do something similar after you are born, mostly because your lungs are full of air instead of fluid. If these blood vessels stay open, which they do in some people, they can cause health problems down the line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wondering what kind of waste a baby sends back to the mother? Babies swallow and 'breathe' amniotic fluid in the womb, right? And they pee it back out into the womb, correct? This help prime their kidneys and what not?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. After the fetus has functioning organs do they still send the waste to the mother or do they filter it in their organs and just pee into the womb? And at that point is it basically CO2 they send back to the mother?</p></div>		</li>
