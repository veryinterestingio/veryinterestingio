			<div class="markdown"><p>Get your ass a bidet! They're cheap, easy to install, environmentally friendly (you use a lot less TP) and just plain pleasant. Your ass will thank you!</p>
<p>Plus, if you got poop anywhere else on your body would you be okay with just wiping it off with dry paper? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. Bidet gets you nice and clean. I just use enough TP to blot dry then use that warm fan dry feature on mine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This actually helps if you have the runs or are experiencing spicy poops. Just be sure to rinse clean and dry completely before applying. </p>
<p>I bought Desitin with the prep for my last colonoscopy. Literally saved my ass several times. </p></div>		</li>
