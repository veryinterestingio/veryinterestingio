			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this, chronic exposure to excess cortisol causes telomeres (the protective casing at the end of strands of DNA) to become diminished over time. As part of the normal aging process, every time a cell divides you lose a little bit of your telomere length. However, chronic exposure to heightened cortisol levels causes that process of telomere shortening to happen more quickly. When telomeres become too short, the cell will die or become pro-inflammatory. So people under chronic stress are quite literally aging faster at a cellular level.</p>
<p>There may be interesting evolutionary reasons for this. In times of great stress and social upheaval (caused by food shortages, natural disasters, warfare, and so on) it makes sense to have a population that reaches maturity faster so they can begin reproducing and ensuring the survival of the species. In such a context it makes sense for our bodies to adopt a &quot;live fast and die young&quot; approach to existence.</p>
<p>Edit: as some folks have pointed out some inaccuracies in my post (thank you) I want to clarify lest I spread misinformation.</p>
<p>1) there are many additional factors involved in the aging process, telomere shortening is just one</p>
<p>2) aging is not the same as maturity, and telomere shortening doesn't cause early maturity. Although the two are certainly correlated, early maturity/puberty caused by childhood stressors occurs as a result of different processes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be noted that the telomere attrition theory of aging has largely fallen by the wayside in the gerontology community. It's still recognized as one of the nine &quot;Hallmarks of Aging&quot; (an excellent review of all the recognized pathologies of aging: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3836174/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3836174/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3836174/</a></a> ) and it has its ardent supporters but there's a LOT of damaging effects of chronic stress and inflammation on essentially all of the hallmarks, ranging from Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), aka 'Free radical' production, to aberrant nutrient regulation and loss of balanced enzyme function.    </p>
<p>I only mention this because, while your comment is an excellent response, I still talk to a lot of lay-people who have taken up the baton of Telomeres as the sole causative agent in aging and I wanted to highjack your comment thread to address it a bit in an aging context.    </p>
<p>Why not simply make telomeres longer, for instance?    </p>
<p>A good example of the protective role of SHORT telomeres is to examine the mouse. Mice have telomeres that may be up to 100 times longer than humans. AND they have active telomerase throughout their lives, an enzyme that makes their telomeres continue to grow. They also only live a couple of years and get cancer if you so much as look at them funny. One way to think of the role of telomeres is a limitation on the number of times a cell can divide. And of course cancer NEEDS to divide to survive, making telomeres one more protective mechanism a would-be-tumor needs to overcome (usually by turning on telomerase in \~90% of metastatic cancers).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aging and maturing are different processes. Aging (as we understand it) is a collection of effects that cause a build up of damage throughout the body.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really the answer for your question but regarding NSAIDS.  long term use is quite dangerous, they damage your kidney (nephrotoxic), damage your stomach and intestines (GI ulceration), increase your blood pressure. Really not good things to be on for long periods of time.</p>
<p>Edit: other interesting fact I remember:</p>
<p>Cortico-steroids, the most powerful anti-inflammatory drugs, are actually based on the working of cortisol (hence the cortico- in their name). Cortisol has some anti-inflammatory action but this effect is enhanced in these drugs. So, these drugs don't decrease cortisol, if anything they kind of increase it by mimicing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was gonna say the same thing. The Army hands out what we call &quot;soldier candy&quot;. 800 mg Ibuprofen. Max dose is 3 per day. Short term it works great, but long term it has serious drawbacks. It fucks with your internal organs quite a bit, it can burn a hole in your stomach and/or intestines, and can do permanent damage to the kidneys.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Cause versus effect.  Sick people take more NSAIDS to treat their symptoms.  Find me a study that shows moderate (as-directed) use of Ibuprofen causes ANY problems in normal healthy people?  The point is, don't scare people away from safe medication for false reasons.</p>
<p>Yes, the internet and your physician will advise you to avoid NSAIDs if you have a history of stomach ulcers or GI bleeds.  Note the word &quot;history.&quot;  If you're in pain and don't have a history of those problems or kidney disease, take an NSAID because no study provides conclusive or overwhelming evidence that they cause kidney disease either.

			<div class="markdown"><p>The term NSAIDs stands for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, this class of drugs do not affect cortisol levels.</p>
<p>If you are asking whether pharmacological cortisol suppression could prolong life then no, I don't believe there is evidence to suggest that although would need to research to confirm if a direct study looking at this had been done.</p>
<p>Cortisol is an essential hormone and you need only look at diseases such as Addison's to see the detrimental effects of hypocortisolism. What we do know, however, is that excessive cortisol is equally as harmful. Studies have been done that look at non-pharmacological cortisol lowering techniques relating to lifestyle changes, such as stress management, and these confirm that there are vast and holistic benefits in lowering cortisol in this way. Of course, certain diseases result in excess cortisol production and in this instance you would need to see an endocrinologist for further investigations and likely be started on a suppressive drug. However, this is not something that should be done routinely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's funny you should ask. There have been several studies on NSAIDs potential for antidepressant effects. A few studies found that NSAIDs do in fact have antidepressant effects or can augment traditional antidepressants.  A recent study that's pretty exciting seems to have found a causal link, showing that ibuprofen may actually reduce mental pain by the exact same mechanism that it reduces physical pain (very weird and very cool). I think they also tested tylenol and they didnt find the same effect, but I could be mistaken there.</p>
<p>I was going to link a study for you, but I found that there were quite a few more studies on the topic than I thought, and I'm not sure which ones are good. It's only a quick google search away!</p></div>		</li>
