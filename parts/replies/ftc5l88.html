			<div class="markdown"><p>That's assuming you Even could bread it out without making some huge concession. Like tbe very nature of having a tongue which moves food around your mouth such that the less chewed gets under your teeth <strong>subconsciously</strong> likely means that theres going to be mistakes. Sure if it was fatal it could be bread out say by not having a tongue. But I think the flaw may be in the mechanism itself which is doomed to occasionally fault.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also evolution doesn't stop once 'bugs' are bred out. Maybe ancestors of humans did not bite their tongue. But they had larger jaws, possibly different mechanics of mastication due to diet, whatever. What neuron connections that worked fine then suddenly are not as adequate with a smaller jaw and different method of chewing.</p>
<p>Evolution does not only solve problems, sometimes it creates entirely new and different problems.</p>
<p>(Edit: please don't quote me as saying that ancestors didn't bite their tongue.)</p></div>		</li>
