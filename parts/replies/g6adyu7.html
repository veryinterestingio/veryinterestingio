<p>And excitement feels a LOT different than nervousness/anxiety</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because people in this thread are talking about multiple different feelings as they do every single time this comes up. They are not talking about the half second brick drop feeling, they are not talking about an adrenaline rush, they are talking about the feeling that stays around longer when you are nervous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s similar! Some people have these “butterflies” in response to things that are good and exciting. Your body can’t tell the difference between good exciting and bad exciting. It releases epinephrine to help you fight. This sends blood away from your intestine and towards more important areas. When you are stressed, stress hormones are also released into the body. All of these are pretty harsh, and can cause an upset in your stomach. </p>
<p>Basically your stomach is throwing a fit because it wants it’s blood supply back</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah same! I've had people ask me if I felt butterflies after a first date, I say no and they think that means I wasn't interested, but no I just rarely get that feeling. Also had a girl tell me she wasn't interested solely because she didn't get butterflies, which I thought was just an excuse because I personally don't get them</p></div>		</li>
