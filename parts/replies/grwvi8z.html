			<div class="markdown"><p>Very important bid why FM is better than AM. </p>
<p>Amplitude in AM gets weaker while signal get weaker aka travel father. So very soon part of &quot;information&quot; from signal can be barely distinguished from random background noise. So you get bad signal.</p>
<p>While frequency never diminishes. So you can get &quot;information&quot; from signal until signal is just strong enough above random noise level. So strong or weak signal can get you same reception quality.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It's important to note that amplitude gets weaker in both modulations; it's just that it affects the modulation that depends on amplitude.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that's what I meant by strong enough FM signal. Probably was assumption not ELI5 level there.
As I understand you can get clear FM signal until carrier signal amplitude is strong enough compared to background noise. So called signal to noise ratio. While AM will start loosing data to noise way sooner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amateurs radio operators  use SSB (single side band), essentially and AM carrier that has either the upper or lower side band suppressed with the carrier. Takes up less bandwidth and is almost as good sounding.</p>
<p>But we get out further with AM then FM by bouncing the signal off the ionosphere. Different story there. If were to use FM on some of the bands, we would run out of allocated bandwidth in some bands fast due to the size of the signal.</p>
<p>SSB: 3000Hz</p>
<p>AM: 6000Hz</p>
<p>FM: 5000-150000 Hz</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Important to note that that is not a side effect of AM as a technology, but the fact that AM radio is typically using a lower frequency that bounces off our atmosphere easier. </p>
<p>You could conceivably send FM signals using that same lower frequency.</p></div>		</li>
