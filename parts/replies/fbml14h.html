			<div class="markdown"><p>Studio Mechanic here. I‚Äôm part of an IATSE Union. The person above me nailed it. When I work a movie or tv show from a big company, pay is by the hour. Also, for the most part,we are considered employees, but it‚Äôs basically as an independent contractors, for which we receive W-2‚Äôs for tax purposes. </p>
<p>If we work a small gig, such as a commercial or low budget film, the pay could be negotiated as a daily rate - which could be much higher scale. </p>
<p>Most big business film labor is run through various IATSE unions. There are separate unions for camera, wardrobe, teamsters, grip/electric/makeup/hair/medics/sound/set teachers/construction/craft services/painting/special effects/greensmen- there‚Äôs a lot of various jobs in this one particular union </p>
<p>Other unions are SAG-AFTRA (acting), DGA (directors guild), PGA (producers guild), WGA (writers guild), etc</p>
<p>Production assistants are non-union and hourly. This is usually the starting point to most of the unions, but it is the beginning of the direct route into the DGA.</p>
<p>EDITED: added a bunch of jobs the the list, I know I missed some.</p>
<p>This is the most upvotes I‚Äôve ever had, thank you all.  Also, than you very much to whoever gilded me.  It‚Äôs going to take some time to respond to things. I can‚Äôt believe how much this exploded.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I‚Äôve always been curious - how do you find the work and stay gainfully employed enough to make a living at it?   And what is your assumed working rate for the year? (In my old world we assumed 80% of days being billed in a year was a great year. )</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to be a special person, sort of deranged, to put up with the hustle and bustle of trying to make a living in this business. I mean that in the nicest way possible. </p>
<p>I live near Chicago, which aside from Atlanta, NYC, and California is a hotspot for film/tv.  We are at a point where there is so much happening that we are short people (IATSE 476). So, living in this area helps with getting work. </p>
<p>As with any kind of ‚Äòindependent contractor‚Äô type job, it helps if people like you - but the real way to get solid work is to get in with a good crew, but also part who-you-know. </p>
<p>I look at the business almost like teaching.  Days are usually 10 hours to 12 hours, but films can be anywhere from 8 to 16. Therefore, you make a great deal of money when you do 5 days of work, which makes up for the weeks when you only get 1-3 days. We also have off months and busy seasons, just like summer break for teachers. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs a tough business, but if your lucky enough to get into a core crew, as opposed to a an extra man, for a tv show, it‚Äôs basically a full time gig - but sometimes also causes burn out.  I mean, how would it feel doing 60-75 hours a weeks for basically 2 months straight with barely a day and a half to recoup for the next week?  It can be tense at the end of the long runs.  First day of the week is usually a 5-6AM start and with turnarounds, specific time spacing for labor &amp; talent, you could be starting at 3PM on Friday, leaving the days end at 5-6AM Saturday, which kills your Saturday and leaves one day to be ready to be up at 4am on Monday again. üòë</p>
<p>OMG, y‚Äôall surprised me overnight.  Thank you for the upvotes and the gold!</p></div>		</li>

What that means is if I know I'm free to work tomorrow I'll call in by 6pm today and they will call me by 9ish tonight for the following day.</p>
<p>It's a crazy way to get through life but there's a lot of money in it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My sister is a set dresser, her hubs an art director. Between gigs they call it funemployment. Considering the pay is usually union, their unemployment checks arent bad and carry them through to the next gig. Same goes with the animation industry, though hiatuses that go beyond two months get a little brutal..</p></div>		</li>

<p>And, as usual, sound is not mentioned.... :-)</p>
<p>But definitely don't forget transpo/teamsters. And all the construction workers that built the set might've been working for months before shooting started, as did art department, props, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A blonde, a brunette and a red head all find themselves on set. Being the sluts they are, they all decide they are going to find someone and take them home with them. So they all do so, and the next day they are back on set talking about their off set experiences. The red head says, ‚ÄúI took home the director, his vision is unflinching and he leads this entire production through sheer will.‚Äù The brunette is next, ‚ÄúOh yeah, well I slept with cinematographer! He‚Äôs the visual genius who paints with light to Carothers the beautiful emotions displayed by actors!‚Äù The blonde steps up very proud of herself, ‚Äúoh yeah?!?! Well I slept with the sound mixer.‚Äù At this, the other two, burst out laughing, doubling over and confusing the blonde. Together they both asked, ‚ÄúWhy would you ever do that?!‚Äù</p>
<p>The blonde simply replied, ‚Äúwell yesterday on set everyone kept yelling, ‚ÄúFuck Sound!‚Äù.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PGA isn't a real union though, it's just a guild. They don't have a collective bargaining agreement or anything like that, pretty much all you get with them is access to the health plan (which is quite good!).</p>
<p>You can't even use the p.g.a title after your name once you join. That credit (like you see on title cards) has to be negotiated for every appearance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don‚Äôt think your distinction about them being ‚Äújust a guild‚Äù is correct. </p>
<p>WGA (writer‚Äôs guild) for instance, has collective bargaining.</p>
<p>Guild is just a fancy old fashioned term the writers, producers, AD‚Äôs and directors use in place of union, doesn‚Äôt denote anything as far I‚Äôm aware.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to add, when that agent takes their 10%, that doesn‚Äôt mean the actor only gets 90%. The check is for 110% of the actor‚Äôs fee. The production pays the fee, not the actor, which I always thought was ludicrous.  (But if I do become an actor, I‚Äôll consider that perfectly fine).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Former HR assistant here for live entertainment: lots of contracts. So many contracts. To work in this industry (whether on screen, behind the camera, on stage or behind the scenes) you need to get used to being a permanent employee sometimes and a freelancer others and having fixed-term contracts other times. For HR, it just means being really clear about how certain people are employed in certain ways.</p>
<p>At my last job, we divided everyone up between:</p>
<ul>
<li>Union permanent/full-time</li>
<li>Non-union permanent/full-time</li>
<li>Casual union (zero-hour casual employee) </li>
<li>Casual non-union (zero-hour casual employee)</li>
<li>Contractor
And did two sets of payroll documentation - one for employees, and one for contractors, which was technically accounts payable. We currently employ someone full-time to manage HR procedure and documentation for ~100 creative staff, and another part-time to deal with the &quot;who do we need to work on what days to get this done&quot; part of the problem (although this is not a HR responsibility) </li>
</ul>
<p>Renegotiating pay rates or job descriptions is awful, because even once you're done with the union, you have to update wording in all the different versions of that contract and occasionally get people who are non-union to individually agree to the change. Happy to answer more questions if this kind of stuff is your jam.</p></div>		</li>
