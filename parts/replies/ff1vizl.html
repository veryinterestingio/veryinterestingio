			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Like, I can agree that it can be unrealistic if it's used in a first person view video game, but otherwise it's just trying to mimic a camera. It also hides low framerates very well for people with lower end hardware.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The motion blur usually in games is very apparent when you turn the camera/character around. This only really shows up in cinema along with bloom, screen shake, and vignette. You wouldn't experience this in real life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is called “smooth pursuit eye movements” where the OP’s question is about “saccadic eye movements”. It’s the difference between tracking a moving object versus scanning an environment. Trying to trace a wall is interesting because you expect smooth pursuit but without a moving visual signal the eyes can’t initiate pursuit and end up performing saccadic movements instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you watch something move, that’s a different eye movement, called a smooth pursuit. Our eyes can track something moving across our field of vision. When you look at different still objects, the eye movements are caked saccades. Small, jumpy movements that focus on different areas of interest within your visual field. Your brain ignores vision while your eyes are moving, so you don’t perceive the “ whoosh” of your eyes moving around quickly</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah so this is probably what’s happening when you’re stopped at a train crossing and the difference between looking at each individual car going past (slows down/smooth) and not starting but just looking (faster/choppier)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Smooth pursuit&quot; vs. &quot;saccadic&quot; eye movements have already been mentioned, but I want to add:</p>
<p>It's not (only) that they're different labels for the two main types of motion the eyes have and that they somehow relate to one's intention (i.e. tracking a moving object vs. examining the environment), but they're also driven by different brain processes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The eyes don't send pictures to your brain if the eyes is currently moving.</p>

<p>This is obviously false. If it were true, you'd be blind the whole time you were tacking a moving object.</p></div>		</li>
