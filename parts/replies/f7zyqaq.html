			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't actually type 300wpm or whatever ridiculous characters per minute that would be. They use a different writing format that's <em>informationally equivalent</em> to 300wpm but isn't actually. Not in the sense that they could type it out on a QWERTY board.</p>
<p>IIRC the world record is only 200ish wpm for English typing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saw a video 20 or so years ago. Big, 300lb man claimed to be fastest typist. Demonstrating in a school typing class, using an old style typewriter where you had to throw the platen back by hand to move to the next line, this man proceeded to type in an absolute blur.</p>
<p>It was amazing! When he stopped after about one page, the camera zoomed into the text he’d typed. I expected to see complete gibberish and every other word mangled, but he had typed two absolutely perfect paragraphs. The audience cheered and clapped as he sat back with a wide grin on his face. It was over 200 wpm. An astounding presentation to say the least!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slight tangent; why do people use wpm as a measure? Words vary incredibly in length. When I did typing as part of &quot;IT&quot; lessons in school we were measured on &quot;correct characters per minute&quot;, not words, which seems like a better measure to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>90 is awesome, but you can use scripts to significantly improve that speed. For example, the word 'technology' is pretty common, but takes a long time to type. But you never type 'techn' by itself, so you can have a script running in the background that basically watches what you're typing, then as soon as you hit the space bar it extends your abbreviations for you automatically. Do that with a hundred common words, and your typing speed goes up like crazy. Here's what a sentence might look like typed out this way (without the script auto-filling the words as you go) -</p>
<p>Lts of older ppl in th gvt are older, so they dnt use as mch techn as the yngr genn.</p>
<p>With the script, that could say, &quot;Lots of older people in the government are older, so they don't use as much technology as the younger generation.&quot; (Older people, don't be offended, I just used long words that I've used abbreviations for frequently.)</p>
<p>It takes a bit of getting used to, but after a few weeks of practice, common words get a tiny bit faster, and longer words like technology, government, construction, and a bunch of others, get significantly faster to type. You can also use scripts to auto-correct your common mistakes, even when a regular spell check wouldn't. So if you always type 'sigificant' instead of 'significant', you don't have to remember an abbreviation for it, you just type what your fingers are used to, and the script fixes it for you.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A note for anyone wanting to do the same with transcription - check that your specific platform allows it!  Depending on how the script works, it could be effectively pasting in the word instead of effectively typing it letter-by-letter, and some transcription jobs track your individual letter typing speed to make sure nobody is trying to rip them off by using only bots.  </p>
<p>If you have a single transcription job, maybe try it out a bit first before going whole-hog, but it might not be advisable if you're doing something like Mturk where you can get many transcription tasks from different requesters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe, in the future, they will be eventually replaced by speech-to-text transcript devices &amp; applications. This way there won't be a need to waste time by typing in shorthand &amp; then converting it into full text later. Already the speech-to-text softwares are advancing to high accuracy &amp; efficiency rates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, why do we all use QWERTY keyboards, if these steno-keyboards are so much faster?  These days, surely software can automatically and immediately translate to regular English on the display? </p>
<p>How would one of these keyboards work on a touchscreen smartphone?  Perhaps it would be faster for texting?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Teaching people to use a steno keyboard (where you hit multiple keys to create a form of shorthand), is much, much, much harder than teaching a Qwerty keyboard where every English character has a key.  You don't need hundreds of words per minute for texting or posting cat videos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting!  So steno keyboards require you to press more than one (maybe more than two?) keys at a time, like chords on a piano?  That would indeed not work very well on a smartphone. </p>
<p>Still, people have invested lots of time into finding slightly faster ways to text, like Swype keyboards on smartphones.</p></div>		</li>
