			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. Using my sleep app I figured out I needed to drink earlier (stop 4 hrs before bedtime) to let my body process the alcohol. Otherwise my heart rate during sleep would be higher and I would wake more easily (cutting into deep sleep, quality of sleep, etc). Went from averaging an hour of deep sleep to 3 hours per night and it was a game changer for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s called AutoSleep and works with my smart watch. Measures heart rate, length of sleep, deep sleep (when heart rate is lowered and movement is nonexistent). Very informative and helped me pinpoint what works for me for better sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah I basically do that. I only drink once a week (usually Saturday) now. Before I had a beer a day. Switched that up months ago by using La Croix as my drink at dinner haha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I gave this a shot. Didn't sleep for three days. Almost lost my mind. Two weeks later and I haven't drank since. It was eye opening to see how dependent on booze my body was, just to sleep</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't confirm, is probably an edge case. Alcoholic for 28 years. Slept great. Didn't get hangovers. When I cut down before stopping, then I experienced what you described. Drank a handle and a half that whole time before slowing down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant. It depresses (slows, sedates) the functions of your cns (breathing, heart rate, etc). </p>
<p>Your body pumps adrenaline in an attempt to try to get you back to a state of equilibrium. When the alcohol is finally filtered out your body is still pumping that adrenaline which wakes you up and makes it hard to fall back asleep.</p></div>		</li>
