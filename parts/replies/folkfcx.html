			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this, the reason for raising military vessels is probably more about protecting classified info than anything else. Whether or not it’s a legitimate threat or not, America would think that another country raising a wrecked American military vessel would give away too much info about our military.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Please tell me why that makes it valuable? Is it just the novelty or is there a reason beyond that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, high sensitivity radiation sensing equipment, such as x-ray machines and Geiger counters need to be made of something that does not emit radiation. This is because they would not be able to tell if the radiation was coming from what they are trying to measure or from the Geiger counter itself. </p>
<p>After nuclear weapons were first used, the atmosphere now contains small amounts of radionuclides, which when blown into steel in a blast furnace, contaminate the steel.</p>
<p>This steel, made from before the first bombs were detonated, produces less radiation and can be used to create more sensitive equipment. Sunken warships are a good source because they are very large, and have pretty good paper trails.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. I think most geiger counters are made with steel from german u-boats that were underwater when the russian nuke went off.<br />
Edit: I'm a random stranger off the internet who isn't qualified to comment on this sort of thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's funny how you can express somewhat correct statement with so many tiny errors and misleading cherry picked facts. Almost making four false left turns keeps you in the right direction. </p>
<p>That being said Low-backgroud steel is a thing.</p></div>		</li>
