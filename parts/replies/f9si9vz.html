			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the reason that there is absolutely zero chance that the thylacine, or Tasmanian Tiger, is still alive. Their genetic diversity was near breaking point even before they were hunted to extinction. It is simply not possible for a viable population to have survived leaving absolutely no trace. No scat. No corpses. Nothing. They are all dead.</p></div>		</li>
