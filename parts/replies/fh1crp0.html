			<div class="markdown"><p>FYI, that &quot;bullet hole&quot; is most likely a reflection of light and not an actual hole. In roughly half a dozen photo surveys of all of the solar arrays since then, that feature has never shown back up.</p>
<p>That's not to say the solar arrays aren't riddled with thousands of holes, just that that one isn't one of them.</p>
<p>The radiators do have quite a few holes as well, but I don't have a public photo handy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Fortunately the ammonia is all outdoors and only interfaces with the crew cabin via a heat exchanger. Despite all the strikes we've seen on the radiators, none have ever punctured a flow tube.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Debris accumulation is a problem at higher altitude. Here it doesn't accumulate.</p></div>		</li>
