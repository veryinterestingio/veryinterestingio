			<div class="markdown"><p>The Universal Speed Limit (often called the speed of light) is simply how fast <em>anything</em> can happen. Light just happens to be the fastest thing we know of so we simplify it and call it the speed of light</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How to explain...</p>
<p>Electrons actually travel quite slowly through a conductor like copper but the electromagnetic waves they produce travel at the speed of light.</p>
<p>Think of electricity like water through a hose. When you turn on the tap the water takes some time to go from one end of the hose to the other.</p>
<p>But if you turn on the tap when the hose is already filled with water the water will start coming out immediately. So even though the water itself is traveling quite slowly the wave it generates through the hose is very fast.</p>
<p>When you pump electrons into the atoms of a wire it bumps other electrons down the chain causing electrons to come out the other end. This is the electromagnetic wave.</p></div>		</li>
