			<div class="markdown"><p>Polarity is pretty important in chem so I'll try to explain. So basically, atoms have a quality called electronegativity. Electronegativity is essentially the tendency of an atom to pull atoms to themselves in a covalent bond. In an ideal situation, the covalent bond is simply the &quot;sharing&quot; of electrons between atoms, but in reality, some atoms pull harder on the electrons than others. So because some atoms have the electrons closer to them, this creates what's known as a partial charge. For example, H2O has two bonds. H-O-H. O is highly electronegative so it pulls the electrons from the H's closer to it and becomes slightly negative as a result. The H's, having electrons pulled away from them, become slightly positive. Now, when H2O molecules are together, the O of one molecule, which has a negative partial charge, attracts the H's of other water molecules, which have a positive partial charge. The attraction between each water molecule is what is responsible for water's high boiling point, its surface tension, capillary action, and all that other fun stuff. So H2O's polarity is due to something called  a molecular dipole (more specifically a hydrogen bond). Other examples of intermolecular forces (the forces of attraction between molecules) include the aforementioned London dispersion forces, which pretty much occur between everything and non-hydrogen bond dipole movements.</p>
<p>A molecule is considered polar if the sum of its bond dipoles (a dipole can be visualized with arrows pointing to where the electron is being pulled) don't cancel out. IE if it is a linear or a flat molecule (planar), the arrows cancel out and the molecule is not polar. A &quot;bent&quot; molecule like water doesn't have its arrows cancel out so it is polar. </p>
<p>In chem, general solubility boils down to &quot;like dissolves like.&quot; In other words, nonpolar substances like other nonpolar substances while polar substances like other polar substances and mix well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know how water and oil don't mix? Water is polar and oil is nonpolar. Their molecules don't like each other so they stay apart. Like dissolves/attracts like. So erasers are nonpolar and graphite is nonpolar... So they like eachother and stick together when you rub the eraser all over it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Graphite really likes to stick to things, like paper. But it REALLY likes to stick to rubber. Rubber is used so that when you don't want graphite to stick to paper, you can make it stick to the rubber instead. Then the rubber rubs off and takes the graphite you don't like with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The enthusiasm is admirable, but a lot of this information is inaccurate. Firstly, London dispersion forces are extremely weak, certainly far too weak to explain how graphite coheres so strongly to the eraser and the paper. Other sources I've found say that it does so because the the graphite sheets get caught in the rough structure of the cellulose in paper. A similar process seems to occur in erasers, where the graphite gets caught on the rough surface of the eraser. </p>
<p>Also, rubber's being nonpolar is not what makes it an insulator. Other species, including graphite, are both non polar and conductive. Similarly, there are polar molecules such as water, that are not very conductive at all (water is associated with being conductive because the ions typically dissolved in any naturally found water are able to carry charge, but the water itself does not do so.) It is more accurate to say that electrons are localized in bonds within the rubber, and have little ability to move, which is what the flow of electricity is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone with Chem and ChemE degrees I very much second this, I love the enthusiasm but a lot of misinformation. It's entirely a physical process as u/LordDongler claims below, London forces and solubility have absolutely nothing to do with erasing graphite. </p>
<p>Also, as mentioned above, polarity does not correlate to conductivity. In the case of graphite it's the electron resonance that leads to conductivity, while natural latex rubber (and most classical polymers) do not possess such features, with the exception being more modern, exotics polymers (e.g. PEDOT)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seconded. As far as I know the mechanism for erasing isn't well known, but it definitely isn't london dispersion forces. Those are stupidly short ranged (drops off with distance to the 6th power iirc).</p>
<p>Similarly, the solubility discussion is nonsense in general. Ditto for polarity comments.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit 3: Thanks for the gold!! Can someone ELI5 to me what I do with it?! (Can't wait for all the unecessarily advanced explanations ??)</p>

<p>Enjoy being able to see new posts in a thread since your last visit.</p>
<p>It is the only feature I actually find useful, but I fucking miss it when I don't have it (like right now).</p>
<p>Honestly should be a default feature of reddit as it makes coming back to threads (at least in small/medium subs) much more reliable since you can immediately tell what is new.  It makes it way easier to have meaningful engagement on a topic and would probably improve reddit if everyone had access to it.</p>
<p>But I also can see that having an actually useful feature is probably key to getting people to buy gold for themselves.</p></div>		</li>
