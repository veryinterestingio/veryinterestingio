			<div class="markdown"><p>The elements are identified by the number of protons. The largest element we've found has 118, Oganesson. The chemical properties are based on the electrons. It's easy to add or remove electrons from atoms, which is how you get ions. Add an electron to a carbon atom, and it behaves almost like a nitrogen atom except it has extra negative charge (which is itself a pretty big change from the behavior of a neutral atom). So it would be relatively easy to add extra electrons to an Oganesson atom to make it have 119 electrons or more. Well, except for one problem: the heaviest elements don't exist long enough to hold onto electrons and perform chemistry. So far, the heaviest atoms (not nuclei) to have chemical properties measured is flerovium, element 114, but most of the elements meitnerium (109) and up have only been measured in very limited experiments, and Moscovium is said to be the heaviest element with a half life long enough perform chemistry experiments on.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Every element until the very end of period 7 has now been synthesized at least once and they all have formal names (rather than placeholders that only stand for the number).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So heavyness is how many protons it has? Too many will like collapse it in its own little black hole or does it just disintegrate?</p>
<p>Also, if you could stabilize everything perfectly would we be able to have elements like 334 or 12,005 or is there some other limit? If so, could these elements somehow exist out there in the universe?</p>
<p>EDIT: Protons, not electrons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The heaviest (biggest, newest) elements have only been synthesized in labs, and they all decompose and destabilize within tiny fractions of a second.</p>
<p>If we could stabilize them perfectly, and keep them around, then maybe we’d be able to keep squeezing protons and neutrons together to make new elements in the hundreds or thousands of protons...</p>
<p>But we’d be looking at such far-flung advanced technology at that point that we would make Star Trek look like cave paintings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electrons are essentially weightless compared to neutrons and protons. You can't just keep adding electrons because they repel each other (negative charge) and the positively charged nucleus can't hold them strongly enough to offset that. You can't just keep making the nucleus bigger to compensate but I don't remember enough about radioactivity to explain it.</p></div>		</li>
