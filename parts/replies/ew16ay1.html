<p>Holding Yuan is a bad investment.  If you end up with Yuan, you go to China and spend it ASAP.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. A weak currency makes your products cheaper to the rest of the world and definitely stimulates growth. That’s why US monetary policy has historically been to keep the dollar weak, so much so that the Chinese ironically complained of currency manipulation. </p>
<p>Under the trump administration, the dollar is stronger, weakening our exports. But ironically offsetting some of the stupid tariffs and making it possible to print away the massive deficit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unclear. It depends on what the Yuan is able to induce when it returns. If it's unable to spur investment and consumption, then in effect China traded away useful good and services for pieces of paper that can't do anything. But if that Yuan is parlayed into even more goods and services, then it can be a win.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So china gets potential returns on the debt they buy, and have factories built inside them with the money they sent in return. Seems like a win, win move for china if I understood everything correctly</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. The problem China has, however, is that imports are growing and demand for foreign luxury goods is growing within China.  There is a potential tipping point where a weak currency starts to work against them....  but I think we are a long, long, long way off from that....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because everything China imports such as oil, iron, cars, soybeans, etc. are now more expensive. They are producing just as much but getting less in return.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The US follows a policy of inflation targeting. The Federal Reserve assesses the economy and makes a guess at what the &quot;natural&quot; rate of inflation would be. It then pursues monetary policy to try to bring it close to 2%. If inflation would otherwise be lower, this could mean printing a lot of money. If inflation would otherwise be higher, it might mean printing much less or even &quot;destroying&quot; money. </p>
<p>Basically, monetary policy can only do one thing at a time. If you (like the US) want to use it to fix the inflation rate, you can't also fix an exchange rate. If you (like China) want to use it to fix an exchange rate, you can't also fix the inflation rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is broadly true, but remember that it is crucially not the Federal Reserve which has any hand at all in the printing of money, or the amount of money printed. The US Treasury does that, and the Federal Reserve is the organization which uses different instruments such as adjusting the interest rates of it's loans to banks in order to stimulate or cool off the economy. The independence or dependence of the different organizations involved are crucial to their functioning and history, as it has been determined in the past that allowing the executive government to directly manipulate the currency of the country can be used for short term gains or political projects with disastrous long term consequences. The validity of this statement is up to debate, but that is more or less why the Fed is <em>supposed</em> to be independent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do. All central banks do. &quot;Printing money&quot; is such a loaded term that it's become nonsensical. It's best not to use the term at all. Any time a central bank does any sort of market operation it is &quot;printing money&quot;.</p>
<p>Every time a central bank does any sort of market operation they are &quot;printing money&quot;. If a central bank purchases bonds, the amount of money in the economy increases (but the amount of bonds decreases by the same amount). </p>
<p>In the case where a central bank uses an interest rate as its policy variable and is using that to target inflation, it is also &quot;printing money&quot;. On a day to day basis, the central bank is managing the amount of reserves in the banking system ensuring that there's not to many reserves nor too few. It manages the amount of reserves by buying and selling financial assets (such as government bonds).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. One way affects exchange rate. In USA they can’t affect the exchange rate. They increase the money supply domestically to affect interest rates. Interest rates can be considered price of money in some sense. Just as exchange is also price of money, but vis-a-vid foreign currency.</p>
<p>China controls both the internal price (interest rates) and external price (exchange rate) but because of that it has to put in place strict capital controls.</p></div>		</li>
