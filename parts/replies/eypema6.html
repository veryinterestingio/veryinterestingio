			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that's from when it was taught as part of the alphabet.  So you couldn't just throw &quot;and&quot; at the end, you had to say &quot;and, per se, and&quot;.  But in every other context, it makes no sense. :-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because percent is actually of &quot;imperial&quot; (British) origins. The only reason you don't think we're using a boulder is because you're using a boulder too.</p>
<p>Also it's not such an awful boulder (divisible by 10) so it stuck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never understood why percent was written as 0/0 (%) instead of say /100. per mille being 0/00 ( <em>‰</em> ) and per basis point being 0/000 ( ‱ ) which all make sense as multiplications of percent but not actually mathematical. Instead it's just % is supposed to be short for cento but who even knows how.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know the % sign comes from the abbreviation of &quot;per centum&quot; = p/c = %.</p>
<p>For per mille there probably was just added a &quot;0&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
