<p>That is very interesting and bizarre.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same...I get to the gym and desperately need to piss, warm up for 20-30 minutes and by the time I'm starting my first working sets (I notice this more while squatting than anything else) I'm ready to blast off again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I would assume your sessions are pretty intense (or you get amped to do them)? That's basically your body anticipating a fight-or-flight situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a one hour high intensity group workout.  So, yeah, I guess I get a bit amped before going in, and my brain screams &quot;DAKOTA GOTTA GO PEE&quot;, but ... just a dribble comes out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This on top of having a child 18 months ago makes it feel like I'm never going to make it to the bathroom. I go right when I get to the gym and then immediately have to go again during warm up. It's a group fitness studio so everyone watches me run to the bathroom every.single.time. </p></div>		</li>
