			<div class="markdown"><p>This is funny, but on a serious note, I think carbonation was a discovery of bottled brew that still had active yeast and sugar to feed it. I once made carbonated water by putting a pinch of sugar in a bottle with a touch of yeast. After a few weeks it carbonated. It was gross.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You got the right idea but itâ€™s not the carbonic acid in the soda thatâ€™s directly affecting your nose itâ€™s the carbon dioxide (CO2) gas in the soda.  It dissolves in the moisture in your nose and sinus area, turning some of it into carbonic acid, which burns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure combusts is the correct term but it's been a long time since I studied Chemistry.  The reaction between CO2 and H2O is not a particularly energetic reaction and it only occurs in small quantities. Most of the CO2 dissolves without reacting.</p></div>		</li>
