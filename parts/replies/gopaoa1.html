			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice! Thank you for the reply and citations. So it seems to be that while its almost impossible to comprehensively attribute causation it is reasonable to say that frequency or intensity of such whether spikes is attributable to climate change?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best way to think about it is that climate change is changing the distributions I mentioned above, both in terms of shifting the means, but also potentially changing the shape of the tails. This implies that there are real changes in the expected frequencies of an event of a given magnitude (i.e., the recurrence interval of a given event magnitude is changing, so what was previously a &quot;100 year flood&quot; might now be a &quot;50 year flood&quot;, etc) and in turn means that there may be magnitudes of events that were exceedingly unlikely before and are becoming more likely now (though still not an everyday occurrence). So really, when we talk about attribution, we're talking about a given event being more likely because of climate change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're not used to thinking about distributions, another way to think about this is that you learn more from many somewhat extreme data points than you do from one very extreme data point.  </p>
<p>If you have a flood that you only expect once in a 1000 years and have no other information, that might have happened because of climate change or might be because you just got unlucky and happened to be the worst year in a millennium.  But if you start getting 100-year floods every 5 years for a couple decades and one of those is a 1000-year flood, that's strong evidence that the distribution has changed and that the 1000-year flood isn't purely bad luck but because climate change has made such floods more likely.  But you can't understand this just by looking at the one flood, you have to look at more data even if it's less extreme data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is part of the problem then saying &quot;well we can imagine what a 1000 year flood may look like. We have never seen anything like that, but our records only go back 100 years. Could this 1000 year flood not only be becoming a 500 year flood, buy may have happened with or without humans&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like loading a die to only slightly alter it. In any particular throw, any value can come up. Did this 4 come up because it was loaded, or would it have been a 4 anyway?</p>
<p>You can also look at it like, well, this die is only slightly altered even if it loaded, so it's not a big deal. But I guarantee you that if the goal is to keep the casino in business, it's a huge deal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are heavy tailed based on many observations. Geophysical variables are usually not Gaussian because of coupled, multi-scale nonlinear dynamics of the variables.

			<div class="markdown"><p>We expect it (for the future) because that's what we have observed in the past!</p>
<p>As for why, it's because of the properties of the climate system (feedbacks etc), but ultimately what matters in practice is whether the phenomenon ends up heavy tailed</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm both pleased and surprised to see such a reasonable response when it comes to any question involving climate change.  What a relief.  I fully expected it to be an &quot;absolutely, yes!&quot; Answer as it seems everything bad is tied to climate change or on the other hand climate change isnt real.  It's so tiring but your response was well reasoned and thought out.</p></div>		</li>
