			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. That is being done currently in some labs/ projects. That is an intensive project though.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would assume so. I’d guess it just involves constantly trying to identify member(s) of a microbe population with the ability to break down longer chains? Which would take some time since you would have to watch the process for a while before gleaning that some small percentage of the population has that ability. And then how you isolate and grow that particular subset, I can’t even imagine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The catch-22 is that having a way to break down these materials defeats the properties that make them good containers. If some species evolved the ability to eat plastic, containers made of that plastic wouldn’t last long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They would probably still last plenty long though. PLA is a biodegradable plastic, but it won't degrade unless under the right conditions. As long as it remains clean and dry most of the time, it'll remain usable for a very long time.
Consider it like containers made of wood, but more robust.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Breaking down plastics is like trying to eat a whole watermelon with just your mouth - it’s too big to bite into smaller pieces with your front teeth (enzymes won’t work because they aren’t big enough to latch-on), and you can’t fit it into your mouth to suck on or swallow whole (you can’t engulf it).</p></div>		</li>
