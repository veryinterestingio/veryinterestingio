			<div class="markdown"><p>The largest horses become prone to leg and hoof issues from holding up all that weight, which begins to impose a limit on how large they can get before they're no longer practically useful (or really ethical) to produce.</p>
<p>Also, while riding horses are still fairly common, there's far less use for and desire for large draft horses anymore. What draft horse breeding is left is mainly intended for show, so they're breeding for traits like being pretty and fitting within the established breed characteristics for tradition and history. </p>
<p>Back in the day, there would have been incentive for breeders to produce the biggest, strongest draft horses possible ... but today, such a horse would only really be useful as an oddity at fairs and shows to be ogled and perhaps to have the notoriety of breaking a record. Not really worth the immense cost of breeding and caring for such large horses for most people. Nor is it really worth the risk of breeding animals that might have short, painful lives because their legs and hooves struggle to support their weight.</p>
<p>(Even back in the day, it would often be more practical to have a team of smaller horses rather than one gigantic one. They'll be easier to feed, house, and care for. They'll be easier to replace if necessary. They'll be able to use standard-sized harness, shoes, and other gear, rather than needing custom-made items of everything.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Silly considerations like practicality and ethics have never stopped dog breeders though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Breeding dogs is relatively inexpensive due to their small size and short lifespan.</p>
<p>Try that with huge horses. Similarly, there are thousands of variants of your common roses or other plants, but not many variants of trees that take decades to grow and mature. You also don't see anyone breeding whales, elephants or rhinos, but there are plenty of breeds of various fish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, you gotta think too that horses aren’t as prevalent or as necessary now as they were in the 1800’s. So I’m sure there probably aren’t as many being bred and certainly not as many for work as I’m sure that monster was.</p></div>		</li>

<p>According to the Guinness World Records 2013 edition, Big Jake is the tallest living horse. This Belgian gelding weighs 2,600 pounds and stands just shy of 6 feet 11 inches tall</p>

<p>More than a metric ton of bone and muscle. Hard to imagine there was something even larger back in the 1800's.</p></div>		</li>
