			<div class="markdown"><p>Head size is one popular explanation, though bipedalism is another. Our hips changed shape to accommodate bipedalism, possibly at the expense of childbirth. Other primates can stand on two legs, but our hips can maintain standing and walking positions for much longer without strain. But that same change in shape may have made it harder for babies’ skulls to pass through the pelvic bone. Admittedly, I’m not an anthropologist, so I don’t know if this problem would still occur if our baby heads weren’t so big.</p></div>		</li>
