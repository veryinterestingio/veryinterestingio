			<div class="markdown"><p>The springs and groundwater are also fed by rain in the mountains and elsewhere in the watershed.  For example, the US state of Florida has numerous freshwater springs feeding its swamps and rivers, but the water in the springs ultimately comes from the Appalachian mountains in Georgia and the Carolinas, flowing through underground aquifers until it comes to the surface in Florida.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that Florida's springs are fed from water that far away. According to this (admittedly not a new source), Florida has its own aquifers.  </p>
<p>&quot;Contrary to popular belief, underground rivers do not bring water into Florida from other states. Instead, rainwater replenishes the aquifers which in turn supply the springs with water. &quot;<br />

<p>Actually a little more than a third of the land area of the 48 states lies in the Mississippi basin. But your heart is in the right place. :-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mountains also help the water to condense. When the clouds travel up the mountains the water in them condenses when the temperature drops. This is why there's more rain in one side of the mountains than the other side. This way there's more water up the mountains to fall down.</p></div>		</li>
