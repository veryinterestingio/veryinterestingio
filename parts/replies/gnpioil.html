			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this.</p>
<p>Most languages below the interpreted level go through a process called bootstrapping.</p>
<p>So what this means is that when you were creating the C language, you don’t write all the tools to create C using assembly. You create a very basic set of C tools in assembly, then create the rest of the more complex tools with these new basic C tools, and maybe augment them with assembly if your previous tools don’t fully cover them. In most cases this tool would become the compiler </p>
<p>Reason for this is because it is generally much quicker to implement something at a higher level from programmers, and it is also easier for future users to maintain/extend it. You can now be a C programmer to improve on the C compiler with no knowledge of assembly.</p>
<p>So if you go online to search, the compiler for C# is written in C#, the compiler for Java is written in Java, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And your intuition about there being prior languages was spot on.  Its just not Java all the way down.   Its...</p>
<p>Transistors &gt; binary &gt; assembly &gt; c &gt; c++ / c#, Java</p>
<p>Not the exact hierarchy but you get the idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please note, &quot;CrashCourse&quot; on youtube has an EXCELLENT series covering the development of computers and programming languages.</p>
<p>Great commentary, history, and animation - takes you from the earliest computers to know how on modern day languages. Very nice series.</p>
