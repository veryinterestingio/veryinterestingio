			<div class="markdown"><p>You might find it interesting to know that when I worked at the Air Force Weather Agency in the early 2000s, one of the forecasts we did was whether or not contrails would form...useful information for mission planners who don't want their aircraft to be seen from far away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, sometimes you'll see contrails that start and stop and start and stop like Morse code, and that's when a plane is flying along the boundary between moist and dry air; the boundary isn't perfectly flat and has waves like the ocean, so as the plane flies through the waves the contrails appear and disappear.  The atmospheric waves are invisible but you can sometimes see them by the <a href="http://www.antarctica.gov.au/__data/assets/image/0004/161581/varieties/antarctic.jpg" target="_blank">effect they have on clouds</a>.  Where the clouds are, the air is moist and water can condense as droplets or ice crystals.  Where the clouds aren't, the air is dry and water droplets or ice crystals evaporate/sublime back to invisible water vapour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and under certain conditions, when the air is supersaturated with moisture, the additional water and disturbance can start a &quot;chain reaction&quot;, causing the contrail to expand into cloud over quite a large area.</p>
<p>Antoine St.-Exupery describes this in &quot;Flight to Arras&quot;.  That was published in 1943, so for those who think of contrails as a conspiracy, it's been one for a loooong time without any noticeable results.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. I have wondered that for 30 years, since the first day of 1st grade when I was out on the playground watching airplanes cross over my head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's the engine exhaust. Hydrocarbon combustion produces water as one of it's two main products. Propeller aircraft can still produce contrails because they are still burning fuel. If it was the disturbance of the air, it wouldn't be centered around the engines like it is. Behind the engines is a high pressure area, which is the opposite of what you need to force moisture out of the air. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually both - engines produce most contrail patterns (exhaust contrails) we see, but sometimes the wingtips, wings and even body produce them too (<a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/2008JAS2768.1" target="_blank">Aerodynamic Contrails</a>), especially at lower altitudes.</p>
