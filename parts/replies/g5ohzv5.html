			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah Venus is literally the planet where a significant percentage of probes <em>did not even make it to the ground</em> still functional. Venera 4 ran out of power trying to make it through the atmosphere; Venera 5 &amp; 6 were crushed by the atmosphere 60,000 ft above the surface.</p>
<p>It's not just that the environmental molecules are difficult; they are, but not really to the extent that life is unimaginable. But the overwhelming pressure and heat are... significant impediments to the survival of most life as we understand it, let alone its development.</p></div>		</li>
