			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, no, they do not work by affecting adenosine receptors. Adenosine causes a slowdown in neural activity, and caffeine interferes with that effect. Methylphenidate, on the other hand, increases neural activity more directly. It does this by causing certain neurotransmitters (dopamine and norepinephrine) to stick around longer than usual before being broken down, in a process called &quot;reuptake inhibition&quot;. Since those neurotransmitters stay around longer, they stimulate neighboring neurons more heavily.</p>
<p>Amphetamine does something similar, but also causes the actual release of neurotransmitters in the first place in addition to preventing them from being broken down.</p>
<p>I'm not clear on how nicotine works, but it seems like it indirectly causes the release of dopamine, among other things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes the same applies for nicotine and methylphenidate. The dopamine system is more robust than any other system afaik. So it takes much more over a much longer period of time before having any significant change in receptors. The similar is also true in reverse. Messing too much about the dopamine system may result in mania/psychosis that lasts 1-2 months due to how robust the system is. So do please treat these medications with some seriousness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the adenosine is a byproduct of the brain metabolism.</p>
<p>It increases the receptors because there's no signal from the ones it has.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer, combined with the other answer distinguishing A1 and A2 receptors. The chemicals adenosine and caffeine work on the 2 receptors in different ways. The math is the same for both receptors, which involve differential equations for the relative concentrations of both, but the roles on the 2 receptors are reversed. This naturally makes the receptors activate at different concentrations of each. Eventually, the nervous system will adjust their activity if you maintain the same caffeine:adenosine concentration levels.</p>
