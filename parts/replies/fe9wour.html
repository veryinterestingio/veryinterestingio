			<div class="markdown"><p>basically this...the human eye has an incredible dynamic range compared to cameras (even nice ones) - what this means is the eye-brain system is capable of interpreting a wide range of brightness, which is how we can see a black sky (or in a light-polluted city, the deep red of the light pollution), and all the white-grey shades in the moon at the same time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>idk i think i tried taking a picture of the moon in pro mode with a quick exposure and it still looked bad.</p>
<p>Yes exposure contributes, but I think it's not the main issue (by far) of taking a picture of the moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>'Exposure' in photography terms means a lot more than the exposure time. It means aperture setting and ISO (gain) as well. The thing about cameras is that they have a single dynamic range per photo based on the settings applied. The moon has a wide range of albedo; some portions are relatively dark while some reflect the sunlight strongly, which is why they appear so bright white. The result is a very wide range of brightness that are a big challenge to capture in a photograph as well as the eye can make sense of it all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Take photos of the moon using the same settings as you'd use for an object in direct sunlight... because the moon is in direct sunlight even though it's night.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. Most smartphones don't have a 'minimum' brightness on their standard photo apps to shoot something as relatively bright as the moon (if you shot it during the day, you'd be ok).</p>
<p>Here's an example of two smartphones taking photos of the moon - one shot each with the default app at minimum brightness, and one shot each with a third-party app that allows you more flexibility and control over your photos:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For very little money (the one in that blog is a $5 app), you can get an app for virtually any current phone that will have almost any control you could want of the phone's camera. Just do your research on what they offer and what you actually want. There are many many apps for ios and android and I couldn't tell you which ones are superior.</p></div>		</li>
