			<div class="markdown"><p>Most importantly, the sensation of temperature is actually the sensation of changing temperature. That is why metal and leather at the same temperature feel like they are different. The human body is only able to detect the change of its own temperature. Outside your brain filters most of that shit out, but inside it doesn’t have much to filter so it “forgets” to filter. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's because the metal conducts the heat, while leather doesn't. If you grab a 10°C piece of metal it will suck the heat from your body. The leather will feel nice quickly because its surface will reach your body temperature quickly.<br />
Bottom line, you still feel the temperature, not the temperature change. Because a big chunk of metal won't change it's temp, but will stay cold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, the sensation you feel is the change in the temperature of your skin. A subtle but important difference. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not what they're saying. You feel the temperature change of your own body, not of the object necessarily. Think about it: can the human body measure absolute temperature of another object? Not really. Of itself? Not really. But it can definitely sense a change in its own temperature (at the skin and what not).</p>
<p>A big chunk of metal will keep cooling your hand down so it will continue to feel super cold. Then once your hand is at, say, 45°, and you touch something that is also 45°, it won't feel cold nor warm. Try it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for that. Never thought of sensing temperature in that way. Like the constant movement of our eyes so we can see. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fundamental premise is wrong. He justifies thats why the metal feels colder. When really its conductivity. But also relating to the question that doesn't answer it. Because temperatures are always changing outside and it doesn't feel like it. Which I for the most part assume is because activity makes your temperature more stable.</p></div>		</li>
