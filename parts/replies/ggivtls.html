			<div class="markdown"><p>Covid transmission is mostly through droplets in the air. The droplets come from the breath of an infected individual. They can hang in the air for several hours before falling to the ground/shelving/etc. </p>
<p>If an immune person touches something that has Covid on it then touches something else, they can transfer the virus to the second object. If a previously uninfected person touches the newly contaminated object, then touches their face, they could potentially become infected. That’s not as likely though as becoming infected by breathing droplets from an infected person. </p>
<p>Part of the reduced risk of infection via contaminated object is viral load. Basically, the more virus that you’re exposed to, the more likely it is that it can overwhelm your immune system and cause infection. Touching a contaminated object then touching your face is going to expose you to fewer virus particles than if you breath in the droplets. </p>
<p>So while it is possible that an immune person could inadvertently spread the virus by physically touching things, it’s not as risky as an asymptotic person being out and about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But an &quot;immune&quot; person is one who, when exposed to the virus, has enough/the right antibodies to fight off the virus, right? So during the time that their body is fighting it off, could they produce droplets that could infect others?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wait, this is the first time I've heard of Covid sticking around in the air for hours. Is this true? It floats around in the microscopic amounts of humidity in the air? Like a miasma?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For normal breath its not hours, its seconds, or minutes in the right conditions.</p>
<p>It can become truly airborne under specific scenarios like with intubation, chest compressions, and potentially things like singing.  Nothing I have seen suggests that it is primarily fully aerosolized like measles.</p></div>		</li>
