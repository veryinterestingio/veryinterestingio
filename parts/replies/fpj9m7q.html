			<div class="markdown"><p>One doctor I saw years ago said that in a pinch if you felt a migraine coming to drink caffeine. The dialation you spoke of is countered by the constriction that caffeine causes. At least thats how it was explained to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One risk there is that some headaches, not sure if they are also migraines or just hurt like the start of a migraine, are caused by overly-constricted blood vessels and if it’s one of those then caffeine will make the pain worse.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I occasionally get migraines, a couple a year usually, and have experienced just the one aura migraine where there was no pain, it was probably the absolute worst migraine I've ever had.</p>
<p>Because of the lack of pain I didn't put the symptoms together until much later than I usually would. Thankfully I was at home because by the time I crawled into bed in a blacked out room I probably seemed like I was absolutely wasted, my balance was destroyed, I could barely look at things let alone see clearly, I got nauseous just turning my head. I still had symptoms the next morning, though not nearly as bad, and was talking to my mother on the phone when I described it and she pointed out that it sounded like a migraine, I had never even heard of one without the pain before that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've only had it 2 times over the last 2 years as I can remember.
1st time I lost my vision in a little circle in the absolute middle of my vision. Couldn't read the first letter on the licence plate of the car driving in front of me no matter my effort. Second time I couldn't really see what was in my top right field of view. It was like when you stand up to quickly a vs your vision almost blacks out, except it wasn't that bad, and only in my top right vision.
A bit hard to tell exactly, as when I moved my vision to the right to &quot;see&quot; what I couldn't see, it just moved further to the right. But I didn't trust myself to drive any car while it was happening. Lasted maybe 1 hour and a half.
I've doubted that these actually are migraine auras, but I took tests for 1,5 hours at the eye doctor and he found nothing wrong, so that's what he gave me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I only think I've gotten a migraine once. At least I think it was a migraine. after about an hour, give or take, I puked. The pain was so bad, I actually vomited. And already immediately after I puked, the headache was gone.</p>
<p>So, uh, any insight as to what that was about? Is that common with migraines? Why does it make you puke, and why does puking make it better? It was so bizarre. It was like I threw up chunks of pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The beginning of my migraines and my parents migraines when they were kids was the exact same.  Pain gets so bad you finally puke then bam you feel so much better.  Now that its many years later I never throw up.  That really only lasted a few years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weird.</p>
<p>My nausea would last a couple hours.  I'd end up dry heaving into the toilet until my entire midsection hurt like hell.  On several occasions I just kept dry heaving until I passed out from exhaustion.  Not sure if it was passing out or just fell asleep or some weird combination.
I have no idea what you did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it wasn't a migraine. I never get migraines other than that one time. It might have been longer than an hour. It was a while ago. I just know I ahf never experienced anything like that before. I figured vomiting from pain meant it was a migraine.</p>
<p>Well, that and any light exposure made everything way worse. I didn't even want to lay down. I just sat on my couch, head in hand. Waiting for it to go away or lighten up, which it didn't at all until I puked.</p></div>		</li>
