<p>I do think law school is a joke and apprenticeship would be a better system - but you can't have a self-taught lawyer. Anyone can read statues and adminstrative code. There's a lot more to it than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's called &quot;reading law,&quot; and it's allowed in four states (plus CA, VT, and WA). It's how Jefferson and Lincoln became lawyers. NY and Maine both allow students with some law school but no degree to finish their training by this. If you ever heard an attorney in a movie say something like, &quot;I may be just a simple country lawyer...&quot; that character may be telling you that they read for their license.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shoutout for my fellow non-librarians in the field! People often think I'm an archivist or librarian. I am but a humble library technician, but I can still whip out my Google-fu to help find pretty much any document, I just don't have to worry about management of the whole library, I am 100% focused on reference for my users and preparing the actual documents for lending.</p></div>		</li>
