			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually pretty cool how many questions humans have that are fundamental problems in physics that we have been working on a long time. </p>
<p>Humans naturally wonder about these things. And many laypeople think us physicists have solved them. But innocuously simple questions like &quot;what is time, really?&quot; are deceptively difficult.</p>
<p>(The best answer I have for &quot;what is time?&quot; is: the direction of increasing entropy in an isolated system and a component of a four-dimensional lorentzian manifold)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Along those lines, &quot;What is gravity?&quot; is another of my favorites.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought that the Michelson-Morley Experiment is quite weird and not setup to prove the existence for an aether - the light they measured already interacted with our atmosphere which moves in the same system as the experiment. </p>
<p>Even if we‘d shoot the experiment into space and a nearly perfect vacuum - the light has to interact with the measurement device in some way, no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not quite sure I understood your comment correctly. But the atmosphere can be ignored in the MME. Aether needs to be omnipresent to work as a medium for light. </p>
<p>You can assume that the <em>aether</em> also moves along with the Earth (or any moving experimental platform), a hypothesis called &quot;Aether drag&quot;. It creates a whole new set of problems though, and, more importantly, is inconsistent with other experiments (most notably with stellar aberration). The MME did not single-handedly disprove the idea of Aether, there were attempts to explain the null-result and other experiments to disprove those new explanations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the idea was that since the atmosphere was constant in all directions, the only thing that would change the speed of light would be earth’s motion relative to the aether (the big assumption, like the comment above says, is that Earth is moving relative to the aether)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The interaction with our atmosphere is very weak. The speed of light through a moving medium can be found with the formula for Fresnel Drag: c'=c/n+v(1-1/n^(2)), where n is the index of refraction of the medium and v is the speed of the medium. Since the index of refraction of air is very close to one (n~=1.003), this doesn't affect the Michelson-Morley experiment much.</p></div>		</li>
