			<div class="markdown"><p>I love evidence as much as the next guy but this study of 19 patients receiving higher doses than are typically used in local anesthetic, variable dosing regimes within each drug treatment group, and variable dosing regimes between the two drugs, published in a low impact dental pain journal might not be the best reflector of current practice rational.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agreed that we need to dissect every study; however, I think you missing the point. The current practice is based on clinical studies that support it. There are various studies on R.E.C.K along with animals studies comparing the epi and norepi. The comments are all hypothesis based on what we know about the mechanism of the drug. However, they are just hypothesis until it's proven in clinical studies.
As for the study I listed, I don't think the dose is high for dental procedure. It's true that normal dose of epi is 1:100,000 or 1:200,000. However, for dental procedure with pronounced hemostasis, epi 1:50,000 is appropriate.  So is variable dosing. It is dental study so it's appropriate to published in the dental journals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bigger point I was making is a study of 19 patients will not be rigorous enough even with every other variable tightly controlled to demonstrate a meaningful difference. They also do not describe the significance of their findings statistically which isn’t surprising since it would be difficult to have a significant difference with such a low n coupled with a medication with a low rate of clinically significant side effects. They say “suggests” which in this context doesn’t meant very much.</p>
<p>I do appreciate you making the point regarding the leap from classroom physiology and actual clinical practice/clinical studies. I practice in an area where lidocaine with epi is used extensively, and where the clinical effects are very apparent (ie the huge volume of local with epi injected under the skin of a toddler’s entire back prior to harvesting skin for grafting). Even with an understanding of the pharmacology and physiology the actual effects on the patient in front of you can always vary widely.</p></div>		</li>
