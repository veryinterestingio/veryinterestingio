<p>lower pressure lowers the boiling point, which is why high altitude cooking directions exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really doubt there is any effective change in pressure. Conservation of heat via (lack of) evaporation though is a big thing. You answer is basically correct but I doubt pressure is the driver. I would love for someone smarter than me to do the math on this one and show how much pressure a 2 kilo (the heaviest one I could find in my kitchen) lid can generate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a subtle change in pressure, which (as reminded) raises the boiling point, which allows the water to be hotter. The lid the is trapping even more heat. Cycle in my head and my confused answer.</p>
<p>On your typical stovetop pot, in my experience, there’s a limit, and the pressure will make the lid move, releasing some pressure. Depending on the lid, I’d suspect the temperature to be able to rise just a few degrees.</p>
<p>In a pressure cooker, there’s a likely 15PSI difference, and the water can heat to around 250F degrees. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually ended up doing the math and on my dutch oven with a cast iron lid (heaviest lid.in my house) it only raises the psi (if I did it correctly) by .05 psi. I haven't found a decent calculator to translate that to a temp change in the boiling point but I stand by my previous statement that it is negligible at best and that the conservation of heat (mainly through lack of evaporation) is the biggest contributor. Not to mention that every time the lid &quot;burps&quot; you'll lose that pressure increase.</p></div>		</li>
