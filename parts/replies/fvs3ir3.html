			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall hearing about a neat system, I believe in Iceland. If you murdered someone, you were exiled. <em>But</em>, if you chose to stay in Iceland, you could become a free man again if you killed 3 other murderers. It's a neat self-governing system. It's clearly in your best interest to leave, as otherwise you'd have every other murderer on the island trying to kill you to regain their freedom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty interesting. How did they confirm whether the 3 people were actually murderers or not?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They didn't. There was no such thing in Iceland. Source: National Museum of Iceland in Reykjavik has a presentation on crime and murder in Iceland. Because Iceland is such a tightly knit community of interrelated families, murder was just not a thing there - extremely rare. Even today, there are under 5 homicides in the entire country a year. Back then? There weren't three murders alive in the entire country in the same year, and less than one person was executed per year until the last execution in 1830.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Law enforcement&quot;. It's important to remember that this didn't really exist throughout most history. Specifically in the case of Iceland, where the settlers were mostly political refugees of the unification of Norway by Harald Fairhair, there really weren't that many people. The &quot;local authorities&quot; were goði, that were kinda... lawyers, regional congressmen, judges and military and religious leaders.</p>
<p>It's a funky system, mostly coming down to the division of Iceland into &quot;things&quot; that came together in the Althing to debate legislation. That's how Iceland eventually (in the 1300's) became christian, through consensus, and that's how they operated even under Norwegian rule, as it was simply too far away to safely rule.</p>
<p>But yeah the thing with the 3 murders thing is that, like most things, it was a bit more complicated. Like, people had a blood price, Iceland had a very robust legal system dealing with the &quot;price&quot; of a person that should be paid as reparations. There was also the solving of legal disputes through holmganga (single combat), but the most common sentence was outlawery. If you were outlawed, you basically had no rights and could be killed on sight if you were on the island.</p>
<p>It was a fascinating self-governing experiment.</p></div>		</li>
