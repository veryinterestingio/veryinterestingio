			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a review special issue on this (see second half of page) in <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/13652435/2020/34/2" target="_blank"><em>Functional Ecology</em></a> recently. However, in practice I haven't noticed this coming up much in the papers I read, department seminars, etc. -- it could be huge but just not in my particular scientific neighborhood. In contrast, I have seen a ton of interest in microbiomes: in roots, in leaves, on skin, in guts, etc. Not really related to epigenetics, of course, except that these are both mechanisms where there can be inheritance that's not based on DNA sequences alone in the host nucleus. Sometimes interest is driven by how easy it is to get data -- my impression is it's easier to get a microbiome (oversimplifying, but sequence a lot of 16S and blast it) than to figure out what epigenetic mechanisms are, so this could be driving some of this in my little corner of science. This is a case where Matt Might's <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/" target="_blank">guide to a PhD</a> is a useful perspective -- your mileage may vary in other areas of biology.</p></div>		</li>
