			<div class="markdown"><p>Out of curiosity; might be a dumb question, but when you stutter, can you cancel the word or do you have to Finnish it when you've started it? If yes, do you stutter if you say a synonym instead for the word? (or any other word?)</p>
<p>Sorry for my phrasing if this sounds rubbish, 2nd language :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I stutter, I get &quot;stuck&quot; on the word and cannot continue talking until that word comes out; its almost like a lock in my brain. I can think of what I'm trying to say, and I can picture the word in my head but it just....doesn't come out. It's frustrating and embarrassing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All the posts here are entirely accurate but the one above explains it very well.</p>
<p>I have a similar vocal disorder (spasmodic dysphonia), which I and my therapist think <em>might</em> be related to stuttering. There's just not enough research. Some days are just better than others, no pattern. Only time I consistently speak normally is while drunk or swearing, not really conducive to daily life. Embrace it, everyone has to repeat themselves sometimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting. It seems like I read Sam L Jackson started swearing so much because he had a stutter and he could avoid it by dropping an F bomb here or there. I wonder what it is about swearing that doesn't trigger the stutter?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To me it would seem that the stutter is caused by some deep-rooted anxiety, hence &quot;letting go&quot; and using expletives would alleviate that anxiousness, but I am just some dude making guesses and I would assume someone who knows more would have figured that out by now were it the case.</p>
<p>Super interesting. I am curious to know what the cause may be, and I hope we can figure it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stuttering has forced me to have a strong vocabulary. I can normally feel a word coming up in a sentence is going to trip me up so I'll do some mental gymnastics searching for a synonym that I know won't make me stutter. Words that begin with soft vowels are often tough to get out.</p></div>		</li>
