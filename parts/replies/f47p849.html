			<div class="markdown"><p>The consequences you bring up are non-existent for admitting to suicidal ideation. </p>
<p>The only time hospitalization is deemed necessary is when the patient is an imminent threat of harm to either themselves, or someone else. </p>
<p>Ideation and threat of harm are distinct. Mental health professionals are trained to identify the differences. </p>
<p>The only thing that'll happen if you admit to suicidal ideation is that the person you're seeing suggest more care, and a safety plan for if the ideation ever becomes a compulsion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if the practice of asking a control question could help in such a scenario. When asking sensitive questions you could have the sensitive question and an inoccuous one written on the same paper.</p>
<p>So for example </p>
<p>A. Is blue your favorite color ?
B. Do you have thoughts of ending your life ? </p>
<p>Then you ask them to answer yes or no to whatever question they want.</p>
<p>Through statistics you could figure out what percentage answered the suicide question and people wouldn't have to fear any repercussions.</p></div>		</li>
