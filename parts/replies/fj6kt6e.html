			<div class="markdown"><p>Also true, most things it isn't an issue, but there are a few that could be. Plus, you are just taking time away from pushing blood. It is not an instant effect when you begin that perfusion pressures in the vessels goes all the way up to needed. Had a patient code shortly after a cabg procedure and cpr was started until we could reopen the chest. Thankfully the surgeon was still in house and was back in the OR with us in less than 10 minutes. My point here is this: I had special lines in this person that let me see things like arterial pressures and right ventricle pressures. It took almost 30 seconds of initial CPR to build up pressure that would actually perfuse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This.  </p>
<p>Rescue breaths aren't advised unless you have a second person to switch off with. (and even then it's better to keep them in reserve for when you tire of compressions)  </p>
<p>Pump.  </p>
<p>Don't stop pumping.  </p>
<p>Bloodflow is critical.  </p>
<p>Breaths are not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. When people try to argue this point I simply say that it doesn't matter if you breathe for them or not. They are already dead. Breathing and no blood flow? Still tissues dying of lack of oxygen.</p></div>		</li>
