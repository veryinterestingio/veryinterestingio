			<div class="markdown"><p>A headwind - for the virus, or for us?</p>
<p>Sorry I was not clear enough. What I mean is, do these responses actually help against the virus, or are they a consequence of the struggle?</p>
<p>If they help then treating the symptoms would actually also help the virus last longer.</p>
<p>If its just a result of the struggle, then treating the symptoms would not be a problem.</p></div>		</li>
