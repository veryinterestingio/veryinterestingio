			<div class="markdown"><p>Spin-orbit resonances are a type of tidal locking. I interpreted the question to mean 1:1 tidal locking.</p>
<p>A brief read of Mercury's wikipedia reveals that Mercury's orbit is highly eccentric compared to other planets, so it slows down when its high in its orbit and speeds up when its low in it. To get a 1:1 tidal lock (i.e. same hemisphere towards the sun at all times) in an eccentric orbit like that, you'd need to spin at a non-constant speed or else you'd still experience tidal forces. I'm guessing that the 3:2 resonance minimizes the forces in that particular eccentric orbit better than 1:1 does, but citation needed on that. It might just be a semi-stable state on Mercury's path to a 1:1 tidal lock.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Other way around really. Tidal locking is a type of resonance. Calling Mercury tidally locked is simply confusing and not good practice. Saying it is locked into a resonance is more suitable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well then the question there is if tidal locking effects can hammer out orbital eccentricity.</p>
<p>Which, given that energy is dissipated in tidal processes, is necessarily a &quot;yes&quot;.  In the very longest time case, Mercury could just flatten out its orbit, and end up in a nice 1:1 tidal lock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mercury's 3:2 spin-orbit resonance is not a tidal effect, but rather because the planet has unequal principal moments of inertia. I.e., it isn't a perfect sphere. If you exaggerate its asymmetry and imagine the planet to be cigar-shaped, then at closest approach to the Sun (its orbit is quite eccentric), the cigar axis wants to point toward the Sun or it will experience a gravitational torque. Any half-integer relationship between spin and orbit rates would work.</p>
<p>Layered on top of this 3:2 resonance you have tidal torque trying to drive toward 1:1 locking, like the Moon. However the resonance is stable enough to prevent further de-spin. So unless something dramatic happens (a huge asteroid collision, say) Mercury will stay in this 3:2 resonance indefinitely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its current resonance is very stable, so it would likely take a large perturbation to change it. Even in that case, it isn't particularly likely to evolve to a 1:1 resonance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did say it wouldn't wind up in the lagrange points. I was saying that OPs suggestion that everything become tidally locked would result in the moon orbiting at a lagrange point, which is unstable, and therefore wouldn't happen. </p>
<p>Yeah 3 body systems are fundamentally chaotic, but that just means they're unpredictable from initial conditions, not that they never result in anything resembling order.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure the motion of 3 body systems are non-repeating except in a small number of special cases. Combined with the inability to predict the orbits from initial conditions, I thought this meant we only know what's going to happen for a few million years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The three body problem is fundamentally not solvable analytically, which is not the same as fundamentally unstable or &quot;fundamentally chaotic&quot;. Stable solutions exist, for instance all three bodies sit at the collective center of mass and don't move.</p>
<p>In the case that we are modelling tidal locking the bodies cannot be considered rigid anyway, they can even smash into each other.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nope. You're thinking of the Trojan (and Greek) asteroids. The asteroid <em>belt</em> is between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. They're distinct regions.</p></div>		</li>
