			<div class="markdown"><p>This should be the top response. The OP question states a falsehood as fact, basically, and people reading it as well as all the top-voted answers will come away with that impression.  Not a big deal but it bothers me!  </p>
<p>In addition, stranded wire is used inside conduit (the metal or plastic pipes that wire is run though in exposed locations) and in BX (the type of wiring in a flexible metal sheath that's used today for exposed, indoor locations). BX was the norm when they built a gigantic number of houses in the post-war boom. </p>
<p>However my guess is that OP was thinking about the power cord to a lamp or appliance, not the wiring in his/her walls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many domestic wiring is done with stranded, although I agree that solid core is not uncommon. The newer wiring in my walls and ceiling is all stranded, and the older stuff is solid.  I think manufacturing costs of stranded have fallen over time to make it more common place now.  (I am in Aus, not UK)</p></div>		</li>
