			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this a little bit, electron shells are probabilities of where you'll find an (unenergized) electron orbiting an atom. I believe the percentage is 90%. So yeah, that's around 1 in every 10 times you don't find the electron where it's supposed to be. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the shells are of different shapes. The S-type shells are spherical, and the P-type shells are shaped like 2 raindrops with the tips connected at the nucleus of the atom. There are 2 other orbital classifications (D and F), but I won't go into that here.</p>
<p>Different atoms have different numbers of S, P, D, and F shells. Usually, the number of s shells is 1 greater than the number of p shells, and so on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What level of chemistry was this? If by &quot;the middle section&quot; you're referring to the transition metals, its basically because they're more &quot;complicated&quot; than the elements in groups 1-8, so you just don't learn about them until a certain level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The outer shell allways has 8 electrons. Metals are filling in a lower level and have 1 or 2 in the outer level. This means that they have less ELI5 chemistry. (Adding up to 8 eletrons)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no idea, but I assume that the alchemists of old had no real understanding of how elements worked and what elements there were, but they noticed that both gold and lead were very dense and thus heavy metals. One was shiny and rare and the other was dull and common. It would be nice if you could turn the common one into the rare one and get rich.</p>
<p>All they had back then was chemical reaction to turn one material into another. Of course you can't turn one element into another using chemistry, you need physics for that, but they didn't know it and tried a lot of different things that didn't work.</p>
<p>Nowadays we can turn one element into another, but it turns out turning lead into gold is actually quite complicated and expensive and you just end up with some very expensive and radioactive gold.</p>
<p>Turning gold into lead is actually quite a bit easier, but there isn't really that much call for that sort of transmutation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of it was a philsophical thing; gold is considered to be a &quot;pure&quot; metal (possibly because of its value, but also because it's hypoallergenic and not prone to tarnishing), where as lead was a &quot;base&quot; metal (dirty, ugly, common, etc.), but otherwise very similar (dense, soft, etc).  Thus, there may have been some thinking that if they could just remove the problem elements, as it were, from the lead, it would become gold.</p>
<p>So, the attempts to convert lead to gold was, in some ways, a metaphor for trying to perfect humanity.  </p>
<p>A lot of people think that it was a get-rich-quick scheme, but I'm under the impression that some of the ingredients used in the experiments cost more than the lead's weight in gold...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Leading on more for that, gold may have been historically valuable because of its relatively rarity and shinyness, but it really has some amazing properties.  It's extremely malleable and ductile, meaning it's both easy to change it's shape and can be stretched very thin.  One ounce of gold can be stretched into a wire 80 kilometers long.  And it's also very useful as an electrical or thermal conductor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lead is also represented by Saturn which is the physical body, and gold by the sun, which is energy. Converting lead into gold requires the removal of three protons (which is possible and has been achieved multiple times) but it's basically the next largest element in abundant supply. They could also have used mercury or thallium, but those don't have as much symbolism or availability.</p>
<p>There were tons of different alchemy rituals converting different things to gold or silver, but lead to gold is just the most famous. Also &quot;alchemy&quot; isn't possible without some form of radiation causing nuclear decay.</p></div>		</li>
