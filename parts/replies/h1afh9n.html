			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of simple maths might be tedious for a human, but computers don’t believe in the word tedious. They can do the same thing over and over again without slowing down, so if addition takes 0.000001 seconds, then 100 additions takes 0.0001 seconds.</p>
<p>And multiplication is just a bunch of additions, and division is just multiplication but by a value that is between 0 and 1, so a computer can do all of that ridiculously fast too</p>
<p>Which is still such a small amount of time that humans wouldn’t even realise time had passed between when they clicked and when their result is given.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yea pissed me off when I went to go do a background check on myself and had to wait for a solid 5 minutes going through animations of &quot;Checking dark web&quot;, &quot;Checking hidden social media profiles deleted&quot;.  I know they had all the information in about 10 seconds, but to seem &quot;legit&quot; they added minutes of animation crap</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt it, although the actual messages may be bullshit, we are only talking a few seconds for a fake wait, no one is just waiting multiple minutes for no reason. It’s probably connecting to a bunch of different social media and related apis which can take a while. It’s math done on a single computer that’s incomprehensibly fast.</p></div>		</li>
