			<div class="markdown"><p>Juat to add to this:  Even if their phones could reach cell towers, it wouldn't be effective - LTE breaks down when the LTE client device is moving at more than a couple hundred miles per hour.</p>
<p>Edit: I need to say that I'm not sure this applies to phones in orbit.  Presuming that the phones could actually reach towers on the ground (the biggest hurdle, since radiation decreases with the square of the distance, and cell tower antennas have their antenna gain set for devices on the ground around them), the separation of the towers from the phones would be so great that it's <em>possible</em> the speed might be equivalent to the phone moving much slower, down close to the tower.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is that to prevent it from being used on a missile or rocket?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. A missile or a rocket would never use civilian communications networks in the first place. </p>
<p>It breaks down because the towers have limited range, and switching from one tower to the next takes too much time. By the time your phone and the closest tower has managed to establish a connection, the tower is too far away and you need to start connecting to a new tower. </p>
<p>You'll be in a constant state of trying to connect to new cell towers, unable to transmit more than a tiny amount of data each time, leading to extremely low effective speeds. Probably too low speeds for any application to be able to load a meaningful amount of data.</p>
<p>One of the features of the new 5G standard is the ability to stay connected at much greater speeds. Exactly how they achieve this, I'm not sure. The connection process might complete significantly faster, perhaps.</p>
<p>Also, even if it wasn't for this, cell towers don't have enough range to reach the ISS. Cell tower antennas are designed to send and receive signals horizontally across the planet's surface, not towards the sky. Even in a commercial airplane, you'll struggle to stay connected to a cell network for more than a few minutes, and the ISS much higher up than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, sort of.  They just get much, much weaker, very quickly.  If there were another planet about 80 lightyears away where our early high-powered radio broadcasts are just now reaching (there should be lots of those), and there were people on that planet who were transmitting that same level of power and their waves were reaching us just now, we wouldn't have any chance of hearing them.</p>
<p>The Voyager probes transmit back to the Earth on an <em>extremely</em> high-gain antenna.  The radio power is 19 watts, but the 48dbi antenna gain causes that to be equivalent to about 731,000 watts of isotropic radiation (that's radiation going out equally in all directions).  And still, our three Deep Space Network radio telescope arrays have had to be upgraded to stay in touch with the probes, and they're many, many thousands of times closer than the stars that have been reached by our radio waves so far.  And the DSN isn't spending the rest of its time looking for alien radio signals - the entire search for extraterrestrial life is mostly confined to looking at changes in the brightness of start over time at this point (looking for megastructures).</p>
<p>Edit:  BTW, this doesn't mean it's impossible that we could receive alien radio signals - it means that anyone we hear is probably very intentionally trying to contact us specifically, and blasting radio waves our way in a very tight beam, or they have radio transmitters so powerful you could cook the surface of a whole frozen planet with them.  (Or both.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it &quot;heading out very far&quot; is the wrong way to state it - signals sent into space continue heading out there until they hit something that can absorb the signal, but by the time it hits something the amount of energy it will have is probably very very low.</p>
<p>Think ripples on a lake - throw a rock as far as you can into the middle and the ripples will keep propagating outward, but at the shore you're going to have a very hard time pointing at an individual ripple and saying &quot;that's from the rock I threw&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda true, but there are some important things to consider. Light travels significantly slower through fiber optic cables than it  does through the atmosphere. Often times, the speed of light through these cables is as low as 70% of the speed of light in a vacuum. Also, while optical cables are laid in a pretty straight line through the oceans, your signals also need to travel to the points where these cables start, and this path might deviate from a straight line by a fair bit.</p>
<p>I think this is why some companies consider low earth orbit feasible for internet-supplying satellite networks. Geostationary satellites are so far away that the network latency will be a problem, but LEO satellites are close enough that they'll be able to compete with cables when it comes to latency.</p></div>		</li>
