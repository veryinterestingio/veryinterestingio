			<div class="markdown"><p>It is possible for glaciers to “regrow” by reducing how fast ice calves, or breaks off the front, and by accumulating more snow upstream on the ice sheet. These processes require the climate to cool and restabilize for a long period of time. However, regrowing a glacier can take hundreds of years and is a much slower process than retreat, which can happen very rapidly (on the order of decades or less). - MK</p></div>		</li>
