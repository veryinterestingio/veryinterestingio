			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, IF we can find/invent a fuel that can give constant acceleration to a ship, even at a paltry 1g acceleration(same as what you feel on Earth), you can traverse the entire Milky Way Galaxy in just 12 years. A hundred thousand years would've passed on Earth though, but that's besides the point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the distance you travel in the galaxy rest frame increases <em>exponentially</em> with the time experienced by the crew of the spaceship. Or vice versa - the time experienced by the crew of the spaceship only increases <em>logarithmically</em> with the distance travelled in the galaxy rest frame. So, accelerating at a continuous 1g, you could also reach a lot of distant galaxies well within a human lifespan. (Although as you say, the galaxies will have aged by millions of years by then)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, that &quot;fuel&quot; has transferred the equivalent of the output of a star into kinetic energy long before the 12 years are up.</p>
<p>Permanent 1g is absurdly expensive after a couple of months. You're burning along, consuming the output of a star (yes, all of it), and a little while later you're consuming <em>the entire star, all its mass, every hour</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This has been bugging me for some time now. I've always heard that speed is all relative. 50 mph is only 50 mph in reference to the Earth. But the Earth is moving around the Sun, which is moving around the Galaxy, which is moving... and so on. No speed is absolute, everything is relative, right?</p>
<p>But then I hear stuff like what you just said all the time too. &quot;As you approach the speed of light, X happens&quot;. If something's speed approaches the speed of light definitively, isn't that non-relative, completely objective speed?</p>
<p>Basically, how can anything ever approach the speed of light if all speeds are relative? It feels like a contradiction to me. If you can approach the speed of light as a universal constant, than speed isn't relative, we just need to use the speed of light as &quot;speed of 1&quot; and everything else is just a fraction of it. &quot;My car is objectively, not relatively, going 0.00000000173 speed.&quot; But everyone always says speed is relative, so this can't be true... but I don't get why.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So yes, this is the speed of light <em>relative to some frame</em>. As you approach the speed of light relative to Earth, it appears that Earth is moving away from you close to the speed of light. So you see Earth as time-dilated etc. This is actually the core of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_paradox" target="_blank">Twin's Paradox</a> - if you aren't careful with how you think about the problem, it raises the question of if both see each other as time-dilated, why does one twin age less than the other? (The answer is that, in every frame, everyone agrees that one twin changed velocities and the other didn't, so the symmetry is indeed broken).</p>
<p>From your perspective, you're always stationary. But the equations of motion still work. If the stars and stuff in the nearby universe are moving close to the speed of light relative to you, then the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity-addition_formula" target="_blank">velocity addition formula</a> means you need to add an increasingly large amount of acceleration to make the rest of the universe appear to move even faster.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If everything is actually moving relatively at the speed of light, where is the contraction of time and space? I mean, photons don't break symmetry, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, I always assumed the light reaching each other was synced. Like inside the speed bubble you receive photons shower because the light outside has further to go, so you don't see your twin age until you slow down. And other way the light from the bubble is each second further away. </p>
<p>But that was entirely an intuitive instinct without looking into details... interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure this totally answers /u/TheTitan99 's question for me. Here's a contrived scenario:</p>
<p>I'm on an asteroid watching a ship fly away from me at 60% the speed of light. At the same time, another asteroid is coming towards me at 60% the speed of light. As that asteroid passes me I hop across, so I'm now standing on it. I observe the ship again.</p>
<ul>
<li>How fast does the ship look like it's going to me now?</li>
<li>How fast do I look like I'm going, to someone in the ship?</li>
</ul>
<p>Or an opposing scenario:</p>
<p>I take off from my asteroid and accelerate my ship to its maximum speed, 60% the speed of light (relative to the asteroid). I then split that ship into two stages, accelerating the front portion of the ship further to 60% the speed of light relative to the leftover observers in the back portion of the ship. But I can't be going 120% the speed of light relative to the original asteroid now, so what happens?</p>
<p>If this is just beyond simple language to explain, don't worry about it. Maybe I should actually try reading <em>On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies</em> rather than learning everything about relativity though awkward metaphors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you're correct, there's a surface-level discrepancy here.</p>
<p>The explanation for how this can be true is that <em>space, time and simultaneity</em> are also relative. Two observers that move fast past each other will each observe the other as being both squished and as having a slower passage of time. Also, the two will in most cases not be able to agree on which external events happen simultaneously, or even which order they happen in.</p>
<p>If you just keep on accelerating, it will seem to you that as you approach the speed of light, you will gradually stop speeding up... but you will still reach your destination faster, as universe gets squished in the direction of travel. If you were to move past Jupiter at a high fraction of the speed of light (like, 99.99something %), then it would look like a flat pancake. You're not moving faster than the speed of light, and yet you end up passing Jupiter much faster than you should, because <em>to you, it has been squished.</em> That's not just a visual effect, either: it <em>actually</em> is flat from your point of view.</p>
<p>External observers will still only see you moving past the planet in the way that would be expected, but the massive stopwatch glued to the side of your spaceship will seem to go slower for the external observers, to compensate.</p>
<p>You see yourself as travelling a shorter distance, others see you as having your time slowed down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More weird stuff about relativity  (mostly what you actually see) </p>
<p>The weird way light works means that you will see the sides of a box when it's in front of you so it looks not length contracted, but if you actually measure it (assuming you even have time to measure) the measurements will show it's length contracted exactly according to relativity </p>
<p>Objects look faster and longer when it comes towards you; slower and shorter (even shorter than SR would predict) when it goes away from you </p>
<p>If you accelerate you find an event horizon where you're causally disconnected from the events behind it. What's crazier, you're already disconnected from some events if you accelerate in the future</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand the part about Jupiter being squished. How is it actually flat from your POV? If you had some futuristic slow motion camera that could capture trillions of frames per second, would it appear that way still?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is, relativistic velocities don't add up the way you'd expect.</p>
<p>If you're moving 1 m/s compared to me, and I'm moving 1 m/s compared to the ground, you're <em>not</em> moving 2 m/s compared to the ground.</p>
<p>You're actually moving a bit slower than that.</p>
<p>Instead of the total speed being A + B, the relativistic formula is ( A + B ) / ( 1 + AB/c^2 ).</p>
<p>Adding up velocities can only approach c, not exceed it. Any A and B that both are lower than c, will always add up to less than c.</p>
<p>And if A = c, adding or subtracting any B will leave the result unchanged as c, so lightspeed always stays at c to all observers no matter how they are moving relative to each other.</p>
<p>Anything moving at speed c to one observer will forever be stuck at speed c to all observers. That's absolute, but all speeds slower than c are relative.</p></div>		</li>
