Early maps of Ireland show only one place, an island in a lake in the North - West where St Patrick allegedly asked God to open a portal to hell to convince non-believers it was real. Became so popular that Irish monks petitioned the Pope several times to put a stop to the nonsense. So not only was it tourism, it's possibly the first recorded instance of over-tourism.</p></div>		</li>
