			<div class="markdown"><p>You simply apply a magnetic field and some materials will hold that field (or part of it) even after you remove the external field. I'm surprised so few people know you can magnetize a simple iron nail by moving it along side a magnet in the same direction a few times (try this yourself, don't use a stainless steel nail and make sure you take 'the long way back' after one pass). The same principle is used to magnetize industrially produced magnets.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd be prudent to note that said industrially produced magnets aren't magnetised by repeatedly rubbing along a magnet; instead, they're placed in the core of a solenoid, into which current is switched on, hence creating an electromagnet.</p>
<p>In fact, large-scale magnets like <a href="https://4.imimg.com/data4/LI/DA/MY-1799742/mobile-crane-electro-magnet-500x500.jpg" target="_blank">these</a> are almost always electromagnets, as are the magnets in most particle colliders and experimental fusion reactors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Should also mention temperature. By heating the metal, you allow the &quot;microscopic magnets&quot;, the domains, to move more freely. Then apply a large magnetic field, and those domains will align. It's also the reason why a magnet losses its magnetism when it gets too hot. The domains move too freely, randomly, and sum of magnetism becomes zero.</p>
<p>Also electromagnets are used as you can easily control their properties with the flick of a switch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could reverse the process, right? So if I had a neodymium magnet, could I just apply a magnet field to it that is in the opposite direction of the field that was used to magnetize the magnet, and the magnetic field of the magnet would get weaker and change its direction eventually?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neodymium magnets tend to be very resistant to changes in their crystalline structure once formed. They also, oddly enough, tend to have a single direction that they 'prefer' to align their field to. You <em>might</em> eventually change it to a different direction, yes, but it would take both an extremely strong magnetic field (on the order of an electromagnet) and the resulting magnet would likely be weaker overall since not all of the structure would align.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are not contradictory. You can imagine them positioned in a fixed grid, but their spin directions can vary. In a magnetized object, the majority of the magnetic dipole moments are aligned in some particular direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The magnetic field of a material depends less on the orientation of the atoms that make it up, and more on the 'orientation' of the electrons that make up their shell and actually give them an electric field. The electrons of an atom are constantly in motion around it, and these orbitals can have an orientation and what are called &quot;magnetic dipole moments.&quot; From wiki:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>magnetic moment</strong> is the magnetic strength and orientation of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet" target="_blank">magnet</a> or other object that produces a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field" target="_blank">magnetic field</a>. Examples of objects that have magnetic moments include: loops of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current" target="_blank">electric current</a> (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnet" target="_blank">electromagnets</a>), permanent magnets, elementary particles (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron" target="_blank">electrons</a>), various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule" target="_blank">molecules</a>, and many astronomical objects (such as many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet" target="_blank">planets</a>, some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite" target="_blank">moons</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star" target="_blank">stars</a>, etc).  </p>
<p>More precisely, the term <em>magnetic moment</em> normally refers to a system's <strong>magnetic dipole moment</strong>, the component of the magnetic moment that can be represented by an equivalent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_dipole" target="_blank">magnetic dipole</a>:  a magnetic north and south pole separated by a very small distance. The  magnetic dipole component is sufficient for small enough magnets or for  large enough distances. Higher order terms (such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrupole_moment" target="_blank">magnetic quadrupole moment</a>) may be needed in addition to the dipole moment for extended objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Essentially, all atoms are tiny magnets, and each one has an orientation depending on how the electrons are spinning around them. Align enough of those fields in the same direction, you have a magnet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heat the material to a critical temperature, inducing a magnetic phase change in which it behaves like a ferromagnet. Allow it to cool inside an external magnetic field, forcing it to maintain the alignment of magnetic moments as it transitions back to non-ferromagnetic.</p>
<p>The material then retains a magnetic field until reheated.</p>
<p>Note: ofc not <em>any</em> material. I just can't remember specifics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want a weak magnet you can just smack a piece of iron several times. Just point an iron nail north a whack it with a hammer. </p>
<p>You’re essentially shaking up the electrons in the metal, allowing them to align in the Earth’s magnetic field.</p></div>		</li>
