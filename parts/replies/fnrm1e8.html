			<div class="markdown"><p>When most people store them they add a twist to it every time they do, like when you wrap it around your hand to make it a loop (1). If you pull on one end to unravel it, it creates twists. If you want an easily untangleable wire, store it in a figure eight pattern (2).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I normally wrap cables and ropes quickly in normal loops, but they are never tangled, because I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpuutP6Df84&amp;" target="_blank">fold one loop over, and other under</a>. There is no rotational twist, and cable/rope is always straight after unrolling, no 'spring' effect. I stared rolling everything that way, and never seen tangle in my life since then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The real culprit, though, is having an end go through a loop. Even if you do over/under to eliminate twist, if the end goes through the loop, you have a knot. If you don't allow an end to go through a loop, topologically speaking (at least), you can not have a knot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually a really interesting answer and one I don't have off-hand. Something about every agitation giving the cord a chance to change states and that the state without any tangles or knots is more likely to change into one that <em>does</em> than the inverse where it's in a state that already has tangles and changes into one without any.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is quite a difference in friction of a rope vs thin smooth fishing line or surgery thread. A lot of the normally great knots canâ€™t hold on fishing line due to lack of friction. I know the question was about strength, but I thought I should add that for a lot of practical use cases, being able to un-tie a knot after it has been under high stress, is an important factor when you decide what knot to use.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In knot jargon this is the knot's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_knot_terminology#Jamming" target="_blank">jamming</a> ability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like this is exactly where the figure 8 comes in handy. It'll only tighten on itself and won't slip when you pull on it, and even when It's had weight on it for days and is stiffer than a glass of neat isopropyl alcohol it's still easy to untie because all you have to do is start flexing the body of the knot and it loosens right up. </p>
<p>The figure 8 is great for anything from bass fishing to belaying in my opinion.</p></div>		</li>
