			<div class="markdown"><p>Most changes take about two weeks to notice. Not to mention the pills mess with more than just your mood. The neurotransmitters they target are involved in MANY of your bodily systems. I for one have never found a pill that wasn't worse than the disease because of side effects that messed up the things in my body that actually work fine. I wish more people understood this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And even after two weeks you’re far from cured or normal. Although you definitely notice you’re taking them straight away. Just not in a good way. I felt really off when I first took SSRIs. The first day felt like taking ecstasy without any of the good mood parts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah some of them are really...interesting. I started a new one and took it at night at my partner's place, then the next morning I got up, made myself get ready for work, drove all the way there, sat in my car for about 10mins and then called out sick <em>from the work parking lot.</em> I sat in my car for a couple more hours just fucking around on my phone (no one saw me, I always parked in the back of the lot) before finally driving back to my own home. Don't remember what I did the rest of the day but it was a weird one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tried two before I stopped for a long time, and then fell into a downward spiral and am now on duloxetine with no real side effects,  at least none that I didnt already have. I was on welbutrin and it gave me the shakes and coming off it made me hallucinate,  paxil took away my filter, made me happy but also aggressive as all.. which as I have anger and impulse issues (when not on duloxetine) was a very bad combo.</p>
<p>I wish I didn't need it. But I have CPTSD and major depression, so I can't be without it, For the safety of others and myself.</p>
<p>I hate drugs. But I wasn't really in control of myself anymore.  Getting adjusted to it was awful,  I felt like I could feel every atom. Nausea like you wouldn't believe.  As I also have IBS I'm very familiar with nausea. </p>
<p>My doctor told me that duloxetine could help with my anxiety, depression, IBS, migraines, and peripheral neuropathy, and I sat there in the chair and said &quot; that seems like a lot to ask of one pill.&quot;</p>
<p>It has though. I was having migraines weekly. Panic attacks nightly. Impulse and anger management issues. </p>
<p>I have migraines now maybe once a month. My panic attacks are also way down. I'm in control of me again and not my anxiety.  My IBS is about the same (awful). Haven't noticed any change in the PN. Been on it 2 years now. I'm a better me with it.</p></div>		</li>
