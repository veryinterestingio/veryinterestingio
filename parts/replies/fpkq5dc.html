			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://phys.org/news/2020-05-reveals-single-step-strategy-recycling-nuclear.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is the Phys.org story, and <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.iecr.0c00381" target="_blank">here</a> is the journal article.</p>
<p>The main point here seems to be that uranium along with the other actinides plutonium, neptunium, and americium are purified out together, and in one step. Uranium is fuel of course, so getting it purified out of spent fuel is the whole point of reprocessing. But the other actinides can also be used as fuel, so getting them with uranium isn’t bad, as in <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOX_fuel" target="_blank">mixed oxide fuel</a>.</p>
<p>If the other actinides don’t go back into fuel, they go into waste. They are very radioactive for a long time, and getting them out of waste would be a great thing. That makes this paper a good thing for waste management. </p>
<p>Dissolving fuel in nitric acid is an old idea, used in <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PUREX" target="_blank">PUREX</a> for example. But those reprocessing schemes only start with nitric dissolution, and the proposed one is very simple. Furthermore, things like PUREX get only uranium and plutonium out, and that gets you a lot closer to isolating plutonium for weapons. Getting all the actinides mixed together makes this harder, and makes this process better at preventing weapons manufacture. </p>
<p>The paper proposes a way to recycle fuel simply, cut actinides out of waste, and make weapons more difficult.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Several of the forth generation reactors designs operate with a closed fuel cycle, ie you don’t have to bury transuranics in the ground. Advances that make it easier to strip out the fission products would make the operation of these designs easier and more efficient. </p>
<p>Anything that doesn’t separate plutonium out gets bonus points for making nuclear proliferation less likely (siphoning off just 10kgs of plutonium is enough to make a small nuclear weapon, so this is a very real danger).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Gen IV reactors are currently completely theoretical, without even proof of concept designs, and at minimum several decades away from commercial implementation.</p>
<p>Depending on the progress Fusion research makes in that timeline, none of them might ever be build.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thanks for this, I was going to ask about this point since I remember lots of discussion about how recycling nuclear fuel made a lot of people nervous, not because of the safety, but because the process yielded plutonium. I was wondering how this new process differed from the older processes.</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The whole fuel rod and the cladding are all dissolved together. “Containment” in this case no longer means the cladding, it now means the big vat which everything is dissolving in. </p>
<p>Reprocessing facilities are very radioactive places, having all the transuranics and fission products sloshing around together, along with the chemical hazards of concentrated nitric acid and whatever else is being used. But like the inside of a furnace, they don’t have to be nice places, they just have to keep the dangerous things inside (heat for a furnace, radiation and chemicals for a reprocessing facility).</p></div>		</li>

<p>From a quick scan of the abstract and introduction it looks like it is discussing the separation of uranium from spent mixed oxide fuel by forming crystals.<br />
I'm not sure if the method being used is novel or not. Chemistry isn't my field of expertise so my understanding of (re)processing is elementary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It looks to be an improvement in one step of the multi-step process.  It's not a fundamental paradigm shift from existing reprocessing techniques like PUREX or TRUEX, but it's an optimization of one component in a system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>tl;dr thinking about fuel recovery like getting drinkable water (body of water --&gt; treatment facilities --&gt; storage --&gt; distributed to building plumbing --&gt; faucet), this paper says they tested a new over-the-faucet filter that removed a lot of the remaining junk from the water. I think. EDIT: /r/hey_ross says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a single step process for creating a crystal of the four trans-uranium compounds into a oxide crystal that doesn't like non uranium compounds in it. It describes the novel process as being a way to do a known process in a single step (versus multiple reagent steps) with repeatability for greater refinement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neat.</p>
<p>STUFF I POSTED BEFORE THE EDIT</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure I got the answers (EDIT: ooo, so close, past Oppen) based on the article you linked. Note: not anywhere close to a subject expert, just very familiar with the typical organization and &quot;conventions&quot; of academic papers...helps to determine which information isn't part of the &quot;big picture&quot;. And thanks to everyone that got here before me and asked questions (tagged); questions helped guide what I was looking for.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure if the method being used is novel or not.</p>
<p>[...] sounds like someone may have made an advance in separating out a common uranium compound [...] from the rest of the sludge by crystallizing it.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Hmm, their introduction uses references 1-6 to talk about the established process; reference 6 is from 1958, talking about crystallization with &quot;uranyl nitrate&quot; solution...which they also use in this paper's methods. So it seems like the backbone of the chemistry is pretty old (Although how old can nuclear reactor chemistry ACTUALLY be?). </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>My first thought is that they are extracting some specific reaction product from solution [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The word &quot;We&quot; first shows up on the top-right column of page 522 (implies they're done setting the stage, and are now talking about what their motive/improvements were). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>References 7-17 talk about specific difficulties in removing certain impurities. That paragraph ends with reference 18 (citation of their own work, from 2011) saying a certain type of filter (Kureha Crystal Purifier, KCP) does a good job at removing the hard-to-remove solid impurities. </p>
</li>
<li>I don't THINK the KCP is novel tech to them: their 2011 paper makes a passing comment that KCPs have &quot;many successful experiences in industry&quot; (citing a 2002 reference) and also reference ANOTHER previous study of theirs.  </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The article seems to be claiming that the crystallization technique is &quot;innovative&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Based on everything I've read, assuming I'm not accidentally talking out my butt: it looks like they used prior experience to identify an existing piece of tech that could help mitigate a problematic step in the overall process, and then tested parameters of its performance. (EDIT: Almost had it; equivalent to a 7-10 split in bowling)</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the original question of this post...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New method for recycling nuclear fuel discovered - How does crystallizing spent nuclear fuel change its utility?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A simplified view is that because of how uranium likes to crystallize with itself compared to the other chemicals, it's easy(er?) to pull out uranium from the leftover spent fuel solution to reuse (oversimplification: think oil and water). </p>
</li>
<li>This paper proposes an adjustment to the existing process to make it more efficient. I know next to NOTHING about this field so unfortunately I can't compare crystallization to other methods of uranium recovery (of which I know none)</li>

<p>I know this is rhetorical, but the answer is: about 80 years old. Much of the basic chemistry of nuclear reactors and processing spent fuel was worked out in the early 1940s, as part of the Manhattan Project. Which is to say, nuclear reactor chemistry is older than rocket science, older than computers.</p></div>		</li>
