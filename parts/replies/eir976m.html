<p>Not feeling hungry is your body signaling that it has enough nutrients in the bloodstream to provide adequate energy. </p>

<p>What most modern people would describe as &quot;hunger&quot; is almost entirely psychological and/or blood sugar responses.</p>
<p>One thing I notice when doing fasts, is that I get very hungry around my first and second missed meal, and then start feeling essentially no hunger.</p>
<p>Whereas the intensity of &quot;hunger&quot; I feel, if I eat a single pringles chip is <em>through the roof</em> compared to both of the above.  The immediate drive to consume more salt/fats is so much more powerful that the body's natural hints of &quot;You know, I could eat&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It won't. Not directly, at least. Feeling sated, i.e. not feeling hungry, is from nutrients. Feeling full, that's from the physical quantity. Nutrients alone won't make you feel full, the volume of the food will. You can feel full <em>and</em> hungry, at the same time, since they depend on different factors.</p></div>		</li>
