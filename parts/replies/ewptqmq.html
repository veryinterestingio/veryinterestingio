			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you saying that China agreed to give Hong Kong to the British so that they could continue to import opium?</p>
<p>From what I understand, China tried everything they could to ban the import of opium into China. Eventually the British showed up with a giant navy and forced China to give them Hong Kong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I recall, the British took control of the southern portion of Hong Kong in the 1840s as a permanent colony. The northern areas were not taken until 1898 as part of a 99-year lease.</p>
<p>At the end of this time period, the British conducted a handover of Hong Kong to China, but because the area that was controlled permanently by Britain was so closely connected to the area that had to be returned to China, they agreed that Hong Kong would stay together.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the wars were because China wanted Britain to <em>stop</em> bringing opium to China. The phrasing in the top comment makes it sounds like China <em>wanted</em> the opium and gave Hong Kong away to keep their opium supply. Instead, it's that China was too weak against Britain to get what they wanted on either topic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Two of them. But this reply ingnores those two wars, making the process look peaceful. Also, nothing about colonization of Hong Kong was mentioned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s very wrong to not mention the East India Company, the trade imbalance due to how popular tea is, which is the reason the British chose to push opium to China, and the opium war where the British invaded and as a result forced Chinese government to sign a contract where HK is leased.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly what I was trying to formulate in my brain, but history can get jumbled sometimes. So getting people addicted to drugs and then threatening to take the drugs away unless.. yikes. </p>
<p>I am an admittedly sometimes ignorant Westerner and due to media (movies, mostly) I always thought opium originated in China. Reading about its history has really got me thinking.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I may add on to the story, it began with tea. Tea started off in China. It was a big hit in Britain. But it was a one sided trade. China did not want anything the British had to offer. But the British wanted to balance the trade equation. So they started selling opium to China. China govt couldn't stop the British from selling it, so they confiscated and destroyed the opium. British used that as excuse to start opium war. British had guns, China did not. China lost the war and had to cede control of HK to Britain.</p>
<p>People of HK grew up under western democracy ideology. So it's a hard pill to swallow now to return to autocratic communist rule.</p></div>		</li>
