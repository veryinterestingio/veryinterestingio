			<div class="markdown"><p>Cranes are not built into elevator shafts. Elevator shafts are usually too small and the crane would not be able to be dismantled easily if at all. They install elevators way before construction is compete so they can use them to transport men and materials up and down which saves exterior lift rental costs. Cranes are erected where they need to be in order to reach the most area on the site and the space is filled in one it is dismantled.</p></div>		</li>
