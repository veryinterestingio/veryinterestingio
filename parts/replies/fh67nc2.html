<p>When you realize that in order to work, a computer literally has THOUSANDS of individual pieces of hardware, and similarly thousands of pieces of software code from different writers, that all have to work relatively well together as a team, in order to process whatever instructions you give it, or play that new hot game.</p>
<p>From an engineering perspective, its nothing short of amazing.  Which is why as a comouter nerd, it always ends up pissing me off so badly to see people everyday at my workplace going 'Tch.. <em>sigh</em> why do I have to learn all this computer stuff?'</p>
<p>Yeah.. I never worked tech support in my life. /s</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love this explanation, but there's one thing I'd like to clarify:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Computers and game consoles need to “load” a level before you can start playing because even at 2,000,000,000 calculations per second it can still take a while to process all the variables. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason things have to load up is really because the computer has two types of memory, we can think of them as long-term memory and short-term memory. We call them each &quot;disk storage&quot; (or just &quot;disk&quot;) and &quot;RAM.&quot; What we keep on these is called &quot;data.&quot;</p>
<p>Just like how it can take you a bit to recall or &quot;read&quot; from your long-term memory what you did on Friday last week, but only a moment to remember from your short-term what you did just a second or two ago, the disk takes a lot longer to read data from than the RAM does. Not only that, but it's also more difficult to create a new memory or &quot;write&quot; on the disk than it is in the RAM.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why we have these two different forms of memory at all if one is so slow. The answer is just the same as with your own memory - you can permanently remember all the facts you learned in school, but remembering all that stuff all at once is impossible. The disk storage is very large compared to the RAM, and lets you keep a ton of programs even though you don't use them all at the same time.</p>
<p>So, games and other programs are kept on the disk when they're not being used, and then when it's time to use them they get loaded into the RAM. From there, the processor takes what it needs from the RAM to run its calculations with, and then puts the results of those calculations back into the RAM when it's done, to be read again when the processor needs it later. When you're done with the program and close it out, that spot in RAM is freed up for another program to use later.</p>
<p>I lied earlier, there's also a third layer of memory. We can think of it as a &quot;super short-term memory,&quot; and it's right on the processor itself. It's called the cache, and when the processor sees that it's constantly pulling the same bit of memory out of RAM and then putting it back only to pull it right back out again a second later, wasting tons of time, it simply decides to keep that memory close by so that it's always there when it needs it. The cache is very fast, even compared to the RAM, and it's a part of the reason processors, and therefore games, started to get really good in the 2000's, because caches started to become a lot bigger and a lot faster.</p>
<p>TLDR:
Another way to think of all this is that the disk is like a library full of books, and you're the processor. You bring some books to your desk, which is like your RAM, and then read each book one sentence at a time. You make decisions such as to go to another book or take a note (using your cache) based off of each sentence or word, which is like the processor running calculations, and then you put it all back when you're done.</p></div>		</li>
