			<div class="markdown"><p>Get your babies swimming young. Like infant young, even if it’s just with you in the pool holding them. Go underwater, try to get them to blow bubbles. A lot of swim schools do parent taught infant classes.  This doesn’t replace actual swim lessons, but will help build their confidence. 10x easier to teach a kid who isn’t scared to put their face in.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm, am 31, grew up just casually swimming but without early exposure and without real training, finally got lessons from a friend around 20 y/o because I wanted to learn strokes, STILL have trouble with putting my face in the water repeatedly during strokes and getting mildly panicky if I do it too much. I can calmly swim around under the surface with eyes open and go deep like that for fun but if I'm on the top swimming across, and my face goes in and out, it gets to me all of a sudden. It can get me a little overtly flustered if I haven't swum in a while, and can need to stop mid-stroke 'cos it feels like my limbs get confused and I need to just pause and tread water a moment or I can't multitask enough to breathe right. I'm a stone cold motherfucker with any other kind of acute sudden fear situation, but my heart starts racing after a couple of laps in even a shallow pool, if I'm actually putting my head/face underwater routinely.</p>
<p>It's a fun challenge and I'm working on overcoming it, never really had any skill challenge my mental-game so much, but holy shit I wish I'd had different instincts introduced early on. I just felt like sharing this so that people can appreciate the importance of early introduction to things like this, but also I'm totally interested in any suggestions anyone has for working on this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d just say learn how to control your breathing. Also learning to roll to your back and float calmly can give you a lot of peace of mind. If you’re doing freestyle and start to panic you can roll to your back and kick. This way, you get a bit of rest and stay horizontal on the water. Doing this isn’t proper stoke technique by any means, but it useful to know how to do for peace of mind. </p>
<p>Some of my students are a bit older and don’t know how to swim. Those can be challenging.</p>
<p>If you got any questions pm me and I could try to answer.</p></div>		</li>
