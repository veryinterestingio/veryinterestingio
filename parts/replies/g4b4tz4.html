<p>For example bats have both <em>eyes and echolocation</em>.</p>
<p>Why shouldn't being constantly in the water provide a selection advantage for providing <em>some</em> energy under water?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bats already had ears, so modifying those is relatively easy.  Each generation gets slightly better hearing, so each generation has a better chance of survival and reproduction, even if only by a small amount, than the previous one.  </p>
<p>Whales dont have gills or gill like structures at all at this point.  They'd have to build a totally new system.  Nature doesnt do total remodels.  The upfront investment before you start getting O2 isnt worth it.  At the end of the day, even the very first steps on the road to a new system has to be advantageous.  Nature cant see around corners and plan ahead.  It wont go &quot;well, for 1000 generations what I'm doing here is gonna be useless, but once we get the new vascular system on line, we'll get 10% more O2, so that's worth it, let's stick to the plan&quot;</p>
<p>Nope, the very first generation on that path has to have an advantage over its living relatives from the tiny change to its physiology or nature will not select for it.  At this point, any small absorption of O2 through like a skin wrinkle, is so small compared to the energy budget of the whole whale, that it wont show up in the survival odds.  Let's say a whale develops a small patch of spongy tissue on it's side.  That gives it like .01% O2.  The chances are that so many other factors about the whale will impact its survival odds more, that nature wont select for that.  If more O2 were helpful to the whale, it's much more likely that nature would select for bigger lungs, more efficient blood vesicles or something like that because those structures already exist.</p>
<p>&quot;But what if the atmosphere started running out of O2 and the only air were in the water?&quot;  First of all, if the atmosphere runs out of O2, so will the water.  The water gets its O2 from mixing with the air.  But even if that wernt the case, the most likely outcome would simply be a mass extinction of aerobic species all across the planet.  The 'distance' between lungs and gills is HUGE.  The odds of bridging the gap in few enough generations to survive that catastrophic event are so small, that the most likely outcome is just a lot of dead whales.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue is that evolution doesn't have an end goal. Yes, gills and lungs together <em>could</em> be more efficient than just lungs... But it requires a lot of successive genetic changes. And those individual genetic changes would each have to confer their own benefits for natural selection to spread them through the population. </p>
<p>Evolution is a series of &quot;good enough&quot;s.</p></div>		</li>
