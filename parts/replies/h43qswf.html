			<div class="markdown"><p>Aerobic exercise = moving the body, but your body can inhale enough air to continue moving for a long time. </p>
<p>Example: riding a bike at a comfortable pace and slowing down if the body starts to get tired. </p>
<p>Anaerobic exercise = Moving the body FAST. The body needs a lot of air to move FAST and the body can move faster (exerting energy) than we can breathe in air. This kind of movement usually makes our lungs feel like they are burning, muscles feel like hot lava, your brain screams to stop. </p>
<p>Example: sprinting for as long as possible, trying to outrun a cheetah, lifting a heavy weight till the muscles start to fail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the main point.</p>
<p>Breathing through the nose is good for everyday life, but during any amount of cardio exercise, it's simply not feasible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tell that to my elementary school gym teacher. She would actually get mad and threaten points off if she noticed you not doing nose breathing on track days. She's probably the main reason I hated gym class and general fitness stuff for so many years.</p>
<p>She was also the kind of person that confidently didn't understand basic geometry (or even just look up the standards), so she always had track groups start in a line and graded based on run times. Which meant that anyone smart/lucky enough to grab the inside lane <em>always</em> finished first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is possible.... if you run slow enough. </p>
<p>Run faster and it won't be possible.</p>
<p>The simple fact is you can breathe faster through your mouth than your nose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, does this mean I've been following broken advice and trying my best to keep my mouth shut while doing cardio? Is that why I'm always panting like it's my first time out of water in decades?? Should I be breathing with my mouth??? Help????</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly go for it. Only breathing through the nose would be miserable. But nose breathing has benefits. So find a balance, definitely always exhale through your mouth though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who used to compete in Cross Country, I recommend trying a breathing rhythm of nose in, mouth in (always breathing out through the mouth). It's good at balancing the benefits of both</p></div>		</li>
