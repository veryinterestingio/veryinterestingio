			<div class="markdown"><p>In a study on vaginal estrogen application, researchers found that local application of estrogen has been shown to relieve symptoms of atrophic vaginitis including dryness, irritation, itching and or dyspareunia. In addition, local estrogen therapy may have a favorable effect on sexuality, urinary tract infections, vaginal surgery, and incontinence. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but if the rest of the hormone cascade is not balanced well enough, unopposed estrogen can lead to vaginal, ovarian or uterine cancer. Even the the presence of hysterectomy, the remaining vaginal (and possibly cervical) tissue will be at increased risk of malignancy in the presence of unopposed estrogen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's the difference between Estrogen produced naturally and the same level of estrogen but some of it is manually supplimented? Does the body produce other hormones to counteract the negative side effects of the estrogen it produces, which are not present when you're only supplimenting estrogen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. When we give post menopausal women estrogen and they have an intact uterus, we have to give them progesterone with it for this reason. </p>
<p>Also, estrogen therapy is usually only for 1-2 years for menopause symptoms. Even with local application, we don’t go beyond this. For vaginal dryness associated with estrogen decrease, moisturizers and lubricants are the go to. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cervical and vaginal cancer aren't hormonally driven, they're both caused primarily by HPV. Uterine cancer and breast cancer are the two big risks of systemic estrogen therapy. </p></div>		</li>
