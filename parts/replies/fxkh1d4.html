			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right except that softwood lumber is rarely dried beyond a moisture content of 19%. At that point all the &quot;easy&quot; water has been removed and further drying to remove the cellular water would take a great deal of energy and time. Shrinkage in the lumber only begins once the moisture content reduces below 19%, btw. The main reasons for drying lumber at all are to kill surface fungus so it doesn't bloom before the lumber is sold and to reduce shipping weight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like I say, rain doesn't saturate the wood with moisture and not all the wood gets wet. Once it's up and mostly exposed, with air flow even before the siding is on will dry it out. I don't live in a climate with really high humidity so that may be a factor but I don't know how much. It was never an issue for all the years I was building houses though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where I am, there is a stage after the exterior cladding is on, including roof, where the timber framing has to be moisture tested to ensure it has dried out sufficiently. If it fails, you have to wait longer, and the few times this has happened heaters are used to speed it up.</p></div>		</li>
