			<div class="markdown"><p>This tbh. I would say there's three voices: the inner monologue, what your voice sounds to you, and what your voice sounds to other. Your inner monologue is your idealized voice, to the point its what you see as your personal identity. Thats what 'I' am supposed to sound like. Its a real cognitive dissonance trip when you either flub trying to speak or when you hear a recording of your voice and it doesnt match your idealized self.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol that's not it at all. There's usually (some people don't have it or it's a variation) an inner monologue you think to yourself with and the speech you think you hear is more fluent, fluid and clear than what your actual voice and speech typically is.</p>
<p>Also, I don't like your tone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You aren't actually hearing a voice. You get that, right? Unless you are actually conceptualizing yourself giving a speech, the voice doesn't exist. It is only your mind in the abstract. Of course, even if you imagine yourself talking out loud, it would be idealized. You imagined it. Reality differs from that. You don't have perfect control of reality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My inner-speech pattern seems great, then when I talk it doesn't make sense to anyone. I've been told (personally) the words/sentences I speak have additional context, so people think I'm supposed to understand what I'm saying. </p>
<p>OR, I ramble on and finally get to the point, but that's for telling stories and not instructions or &quot;basic&quot; sentences. I'm not much of a talker unless it's close friends/family so I guess it makes sense</p></div>		</li>
