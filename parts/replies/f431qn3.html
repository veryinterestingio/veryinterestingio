			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't tell if this makes me regret not doing my masters in physics, or if it makes me happy I didn't. We didn't have any great courses on waves during my undergrad, so whenever I read about stuff like this I squint.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assumed an understanding of plasma physics in my answer, which is usually only taught in masters or PhD classes. Hopefully that doesn't put you off!</p>
<p>To clarify, a shear Alfvén wave is often compared to the oscillation of a guitar string. Magnetic field lines have tension in them, just like guitar strings. This tension acts to straighten the magnetic field line. This is the restoring force.</p>
<p>The magnetic field lines are 'frozen' into the plasma - where the plasma goes, the magnetic field lines go too. Equivalently, when the magnetic field lines move, the plasma moves with it. When a group of ions collectively move in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field, the magnetic field is bent with them. This is the 'ion kinetic energy' part of the oscillation. The restoring force pulls them back, but they overshoot and again the tension pulls them back, they overshoot, and so on.</p>
<p>A compressional Alfvén wave arises because a magnetic field is difficult to compress, just like a fluid. There is a pressure associated with the magnetic field, just as there is for a fluid. Compressional Alfvén waves are effectively a magnetic sound wave that carries information about changes in the magnetic pressure, just as normal sound waves carry information about changes in the thermodynamic pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of the reason I did my physics degree at all was because I would see all this math and know that it made perfect sense. It just didn't make perfect sense <em>to me.</em> But I wanted it to. Now when I read about things I don't understand, I have trust that it can make complete sense to somebody, and if I put in the work then that person could be me. Sometimes people just aren't ready for certain things at certain times though. I was skeptical of calculus for years of undergrad until I poked it hard enough. Then calc 2 and 3 was mine for the taking. I wasn't ready for linear algebra when I first took it, but after reading a book on abstract algebra, I ate up the advanced linear algebra class. I wasn't ready for waves in solid state physics or fluid dynamics, and don't know if I am yet. My quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics courses clicked instantly though. I guess it's the uncertainty of not knowing what I'm mentally ready for that makes me wonder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that magnetic field lines are useful shorthand for representing the vector field associated with magnetic flux, but I've seen so many knowledgeable people refer to them as physical quantities (such as in &quot;counting the number of magnetic field lines&quot; or their quantization in superconductors) that I'm not sure which it is. Do they exist physically or do they just arise as a convenient way to represent a continuous magnetic field?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At my university there was an undergraduate space / plasma physics course put on by the honors college for anybody who was interested. It was one of the most interesting courses I ever took, and was really enjoyable even though it was stupid hard. We touched on pretty much each topic you put here, Alfvén waves, acoustic waves, drift velocities, and magnetohydrodynamics. I never thought I would see such niche concepts explained out in the wild like this. </p>
<p>If you want to learn about this kind of stuff, I can recommend Basics of the Solar Wind by Nicole Meyer-Vernet. This was our textbook. It’s a fairly cheap book, but probably has a free pdf online as well somewhere.</p>
<p>FWIW, I don’t know shit about physics. I’m a programmer by trade, yet I still was able learn a decent bit about space plasmas just from this book and a good teacher. Don’t think you have to get a PHD or masters in physics to learn things about the universe. You really just need a solid math foundation and you can learn practically anything you want.</p></div>		</li>
