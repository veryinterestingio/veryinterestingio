<p>Except it isn't.<br />
Depleted Uranium (DU) is also &quot;self sharpening&quot;.
Most materials when they hit something hard have a tendency to flatten/mushroom. DU on the other hand tends to have stuff 'flake' from the tip in a way that allows it to remain pointy.<br />
This is really a fantastic feature of DU when you're confronting heavily armored targets.  </p>

<p>There's a limit to how fast you can get bullets going, and the how-hard-it-hits factor is determined by speed times mass. So you want the heaviest (ie, densest, because there are also limitations on size) projectile possible. That's uranium.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the interesting side effects of this is that it's fairly easy to fire a DU shell &quot;too fast&quot; (all armor piercing shells do this, but DU does it at a lower velocity than tungsten based projectiles (WHA). If you can figure out how to get it to the target at 2 km/s then the WHA projectiles can actually have more penetration capability. Europe is currently doing this by fitting the latest generations of some of their tanks with upgraded guns capable of pushing the rounds out with a higher velocity, but the US isn't because DU is at the point of minimal returns.  </p>

<p>Pretty much everything else that people will tell you about uranium isn't really about how uranium is great at this as much as how uranium doesn't suck at this as much as you might have though, considering we only picked it because it was super-heavy.  </p>

<p>Also DU will burn, which is a nice after effect if you're firing 120mm based sabot manage to punch a hole in an enemy tank.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A very crude way of imagining this is like how a pencil sharpens. It tends to break away on the sides like the shavings by exerting the force towards its outer shell.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Maybe that gives you the last few % performance vs. RHA, but against modern composite armor schemes its quite inconsequential.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not all there is to it.</p>
<p>If it was, lead projectiles would be better at penetrating targets than steel.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not really. Like I said above: gold or lead are also very dense, but are completely useless as armor or AP munition. </p>
<p>DU and tungsten are not only very dense, they are also very hard and quite tough. </p>
<p>The most important point is also that <em>DU is cheap</em> compared to other materials with similar properties such as tungsten.</p></div>		</li>
