<p>You are mostly welcome! </p>
<p>Concerning  your first question, all sites I visited share geological, biological, and climatic features making them ideal analog environments where to search for cryptic and extreme surface (and subsurface) life. Working at these sites teaches us on the best way to search for alien critters with a diverse array of  life detection instruments and enabling technology like drills and rovers.  We can group these sites into three categories: Deserts, subsurface, and Hot Spring systems sharing common features. Yet sites can be also very different.</p>
<p>Desert landscapes (playas, dunes, and regolith pavements) can be very similar.  You can find them at high elevations, like in the Himalayas, as well in the middle East, Western United States, South America, or Antartica. All these deserts have in common high aridity, with low precipitation e.g., &lt; 2 mm rain to 300-500 mm rain, with an aridity index that takes into consideration evaporation as an effect of annual precipitation and max temperature.  We  use these sites as laboratory environments where we can look at the distribution of life as a function of the aridity index.  </p>
<p>The subsurface systems seem to be less diverse, because they are mostly isolated from the atmosphere (no oxygen, no light, and little nutrients available to heterotrophic microbes).  The typical microbial life of these systems is  sparse and rare, or clustered in rock pockets, where it uses redox reaction as energy sources to support active, but slow metabolism. You need to drill a lot of rocks to find them!</p>
<p>Of course, diversity is introduced by depth gradient, presence of underground water, hosting rock types and possible heat sources.<br />
About Hydrothermal systems, my (limited) understanding of them, is that geographical differences may not matter as much as their temperature gradients do. In these settings, life that is not only microbial, adapts to survive along the extreme temperature gradient within each individual system (\~20  to 121 deg C).</p>
<p>Finally, the most important lesson we have learned about life detection on extraterrestrial surfaces (and subsurface) is that:<br />
1) life in an extreme terrestrial environment is everywhere, but it is microscopic, or if observable directly in large colonies, is still cryptic and elusive.<br />
2) Sometimes this life can be very abundant and widespread, like in the case of liken-colonized rocks, cyanobacteria living in salt, or beneath/within translucent rocks, and the like.  We usually overlook this type of life, because it blends with the environment and the hosting geology at macroscopic, microscopic, and  molecular levels.<br />
3) Life detection, even on our planet, is hard and challenging. It will be even more challenging and easy to overlook on Mars, unless we train our eyes and mental wiring to see it!<br />
4) Life detection gets even more complicated at molecular level, because chemical or physical methods to detect life could be confounded by the interfering chemistry of the hosting rocks and sediments, and water systems. This is a stumbling block regardless of the state-of-the-art instrumentation we have access to.<br />
5) We need to &quot;play&quot; - and we do play a lot! - with different protocols specific to see life in each environment and at different spatial and temporal scales.</p></div>		</li>
