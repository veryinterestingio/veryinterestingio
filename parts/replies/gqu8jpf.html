<p>Water is weird in that it's less dense as a solid than a liquid </p>

<p>That's because it's a polar molecule, which results in individual molecules pushing each other apart because of magnetic properties. It's not the only molecule to do this when transforming from liquid to solid either there's a number of other polar molecules with their structure that can result in similar expansion. Here's an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/27jvt3/is_it_true_that_water_is_the_only_substance_on/" target="_blank">AskScience thread</a> about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that would (kind of) matter, because the remaining water's freezing point would be getting lower as it gets more concentrated. In fact seawater freezing can lead to wacky things like <a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/oceanography/underwater-brinicles.htm" target="_blank">brinicles aka sea stalactites</a> - hollow tubes of ice freezing downwards from the underside of the sea ice surface layer.</p>
<p>But both of the cases in OPs question (and my answer) are talking about fresh water, so I didn't get into that. Lakes are freshwater of course, but so are the pockets of water under the Antarctic ice. Antarctica is glacial ice <em>on top of land</em>, and in some places there's liquid water under the ice but above that land, or just within the ice. But it's fresh water not salty sea water. OP was not (I don't think) asking about oceans freezing under surface ice like in the Arctic (which doesn't have land under the ice).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. The other answers were often talking about situations such as the Arctic, and I missed that.</p></div>		</li>
