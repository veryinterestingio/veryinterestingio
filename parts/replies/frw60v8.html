			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep 2 procedures on both toes and still problematic. It’s miserable. I got chubby big toes so when I put weight on my feet, they wrap around and push towards the nail. Even with the sides being cut and treated to stop the growth, they still grow inwards and cut the meat. So frustrating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had chronic issues on both big toes. Then I had a procedure done in my early teens that killed/removed part of the lunula/matrix on each side of each toe. I have ugly ass toenails but haven't had any ingrown issues since. Well worth it. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Be warned though. The numbing process was incredibly painful and the first 24 hours or so after numbing wears off is very painful too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll say, it totally depends on who performs the procedure. First I had I got at my family doctor. Just straight into the toe with a needle. Second I saw a podiatrist, who had nothing good to say about how most doctors do the procedure as far as numbing first. She has a device (almost like a hypospray on Star Trek) that basically uses a charge of air to blow an initial numbing agent in, waits about 20-30 minutes and then needle. Aside from a slight bee sting when the first air blast goes in, felt nothing at all.</p>
<p>So, advice to anyone needing a matrixectomy, go to a podiatrist, and perhaps even ask ahead of time how they go about prepping for the procedure.</p>
<p>Edit: I believe the device is called a derma-jet injector. It's a godsend on these toe procedures so might want to specifically ask your doctor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that’s the procedures I’ve got done and yes it is very painful though the second time I was having a foot surgery so they did it while I was under so didn’t have to feel the needles. The first go I was in the office and that needle in an area that’s already painful, plus lidocaine burns as it goes in, yep that was painful. So in total 4 procedures 2 on each toe and no luck. It still somehow grows back. Not to mention my nails are so thick like a bone so that makes it even more painful.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is such an understatement.</p>
<p>I had ingrown toenails on both sides of both big toes. The doctor was only able to do one side of each toe at a time for some reason.</p>
<p>He poked each toe 4 or 5 times with a needle to give me local anesthesia. This is when I found out that anything that blocks pain doesn't actually work on me (still not sure why, and have lots of other examples of it failing).</p>
<p>Afterwards, he jammed a flat piece of metal under the nail to break it free from the nail bed. Then he used diagonal cutters to cut from front to back. He used tweezers to grab the nail and pull it. Lastly, its get treated with both acid and a laser to stop it from growing in that spot.</p>
<p>Both toes. Twice.</p>
<p>Still worth it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try to get your doctor to refer you to someone who does the Vandenbos procedure. I had all kinds of shit done to my toes which never stopped the problem. Then I had the Vandenbos procedure which is where instead of doing anything to the nail, they just completely remove the flesh around the area where the nail digs in. The soft tissue on edge of your toe is just a bit &quot;flatter&quot; afterwards if that makes sense. Day 1 of healing hurt pretty bad but they gave me T3s and I was fine. Never ever had even remotely had an issue again, and this is from having ingrown toenails regularly since I was a teenager. Absolute life changer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whoa that looks horrible but yeah that the problem. That is really it. The side of my toes are so big and they push against the nail pushing the nail to grow inwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh my god it never goes away. Never. I’m in so much pain both from the ingrown nail and the fungus that never goes away. I got it after the procedure and my doctor didn’t tell me that would be the case. I didn’t even know they were related.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way pressure makes the nails grow inward can be used in the opposite direction. Podiatrists can glue wires to the top of the nail that hook into the edges and pull them up as the nail grows forward. Sounds much more gross than it is, and unlike the surgical intervention, it's not painful. </p>
<p>The nail creates a channel in the skin that it will follow, the edges of it become &quot;callused&quot;. If the nail gets jammed in there and breaks the skin, things get annoying. The inflamed skin is puffy and soft, doesn't provide the necessary support and guidance for the nail and gets in the way even more. Bracing the nail to be flatter again and leave the skin channel before that problematic spot gives it a new channel to grow into. </p>
<p>Random side info: Horses can have that problem too. Their hooves can curve too acutely pinching the soft, tender pad and backside of the foot (wrong shoes can do that, just like with humans, wrong hoof care, or simply very soft ground to walk on).</p></div>		</li>
