<p>So all those hand-rubbings and they weren't planning on world domination?</p>

<p>All the time!</p>
<p>Constantly!</p>
<p>By removing particles and dirt they can navigate better and likely live longer.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean they arnt covered in harmful microorganisms, they just arnt covered in dirt at the least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I notice that some other bugs — bees, for example — clearly <em>do</em> understand they're being swatted at, and go from &quot;explore this new 'house' area&quot; to &quot;fuck it I'm outta here&quot; as soon as you start in on them. (And they find their way out very quickly!) Always nice when I &quot;un-invite&quot; a bee from my house, and they immediately get the message and leave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are studies that show that the smaller you are, the slower time passes for you. Like, flies can see lights flickering at a faster rate than we can because they’re basically seeing it in slow motion. </p>
<p>So while we think we’re being fast to the point of being instantaneous, to the fly it’s more like watching a car wreck in slo-mo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like this, thought process is like</p>
<p>Step 1 eat food
Step 2 make more flies
Step 0 dodge shit (this step overrides all steps) </p>
<p>And that is quite literally it. The ability to sense motion in your direction is not an intelligent reaction, it's just a reflex that's always the top priority.</p></div>		</li>

<p>From what I recall, the verdict is still out on whether it actually works to keep bugs away, but the idea does make sense.  If nothing else, it is pretty and does a lot to brighten up the porch.</p></div>		</li>
