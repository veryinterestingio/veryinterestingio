			<div class="markdown"><p>Same exact way as the petroleum jelly. It removes the air gap and air bubbles that is between the probe and the metal. Oil is just a cheaper alternative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couplant is the gel they are talking about, for ultrasonic testing of metals you can use the same type of gels as in medical, oil, or even water works. </p>
<p>Air doesn’t conduct sound very well so It just provides a pathway for the sound to travel into the material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A couplant is just something that will fill the gap between the equipment and the piece being tested.</p>
<p>Oil, while it does lubricate engines and other moving parts, still has a high enough surface tension for some weights of it to create a puddle on the surface, if you will.</p></div>		</li>
