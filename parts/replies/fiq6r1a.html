<p>It depends on the technique you use. A good summary of most techniques used in TEM for strain measurement is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304399113000843" target="_blank">here</a>. High resolution imaging, nano beam diffraction and holography will all give you information on the 2D projection of the strain tensor. I convergent beam diffraction all components of the 3D strain field will impact you measurement, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2818.2007.01760.x" target="_blank">but they're exceptionally hard to retrieve</a>.</p>
<p>Therefore when analyzing semiconductor devices the easiest thing is to cut two samples along principal directions of the structure. For instance, in the case of a FinFET, you'd take one along the fin and one across the fin.</p>
<p>If the sample is small enough (a nanoparticle with a size of only few nanometers) then it is possible to perform atomic resolution tomography and <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b03008" target="_blank">reconstruct the position of every single atom in 3D</a>, therefore also obtaining the full 3D strain field.</p></div>		</li>
