I’m sure the lag time is different for different vaccine types as well as different diseases targeted, but 2 weeks is fairly standard and not at all special to mRNA vaccines right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure, honestly two weeks is pretty good timespan considering most vaccines I know of (varicella, hep b) state you need 6 weeks before antibody levels are reached.</p>
<p>The process I explained above is extremely general, and should be applicable for anything ranging from a general infection to various vaccines. That being said, I really don't have much knowledge in the mRNA department, so  I did want to put up that disclaimer in case I said anything incorrect!</p></div>		</li>
