			<div class="markdown"><p>Good questions. Let me bullet my answers.</p>
<p>-Silicon is reaching its limits, but quantum computing is emerging.  That is predicted to be the game changer.</p>
<p>-As for how materials spread, it used to be by the trade routes long ago. Now, it is science conferences.  As for patents, that is a business practice to protect IP so that their competition cannot work on it. (There is a good case of that in my book between a preacher and Kodak in <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/alchemy-us" target="_blank"><em>The Alchemy of Us</em></a>.) Patents are a good way to track progress within a business, but they do create impediments for advances and collaborations between scientists working in different businesses, unfortunately. For innovation to move without these impediments, universities seem to be places for innovation without these speed bumps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So technological design over material advancement in computation. </p>
<p>Good point on universities, academia can be funded by public and private endeavours. </p>
<p>Time to do some reading!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to say I don't think Quantum Computing is going to be the thing that replaces silicon computing as the other comment suggested. For some tasks (like excel) classical computing will probably be faster at today's rate then quantum will be in 10 years. </p>
<p>All the gains in quantum have to do with reducing the number of operations needed to solve something by a huge amount but the actual compute speed is still slow (I heard a good rule of thumb is classical is like X^2 for every bit and quantum is X^3 for every qbit) so right now it's good for simulating weather or molecules but not most classic workloads.</p>
<p>As for silicone itself there are new alloys in the works, such as Silicon-Germanium or what the scientific community has been proposing since the 70s gallium arsenide.</p></div>		</li>
