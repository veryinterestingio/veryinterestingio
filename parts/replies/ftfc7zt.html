			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes there are a lot of studies constantly going on in various phases and trials. Often times cure is a relative term in cancer because many patients just go into remission on and off for years. Many drugs provide a relative cure for a certain period of time but their effectiveness wears off over time. </p>
<p>There are also so many causes of even just the same type of cancer. A lot of research is just discovering the differences. For example p53 is common in many cancer but a lot may also been caused by say a genetic disorders or environmental exposure that have changed other genes. They can have either one or many of these things contributing to their cancer. So a cure may only work for a vary small subset of that cancer population even if it's a common cancer. That's even  if even gets that far in trial. </p>
<p>Additionally, laypersons are invested in cancer research on a top level because they give to charities, participate in events or know someone with cancer. So they want to hear about stories of people beating cancer or drugs that cure.</p></div>		</li>
