			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not beer specifically, but it’s related to alcohol consumption. Particularly in men, medium to heavy amounts of alcohol consumption can shift where your body stores fat. So a guy that drinks more will probably have a higher ratio of visceral fat versus subcutaneous fat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always heard that it wasn't really that alcohol directly causes a &quot;beer belly&quot; but that heavy alcohol users also tend to eat junk food and not get much exercise. And of course theres calories in alcohol as well. More of a correlation rather then a direct cause. But I'm not at all an expert on the topic (well I am an expert on junk food lol). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny story, I was a paramedic a number of years ago and I went on a call for a stabbing. I get there and it's a morbidly obese person who has stabbed herself in the gut (just above the belly button). When I walk into the house, there she was, sitting in a computer chair, wearing panties and a tank top. Her tank top was pulled up over her belly and there was a steak knife, buried to the handle and her just smoking a cigarette like &quot;are y'all gonna do something about this?&quot;. Turns out, she stabbed herself just to see what it would be like. She just puffed on her smokes and gave me this &quot;well, as you can see, I fucked up&quot; look.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never had a stabbing to respond to, but the procedure I was taught is to leave the knife in provided it's not presenting actively causing damage beyond the penetration, and use rolled gauze stacked on the sides and taped to create a sort of... brace? for the knife so it doesn't shift. Then load and run to the damn hospital. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Secret agent and Hawkeye are right. Generally, the recommended course of action is to brace in place and transport to higher level of care. We packed gauze around the knife and taped it down. It's not for the medics to remove.</p>
<p>However, I spent 9 years as an infantry medic in the US Army. For us, removing the object and getting the wound packed with quick clot and a pressure dressing is the order of business. Stabilize and return to the fight.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great comment!</p>
<p>“Drinking alcohol causes beer bellies. Taking in a lot of calories causes beer bellies. And most importantly, genetics causes beer bellies.” </p>
<p>Totally true but missing a few factors specific to ‘alcohol-bellies’. Consistent alcohol consumption in men at a level most people would consider high end of moderate (4 drinks a night), can cause a shift in where fat is stored in the body. It pushes the balance away from peripheral subcutaneous fat into developing more central visceral fat (this also happens to a smaller degree in normal aging). </p>
<p>More severe alcoholism will also cause inflammation and swelling of the intensities (transiently in the 24-36hrs after drinking) and, eventually ascites (free fluid buildup in the abdominal cavity). </p>
<p>Any or all of these  processes might be adding on top of the caloric drivers of drinking causing a protuberant abdomen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add onto that...because I learned in an unfortunate way... Keep an eye on your buddies if they have a beer belly and they drink a little too hard. </p>
<p>In men, especially dad age, it's easy to assume a beer belly is just normal feature. &quot;Dad bod&quot;, and all that. In an alcoholic, a beer belly could be an abdomen full of ascites, which means liver issues or failure.</p>
<p>If your alcoholism has gotten to the level where your belly keeps filling with ascites, then you're looking at a future of getting it pumped out a hospital every few weeks or months.  And no more salty foods (expect a life of yogurt and fruit). </p>
<p>If you have this build-up happening, then your liver (and maybe even your kidney, because they work together closely) may kick the bucket. </p>
<p>And then if THAT happens, you can't just say you'll get a transplant. Alcohol abusers have to wait 6 months (in the US) before they consider putting you on a recipient list.</p>
<p>So um yeah...That's how we discovered my parent was a closet alcoholic. </p>
<p>When he insisted that his tubby belly was just a beer belly, we believed him. Who knew a large pot belly was a sign of a failing liver?</p>
<p>He checked into the hospital after his belly got so big that he couldn't fit behind a steering wheel. Not a fat dude, the guy couldn't have weighed more than 160 lbs. Doctors pumped out 6 liters of ascites. Next month, same thing... Even though he stopped drinking and followed the diet rules to a T. </p>
<p>Stopping drinking at this point can save some people, but for my dad is was too late. He died 2 months later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This comment is crazy to read for me.  My dad had 19 Liters drained from him for his ascites.  He had it pumped out and within a couple of months it was back in full and his liver and kidneys failed.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My father died from liver and kidney failure caused by alcoholism when he was younger, and later in life when he was alone. He broke his back and was out of work, and during one of the visits they noticed his swelling abdomen. He had to be drained every other day almost, he was not eligible for transplant list because of his previous alcohol abuse, and started getting delirious in his final days. Its tough watching the man who was always strong and tough waste away, having to help him urinate, helping him walk. Ive since cut down on my alcohol consumption, but can still enjoy a few drinks  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, thanks for mentioning that. 1000 calories of alcohol will cause more damage and visceral fat accumulation than 1000 calories of sugar, protein, or fat. Alcohol disproportionately is stored in the belly, it causes inflammation, and your liver has to process the alcohol instead of any of the other calories you eat. It's also not just beer, but any alcohol. Genetics is still the number one factor, but alcohol is the number one modifiable factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I feel that I have a larger belly than should be normal for my size. I drink maybe once every 6 months, and not alot. My Dad also has a disproportionate stomach, but he does drink a good bit. And his dad, my grandfather, also had a larger belly. I dont think he drank.</p>
<p>So it seems genetic, is there any way to lessen it if it is? </p>
<p>Also, I'm 5' 11&quot; and weight just over 200. If it matters.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I've always wondered about this. If I drink regularly and my body seems to &quot;shift&quot; to storing more fat on my midsection, I exercise it off, and quit drinking, will my new excess caloric intake continue to be stored on my midsection more than in the past, or will it go back to going to my thighs etc.?</p>
<p>I realize this may not be a known scientific fact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's likely that fat will be stored wherever there is already an abundance of fat cells. New fat cells are created quite quickly as you gain weight, and shrink when you lose weight, but never completely go away. Which is why people can easily regain weight after a diet if they are not vigilant.</p></div>		</li>
