			<div class="markdown"><p>Do the chemical mechanisms of tolerance allow them to function better at lower alcohol levels than someone without this built up tolerance?  In other words, would someone with a heavy alcohol tolerance at a BAC of 0.08 function like a first time user at 0.04, etc?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  The brain will selectively disable receptors when alcohol is used more frequently, reducing inebriation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably, yes. In short, alcohol increases the activity of inhibitory (GABA) neural pathways, which leads to the free, uninhibited feelings people get when drinking. </p>
<p>Prolonged abuse of alcohol causes structural brain changes. Since alcohol is always in the system activating these inhibitory pathways, the brain increases the number of excitatory pathways in order to balance neural activity. An alcoholic would have more of these excitatory pathways to counterbalance the effects of drinking, so they would be less inebriated than a casual drinker at the same BAC. </p>
<p>As another commenter mentioned, this is also why detox as an alcoholic can be dangerous without proper supervision. Stopping drinking abruptly means that thereâ€™s no time for the brain to balance out the inhibitory/excitatory pathways, which can lead to over-excitation. This can cause seizures, hallucinations, and even death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the specific effect that causes life threatening withdrawal symptoms is the fact that alcohol affects the GABA receptors in the brain, and after long term excessive use, the brain compensates by making more receptors. If you stop suddenly, it can cause certain neurons to be overexcited which can lead to seizures and brain damage. This effect is almost exactly the same as what benzodiazepines like Xanax and Vallium do to the brain, and they cause the same withdrawal symptoms. In fact they have cross tolerance with alcohol, but fewer effects of intoxication. This is why alcoholics are given anti-anxiety meds after they quit drinking suddenly.</p></div>		</li>
