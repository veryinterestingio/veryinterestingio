			<div class="markdown"><p>Mechanical engineer here. They are most certainly not sized to handle every fixture flushing at once. That would get expensive very quickly. They are sized based on usage statistics, and in large buildings, the system can be sized as low as 30% of the total system flow. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely depends on the building. You are absolutely correct in something such as an office building - plumbing code fixture units are a usage-based way of calculating demand. In a building where it is expected that the fixtures will (almost) all be used at the same time, such as a sports arena, the sanitary and supply systems would be sized based on full usage demand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I literally have no experience in this but it would be ridicolous to size them without usage stats. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The U.K. is not the same, it's averaged based on daily usage then has a peaking factor applied. In practical terms the toilets, sinks and other fittings are all in different locations and will likely be stored temporarily in the pipe work until downstream capacity is available.</p>
<p>The likelyhood of it happening is very low though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's a tank style toilet, they'll all flush regardless of water supply size, since the water is already in the tank.  If they're flushometer style toilets and they're not being supplied with enough water the ones closest to the water main will flush more or less normally, the ones further out will dribble water into the bowl slowly.  </p>
<p>If the waste lines are undersized the toilets could back up over the rim and spill out on the floor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they are undersized, partial blockage, full blockage (depending on where on the line it is) and is a multi story you could end up with some head pressure resulting in more than spilling out over the rim but instead shooting out of the drain on the lower stories.</p></div>		</li>
