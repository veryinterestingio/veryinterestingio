<p>Would a capacitor and  transformer be enough to theoretically make it work ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, those would be the main components you'd need.</p>
<p>Both bateries' voltage is DC (direct current), and the transformer can only work with AC (alternate current). So you would also need to convert it to AC to go in the transformer, then another converter after that to go back to DC and store the energy on a capacitor. This capacitor would be huge, probably a capacitor bank. The capacitor &quot;unloads&quot; its energy a little too fast for a car needs, but that's manageable, we can limit &quot;how fast&quot; its charge is used using resistors in the circuit.</p>
<p>It is perhaps simpler to use an actual car battery instead of the capacitor: change the voltage to AC, increase voltage with a transformer, convert it back to DC and use it to charge a car battery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Connecting your cell phone battery to <del>a simple transformer and</del> a capacitor large enough to start a car engine would, practically speaking, have the same effect on the battery as just shorting it out for a significant period of time.</p>
<p>You would need some way to meter the current flow to the capacitor to avoid damage to the battery.</p>
<p>*edit* the transformer is irrelevant, you'd also need a more complicated circuit to step up the DC voltage in addition to metering the current.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Though you could slowly charge up a bank of supercaps with the battery and use them to start the car. There have been videos of people replacing their car batteries with super caps. I'm not sure what the long term effectiveness is like but it does work</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could theoretically use USB external battery through a boost converter to charge the actual battery if it dies though, right? If you'd be selling this kind of solution, it'd probably be pretty critical to estimate the necessary charge in the car battery to get a successful start since you'd only have so many starts, but theoretically you could install some sort of device to monitor voltage, current draw and oil temp to get a decent estimate. Probably not an excellent solution compared to existing boost packs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's possible.</p>
<p>But your external battery must have higher voltage than the car battery, to allow the transfer without the need for extra equipment.</p>
<p>You should also be aware that the internal resistance of a car battery is very low (it is made to allow high electrical current), and some external batteries like the ones used to charge phones will &quot;see&quot; that load (the car battery) as a short-circuit, because it will be draining a current too high. In other words, connecting a higher voltage phone battery to a lower voltage car battery would generate a high current that damages the phone battery - it is just not prepared to deliver too much current.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So this is actually a product that already exist in the market. Basically a 18650 battery bank similar to what you would charge a phone with. They charge up a large capacitor and allow you to jump a car or even truck multiple times. Theoretically if you had one of these already you could easily mcgyver the capacitor to connect to a phone battery. My point is that this is certainly possible and the tech exists in commodity products that cost about $60</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's very cool product! As I said, you'd need more equipment then just the cell battery.</p>
<p>Did you ever try to do that? I mean &quot;mcgyver the capacitor to connect to a phone battery&quot;, and then charge that product? What I wrote at the end is that while theoretically possible, the energy losses would be too much. Of course this part is guessing and I could be wrong. Also I would love to see one of those youtube videos of someone doing it lol!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I personally haven't tried to mcgyver it myself! I do own one of the jump starters and they are amazing! I do agree that it's not really worth the effort. I think in terms of losses you'd should be fine since even if you had like 50% losses there should be more then enough total energy to get at least one &quot;charge&quot; of the capacitor.</p></div>		</li>
