			<div class="markdown"><p>Increase in mitochondria is actually one of the main adaptations to aerobic exercise; you're not too far off with &quot;reduction in fatigue.&quot; Mitochondria are largely intended for aerobic (slow but efficient) production of ATP, the body's energy currency, though they do also have a small anaerobic component. However, you can't just create huge density of mitochondria and expect the body to get &quot;stronger&quot; based on that alone, there are other changes that need to exist as well. For example, since mitochondria largely function in the presence of oxygen, capillary density and the heart's function need to improve as well in order to supply oxygen to mitochondria in arm or other skeletal muscles.</p>
<p>Heart muscles need to be extremely reliable and contract in a different way, so they have a different structure without parallel fibers and rely on aerobic production, hence all the mitochondria and oxygen availability. On the other hand, if you look at, say, an arm muscle, it sometimes needs to do &quot;fast&quot; work by anaerobic means, so it won't be centered as much around aerobic work like the heart. Some fibers in the muscle will be more suited for that faster anaerobic work since those skeletal muscles need a lot more versatility than the heart. In terms of your question, &quot;stronger&quot; might refer a bit more to the anaerobic means of production, and &quot;fatigue resistant&quot; might approximately correlate to aerobic production.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This also explains why Jedi have superior abilities, both mental and physical.</p>
<p>Having enhanced mitochondria allows them to resonate the field of energy, which all life gives off, at a rate greater than 10k hz. As any HAM knows, this is how radio waves are created and propelled.</p>
<p>Jedi are simply radio transmitters, and when they become advanced, they can receive transmission from both other Jedi and non-Jedi, hence the ability to read minds from afar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on what you mean by fatigue. </p>
<p>If you mean have an ability to keep your muscles in the clenched position indefinitely, e.g. holding on to something to keep from falling down, then no. That is controlled by nerve signals, independent of mitochondria. </p>
<p>As for endurance, I am not knowledgeable in that area, so I cannot give you an answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can’t be directly compared to other muscles you are more familiar with.<br />
Your day to day experience tells you that if you start running or lifting something heavy you quickly fatigue and it becomes harder and harder until you have to stop.<br />
It would be a mistake to try to think of your heart in the same way just because it is also a muscle.<br />
It’s a different type of muscle tissue and it has energy supplies that are almost impossible to exhaust under NORMAL operating conditions (assuming your blood is getting properly oxygenated and that blood is getting to all of your heart muscle).<br />
The muscle tissue can get damaged though just like other muscle tissue. And the electrical signals controlling its intricate rhythm can be knocked out of whack under extreme circumstances (electrolytes too low or out of balance, electrical shock, physical trauma, etc.).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really accurate. Tachycardia normally causes the heart to &quot;misfire&quot; because it is pumping blood so fast that the heart doesn't rest long enough to fill with more blood. It is more similar to an engine stalling and puttering out than getting tired.</p>
<p>Your heart basically is immune to fatigue, it will work harder and harder as the body needs it too without tiring. Most cardiac problems in fact are the heart muscle being too strong for a weakened body to withstand. </p>
<p>High blood pressure for example is dangerous because the arteries get damaged by the constant pounding from your heart and eventually weaken, harden and fail. The heart muscle itself is still relentless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Load. If you increase the load on the muscle, you can hypertrophy to accommodate moving the increased load. </p>
<p>If you keep the same load, but want to move it more often, you don't necessarily need to become &quot;stronger&quot; to move it more often, you just need to increase your ability to produce energy to facilitate that increased frequency. </p>
<p>It's kind of like how running long distances doesn't cause your muscles to hypertrophy in the same way as lifting weights does. </p>
<p>This is very much an oversimplification of some complex stuff happening in the heart, but it still works.</p></div>		</li>
