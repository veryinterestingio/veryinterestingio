			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s the bearing wearing out and the balls aren’t sitting in the race properly. Suddenly jarring them can temporarily put then back in the race and quiet them down.</p>
<p>Eventually it will get bad enough that the fan will just stop spinning altogether. Then it will get very quiet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Protip, if you care about the machine at all, case fans are cheap and easy to install. When my fans were dying recently, I got three fancy Noctua fans for like $12 a pop. My max GPU temp dropped like 5 degrees, and the fans are much much quieter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had that issue with my old PSU. The fan inside of it was failing and there's no way I'm cracking open a PSU to replace the fan so I left the case door off and every time it got out I'd smack the shit out of it. Worked for a few months, and eventually the whole PSU failed. Same thing happened to a case fan in my old case. I kept smacking it until it would quiet down. Eventually got a new case for various other reasons. It really works though!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Smart man! If you don't know how to discharge capacitors, opening those things up can be a shocking experience you may only get to experience once in your life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is basically the exactly right answer.  I’ve repaired electronics and electrical devices for the last 20 years, some built or designed before I was born.</p>
<p>There are other reasons as well, but this bit about connectors and contacts is very real. </p>
<p>Another issue is relays, an electrically controlled switch. The contacts inside of them can get stuck and a good whack gets them unstuck. There is a medical device I work on and occasionally this happens and I tell the users to give it a swift kick until I can get in and fix it.</p>
<p>Another issue is solder joints. They can crack and the component will be in place still but not making electrical contact. A good whack will wiggle it some and get it going again. </p>
<p>It’s funny you bring up hard drives. My dad was working on a sun workstation that had hard drive problems. The recommendation from sun was to take the hard drive out, hold it perfectly level a few inches above a hard table and drop it. Worked an absolute treat.  It started up and we were able to get everything off it before replacing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The drop trick is definitely good to know, but it should only be used as a last resort.</p>
<p>By holding it level, you minimize the likelihood that the read arms will damage the platters during the drop.</p>
<p>I still use the drop trick when attempting data recovery on not-so-critical data stores.  It's worked about 80% of the time for me.  Another good trick is the freezer trick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a video of some Russians trying to get an old ISU-152 to work. Apparently after the war they just parked it in the middle of a village as a &quot;monument&quot; to the great war. They didn't decommission it at all, the gun still worked. Anyways while they were trying to get it to work they blew the leaves and debris out of the cylinders, replaced some bad hoses and whatnot they started beating the shit out of it with a sledgehammer and eventually got it to start. It wouldn't go into first gear though but it ran and they were able to move it in reverse and I think throw it strait into 2nd from reverse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The video is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkeR9IWkJKE" target="_blank">here</a> there was an original article that accompanied the video though that explained the process but I cannot find it. The video does not really explain what they are doing or the situation. It does not show them actually using the sledgehammer but at the 1 minute mark you can see the guy with the sledgehammer. You can see at 9 minutes though them deactivating the gun (using a torch to put a hole in the gun) which meant it was a usable gun. You can see around 12 minutes them try to move the thing in 1st gear but it wont budge so they eventually get it to move in reverse. The article that came with it explained everything they did to get it to work that's how I know they threw it into 2nd gear from reverse in order to get it to move forward. I forget what the guy welding or cutting the metal at around 2 minutes had to do with it but it had something to do with needing to fashion some sort of broken or missing part. It was all in the article.</p></div>		</li>
