<p>Incidentally these glands tend to develop body odor around the same time you grow hair in your armpits and groin, that is puberty, hence why most lessons about &quot;bodily changes&quot; during puberty include body odor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fun fact: the exact composition (and resulting bacterial population supported) of sweat varies depending on your dominant sex hormone.  This is why men (usually) tend to have stronger body odor then women, and also why trans people on hormone replacement therapy often report changes in body odor.</p></div>		</li>
