			<div class="markdown"><p>All three are very valid, here's an addition.</p>
<p>The louder you go, the less imperfections you hear.</p>
<p>A little theory of mine:
If the music is equalized to have a &quot;V&quot; shape (loud highs, low mids, loud bass), or your headphones/earphones/speakers aren't that great, you might be more prone to turn the music up to sort of &quot;normalize&quot; the interpretation of the music unconsciously.</p>
<p>Of course this won't always be the case, some times you just turn it up for the sake of it, but it would sort of explain a lot.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Only kinda. When people want loud they like to turn music up until there is some saturation / distortion. In good recording studios it's fairly common for new people to keep turning the volume up and up and up to dangerous levels because the amplification and speakers systems are engineered to produce very low levels of distortion even at high sound pressure levels.</p></div>		</li>
