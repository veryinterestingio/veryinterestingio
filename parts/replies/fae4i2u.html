			<div class="markdown"><p>The details are beyond my immediate knowledge but I think you can look at /u/FalanxZealot's comment and arrive at a fairly good conclusion. If you look at silver, it shares many similar traits with gold, among which is that high purity silver also recrystallizes at room temperature, making it also very easy to cold work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Room temperature is a bit low (not by much though) for silver's recrystallisation temperature, but ultra high purity metals, due to their freedom from solute 'defects' tend to have miniscule work hardening rates. </p>
<p>Gold's melting point is about 100C higher than silver's, so the recrystallisation temperature is commensurately higher, too</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How high purity does it have to be?  Commerical fine silver can be worked much longer than sterling, but I've definitely had it harden on me.</p></div>		</li>
