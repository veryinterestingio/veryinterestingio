			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I’ve learned from a lecturer at University, the first of these points appears to be the way economists explain the behaviour. </p>
<p>The behaviour was first theorised by Harold Hotelling, who used the concepts of game theory to determine how two agents in direct competition act in this situation. The outcome can be said to be a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma" target="_blank">prisoner’s dilemma</a>, whereby a lack of trust between two competing agents means they both make a choice that exposes them to the lowest risk of an adverse outcome, usually either exposing their counterpart is some way or reducing their own gain, meaning the most inefficient outcome is met for both parties. </p>
<p>Hotelling attributes this specific outcome (competing firms bunching at the same location) as Hotelling’s Principle or  <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotelling%27s_law" target="_blank">Hotelling’s Law</a>. Both firms are scared of facing the 75/25 situation described above that they will actively remove this risk immediately by grouping. In a way I guess one firm getting this risk off the book means both firms do simultaneously, so that’s nice. </p>
<p>Seems a little bizarre at first given we should be smart enough to come to an efficient conclusion, but apparently the fear of losing an advantage means firms will settle for lower expected revenue to offset the risk of a competitor’s location change negatively affecting them.</p></div>		</li>
