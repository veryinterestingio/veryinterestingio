			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I try to stay consistent but answer a slightly different question. For example instead of naming my first dog, I'll use the name of my favorite dog. When it asks the city I got married in I answer with the city we met. </p>
<p>That way the questions can trigger my memory, but the answers can't be easily guessed if you know to much about me.</p></div>		</li>
