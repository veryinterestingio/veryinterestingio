			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. Tesla’s business goal isn’t profit. It redirects all profit back into R&amp;D to bring out lower priced cars at a higher volume.</p>
<p>It’s written out in Elon’s statement from the beginning:

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an economics guy, but, a friend explained something similar to me. The startup he works for is run with the express purpose of fast growth and increasing market valuation rather than making money. Everything they make is immediately put back in and he explained they keep running very close to red all the time, but that fuels their growth. Or something.</p>
<p>So this makes a lot of sense to me. Musk is running a multi-billion dollar company like a startup basically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is &quot;The Silicon Valley Way&quot;: don't worry about making money, just sacrifice <em>everything</em> to get market share, and sell out once you've gotten that market share (it's someone else's problem now!) </p>
<p>All Musk did was apply it to cars (and he even did it <em>in Silicon Valley</em> ... at least if you count Freemont as being in the valley).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. It's the silicon valley model, and allows for hyper growth. It does mean that it CAN collapse quickly (extremely unlikely for Tesla at this point), and that the company can go back and grab loans later if needed to continue their growth. It certainly doesn't always work, but when it does, you get Amazon, Tesla, Twitter, etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Tesla spends less on R&amp;D than every other major manufacturer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That could be due to the fail fast development method. It's been well known to decrease cost in the software/tech world that a lot of Tesla's main people come from.</p>
<p>Also vertical integration. They have two motors between all 4 models, the AC and the PM, and effectively two different battery packs, one for the S/X and one for the 3/Y (there are some differences between LR and Perf models).</p>
<p>Rather than do complex integrations with various control systems from outside suppliers they just integrate it all into their hardware/software.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Per model?</p>
<p>I’m sure Ford, for example, spends a lot more, but they have more than 50 different models, each with multiple engine choices and configurations. That takes a lot of R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Tesla has 3 models.</p>
<p>That’s a big difference.</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> Tesla spends more per model, but I’m happy to be proved wrong if anyone has some real figures?</p>
<p>EDIT: found a few figures.</p>
<p>In 2019 Volkswagen spent £12.2bn on R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Volkswagen has 42 different models of car available in the UK, probably more worldwide, each with a choice of multiple engine configurations. Keeping it (very) simple, that would be around £250mil per model.</p>
<p>Tesla spend £1.1bn on R&amp;D over 3 models. That’s £367mil per model.</p>
<p>Just as a rough guide.</p>
<p>Either way, it’s aside from the point. The point is that all the money goes back into the company, not paid out as profit. That’s the business model. It’s irrelevant how big or small the number is, the point is that it goes back into the business.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The value is based on the stock price, not the cashflow or assets.</p>
<p>The stock price is high because many people think it will grow, not because they are making high profits.</p>

<p>THE WORLD needs to grow its infrastructure quite a bit. We couldn't support public charging needs right now if the EV market went from 1 to 2% of the market tomorrow.</p></div>		</li>
