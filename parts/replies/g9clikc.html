			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have multiple jobs, even if you don't change brackets, the withholding will be wrong with the defaults. You don't get taxes for the first 12k so so you make so if you have two jobs at 40k and they are withholding as if you are making 40k, then will owe taxes on another 12k at your highest tax bracket. If the brackets change and since they are progressive, you'd have to do some more complex calculation to know how much to withhold from each of your jobs. The reason you the government doesn't do this ahead of time is because they don't know how much you would make each year. If you had these two 40k jobs, did your complicated math to adjust the withholding for both, then halfway through the year got a raise or you quit one of the jobs, then the math you did earlier is completely wrong. In addition, you can estimate it for fixed salaries, but not variable income. You (or the government) have no idea how much money you will make (or lose) trading securities that year. You or the government have no idea how much money you will make in tips. Although most people who get tips evade taxes on them anyway (extremely illegal) so that's a moot point.</p></div>		</li>
