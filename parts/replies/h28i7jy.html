			<div class="markdown"><p>So from my understanding. Both the mRNA vaccines, and viral vector vaccines, hijack cells-in a similiar way to an actual virus (minus the replication of a virus)-our own cells then express the foreign proteins, our immune system sees this and does its thing, building a defence to the foreign proteins and also destroying said cells expressing the foreign proteins?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This would also mean that any gene therapy approaches that express full-length versions of proteins affected by nonsense mutations are doomed to fail, since the host cell would presumably identify the &quot;rest of the protein&quot; being expressed as foreign, and would lead to the development of antibodies against it, does it not?</p></div>		</li>

<li>
<p>Gene therapy inserts genes into the nucleus of cells.  The mRNA in the Pfizer/Moderna vaccines are never inserted into your genome. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mRNA in the Pfizer and Moderna make the same protein spike that exists on the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and is (eventually) recognized by the immune system because of the way it binds to receptors. </p>
</li>
<li>Just because a gene therapy treatment makes a protein, does not mean that it will trigger an immune response.  The shape and composition of a gene therapy protein will not necessarily bind to sites on the cells or MHC proteins, thus not trigger the immune system.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have any sources for point 3? MHC molecules present short peptides of potential antigens to immune cells, and while there are some specific highly immunogenic peptides, there is no reason to believe that a random peptide unknown to the host (as would be the case in gene therapy-induced production of full length proteins of genes affected by nonsense mutations) would not have antigenic potential.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great summary, all I would say is that gene therapy is not defined by whether or not the payload reaches the nucleus. The mRNA vaccines are technically gene therapy if you are going by the conventional definition.</p></div>		</li>
