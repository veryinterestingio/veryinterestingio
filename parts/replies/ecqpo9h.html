			<div class="markdown"><p>What was your experience with that surgery like? Recovery time, intensity, what exactly you were correcting, etc. I've had terrible sinus issues and am curious if I may have a slightly deviated septum myself, so I've been considering looking into this kind of thing once insurance allows. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a deviated septum and have seen an ENT regarding the issue. Post surgery you’re looking at 2 weeks of no physical activity and packing your nose, about 6-8 for full recovery. I’ll probably get around to having the surgery one day </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had septoplasty done for a deviated septum. I had trouble breathing through my nose and when I could it would whistle all the time. My ENT was amazing. Recovery was ok, you have to deal with stints in your nose for a few weeks, but removing is one of the most satisfying feelings.</p>
<p>I immediately noticed how much easier it was to breathe, it made me sleep better, and it even straightened my nose out a bit. I would highly recommend seeing an ENT and talking about it if you've been having nasal issues for a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, the first week or two after the surgery I could already breathe better but it was annoying because I had stints in my nose and stuff oozing. But once they pulled those out... it was having a 2nd and 3rd mouth-size hold to breathe through, it felt like that big of a difference. Pain wise, I just remember being kinda sore but nothing terrible.  It's been a year though so the details are a bit hazy.</p></div>		</li>
