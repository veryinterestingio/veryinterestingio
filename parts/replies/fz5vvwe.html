			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes well, I understand that an artist wants her media to be consumed in the appropriate manner. But don't they understand that 90% of the people consuming it aren't doing it that way?   </p>
<p>For the last 25 years of my life, I have to sit there with a remote and turn down explosions, then turn up dialogue. Over. And over. And fucking over. They made TVs to try and compensate for it, they still don't do a good enough job.   </p>
<p>I can not express how overwhelmingly frustrated I am at having to turn the TV down to 10/100 volume for all the explosions and car chases, and then have to turn it up to 90/100 when they talk, or you CAN'T HEAR A DAMN THING.  </p>
<p>I would literally pay $100 for a piece of technology that analyzes sound patterns and amplifies dialogue in all movies by 100% and reduces all explosions and music by 100%. Like seriously.  Make a 'home soundtrack' and 'theater soundtrack' if you're so inclined. But to all the studio executives lurking this this thread: You're talented and skilled and an artist, but I fucking hate this one thing.  </p>
<p>That is all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. I like subtitles on everything. It also helps that I watch non English content that I need subtitles to understand. I've got so good at reading subtitles that I barely notice them but my brain registers what they say.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This kind of already exists, it's the dynamic range compression option that some receivers and TVs have. If you don't want (or your equipment can't handle) the super loud explosions that the original mix contained, that should make everything a more similar volume.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My receiver came with a mic you can plug in and then you run a 'test' that makes all your speakers make weird noises in sequence and then automatically makes adjustments to each speaker to make the sound optimal for the room you are in/the quality of speakers. My favorite part is the subwoofer test. It makes me giggle</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but if it weren't for reddit we wouldn't have this expert answer, either. Almost no matter where you are, if you ask a question about a niche expertise, most people you reach won't be an expert in that subject. At least this gives you the unlikely option of hearing from an actual expert, even if most people aren't one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not the mixing engineers fault it’s Dolby’s. They are just mixing to what Dolby tells them. </p>
<p>I’m a TV broadcast engineer and we got to stupid  lengths to keep Dolby happy but less than 1% of people at home actually have the correct Dolby decoder to match what is being encoded/mixed. </p>
<p>Dolby release a “new” surround sound codec every few years so you need to update you decoder/amp amp every few years to match what is being sent. Dolby fucking sucks and should die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's designed to work well on systems other than what is actually planned to be used? That seems like a poor design decision, no way around it. Design for your target market; theater and home are different products. IMO anyone who buys a DVD without specially remastered audio has been completely ripped off. And the real high quality ones will have multiple audio options.</p></div>		</li>
