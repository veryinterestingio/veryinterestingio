			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad was a cop in SF on the mounted unit. He said the horses would always get <em>super</em> skittish whenever they got anywhere near the lion or tiger exhibits at the zoo.</p>
<p>Weird how animals just know that even though they would have no contact in the wild.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard of enrichment activities in zoos before. I was watching some doc on sun bears in an Australian zoo, and they hide his food in different places so he'll spend his day foraging rather than eating and loafing. Pretty neat stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My lab has eaten at least three pairs of Bluetooth headphones including a pair of $250+ Marley's, a couple games controllers, more shoes than I can count, more boxes than I remember, a couple beds, a few blankets, and more stuffed toys than I know. Obviously some of those are made for him to chew, but still. I might need to consider doggy daycare once in a while for him and his sister. (The chewing would get worse if they went on separate days lol)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Border collies are brutal. I love the dman dog but sometimes grrr. Doggy door &amp; $1000 worth of fence is the only thing that's keeping my couch &amp; house from getting any more shredded when I go to work.</p>
<p>We just bought a new house. Fenced in the yard right away but didn't get to the doggy door right away. My older dog is fine. He just sleeps when he's bored. She ripped the vinyl siding off the house right next to the door. She ripped huge holes in the lattice work on the deck. Fought &amp; chewed her way out of her chain link fence kennel. All within the 1st week of moving in. </p>
<p>Put in the doggy door. She's been perfect again like she was at the old house. She can go in &amp; out as she pleases. Spoiled jerk.</p></div>		</li>
