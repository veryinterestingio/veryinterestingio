			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, and I'd say while the quality of a finished dish is absolutely important, you can get a pretty close idea of a chef's skill (and what the final dish will taste like, barring some terrible error) by tasting different parts of it through the whole prep process. There's no reason a dish's final taste should be a surprise to anyone (especially the chef!!!), so you don't actually need to wait for the finished product other than to assess the plating or something.</p></div>		</li>
