			<div class="markdown"><p>Any first stage, innate immune reaction will start with neutrophils (or other granulocytes), and monocytes/macrophages.   I believe in this cotext, DCs don't do much &quot;controlling&quot; they generally/mostly act as APCs (antigen presenting cells) for adaptive immunity - they pickup the debris leftover from the granulocyte/invader battle and present the invader bits to t-cells to start the development of an adaptive response.</p>
<p>Sorry, that doesn't really answer your original question - I think you would be fairly symptomatic if you had a substantial innate immune response.  I think the asymptomatic/symptomatic split must have something to do more globally with how  inflammatory that individuals response is.  At the cellular level, how much cellular recruitment of more immune cells is going on, vs, the neutrophils saying, &quot;nah we got this - no need to call in the reserves&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. Whoops I misspoke on the DCs. Do you think that cytokines like IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-a aren’t released in asymptomatic patient’s immune response?</p></div>		</li>
