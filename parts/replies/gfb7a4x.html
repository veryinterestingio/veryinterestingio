<p>I see this all the time. Isn’t it a little irresponsible? There is no way to say “we know there are longterm effects, we just don’t know what they are.” Not just because not a lot of time has passed, but because such a statement is just impossible to explain. How can you know that there are “other” effects without knowing anything about what those effects are? There are signs it could cause lasting lung damage but why do we feel the need to tell people this will have “other” lasting effects that we haven’t even discovered yet?</p></div>		</li>

<p>When you have limited evidence and there are documented cases of those kinds of long term effects, it's better to assume it's common and work around that.  If you go &quot;we're not sure, so carry on as normal,&quot; it's <em>very</em> easy to stumble into a scenario where you have millions subjected to those effects before you have real confirmation.</p>
<p>When it comes to major impacts like that, you always want to err on the side of caution. If you're wrong, yeah there are some consequences, but it's nothing compared to if you said it was not a big deal and were wrong about that and millions die or are crippled as a result.</p></div>		</li>
