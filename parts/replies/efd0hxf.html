I wasn't on subs, but a close friend of mine was a bubble head and he said that they had huge areas on their maps that were marked off and that they couldn't go there because either whales were spotted there or that was a common place for them to be during their migration I can't remember which exactly could have been both.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey! So, first of all - good thought!
So, sonar works so well because acoustic signals permeate water well. Electromagnetic waves (radio waves, light waves etc) don't do so well. Magnetic fields permeate better than EM waves, however they are much harder to control and generate. That said, there are some products that divers can use that use magnetic fields for communication, but they are very limited in range.</p>
<p>So to answer your first question - acoustic sonar is the only real viable solution that we know of.</p>
<p>Whales communicate with calls in the 100-500 Hz range, which indicates that they can hear at least down to that frequency range. They also use bio-sonar for food that generates signals upwards of 100,000 Hz, so it's pretty safe to say whales can hear between 100 Hz - 100kHz. High-frequency acoustic signals don't permeate through water easily, in fact they don't permeate through any medium very well, however low-frequency signals do - this is why outside of a club you can hear the bass but not the vocals.</p>
<p>So to answer your second question, we'd have to generate a signal that is well below their hearing range, because signals above their hearing range simply won't work. Generating low-frequency signals in water takes an immense amount of energy, and the only real solutions we have right now are air guns and explosives. Both of these solutions also generate mid-high frequency noise that can scare, cause pain, and possibly deafen whales.</p>
<p>There is a lot of on-going research to develop a system capable of generating low frequency signals without generating damaging mid-high frequency signals, however there is no commercially available product at the moment.</p>
<p>Source: I have worked on a project designed to do exactly that. The project is still in the research / prototype phase, but is moving towards an operational system, and will hopefully be on the market within the next 5 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brb, I saw a post this morning talking about low frequency sonar, I gotta go find it</p>
<p>From u/Erratic_Kamikaze</p>
<p>Navy Mid-Frequency Active Sonar (MFA) fires off anywhere from about 120dB to 250dB, depending on requirements based on assumed range of the contact and environmental conditions. For those not familiar, the Decibel is a logarithmic measurement, meaning the amount of energy used to generate the sound doubles every 3dB. 120dB is the volume level of a chainsaw, measured from one foot away from the source. 155dB is the volume of a gunshot. 250dB underwater will kill you fairly quickly.</p>
<p>In the right environmental conditions MFA can hold contact on a surface vessel (only the bottom of the boat catching sound and reflecting back) 50 miles away.</p>
<p>These details concerning MFA are unclassified, and freely available. I’ve personally witnessed this. I’ve seen whales on my display while we were active. MFA doesn’t bother them, even with all that power due to it being a similar frequency to their own calls. They themselves (Blue Whales) can reach a volume of up to 188dB. As pointed out by a comment below, vocalizations by Sperm Whales have been recorded at up to 230dB</p>
<p>Low-Frequency Active Sonar (LFA) is more classified. Due to the frequencies being lower, it takes even more power to generate it. It can (and this is  acknowledged by the Navy) kill sea life. It also fires at a much higher dB. It’s loud enough to be treated more like the shock-wave of an explosion instead of noise. LFA is the bad one, but the Navy chooses to continue its use on SURTASS (Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System) vessels due to range and accuracy of the system as a whole. Those serve more of a peaceful surveillance role as opposed to a tactical one, but in conjunction with a warship are a powerful tool.</p>
<p>It is required that LFA and MFA be cut off if sea life is observed, but this requirement can be waived due to mission requirements. I believe the program is called PMAP (Protective Measures Assessment Protocol). The Captain of the vessel can make the decision, but must report it to his governing command, and it will most likely be evaluated later to see if it was needed.</p>
<p>The US Navy isn’t really that bad of a noise-polluter. If it is discovered that Active Sonar was knowingly used around sea-life (whales, dolphins, turtles, anything visible really) for no good reason the consequences are pretty severe. The Navy isn’t nonchalant about it.</p>
<p>Sonar is pretty old technology, Russia and China both have roughly the same tech we have. I can guarantee they don’t have a PMAP equivalent program though.</p>
<p>I'm not writing an opinion piece or anything, but I figured I’d drop some info for anyone interested. I love this stuff so I can go all day.</p>
<p>Edited for grammar and extra detail, changed “SERTASS” to “SURTASS”.</p>
<p>Here is a ping recorded underwater for anyone curious. Due to proximity to the coast, that ship is minimum 12 nautical miles away, and in the description it says the noise was so loud some of the divers retreated from the water. <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EAqUelpwEl8" target="_blank">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EAqUelpwEl8</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SONAR frequencies are chosen based on what sounds best transmit through the water.  That is also how nature evolved whale sonar, so the effective frequencies overlap for both SONAR and for whales.  In addition, SONAR has to be very, very loud so that it can travel long distances.  SONAR that the whales couldn't hear wouldn't function effectively as SONAR because it would be an inopportune frequency or not loud enough (or both.)</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes and no. Low frequency sonar works fine, it's just more difficult to get a bearing measurement from. You'd need to design / space your sensors out more to detect lower frequency signals. It's also just much harder to generate low frequency signals.</p></div>		</li>
