Two weeks after Astrazeneca (15 days), Moderna and Janssen (both 14 days). Don't know enough about the difference between the two mRNA vaccines to know why that 1 week difference exists though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. Are you guys waiting 3 weeks for 2nd dose of Pfizer and 4 weeks for 2nd dose of Moderna like the US? I know the UK decided to wait longer between doses.</p>
<p>Based on the trial results, there's nothing special about 2 weeks after 2nd dose for mRNA vaccines. They just needed a guideline for people to follow.</p>
<p>Some of that wait time I suspect is to cover those that get infected shortly after getting the vaccine (but before it kicks in). That longer waiting period before being declared &quot;fully vaccinated&quot; gives them time to remain cautious while they may be contagious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes there are probably some people who would assume they are invincible after getting the jab, so it's probably a good thing that people are made aware that the vaccine takes a while to kick in fully.
It's officially a 4 week wait for all 2nd doses here now, but things have seriously ramped up in recent weeks to get people vaxxed before delta gets a further grip as we prepare for back to school and reopening indoor dining etc. I've my 2nd dose of Pfizer tomorrow after 3 weeks, so they are cutting it down as more supply becomes available. We have been vaccinating first higher risk, and then by age groups, which was quite slow until July when we reached the 30s age groups, but now offering vaccines to everybody over 16, and over 12s age group will begin later in August. Uptake is very high here thankfully.</p></div>		</li>
