			<div class="markdown"><p>100m/s would be 10ms to go a meter. That's faster than standard 200ms reaction times, but not completely negligible or immeasurable, am I wrong? An extra half a meter of nerve to to through would be 5ms or 2.5% slower reactions?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is some slowdown at the end of each nerve when it needs to go through the synapse, and muscles need to contract too, so that would explain why the reaction time is not as fast as the myelinated nerve speed. I mentioned that because the myelinated nerve is the only part that would vary based on height, and itâ€™s very fast compared to unmyelinated nerves, which IIRC are like 2 m/s, which would be slow enough to be noticeable. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Although not entirely pertinent to your question, it might not go to the brain if there's a reflex arc. If you touch a hot stove, the sensory fibers bring the pain/hot signal to your spine, where it synapses with the corresponding motor nerve to jerk your hand without ever having reached the brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reflexes originate from the spinal cord, but yes, theoretically it would be excitation -&gt; spinal cord -&gt; reaction.</p>
<p>EDIT: Actually, nevermind, not all reflexes originate from the spinal cord, the patellar reflex for example (the one that happens when you knock someone's knee with that little hammer) happens directly at the quadriceps. In this case, height wouldn't matter much, since the signal has a really short way to travel.</p></div>		</li>
