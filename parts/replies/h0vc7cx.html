			<div class="markdown"><p>Last time I spoke to one I got them on the phone then I screamed into my phone as loud and for as long as I could. I asked if they wanted to call me again? They hung up I didn't hear from anyone for 3 months.</p>
<p>&quot;Comcast&quot; called me about 3 weeks ago. I had the guy going for like 6 or 7 minutes. He asked for my name and address. I was like &quot;But you called me? You should have it pulled up there. In fact, why don't you give me my name?&quot; &quot;You want me to give you name?&quot; (That's how he said it) &quot;Yeah, you called me so my account information should already be up, can you go ahead and tell me my name and address?&quot; &quot;You want... I need you to verifyâ€”&quot; &quot;No sir, when you call me I verify you are who you say you are. But you're not are you?&quot; &quot;Listen here you little shit. You asshole. You fuck me around? You waste my time? Your mother is whore.&quot; (I'm fucking dying laughing, he's tryna tell &quot;Yo' Mama&quot; jokes.) Haven't heard from those assholes again either.</p></div>		</li>
