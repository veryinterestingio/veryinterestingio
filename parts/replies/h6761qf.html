			<div class="markdown"><p>How common is the belief that it is infinite?  I was under the impression that the belief that everything is expanding after the big ang puts a limit on the &quot;size&quot; of the universe. I guess it depends on what we mean by universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The observable universe is finite.  There are other definitions that are equally finite.</p>
<p>The entire universe is...we don't know. </p>
<p>The math seems to hint that it's infinite.  Certainly the math gets more difficult if we try to make it finite, and added complexity is a sign (but not proof!) that we are on the wrong track. </p>
<p>We also don't seem to see any particular differences that would hint that an edge was nearby, even if not technically observable.  So if it is finite, we are far enough away from the edge that we can't tell.</p>
<p>Most scientists who believe it is finite do so because of preexisting beliefs.  The argument usually has the form of &quot;nothing physical can be infinite, therefore the universe isn't either.&quot;  If that's the kind of argument that convinces you, then ok.  For me, it's too &quot;just so&quot; for my taste.  I think most scientists agree.</p>
<p>One very unfortunate explanation of the Big Bang that seems to crop up everywhere is to show a little point all by itself that suddenly gets really big.  This is not correct, at least in the sense that we have any data that supports it.  Now if we follow back our *observable* universe, then we will find that it was in a very tiny area.  That scans.  </p>
<p>What we don't know is just how much that little dot represented the *entire* universe.  Almost nobody thinks it's the whole thing.  Some think that the dot was part of a larger but still finite universe.  Most think that the dot was part of an already infinite universe.</p>
<p>So the universe was infinite.  And then it got bigger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a weird dream once that the big bang was a black hole that we are seeing from the other side of being pulled through. Coming from a extremely massive singularity point of a blackhole and on the &quot;other side&quot; being &quot;spit out&quot; in all directions, infinitely floating away from that single point into infiniteness. Because as you get closer to the middle of a blackhole youre less effected by time, so the thought was that at the very middle that time just...isnt and thats the beginning and end  and everything in between all at once.</p>
<p>I know my brain has no idea wtf its talking about in subconscious dreams like that, but I always thought it was an interesting idea that when i am awake just sounds really dumb. I guess it was just trying to sort things out and just decided that was its rationale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That last sentence perfectly illustrates why I love space and science. The universe was infinite, then it got bigger. Thoughts like that are just so not understandable lol. It’s all so crazy and weird and out of our element. Here I am, sitting in a chair, bored on a Friday at work, watching the clock for 5, sneaking in some Reddit time with nothing to do, and all the while, the whole damn insane universe is doing insane who-knows-what everywhere at all points in an infinite landscape of things that are so big and old and faraway that I’m essentially nonexistent. But I exist enough to appreciate it, bored at work on a Friday, sitting in a chair some other bored worker made once, watching the clock til it’s time to go home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now I'm curious, is the definition for an infinite sized universe simple enough to be like the length of piece of string in a loop is infinite from start to end as it has no technical start or end despite being very finite in actual size, (ie is looping back upon itself enough to make it infinite?), or does it truly need to go on forever?</p>
<p>Edit: for that matter, if the universe is the only thing that exists, is that enough to call it infinite as it contains everything?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being infinite is the prevailing view at the moment, but cosmology is super hard and super new so that view might yet change as we get better tools.</p>
<p>It's also super important to be specific because there's two related concepts that are easy to mix up:</p>
<p>The entire universe is thought to be infinite (and flat, but that's another topic). It is expanding in the sense that points that are currently close will in the future be further apart, but this doesn't imply the universe is getting bigger or expanding into something else because it's already infinite.</p>
<p>The observable universe is finite (at approx lifespan of the universe multiplied by speed of light) and is expanding into the rest of the universe as light has now had the chance to reach us from further away.</p>
<p>Did that help?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it is infinite in size how do you logic out of the big bang.</p>
<p>It was once a dot.  With a clear boundary.  Then it expanded a lot.  Now its infinite.</p>
<p>How can you define when the boundary disappeared?</p></div>		</li>
