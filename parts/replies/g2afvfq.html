			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey Homer, did you dig up my garden to get flower for your float?</p>
<p>Can't have a float without flowers.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess so. But did you have to salt the earth so that nothing would ever grow there again?</p>
<p>Hehe...yeah.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the big strategies Genghis had for the invasion of Kwarezm was to redirect the silk road through and more streamlined and taxable route. To do so he completely destroyed any towns or cities not on his planed route.</p>
<p>In the same vein Mongol tactics heavily used fear as a weapon. They completely destroy and butcher those who opposed them, and then spare those who surrender immediately. Most stories of Mongol brutality were spread by the Mongols themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it's like how the popular story goes that Rome salted the earth of Carthage but really they just took it over and made them pay food tithes to help feed the empire. Why fuck up arable land when you can just, y'know, use it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have one specifically on Genghis era really from his birth to passing and how his son's who ruined what he built. I listened via audible and loved it. It explains their governance pretty well as during his reign it was probably their most unified so it goes over what it was like before, the transition, and during his reign.</p>
<p>Book: Genghis Khan and the making of the Modern World.  </p>
<p>Mongols carried their history orally much like the original english (pictish) before the anglo-saxon invasion so it's difficult to get lengthy detailed history of government and military from start to finish.</p>
<p>Edit: just to add Genghis was a fucking badass. His story of his rise to Khan after being an outcast  is insane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Add to that, one would assume that a conqueror would want their conquered land to be useful. It’s pretty stupid to make it infertile.</p>
<p>Edit: Cue the “Well Ackshually!”s, discussing the arability of Mongolia, the land Khan controlled, and the Soviets of the past 100 years.
My point was that “salting the earth” was mostly myth, agreeing with /u/SYLOH that it was an exceedingly expensive and useless endeavor, plus, it’s just dumb to make land utterly useless, plus, Genghis Khan conquered more than just Mongolia, you fuckwads! His empire was very extensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Genghis khan is famous for totally annihilating anyone who opposed or challenged his armies and rule.  I guess he just controlled so much that one country/ state/ culture was no real loss.  The fear of the story probably had value as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there is one thing you have plenty of in an empire spanning from Central Asia, Siberia to Manchuria, its land. The shortage is in people to work it and that is still true today.</p>
<p>The institution of Serfdom, of pretty much slavery but with them being tied to the land rather than a specific master (and thus not able to leave those lands), persisted in Imperial Russia until the 1860's. Then in Soviet times it wasn't a coincidence that hard labour camps were set up out east rather than in the more European west.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually quite untrue. When the Mongols invaded northern China, there was a serious debate over whether they should just slaughter everyone and let the grass grow, so the place would become a steppe that's nice for horses. </p>
<p>It took a Khitan noble in Genghis' camp to convince him that it would be better to let the Chinese live, and they could give him far more wealth that way (which was true).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Iirc, secret history of the mongols ends with the death of Genghis khan</p></div>		</li>
