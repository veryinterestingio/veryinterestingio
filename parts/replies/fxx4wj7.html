</blockquote>
<p>That's the thing, since all the genes required for a cell to travel is already in it <em>before</em> it becomes cancer, you don't need a mutation in the traditional sense to set it off, just a slight change in how the DNA of the cancer is balled up. </p>

<p>A bit of both. </p>
<p>Cancer cells can give off various chemicals which cause nearby healthy cells to behave a certain way, <em>and</em> they can multiply unendingly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Paraneoplastic syndrome is an example of this and is scary as hell. My dad presented with gullian barre like symptoms. IVIG (12 rounds) did nothing. He had severe ataxia (loss of coordination and muscle weakness, he woke up one day and couldn't stand, never walked again). His spinal tap had the same markers as GBS, extra protein, and he kept needing blood transfusions. Physiotherapy did nothing. His MRI (brain and spine) were clear.</p>
<p>8 months and many transfusions later a doctor realized what it was. Due to the part of the brain affected, it was either lymphoma (not the worst) or small cell lung cancer (worst case scenario). It was the latter. MRI showed it everywhere. Brain, liver, lungs, spine...</p>
<p>They diagnosed it. Treatment would have done more bad than good. He died within 2 weeks. It was so fast. It was awful. The cancer set his immune system against his brain. They knew it was autoimmune but all tests were negative. And then they weren't. But they thought of other autoimmune disorders, which are still rare, but paraneoplastic syndrome is really rare.</p>
<p>Even if he had been properly diagnosed the day the ataxia kicked in, there was no chance. Small cell lung is bad, really bad, few treatments, 17% one year survival rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm trying to think of a cancer that could induce malignancy. Certainly there are many types that could cause other cell types to grow or divide. Even benign neuroendocrine tumors would be an obvious example. But to induce <em>unending</em> division (i.e. malignancy)? I can't think of any, do you know examples?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mutate is a bad word. Mutation is a natural process that occurs when copying dna is flawed. Cancer cells use their enzymes to cut the tissues to infiltrate it, their growth factors to create pathways supplying them with food and oxygen and generally mold their environment. But they don't per se change the programming of the cells, just how it's executed.</p>
<p>Oh and no topic: I work at a pneumonology ward, and most of our patients die of pulmonary embolisms(cancer makes faulty blood vessels, which cause clots; it can also introduce more clotting factors) or respiratory failure but cancer can kill someone by for instance &quot;eating their food&quot; or growing on a wall of a big blood vessel and rupturing(it's not build to create solid tissue, due to how random it is) or growing enough to obstruct blood flow or the intestines.</p>
<p>So yeah, many many ways.</p></div>		</li>
