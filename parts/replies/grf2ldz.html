<p>I'm sorry I think you meant a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5Ftm1-jik" target="_blank">FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER</a></p>
<p>sorry could not resist but the video might be interesting to OP as well</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Transformers don't convert between AC and DC. A transformer as a component only exchanges voltage for current or vice versa. They don't work via resistance, but inductance. By wrapping a wire around one end of a semi-toroidal ferrous core, you can induce an alternating magnetic field through the core. If you then wrap more wire around the other side, this alternating field induces alternating current in that wire. The output current and voltage depend on the inductance of the core and the relative number of wraps on the input and output coils. More output wraps means higher voltage, lower current and vice versa. </p>
<p>The component responsible for converting AC to DC is called a rectifier. There are several different kinds, but in general, they use diodes to guide the alternating current in such a way that the current across the load (whatever is downstream from the rectifier) is direct. You're correct that smoothing capacitors are frequently employed to condition the supplied power so that it's even and predictable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electrical engineer here - You are sorta kinda a little bit there, but not quite. Transformers need AC to work and power is indeed transferred when the magnetic fields in the coils change. However, that is not why low power devices are low power. The transformers just change the voltage which is like electric pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Transformer can for example turn a high voltage with low current to low voltage with high current. The important thing is power in and power out stays the same.(disregarding for losses)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think perhaps I'm thinking of a different type of power adapter (switching vs. transformer).  Am I talking nonsense here?  I thought this was OP's original question.</p></div>		</li>
