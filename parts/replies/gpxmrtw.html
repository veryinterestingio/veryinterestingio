			<div class="markdown"><p>One quick tweak - electric motors have power curves just like ICEs, they can't deliver full power from dead stop. They can deliver full torque from a dead stop, which is really what you want, but the torque decreases as speed increases - for most electric motors, peak power output is at half of its freerun speed. Thus, it would actually be theoretically more efficient if electric motors did have a gearbox, but the benefits are tiny compared to the extra weight and complexity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My knowledge of this stuff is somewhat limited - what is &quot;freerun speed&quot;? Is that when the 3-phase motor RPM approaches the max frequency the controller is capable of switching at or something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trending out of ELI5 territory, but all DC electric motors (brushless 3-phase motors included - they're considered DC, I know, it's weird) act as both motors and generators - at the same time. The faster a motor spins the greater the induced voltage on each of its windings, called the back-EMF. If you apply a voltage greater than back-EMF to the coil, it will make the motor spin, but the total applied voltage the the coil will be the supplied voltage minus the back-EMF voltage, which means the current in the coil will be lower than you'd expect. At one point, the back-EMF starts to equal the applied voltage, at which point the motor can't spin any faster - in reality, many other things producing drag will result in the back-EMF being somewhat lower than applied voltage at this point, but I digress. This speed is the maximum speed the motor can go at that voltage level, which is the same as its no-load speed, or as I referred to it, its freerun speed. You may have noticed many electric motors have a kV rating - the units differ, but that refers to how much back-EMF is generated per RPM (or something equivalent). Multiply that kV rating by your applied voltage to get freerun speed, because that's when applied and back-EMF will be equal.</p>
<p>ELI5 version: electric motors also act as generators that oppose your attempts to use them like motors, even when you're using them like motors, and the faster they go, the more power they produce. You have to give it even more power to overcome the power its generating, but the faster it spins, the more power it generates. Eventually you'll hit a speed where they balance out, and at a given voltage level, that's as fast as your motor can spin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Brammo Impulse sport bike has a 6 speed manual transmission with a clutch, it is amazing to ride. You can feel a power difference between each gear to give you more control. You could ride around all day in 6th to save power, or bounce between gears on a track to improve performance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're missing a key part of the equation. There is the clutch / torque converter that allows for slippage of the motor below a certain RPM. Gears are there to allow for more efficent delivery of power but are not strictly required even in a gas automobile. A great example of a car without gears is a 1962 Buick Lesabre with a 1 speed Dynaflow automatic transmission. There was a competion between automakers to get the smoothest gear shifts, and the buick won with no shifting required. The torque converter wouls slip up to 55 mph then lock. The downside is poor fuel economy with 6 mpg out of a 401 cubic inch v8.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With all due respect, I don't see how that's really a missing piece of the story. Torque converters are nothing more than wasteful (as in energy is being wasted) clutches which provide a more pleasant driving experience. They allow non-manually clutched engines to idle and deliver power gradually as needed. They're just a way of connecting an output shaft to an input shaft in a gradual way.</p></div>		</li>
