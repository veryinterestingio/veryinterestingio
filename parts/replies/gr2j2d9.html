			<div class="markdown"><p>if you've got three months the worst is behind you (it seems six weeks is the most dangerous)</p>
<p>the longer you've quit the easier it gets.  yeah, you might get the occasional urge but it's more like a passing thought than a junkie's mad craving</p>
<p>just one thing:  NEVER SMOKE ANOTHER CIGARETTE.  unless you want to start smoking again.  i know people that had quit for months, one lady had quit for over a year, and tempted fate.... within in a week she was back up to a pack a day</p>
<p>THERE'S NOTHING POSITIVE ABOUT SMOKING</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm about to complete week 6 on Friday. Week 4 was honestly the worst it's been. I felt like my entire body was screaming. Currently I'm just at the rare strong urge but I'm holding strong. Was at a small gathering with heavy smokers and I didn't even have a craving the whole nightü§ò</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean... There are some positive things about smoking. Let's not be purposely hyperbolic. The amount of people I've met smoking, the social aspect, the calming time outside when you just need to get away, the enjoyment of the taste, the various settings and smoke spots you become fond of, the conversations over a smoke with a friend or a lover, and just the overall enjoyment of the act of smoking are positive things. I could list many more. Yeah, there's nothing positive about smoking in a physical/health sense, but let's not be absolute and say there's absolutely nothing positive about smoking at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I quit for 6 years and ended up in an impact treatment center where almost everyone smoked. After a particularly shitty day I bummed a smoke, then was hooked again for 4 months even though I really didn't want to.</p>
<p>Never again (I fucking hope!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the idea of lozenges, but minty sugar all day every day sucks.  I‚Äôve tried gum, but you‚Äôre supposed to give it a chomp or two, then leave it for a while, rinse and repeat.  Well, it‚Äôs a piece of gum.  You want to chew it.  But chewing it like you normally would chew gum makes you want to puke, so there‚Äôs that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>just think of the way a can smells that has been used as an outdoor ashtray for a long time. that dirty tar smoke smell mixed with old water in the can. bonus points if it was a beer can with a little beer left in it. very distinct smell. that was my mental image as I was quitting when I got the craving for a cigarette</p></div>		</li>
