			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the correction. So if a 3D person 'spoke' to a 2D one, would he 'hear' it? Can sound exist in the 2nd dimension?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pure speculation of course but its possible this people develop some kind of hearing system, at the end of the day, sound is just a wave propagating throug different mediums, and that wave can propagate through a “flat” plane, same as light. Thing is, if they hear a 3rd dimension person speaking they’ll probably freak out as they hear but cannot see or sense where is that noise coming from. In other words, if the 3rd dimension person speaking is, for instance, on “top” of the 2D person, then the 2D person will feel the sound coming from inside him as well, only adding to the poor guy mental issues</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay. So far, so good. Let's say a 4D person spoke to <em>me</em> this time. Those mediums you mentioned, I assume the 3-dimensional space around me is included in that, right? Because sound is carried by wind, which may move in all directions?</p>
<p>Anyway, are there additional mediums in the 4th dimension which would, in a way, make <em>their</em> voice sound weird to 3D me? God I hope that question makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This raises the question whether a 2D plane being subjected to vibrations from a top dimensions would </p>
<p>a) have any effect on the plane, and whether the denizens on the 2D plane would notice something</p>
<p>b) if not, how that should be interpreted; where did the energy/information disappear to? Remain in the higher dimension? </p>
<p>c) Does absorption constitute an inexplicable information loss in the 3D world (operating under the assumption that the 3D world can't measure the 2D plane effectively, with its sub-Planck-length infinite  thinness)? </p>
<p>d) could (with the flatlanders' full knowledge) be used for communication, or whether no instrument they can produce can detect the vibration.</p>
<p>e) what does vibrating a 2D surface philosophically even mean.</p></div>		</li>
