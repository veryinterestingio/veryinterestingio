			<div class="markdown"><p>Omg. That is why .... oh my! I never realized. I live near an alley of cherry trees and In the  spring/summer when it rains, there will be SO MANY squashed cherries and cherry pits on the ground and I never really asked myself why that is ... because the street is usually littered with a few cherries but not that many. That makes so much sense now.</p></div>		</li>
