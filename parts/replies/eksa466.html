			<div class="markdown"><p>So is it possible to sleep 5 hours and feel great because you got enough REM cycles. Would that be enough sleep? I dream a lot, I can have vivid dreams with a five minute nap that feel like 15 minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are definitely people out there who don't need as much sleep to function normally, and others who need more.  There's also evidence suggesting that people can train their bodies to sleep deeper or lighter, or tweak their REM to some extent, through mental exercises or meditation. And feeling more awake after a power nap vs. an extended snooze is very real.</p>
<p>Your surroundings, mood, mental energy, health, and genetics all likely play a factor.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If dreams last more than 18 hours contact your physician.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it depends but 5 hours can be enough. If you're sleep deprived, you fall into REM quicker and for longer in order to catch yourself up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is some research that suggests your brain is able to go into REM sleep immidiately, not only after 60 to 90 minutes that it usualy needs. However, that is a response to chronic lack of sleep that the brain adopts to at least get <em>some</em> REM. So I really doubt it is healty in the long run or even at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>100% completely unscientific and non-medical speculation, but observe his sleep and see if is he a snorer who suddenly stops snoring, then snort-restarts the snoring.    </p>
<p>People with sleep apnea can sleep all night without actually getting rested. The stop in snoring is a stop in breathing, and the snort-restart is the body realizing it's not getting oxygen and 'waking' itself up just enough to start breathing again (but not awake enough for you to realize this has happened).   </p>
<p>Using a CPAP machine, my colleague went from waking roughly once per minute to about 3 times an hour. He (re)gained a lot of energy after he got it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I suffer from Obstructive Sleep Apnea as does my brother. both of us also have other conditions making cpap not an option for us. we are both chronically totally exhausted and can barely function. It is rough. If he can use cpap he will feel much much better.</p></div>		</li>
