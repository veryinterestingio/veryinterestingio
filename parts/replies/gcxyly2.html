<p>Unfortunately the tech is going the other way. The industry is (quite reasonably) competing to lower the cost per gigabyte, and the sacrifices to increase density and lower cost all tend to reduce endurance. Things like decreasing the size of the flash cell, or storing three and even four bits per cell instead of one or two.</p>
<p>It's a good thing overall - I can buy a 1TB SSD now for the same price I bought my first 40GB SSD a decade ago, with the new drive being several times faster. </p>

<p>There is - Intel's 3D XPoint memory in their Optane drives. Much faster, more durable, and of course more expensive. It sits somewhere between SSDs and RAM in both speed and cost per gigabyte. Maybe it'll overtake NAND flash someday in cost, but it looks like flash-based SSD prices continue falling faster than Optane-based ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really interesting information there and it makes quite the sense. I hope the cost/gig race hits a lower limit and they go on with having to increase the quality instead.</p>
<p>It's the first time I hear the Intel drive, although I don't follow it all that close so it is reasonable. I'll look forward to its development!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Economies of scale are in favor of NAND. There is just so much more being made that the incremental steps of cost saving add up faster.</p>
<p>There is just not enough x-point made yet (or capacity to make) to get to similar annual cost savings or Intel/micron are not passing on enough of their cost savings to the customer, betting that no other new tech will arrive in that segment of speed/price/reliability until they can reduce cost more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cost of storage today is bonkers. I feel like some people still haven’t caught on either. I can get a 128 GB SSD from a name brand manufacturer for like $20 bucks off amazon. It’s not the best SSD in the world, however throwing that into a 6 year old laptop that has a mechanical drive breaths all kind of new life into it. </p>
<p>In college my laptop died, so my dad gave me his old 7+ year old machine. He complained it was way to slow for him now, but would be fine for me to do homework on. Dropped $40 bucks on a small SSD, did a clean install of windows, and it worked better than my old, but newer, laptop (which still had a mechanical drive).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually improved massively over the last decade or so, but instead of increasing write cycles--which isn't terribly limiting now--that margin has been turned into capacity--which is likely the primary sales driver.</p>
<p>Today's SSDs store several bits in a single memory cell, so instead of identifying two charge levels (1 bit) they have to identify 4, 8, or even 16.</p>
<p>When you buy a super-expensive, enterprise-class SSD, what you are paying for is mostly a low-bit-per cell tech to improve lifetime and decrease possible read errors. One bit less per cell is twice as expensive to produce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DNA is for long-term storage only. And by long, I mean hundreds to thousands of years.</p>
<p>The argument is this: Technology moves quickly. Reading a floppy drive now can be tricky, how can we store data in a way that we know we will <em>always</em> be able to read it?</p>
<p>Humans are always going to want to read DNA for medical reasons from now on. So storing information in DNA ensures it will be readable in the far future. It's not currently cost effective compared to storing on tape, but who knows if we'll be able to read magnetic tape in 100, 200 years?</p></div>		</li>
