			<div class="markdown"><p>Unlike most databases, a torrent database is essentially a database of all links to the data, rather than the data itself, so it's a small fraction of the size offered. It's also likely that TPB uses many databases rather than just one. So it's likely that any individual host might not need to download the entire thing, just whatever they can afford to. This could also ensure that there are many copies of it around the world, so even if one was taken down, no information is lost. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which also means the pirate bay isn't technically illegal. They themselves don't pirate anything, nor do they host it on their servers. It's merely a tool to allow people to file share by connecting them to the hoster, which is ultimately not a crime. The crime is the users hosting copyrighted material. At best the only charges to be lobbied against the pirate bay is being an accessory, and knowing the behavior happens but allowing it. But is a hardware store responsible for selling a hammer used to break in and enter? Are you responsible for directing a mass shooter to a crowded location? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At this point there are dozens of clones of TPB's database, and the website. This was literally their idea pretty much right from the beginning, to be like the mythical hydra.</p></div>		</li>
