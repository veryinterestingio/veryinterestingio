			<div class="markdown"><p>Since dogs are directly a product of living alongside humans, they have adapted to interacting with humans. An example of &quot;crying&quot; could be the whimper that German Shepherds do. That's probably the closest parallel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can concur. Once took my dog to the vet for three teeth extractions and neutering all in one day. At the end of the day after I picked her up from the vet she cried like a little human after her sedation wore off. We had Netflix and chill with lots of snuggles and comforting on the couch that evening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. I think a lot of people mistakenly think i.e means &quot;in example&quot; or similar, which is a bit silly. As a rule of thumb, those initialisers are generally Latin, for example NB, e.g., etc.</p></div>		</li>
