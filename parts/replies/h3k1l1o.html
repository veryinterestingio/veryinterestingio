<p>Whenever we burn fossil fuels, we reintroduce that carbon into the cycle. Without more plants or animals for the carbon to live in, all that extra carbon in the cycle ends up in the atmosphere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its really just more plants. The number of plants determines the rate at which it can be pulled out of the atmosphere. Adding more animals actually has a negative effect of returning more back to the atmosphere at a faster rate and also killing more plants to sustain said animals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>None at all. A cow can only emit as much CO2 (and methane, and other gases of course, but those are mostly considered by a CO2-equivalent) as it has eaten. Therefor an animal and the food it is eating are more or less in balance, which is what the comment above already said.</p>
<p>The problem is CO2 which wasn't in this cycle before but is introduced to it by us humans (and a few other things but those aren't relevant). So what we can calculate is how much more trees you would need to balance out our current ghg (green house gas) emissions.</p>
<p>At this point im time we emit about 50 Gt of CO2 per year. A single tree can capture about 20 kg of CO2 per year. That would make 50 trees for 1 metric ton of CO2, which in turn means you'd need 2.5 trillion (10^12) trees to balance out our current emissions. To give you an analogy of hiw much that is: that would be about 10 times the number of trees currently in the US!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A pasture grazed cow isn't a net producers of carbon. So it depends on farming method. Soy feeding encourages deforestation of tropical rainforest (very ecologically negative) while a cow grazing on a flood plain or as part of a crop rotation cycle can be carbon negative. Grass absorbs carbon from atmosphere, cow eats grass, cow poops out carbon rich manure, carbon and other nutrients get trapped in soil. Nutrient rich soil enables better plant growth allowing more CO2 to be sucked out of atmosphere next cycle.</p>
<p>Mono-culture crop farming, think big fields of wheat or soy are net carbon emitters as well as requiring the use of chemical fertilizers (in the absence of animal manure) to replace lost nitrogen and insecticides which are killing pollinators.</p></div>		</li>

<p>CO2 is a very low-energy molecule. In order to break it apart, you need to add energy to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed. It is often described as a &quot;thermodynamic sink&quot; because you have to put so much energy in to get CO2 to do anything interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To the point that there are millions of dollars put into research each year looking for some way to cheat the system and form something less destructive with the CO2. The issue is it's just so expensive to work with, because you gotta introduce so much energy to get anything to happen, so we just keep getting results that basically say &quot;it's cheaper to plant a bunch of trees than to try to scale up this process.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only cheaper but greener. If you need that much energy, you might look to fuels again and produce additional carbon unless you go with a solar panels or wind farms, which has their own issues. Either way, there is a lot of problems out there and sometimes the easy solution is the better one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s not a straightforward question to answer. Methane is about 30x worse than co2 but it only lasts in the atmosphere for a few years before breaking down or being used. CO2 lasts for tens to hundreds of years so it can have a much worse long term effect.</p></div>		</li>
