			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, this is one reason turbine powered EGUs have pre-heaters for their fuel. It is a matter of time in chamber against rate of ignition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not easier to ignite, it's more efficient. Energy that would have been just radiated into space is captured and used to make the burning fuel expand that much harder, giving you &quot;free&quot; thrust. It's very clever, but a lot of modern rockets don't actually use it, due to it adding so much complexity, and therefore reducing reusability and increasing failure rates and price.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heating the fuel does not prevent the bell from braking, but the cold fuel (in case of methane - 160 degrees c, hydrogen - 250 degrees c) cools down the bell. The fuel just gets warmer as a side effect. This actually helps the rocket, as the energy absorbed while cooling &quot;pumps&quot; the fuel around, helping the (turbo)pumps doing the job. Near the wall of the thrust chamber, sometimes atechnique called film cooling is applied. Extra fuel is injected at the walls of the thrust chamber, which does not burn off since there is not enough oxygen in these places, making the hot mixture inside the thrust chamber less hot near the wall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my (vary basic) understanding of the process, it's a happy win-win situation. The fuel is very cold, and needs to be heated to achieve the most efficient combustion. The heat from the exhaust is transferred in to the cold fuel as it flows through many small passages in the bell housing. Cold fuel keeps the bell from melting. The still extremely hot bell heats the fuel prior to combustion.</p></div>		</li>
