			<div class="markdown"><p>I give blood every 6 weeks.  (I just got my eleven gallon pin!)   I am constantly anemic due to this.  Giving one pint of bloow drops the bloow O2 level to the equivalent altitude of 10,000 feet and it takes 6 weeks to regenerate that pint.  After the third week my equivalent altitude is about 5000 feet.  When It is back to normal I give again.  I walk around constantly hypoxic but it's for a good cauyse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before moving to Colorado, I had a few times where I happened to spend time out here followed soon after by a blood test in a costal state.  With a CBC my hematocrit was always higher after a visit, to the point of being noticable on a graph, but not above the bounds of &quot;normal&quot; for that lab.</p></div>		</li>
