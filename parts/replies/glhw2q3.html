			<div class="markdown"><p>not the OP, but Yoga with Adriene on youtube has several bedtime yoga videos that are about 10-15 mins.  The light stretching combined with the breathing exercises can be very effective and after a few views, you won't need the videos anymore.  Yoga in general helps me to sleep through the night by relieving back and neck pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't recommend Adriene enough.  Like with most things, it takes a little while to see the real results so try to commit to a month.  Of course you feel good and relaxed immediately after a session, but after 2-3 weeks the benefits really start sinking in.  She begins every new year with a 30 day series where she does a new video every day in January, so it's perfect for beginners.  Heck, I started doing her videos 5 years ago and I still look forward to her new year series.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just do general stretches for every major body part.  I don't kill it with long holds maybe 5 to 10 seconds for each and it really helps.</p></div>		</li>
