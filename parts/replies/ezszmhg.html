			<div class="markdown"><p>Copy? No. Rename? Often, but this doesn't take time. Try downloading a 5GB file when you have 6GB available, that will work. </p>
<p>And this 99% stuff is also a case for stuff like Netflix buffering. I don't know why they count like this, surely they don't scan their own video for viruses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moving from a temporary download folder on an SSD to the actual destination on a hard drive is doing the same thing as copying. Then it deletes the original. This takes much more time than 'moving' on the same drive, which is basically a rename function.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, I guess this is possible... But why on earth would you download from the slow internet to a fast SSD, only to have it copied to your slower hard drive later? That's one reason you may see a delay, but it's self inflicted. And poor use of an SSD.</p></div>		</li>

<p>i think Google Chrome calculates a checksum of the file (something like sha1), whatever it is (even mp4/mpeg/whatever from netflix) and upload it to it to a server so they can <del>spy on you</del> check if the hash is associated with a known-malicious file</p></div>		</li>
