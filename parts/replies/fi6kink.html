			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah but if you pick and choose, don't you introduce ambiguity? If I'm familiar with your writing, I might not know if an instance of its omission is because you felt it was superfluous, or because the final two items in your list were meant to be coupled.</p>
<p>Always using the OC when listing separate items is great precisely because it eliminates ambiguity and serves clarity, the function of grammar. Then, whenever it's not there, you know you're meant to join the last two items.</p>
<p>ALWAYS OXFORD, COMMA!</p>
<p>Also, don't spell eliminate with an i.</p>
<p>EDIT: Spellings. Somehow, I spelt eliminate with an i. It was a test, all a clever, clever, not stupid test.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you pick in choose in something that could result in a lawsuit such as what you're going to pay a contractor for doing a job you could really burn yourself. The real answer to this question doesn't reside in regular writing, because it really doesn't matter in writing with some intuition where grammar is actually fairly subjective. In law consistency is absolutely key and the Oxford comma is extremely important.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/us/oxford-comma-maine.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/us/oxford-comma-maine.html" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/us/oxford-comma-maine.html</a></a> </p>
<p>Summation: Oakhurst Dairy Oxford Comma Dispute for not paying workers overtime.</p>
<p>Overtime hours were not applicable for the following,</p>
<p>The canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, packing for shipment or distribution of:</p>
<p>(1) Agricultural produce;</p>
<p>(2) Meat and fish products; and</p>
<p>(3) Perishable foods.</p>
<p>This being said there is a specific implication that was extremely favorable for workers. The canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, and packing for shipment only is not applicable for overtime hours, also distribution is not overtime. BUT, the canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, and packing specifically FOR DISTRIBUTION is not necessarily clarified because of the lack of the Oxford comma to clear the ambiguity. Therefore, any worker who canned, processed, preserved, freezed, dried, marketed, or stored for means of distribution are not exempt from overtime.</p>
<p>Oakhurst Dairy had to pay out $5,000,000 to workers for work that was declared overtime in court for the past 4 years because of a missing comma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For real, and that's a good example. But you might also say what's the point of the first comma there as well then. You'd have to be pretty obtuse to think eggs-milk-and-bread was a thing. The point of the OC is to separate separable things, so why not do it when you're meant to, and not when you're not and thus eliminate the possibility for confusion.</p>
<p>I guess I'm saying that the problem lies not in milk and bread per se, but in the grey area of other more ambiguous lists if you've decided on a mercurial approach. If the reader knows you occasionally don't use the OC, then they have to make a judgement call on whether you've used it or not in an ambiguous list. Perhaps your and their definition of ambiguity and obtuseness differ.</p>
<p>IN GLORIOUS MOTHER OXFORD, COMMA SEPARATES YOU.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the point is that you need to be consistent within a single piece of writing. If you use it where you feel like it belongs, and not where you feel like it doesn’t, then it suggests you intended a different meaning or usage. Or that there is some sort of typo involved. at the very least it’s potentially distracting to your reader. Nobody is going to sit there and be so obtuse as to question your meaning the way you’re giving in your humorous example, but it can subtly cause the eye to trip up at times and that is not something you ever want.</p></div>		</li>
