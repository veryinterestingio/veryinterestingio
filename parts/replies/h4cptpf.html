			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. Plants don't have a traditional circulatory system the way animals do, which really prevents tumors from spreading. At most, plants have narrow channels that transport water and sugars but those are not the same thing as blood vessels in animals, so metastasis can't happen (as you said).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. It's discussed elsewhere in this thread that plant cells aren't very susceptible to movement by tumor cells. Burls aren't usually fatal, but they can use up resources which hampers the tree's growth and vitality. Crown galls are more deadly than burls; they strangle the plant and cut off nutrients.</p></div>		</li>
