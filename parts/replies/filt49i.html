<p>I can't tell you how many of my friends think having an android is some kind of intentional annoyance to others just because imessage doesn't work cross platform. </p>
<p>No, Droid to Droid texting is just fine, Apple doesn't want easy compatibility between the systems because fundamentally iPhone isn't more than superficially different and offers no capabilities that couldn't work with everyone. Meaning less people would stay with Apple out of fear of losing things like imessage (which to me is insane but I guess for many is a significant part of staying)</p></div>		</li>
