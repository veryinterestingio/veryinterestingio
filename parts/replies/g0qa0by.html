			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe they are looking at their hand with fingers curled towards their palm, palm facing them. That makes them the relative top in their perspective. Relative to the extension of our fingers, they make sense as the logical ‚Äúbottom‚Äù of the nail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the top of your nail is where your nail extends past your body. The bottom of your nail is where it connects to your finger, otherwise known as the base of the nail</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, generally they become less visible going outwards from the thumb to the pinky. I only have them on my thumbs, but my hands are relatively small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting! I've noticed them on other folks, but have never seen them on my own nails (thumbs included). Like the other poster, I have pretty short nail beds, so perhaps that could be why?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh shit I never actually noticed that before. On my thumbs, they take up almost a third of my nail bed, but my pinky just shows a little sliver.</p>
<p>Any idea why? Or have you just cursed me with this mystery so that I may be perplexed for all time? Cause that'd be a real dick move.</p></div>		</li>
