			<div class="markdown"><p>My car has a twenty gallon tank. It says Low when I have three gallons left, Very Low with two gallons and cuts off roughly around one gallon. I'm not sure how much it helps, but I figured that out after resetting the Fuel Used value and just watched how much I used after getting gas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is odd because generally capacity statements are a tad on the low side of reality since they dont always account for filler neck capacity etc. I have a 22 gallon tank. E light comes on with approximately 2 gallons left. I drive another 50 miles and can fill 21.75 gallons. Meaning I usually have about a half gallon that's in there even after running it nearly out of fuel after the light comes on. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not true- fuel pumps pull from the bottom of the tank so any debris is going to get picked up no matter what. That's  why we have fuel filters. However, the real reason you shouldn't run to empty all of the time is that the fuel pump is usually in the tank, and the fuel is used as a heat sink to keep the pump cool. Uncovering the pump makes it run a bit hotter and shortens its life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, most pumps meant to handle liquids can be damaged if they are allowed to run dry. The liquid may serve as a lubricant, coolant, and protective coating for the <em>internal</em> workings of the pump, it's not only a question of whether it's submerged. </p>
<p>FWIW the owner's manual of my car also tells you not to run it out of fuel because as it dies, the engine will misfire. Incompletely burned fuel then makes it through the engine and puts strain/wear on the catalytic converter. </p>
<p>Not sure if that's the biggest concern, since I haven't heard of that before from other sources. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Not always. My 2000 Cadillac Eldorado has a pump that is situated near the 1/4 tank line.</p>
<p>My mechanic explained it as Cadillac wanting to allow the gasoline in the tank to cool the fuel pump. However, a side effect of this is that it isn’t submerged when driving around with less than a quarter tank, and as a result, the fuel pump gets really hot and wears faster.</p>
<p>I can pull fuel from the bottom of the tank but not as well or efficiently as other cars- actually, the last quarter tank burns about 3x as fast as the rest of it in my experience.</p>
<p>My mechanic advises that I treat the 1/4 line like it’s Empty to minimize long term fuel pump wear. But I don’t really get to heed that advice much being a broke college student with a car that demands no less than 91 octane</p></div>		</li>

<p>Heed this advice, I used to do this and it wasn’t cheap to repair it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You won’t get sludge in your system. Gas tanks are emptied from the bottom and the gas is filtered. With that said, you should not run on empty because towards the very end, you’ll get inconsistent fuel supply and your engine will expect fuel, but not get it, then get a little bit, then run out, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heard of that. This 1st time in this new car was purely miscalculation of me getting to a specific gas station (membership club 20 cents cheaper than surrounding area) and then traffic hit, I saw zero but only drove like 3 more miles and made it.</p>
<p>It's barely got nearly 5k miles on it.</p>
<p>I'm wondering if I should use any fuel additives. </p></div>		</li>
