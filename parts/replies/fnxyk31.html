			<div class="markdown"><p>God, for a second there I thought you meant an actual cat.</p>
<p>Cool story though–back in the 70's, there was a stray cat that somehow ended up on a container ship in Japan and wasn't found until the ship got to San Francisco three weeks later. They thought it was probably dead, but it licked milk off their fingers, so it was brought to the animal shelter and recovered. I was volunteering there when the news crew came in. Kitty was very hungry once she'd been hydrated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something especially fascinating about this is how neatly the math works out.</p>
<p>The measure I usually hear is that a pound of fat is equivalent to ~3500 calories. If he lost 276 that was primarily fat during his fasting period, that's about 966,000 calories worth.</p>
<p>If we also assume a 2500 daily caloric load for someone relatively active (I imagine he was doing other things to help lose the weight), you'd burn through 966,000 calories in 386 days without any other substantive source of energy.</p>
<p>He fasted for 382 days. Like damn, it's crazy we kind of have these numbers figured out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the most general cases, losing weight is an incredibly simple process. The resources are all online for free, and often very very straight forward. People struggle losing weight because it's hard work, and most people are just looking for an easy way out. Billion dollar industries have been built on selling you a complicated way to achieve simple results because it's promoted as less work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that you still eventually shit. You shed your intestinal cells constantly, and you have bacteria as well. Plus, though your burned fat is expelled through your mouth when you breathe (yep, that's your intake and exhaust), there is other mass besides fats in those fat cells. A lot of it is water, but I don't know about the rest. Maybe it all gets recycled by nearby cells, maybe not.</p>
<p>I think you would mostly just excrete your own intestinal lining eventually. Not as one mass--you aren't molting. But cells flake off all the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had always wondered how I lost weight while sleeping and this explains it. I would weigh myself several times just before bed and get a consistent result on the scale. I would then leave the scale exactly where it is and go to sleep and then weigh myself a few times again as soon as I wake up and I would see that I've lost weight. I couldn't figure out where the mass went since I didn't pee or poop or sweat enough to lose that much in my sleep.</p></div>		</li>
