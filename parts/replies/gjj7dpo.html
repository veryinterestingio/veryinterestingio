			<div class="markdown"><p>Here a method I have found luck with:  Choose a task that you are very familiar with, the more complicated the better.  Think the process to complete that task through, step by step in as much detail as you can.</p>
<p>Example:  say you’re a mechanic and you rebuilt enough transmissions to know it by heart. Think the process through starting with the first nut or bolt you have to remove. </p>
<p>I rarely make it 5 minutes and never finish the task.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do a similar thing, but in regards to the thing giving me anxiety.  OP gave the example of not being able to sleep due to anxiety over needing to fall asleep. I mentally list everything I did to prepare to sleep, as if explaining it to someone (in my mind), then list all the things I have to do in the morning to prepare for the reason I have to be up so early.  More realistic example: I am dwelling on something that happened, something someone said, etc. In my mind I write a email to them. Include all the reasons what they did/said was hurtful/wrong, why I am pjssed, why they are a jerkface etc.  Any time I lose trian of thought I have to start from the beginning.  I never finish and it helps me get to my &quot;inner mind&quot; where sleep happens. (To me it feels like a mind inside my mind and feels different... deeper maybe?, idk if that makes sense or not)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly the process.  </p>
<p>In my case, it is usually the process of producing one liter batches of inverse emulsions. I didn't use that as an example as not too many people have the same experience.</p></div>		</li>
