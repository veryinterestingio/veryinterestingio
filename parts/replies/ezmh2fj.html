			<div class="markdown"><p>Same with ants. Eusocial insects are usually majority female, with males created as necessary. Termites are a bit different, with sterile males working along sterile females, as well as a fertile male &quot;king&quot; that lives and mates with the queen (instead of just being used for mating once and discarded).</p></div>		</li>
