			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a geologist. Mt. Rainer is our biggest worry. The mountain still has a very large deposit of water on it. Mostly in ice and snow. So when it erupts it will cause Lahar flows. This is like every river around the volcano rising drastically and filling with thick mud that flows like lava and destroys everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While no one can predict the future, volcanologists have many tools to help forecast events. You may be more familiar with weather forecasts where in an area there is a percent chance of some type of weather like rain. Scientists use instruments to monitor volcanoes and collect data to understand what might happen.</p></div>		</li>
