			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't entirely true. If the species was one where sex determination is environmental and not genetic, e.g. some reptiles, then you could clone both sexes from a single specimen. Even for species with genetic sex determination, if your specimen was the heterogametic sex (males in XY systems, females in WZ systems), then you could theoretically genetically modify a clone to remove the Y/W and duplicate the X/Z to create a clone of the opposite sex. Of course none of this gets around the inbreeding issue, but it isn't 100% guaranteed that inbreeding will cause problems, it just increases the risk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I'm not sure how you arrived at that thought. I'm specifically talking about how to make clones of 2 different sexes.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Forgive me if I'm wrong, but assuming you had a viable XX animal with 2 identical X chromosomes and a viable XY who's  X matched the females wouldn't there be NO risk (outside of random mutation) as you'd just be producing clones of the parents each time?</p>
<p>You wouldn't get many NEW generic disorders, just whatever ones were present in the parents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just the sex chromosomes, you'd need parents where all 4 copies of each chromosome (2 from the mother, 2 from the father) are identical. Otherwise, each offspring would have a different combination from the parents and there'd always be a chance that a new combination would result in a problem.</p></div>		</li>
