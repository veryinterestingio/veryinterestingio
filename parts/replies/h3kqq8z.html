			<div class="markdown"><p>It's true that the some of the unstable elements would have synthesized in supernovas, but that's not always why they exist on Earth today. For some (but not all) unstable elements, the originals have long since decayed away to nothing. Those elements exist today because they are produced by other radioactive processes such as spontaneous alpha and beta decay. </p>
<p>For example, most uranium found in the Earth's crust <em>is</em> left over from the original dust cloud, but what little technetium (atomic number 43) that does exist naturally is produced by radioactive processes from higher elements. The little that is produced does not last long. In fact, for a long time technetium was thought to not be naturally occurring at all, but now we know it does occur in trace amounts.</p>

<p>We know our Solar System is AT LEAST a second generation or even third generation solar system. The reasoning is that the large amounts of iron found on earth were likely from the remnants of a star as Iron builds up in a star over time due to nuclear processes. </p>
<p>So a sun was formed, lived out it's natural life and then exploded sending off all of its particles into the area. Over time the particles condensed and formed a new star and iron from the remnants of the previous star became part of what made up Earth.</p></div>		</li>

Portions of it are about the exact subject that u/Nyanicon is asking about. Just a short distance from the top of the post you'll find an image of a periodic table that shows exactly where proportions of each element were formed and the text explains how they ended up in the Earth's makeup.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't <em>know.</em> That is one reason NASA is so keen on getting samples from the Moon, Mars, asteroids, etc. </p>
<p>If our theories about stellar evolution and plant formation are even close to correct, most solar systems should roughly have the same set of elements in roughly the same proportions. There will be differences, though. Very old planets might  have fewer heavier elements (because they were formed earlier in the universe before 2nd and 3rd generation stars formed). More importantly, how big a planet is, how far it is from the sun, how fast it cooled, and any impacts with other bodies will affect which elements are most prevalent on the surface and atmosphere.</p>
<p>For example, the asteroid that caused the Chicxulub crater deposited a lot of irridium in the crust; asteroids have more irridium than Earth's crust. And some people think the impact that created the Moon also left additional water on Earth. So a planets history matters a lot and each one will be different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to Wikipedia, we've found it in other stars:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1952, the astronomer Paul W. Merrill in California detected the spectral signature of technetium (specifically wavelengths of 403.1 nm, 423.8 nm, 426.2 nm, and 429.7 nm) in light from S-type red giants.[19] The stars were near the end of their lives but were rich in the short-lived element, which indicated that it was being produced in the stars by nuclear reactions. That evidence bolstered the hypothesis that heavier elements are the product of nucleosynthesis in stars.[17] More recently, such observations provided evidence that elements are formed by neutron capture in the s-process.[20]</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Various processes. Gravity causes differentiation based on density, I.e. iron and nickel sinking to the core. Sometimes differentiated bodies get blasted apart in collisions then core chunks are denser then crust chunks. </p>
<p>On Earth geological processes caused further differentiation, for example when magma cools some components freeze at a higher temperature forming bands of minerals, and water is responsible for a lot of concentrating based on solubility washing out minerals then depositing them as the water evaporates - an easy example is salt deposits.</p>
<p>Biological processes also concentrated minerals like limestone and coal and also helped concentrate iron ore, because the presence of oxygen from photosynthesis caused iron to form less soluble minerals that &quot;rained out&quot; of the oceans forming deposits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll add that a star fuses hydrogen into helium. When the hydrogen runs out it fuses the helium, when the helium Runs Out the star fuses the next element and so on until it stops at iron. Fusing iron no longer generates a surplus of energy. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly correct! Instead of phrasing &quot;fusing iron no longer generates a surplus of energy&quot; it's more that iron can't be fused into anything else without <em>adding</em> energy to the system. All previous fusion reactions release energy in the form of light, but fusing iron would require energy from an outside source. </p>
<p>The previous fusion reactions (which created helium, carbon, etc.) occur because of the intense pressure in the core of stars. It's so tightly packed in there that the empty space between protons and electrons is basically eliminated. Since hydrogen is easiest to talk about, we'll start there. The hydrogen atom nuclei is positively charged with a single proton. Do positively charged things want to be close together? They sure don't! But the force of gravity is so strong, it forces these previously repulsed nuclei to buddy up and bump into each other. &quot;Only&quot; about 1 in a billion hydrogen atoms will fuse because the fusion process requires the protons to be 100% aligned with each other - like two baseballs colliding midair and flattening each other perfectly. The reaction releases 0.7% of its total energy in the form of a light particle called a photon. It can take 1.5 million to 2.5 million years for the photon to escape the core of the star.</p>
<p>The bizarre conditions within a supernova (and black hole mergers) create something called seed nuclei. Basically, the nuclei of the iron can spontaneously accept new, free protons to its little core, creating the heavier elements. And guess what free protons are? Hydrogen! Plenty of protons to go around.</p>
<p>So not only do we have almost every element here on earth - everything heavier than iron on the periodic table <em>must</em> be made in supernovae or black hole mergers. Got some gold jewelry around? That's a supernova corpse! </p>
<p>All of the visible matter in the universe was made within the first hour after the big bang. It was about 75% Hydrogen, ~24% helium, and &lt;1%  of everything else. Now it's more like 74% Hydrogen, 24% Helium, and 2% everything else. 13.6 billion years of stellar life cycles has changed the composition of the Universe!</p>

<p>Edit: /u/kingklob pointed out neutron star mergers are also a source of the heavier elements</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Planets were formed from asteroids — the stuff left over is what is in the asteroid belt today. I only say this because planetary accretion and differentiation into core/mantle/crust all occurred over millions of years rather than billions. The rocky planets pretty much formed with their budgets of all the different elements. </p>
<p>Or perhaps by “asteroids with all the elements continued to impact newly formed planets for billions of years” you meant the continued delivery of material during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Heavy_Bombardment" target="_blank">Late Heavy Bombardment</a>. It’s a bit contested as to whether that was even a thing, but seeing as a lot of planetary scientists say it was, let’s go with it for now. Even then, the timescale is not billions, but a few hundred million years of more stuff delivered to the planets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda. Planets were formed from the protoplanetary accretion disk, which was mostly very fine dust, along with many large planetoids sized objects.</p>
<p>Most of these planetoids are still around, swung way out in the Oort Cloud. But you’re right, the planets mostly formed within the first few hundred million years. With some notable exceptions such as Thea and Proto-earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not exactly true. There's plenty of evidence that <em>some</em> of it happened in some form or another. There are quite a few stories about people, places, and events that are unremarkable, and substantiated. In fact, historians overwhelmingly agree that Jesus existed around the year 30 CE, traveled, taught, and had followers that believed he performed magical feats. There's no evidence of those feats, of course, but Jesus - as a person, teacher, and leader - very likely isn't a myth. </p>
