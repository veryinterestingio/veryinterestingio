<p>A base 12 number system makes math a lot easier, because 12 has a lot of factors (1,2,3,4,6,12), and all the major fractions are whole numbers. 1/2=6 1/3=4 1/4=3 and then the major fractions of those are whole numbers as well for the most part. </p>
<p>Because that is how they counted things (including time) it worked it’s way into every part of life, including religion. </p>
<p>I guess technically it’s base 60 when it comes to time, but like you said, it’s essentially the same thing. </p>
<p>Basically it just makes it so you’re almost entirely dealing with whole numbers, which given the computing power of literally the first society, makes a lot of sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Base 12 would make numbers work better. 12 is divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 6; while 10 only has 2 and 5. Unfortunately we have 10 fingers, so 10 got adopted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To tie this back to OP's question:</p>
<p>Calculations for big chunks of time are more common in day to day life and where we have to do math in our head on the fly. &quot;Quarter of&quot;, &quot;quarter after&quot;, &quot;half an hour&quot;, noon being half a day and the 8 hour work day being a third. This is why base 60 and 12, numbers with more factors, were not only chosen, but stuck around. You're often &quot;close enough&quot; to just round to a number that will give easy math in the situations where you use these units of large time.</p>
<p>Calculations for small chunks of time are less common in day to day life and generally imply high levels of precision where you'll have lots of digits and math will be more difficult to do in your head. So, in that case, having many factors isn't important. Further, the fact that these small units of measure are often used in science and engineering made the number system favored in those areas (base 10) more common.</p>
<p>Now, we're at a point where we can convert very easily since most time keeping devices are computers, so even when using another base is preferable mathematically (e.g. using binary inside the computer or something that trivially maps onto binary like hexadecimal) it's trivial* to convert that on the fly to whatever humans are used to and there's no need to just use one ideal number base in all situations.</p>
<p>* As a software developer, I know that time is actually one of the hardest kinds of software, but it's for reasons other than this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not &quot;obsessed&quot;.  The Sumerians counted using their fingers.  Each finger (not thumb) has three sections.  Four fingers times three sections is 12.  5 times 12 is 60.  There's much more to it than that, but that's the very simplified version.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do we actually have any evidence that they counted on their fingers this way? They definitely had a number system like this and this kind of finger counting is done in Asia, but I’m not so sure that you can make the definitive statement that the Sumerians counted this way.</p></div>		</li>
