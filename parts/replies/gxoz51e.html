			<div class="markdown"><p>That was a good question OP. I too wanted to understand this. </p>
<p>When I have anxiety I guess I’m not warmed up and I breath so hard and I can feel my heart hard beating. I guess is because it’s all of a sudden and my body didn’t have time to circulate or understand the blood flow.</p>
<p>Good question asked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. </p>
<p>When stressed, epinephrine signals the body to redistribute blood flow. As your internal organs need blood and you can’t just magically increase the amount of blood in your system, this change is governed by increases in stroke volume (amount of blood pumped in a single pump), venous return (amount of blood entering the heart), and a number of mechanical factors. </p>
<p>Even before beginning exercise, central command signals for the initial changes. Once you begin exercising, the muscles being used release molecules (eg, acetylcholine) which locally dilate arterioles to aid in blood trafficking. Then, a combination of baroreflexes and exercise pressor reflex lead to continued regulation as you maintain or increase intensity. It’s a very tightly controlled process and it’s amazing to see. </p>
<p>There have actually been studies on central command where participants imagined exercise, simply imagined riding a bike, and those initial changes took place. </p>
<p>One of my professors during my PhD always said muscle is more important than the heart in exercise and I tend to agree. Without that muscular control, your heart has to work too hard (rate-pressure product) and could lead to some badness. The role of muscle in maintaining blood pressure is an amazing mechanism and one of the primary reasons we recommend it for just about every disease process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you tell me more about muscles and the lymphatic system? Does a person who moves around less, or not use as many muscles throughout the day or so, have a difference on health? Since it has one way valves and muscle movement basically moves lymph around, does it matter in terms of healing, sickness, infections, etc?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does this also explain why stimulants are hard on people’s hearts?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. Stimulants tend to be more fatiguing to the CNS than the heart, but having an elevated heart rate for too long is also bad. </p>
<p>Caffeine is a great example. It’s an adenosine inhibitor. Adenosine is basically the body’s signal for being tired. During exercise, the breakdown of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) leads to elevated adenosine and, as it increases, your sense of fatigue follows suit. </p>
<p>In exercise studies with caffeine, the same workload can be completed with a lower rating of perceived exertion. As the signal for fatigue is decreased, you can do more sets at a higher intensity. </p>
<p>Also of note, caffeine is the ONLY pre-workout ingredient that has a bout-to-bout effect. Creatine requires loading, beta-alanine requires loading, and nitrates are claimed to aid in cardiovascular endurance but more research is needed. Don’t buy brand name supplements, just drink some (non-coffee) caffeine.</p></div>		</li>
