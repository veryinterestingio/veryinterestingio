			<div class="markdown"><p>It was interesting to see.  The particular incident was a reef shark, picked off a schooling fish, small or juvenile pork fish if I recall correctly, but it was definitely not doing well.  The school made a turn, the straggler didnâ€™t, and the shark was nearby, broke off its pattern, sniped the fish snd that was that.  There was a slight murmur in the gallery, did you see that, type comments and life moved on.</p></div>		</li>
