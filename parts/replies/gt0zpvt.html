			<div class="markdown"><p>When I used to work in a call center, this would happen once a day or so. Not an option if you're on camera, but we found it helpful to squeeze your eyes tight and just focus on the words coming out of your mouth. </p>
<p>Keeping your answers short helps, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hmm interesting to know, but that doesn't happen on normal calls with speakerphone though? Was it long ago before smartphones were better at reducing echoes?  </p>
<p>I have anxiety talking on the phone for some dumb reason. I find that putting it on speakerphone sometimes helps me disassociate from it.</p>
<p>However if the person on the other end doesn't understand or can't hear me, the anxiety gets intense again! This is why I prefer doing things by email or chat!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lucky, every single call that came in on my line had a delay AND and echo of everything I said. For the first month at that job, I could only get out about four words before I had to pause. The worst part? The customer couldn't hear the echo, so I sounded like a loon. I used a metronome to keep a cadence later on because it's the only thing I could think of to get me to stop listening to myself. And I kept NPR talk radio on low to increase the amount of confusion around me so it seemed like a crowded office rather than my own voice in my head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a speech language pathologist, a stutter would not be my first guess when listening to the woman in the video. Especially as listening to yourself in a slightly delayed way actually helps people who stutter to control their speech. It's called Delayed Auditory Feedback (DAF) and makes people speak kind of slow and strange (at least if you haven't practiced it) but without stuttering. There are some videos on YouTube showing the method/its results, here is one of them if you are interested: <a href="https://youtu.be/MAQvhUxDA3g" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/MAQvhUxDA3g</a></p></div>		</li>
