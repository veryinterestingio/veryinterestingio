<p>The \~84 minutes oscillation up &amp; down is independent of your forward movement. It's the same period as an orbiting satellite (if it were at surface level).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not 'finally' That's the very first thing if you want to consider it in a practical sense. The Russians barely made it 12km with the Kola Superdeep Borehole before it got too hot. If you can't dig the hole in the first place, you can't even start to consider this as anything but a thought exercise.</p></div>		</li>
