			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't confuse streaming with spectating. Streaming in a website like Twitch or Steam is exactly what it is, video streaming. The streamer uses software to capture his screen, and stream it as a live video.</p>
<p>Most popular multiplayer games like Counter Strike or League of Legends let you spectate someone while they're playing, which is a different thing. In that case, you do establish the same connection to the server and your computer renders the game just as if you were the player.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And then there are services like PlayStation Now(?) which stream video of the gameplay to you while your client (in this case a PS4 or something) displays it and streams your controls to the server. There is a lag because some server in a rack somewhere is actually running the game itself, not your PlayStation, but with a fast enough internet connection it can work near real time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the in-home streaming on Steam, though, where you can run a game on one computer but play it on another. This is the same thing (encoding a video and streaming that) except it has a two-way connection: server to client so the client can see the screen and client to server so the server knows which keys to press.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But in CS GO if i connect as a spectator i wont be watching the game in real time but i'll be one round behind the actual game.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They absolutely can, look into WebGL. However, it isn't used in the way you're suggesting. When you stream through something like Twitch.tv, the streaming software is just capturing your screen and sending it as a video stream.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>streaming games is just like streaming a video.
also im not sure streaming the data used by processor and video card would actually be more effecient than just streaming the video, not to mention the delays this would cause.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For cloud gaming services the game is captured and encoded as video, so the client just needs to know how to play video and capture inputs to send back. But of course unlike a movie latency really matters. So there are all kinds of optimizations in the capturing and encoding. I've even wondered if some day a graphics card might have an Ethernet jack on it to support h265 direct streaming output. ?</p>
<p>The parents point about multiplayer games hiding the latency can't be overstated. You know how in a FPS you run around a corner, get killed, then in kill cam you see that you didn't actually go around the corner? That's because everything the other player sees is delayed. Some games even intentionally add delay to &quot;even&quot; the competition. Google &quot;lag compensation&quot;. </p>
<p>P. S. Now get ready to get your mind blown. Radiolab played a story on how tall people experience more lag in real life than shorter people!</p>

<p>It's like the difference between being told to draw a triangle over the phone rather than having to actually send a picture of a triangle through the mail to the other person. Also online games use interpolation and other techniques to hide the effects of delay or lag to the end user.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More like, it's the difference between having to send someone a triangle, and already having sent them a catalogue of shapes. In one, you need to actually send it but in the other, you only need a reference number. Your copy of the game already has the big stuff like sets and actors, it only needs the script they're dancing to.</p></div>		</li>
