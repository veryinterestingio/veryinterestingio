<p>Most carboxylic acids are solids at room temperature</p>

<p>And that includes many fatty acids (which I guess is more recognizable to the average person than carboxylic acids). Palmitic acid, for example, has a melting point of 63C/145F and is found in palm oil (hence the name), as well as in smaller amounts in dairy and meat, though often combined with glycerol into triacylglycerols. Also used to make napalm (accounting for the -palm part of that word).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea but ultimately they need to be in an aqueous solution to deprotonate, right? I assume solid to solid chemistry doesn’t really happen anywhere on the scale of aqueous solutions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An aqueous solution is not required, though it is certainly the most common scenario.</p>
<p>One step removed would be to just have a different liquid solvent - ammonia is a straightforward replacement, it acts much the same way as water (it can even autoprotolyse, with NH4+ and NH2- instead of H+/H3O+ and OH-).</p>
<p>Or you can have acid-base reactions in the gas phase, like between gaseous hydrogen chloride and ammonia.</p>
<p>The solid phase is the toughest but should still work. Like some sodium hydroxide mixed with citric acid (maybe assisted by having both in a finely powdered form, or adding heat). Of course the reaction would soon result in a liquid phase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct. If you handle a solid acid it won't take long for it to absorb some water from the air or from your skin and begin burning you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not on the scale of aqueous/solvated, but solid-solid is not uncommon and is possible. You place the solid reagents in a ball mill or manually grind the two together in a mortar and pestle. Reductive animations have been done without solvent with boric acid, sodium borohyride and the starting imine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! My senior thesis was taking Lauric Acid (48% of coconut oil by weight, solid at room temp) and combined with potassium methoxide to separate the glycerine out and create methyl esters(which are now liquid at room temp)</p>
<p>Fun fact that the excess potassium hydroxide reacts with the glycerine as it's being separated out and produces soap (saponification)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you envision an acid reacting? I ask because... do you mean the classic definition (it makes baking powder foam) or the chemical one? The electron one?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was never more disappointed then the day I mixed hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. One powerful acid + one powerful base. Gotta be 10x more exciting then baking soda and vinegar right?!</p>
<p>Nothing happened except the water got salty. No fizz, no foam, then I realized neither of those chemicals contains things that would be a gas once reacted and it made sense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is the difference between these?</p>
<p>As I understand it, the &quot;baking powder&quot; one is a chemical reaction, and a chemical reaction is about exchanging (sharing?) electrons.</p>
<p>I haven't looked at chemistry since I was at school (decades ago) and even then it wasn't my strongest subject. In that limited understanding, all of these different types of reactions you point to look like the exact same thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>of course, I poured acetic acid (the acid in vinegar) on sodium carbonate (thats basically baking powder)  by accident, the stuff was in a test tube and it flew all the way to the ceiling (most of it). </p>
<p>dont try this at home or wear glasses at least...</p>
<p>edit: in my case the acid is liquid and the base is solid, but that doesnt change much really. A solid acid will react with a liquid base very quickly too.</p></div>		</li>
