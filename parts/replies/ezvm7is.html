			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't. You break enough of the fibers causing it to stay folded but not enough for the paper to fall into separate pieces. </p>
<p>Which also explains why folded paper is not as strong and easier to fold again along the line it has previously been folded since most of the fibers there have been broken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're both right: To start with the &quot;bonds&quot; between the cellulose molecules isn't a molecular bond so much as a &quot;surface tension&quot; kind of thing. The hydrogen/oxygen pairs act like magnets, which does cause them to be attracted to each other, but no chemical bonding occurs so it's not a very strong attraction. What <em>does</em> give the paper strength is the way those molecules are tangled around each other.  When you fold the paper a lot of those molecules unravel from each other, so they only have the magnetic attraction thing to hold together. This attraction is very fluid like metal in how it holds it's new shape, but very weakened because it only accounts for a fraction of the strength of unfolded paper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think you break single cellulose fibres. They're very strong, much like carbon fibre for example. However, you likely cause them to slide past each other and partially unravel, breaking hydrogen bonds between fibres and resulting in a much weaker area with less fibre-fibre interaction. Hence the weakness. </p>
<p>However, you might be right when it comes to mesostructures in paper, I'm not too familiar with how single cellulose molecules bunch, but I imagine if they clump together in larger &quot;fibres&quot; those would likely break (through single cellulose molecules gliding past each other)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Incase they break then at some point they should be seperated..but when we take a closer look at those I would argue that they some how glide and stay like roots with the mud connected...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not much. Just that the fibers in cotton wool are not as tightly packed.</p>
<p>Wood pulp before it is processed into paper is kinda similar to cotton wool so you can make cotton paper.</p>
<p>Soak it into water and flatten it. Water tension will keep the fibres stuck to each other. Now dry it out and the fibers are tightly packed together and voila you have cotton paper (this is seriously simplified). </p>
<p>Now go make counterfeit bills (assuming your country hasn't switched to plastic bills... Also don't it's highly illegal)</p></div>		</li>
