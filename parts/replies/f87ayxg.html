<p>However, you shouldn't be worried about any health effects. A small amount of leakage isn't any different from the WiFi signal itself. RF radiation at the frequencies that microwaves use just does what it does inside a microwave: heat things up. It doesn't cause cancer, because it is non-ionizing radiation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just want to re-iterate this part for anyone who's concerned. </p>
<p>&quot;Radiation&quot; is a scary word, but we're all exposed to all kinds of radiation all the time, and our bodies typically deal with it just fine.</p>
<p><em>Ionizing</em> radiation is the problem--radiation with so much energy that it can strip electrons from the molecules in your body. That includes the kind of particle radiation that results from nuclear fission and decay, as well as things like X-ray band radiation.</p>
<p>If you look at any of the typical ways <a href="https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/toolbox/emspectrum1.html" target="_blank">we introduce the electromagnetic spectrum</a> to learners, you'll notice that X-rays and gamma rays are past the &quot;purple&quot; end of the visual light spectrum--they carry more energy than visible light, which is how they can strip those electrons and damage your body. </p>
<p>Microwaves, radar, radio waves, and a few other things are past the &quot;red&quot; end of visible light. In ordinary exposure amounts, these do not pose health hazards. (That is, if you fall asleep naked two feet in front of an operating radar antenna, this might not apply, but in most real-world circumstances you're fine.) Those kinds of radiation don't have enough energy to do anything to you--your body is <em>less</em> likely to be damaged than it is by visible light.</p>
<p>A leaky microwave is <em>less efficient</em> while it's operating, and it can interfere with some consumer electronics. But it's not going to give you cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to correct you on one thing. The intensity of the radiation is not a factor of causing or not causing health problems. What I mean is, even if you sleep 2 feet in front of an operating radar antenna the electromagnetic radiation will NOT harm you in any way. This is because the frequency, therefore the energy, is not high enough to excite electrons above their ionization energy. Bombarding an atom with more photons, of low frequency, is not going to ionize the atom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ionizing radiation is not the only radiation that can harm the human body. There are thermal effects. Particularly on the eyes and reproductive organs. Non-thermal effects are uncertain - some studies have shown effects on calcium ion mobility between tissue cells. Pulsed radar can also affect your hearing. All of these require far far more power than standing in front of your microwave however. Sleeping two feet in front of a high powered military radar antenna though? I wouldn't chance it.</p>

<p>Yeah, I was trying to plot a middle course in my post between ignoring the potential complicating factors and getting lost in the weeds. I might not have hit the right balance.</p>
<p>But obviously your statement here isn't strictly true. If you did something really dumb with an infrared cutting laser, you could cause some superficial burns. </p>
<p>And that illuminates a more general rule: the risk of tissue damage and other adverse health effects from non-ionizing radiation is proportional to flux (power per unit area). The more power a device puts out, and the more directional the array, the more health risks there are.</p>
<p>All of the reliably demonstrated effects are due to heating, and in order to see them, you have to have so much incident energy that you exceed the body's ability to dissipate it. That is, the risk is apparently lower, as well as categorically different, from what you encounter with ionizing radiation. So usually moderate engineering controls are all you really need: you add an interlock to make sure the cover of the cutting array won't open while it's in operation, and you put a cheap faraday cage across the microwave door. </p>
<p>So. If someone asked me to stand naked two feet in front of an operating 60kW radar antenna, I would politely decline. But from a consumer standpoint, the risks are negligible--radio waves are really, really safe. Unless someone is working in laboratory or engineering jobs with specific kinds of equipment, they should literally never spend a moment worrying about it.</p>

<p>yes it will, it can cause burns. how microwaves actually cook food without causing harm would be magic. ionize.. no, heat you up and boil your eyeballs? yes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this - all of the interference is on the 2.4ghz band so it's less detrimental these days since most devices prefer the wider 5ghz band as it can pass more traffic and has much better channel re-use.</p></div>		</li>
