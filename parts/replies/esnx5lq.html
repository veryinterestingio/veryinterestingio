			<div class="markdown"><p>I've done some fieldwork in the Pine Barrens-- beautiful area, and yes you can find S. purpurea there, too!</p>
<p>The community in the food web is comprised of bacteria, protozoans, rotifers (the smallest multi-cellular organisms), and three types of insect larvae: midge, mosquito, and flesh fly.  These are the common organisms one can find in pitchers in the native range of the plant (North America), but occasionally I will find some surprise taxa that are more often found in lake systems.  I've found filamentous green algae, diatoms (a type of algae with a silica &quot;shell&quot;), cladocerans and copepods, though these are all what I would consider rare taxa.  I will also find a lot of pine pollen (which often looks like Mickey Mouse ears) at certain times of years.</p>
<p>The plant is also introduced in Europe, but lacks the native food web (all of the taxa I described above).  There hasn't been much research on the composition of the communities there, but I am heading to Switzerland in just a couple of weeks to do some collaborative research on this exact question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No they don't-- the larvae that live in the food web (mosquito, midge, flesh fly) are aquatic organisms.  The only things that die in the pitchers are terrestrial prey (or flying organisms) that drown, sink to the bottom of the pitcher, and are decomposed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to what she was saying, <em>Sarracenia purpurea</em> produces no or virtually no(reports are conflicted IIRC) digestive enzymes and it has no lid, so the fluid it contains is more or less just rainwater. So aquatic organisms won't die solely from being in the pitcher, but organisms that can't breathe underwater will.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does it take in the wild in Europe (and where), or does it need special food supplements?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question-- it was actually intentionally introduced, and can be found in Switzerland, parts of France and Germany, and is considered invasive in the UK.</p>
<p>As far as food supplements go-- the plants appear to be capturing prey just fine, but that is part of the research I will be conducting when I visit.</p></div>		</li>
