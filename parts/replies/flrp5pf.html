I know this because the one and only time I ever yelled at a cashier and drove away angrily was the exact same day I ended up having a heart emergency, so I think that unusual and out of place anger is just a &quot;sign&quot; that something weird is going on.</p></div>		</li>

If you already have problems with your heart, then sure, the spike may very well be the thing that pushes you over the edge, but I donâ€™t know that anyone suggests that healthy people can <em>never</em> have ordinary BP spikes due to stress.</p></div>		</li>
