			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems almost like the brain knows when it’s safe before the little voice in your head can verbalize it to you and tell your body to panic/feel pain/etc.</p>
<p>That reads weird and I am extremely high, hope it makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I'm not a neuroscientist but I am a biologist and physiologist so I'll take a stab at it.</p>
<p>One important thing to remember is that any biological organism is not built perfectly. Evolution only cares about &quot;good enough,&quot; not &quot;perfect.&quot;</p>
<p>And I'd venture to say that OP is correct, there is a lot of fight-or-flight and adrenaline involved in this situation. And OP is absolutely correct about the &quot;purpose&quot; of pain in general.</p>
<p>So yeah, if you are in a situation where you could be hurt, sometimes your body will kind of shut off some aspects of your typical self-awareness to allow you to get out of that situation. So if your arm is shredded by a lion there's a fair chance your neurotransmitters and other bodily chemicals will just go into &quot;GTFO!!!&quot; mode. Or &quot;KILL THIS THING!!&quot; mode. Every instinct and biological function in your body is now quickly rewired to just fucking run and get safe or try your damndest to kill the thing trying to kill you. How one reacts is variable. Pain is not good right now, it will slow you down. Pain is essentially a warning system for your body. If the warning is not going to help you right now, sometimes you won't receive it.</p>
<p>But as I said, evolution doesn't create &quot;perfect.&quot; So sometimes if you look at a wound, even in a critical moment, your brain will go &quot;Oh shit, that's bad&quot; and send you the warning (pain). And sometimes the fight-or-flight response doesn't work quite right and things will just hurt immediately, especially with very grievous wounds. Or sometimes you freeze in a crisis and get got.</p>
<p>Like I said, not perfect. But good enough for enough individuals to survive enough shitstorms that that's the way it works.</p>
<p>EDIT: Added the &quot;fight&quot; aspect to my &quot;fight-or-flight&quot; description.</p></div>		</li>
