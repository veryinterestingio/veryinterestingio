			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a very common debate among endurance athletes and a particular sore point between long distance runners and other sports (particularly crossfit, mma, cycling, i.e most other sports that result in increased endurance without necessarily being solely an endurance sport)</p>
<p>So, VO2 max, the volume of oxygen your body circulates is a good indicator of &quot;endurance&quot;. </p>
<p>HIIT- high intensity interval training, which  is more or less &quot;frequently going anaerobic&quot; improves VO2 max very quickly and more efficiently than running. So you get more &quot;endurance&quot; in a 20 minute intense workout than an hour jogging. However, if your goal is to run a marathon, then no amount of HIIT is going to prepare your legs no matter how much &quot;better&quot; your heart and lungs are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lactate threshold (or lactate shuttle overload pace) is a much better indicator of endurance/marathon pace. Think of vo2max as your theoretical maximum, but your LT or LSO is the maximum you can actually get to.</p>
<p>Expanding on that, your training needs periodisation, so sometimes short, intense sessions are what you need, other times longer sessions at your LSS pace are required.</p>
<p>For a marathon, it's as much getting your muscles ready for the amount of damage they are going to get as training your heart and lungs to be able to get you through it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a great question! I’m not sure, but if I had to guess I wouldn’t think so. When doing vascular surgery on the elderly I know surgeons have commented about how many new vessels vs. not there have been. And it doesn’t seem like there would be a purpose for that to occur. The body I don’t think would differentiate between new and old vessels for starters.</p></div>		</li>
