			<div class="markdown"><p>Melatonin is actually not as important for sleep as many people believe as it is can only be produced in darkness (we can sleep in light) cortisol is absolutely essential to beong awake and adenosine is a much more important hormone in regard to sleep (its what caffiene blocks which is why when caffiene wears off you feel really tired because you have a build up of adenosine)</p>
<p>Leptin and ghrelin are also super important to sleep but those are for glucose / hunger regulation not tiredness</p>
<p>On a proper 24 hour sleep cycle though many things make you sleepy so with so many confounds it's difficult to figure out if just one hormone is primarily responsible but we know cortisol levels drop right before sleep and adenosine levels rise and as long as both of those happen you can sleep in absolute daylight while melatonin is only produced in the dark if you are in a dark room all night the darkness won't make you any more tired </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adenosine is part of the sleep-wake homoestasis. And your right the melatonin is part of the circadian rhythm and the circadian rhythm alone is not sufficient enough to cause regular sleep patterns.</p></div>		</li>
