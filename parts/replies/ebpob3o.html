			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a follow up question.  I tore my distal bicep tendon, and the surgical repair involved basically drilling a hole through the bone, pulling the end of the tendon into that hole, and securing it via sutures and a &quot;button&quot; on the back side.  My doctor and PT stressed the importance of allowing this to heal fully.  </p>
<p>Question is this....does the bone just &quot;close&quot; around the tendon, or will the tendon and bone actually &quot;grow&quot; together?  Hope that makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseointegration" target="_blank">Osseointegration</a> where bone will envelop artificial structures attached to them (say, pins or joint replacements).  This happens with organic tissue as well, as is referred to in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4241426/" target="_blank">articles such as this one</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also have a question. I partially tore my PCL in a cycling accident, but was not in a place financially to have it treated at the time. I went to a sports medicine specialist 3 years later for a separate issue and he identified the tear after doing a full body exam and noticing instability in my knee. He said that it was already partially healed, and that it wasn't worth doing surgery at this point and to just let it heal naturally. It feels 100% today, after about 8 years.  </p>
<p>I have since heard that connective tissue injuries *never* fully heal. I suppose my question is which is true? It will heal very gradually over time, or not at all? I'm inclined to believe my doctor, but have heard and read a lot of stuff that has given me doubts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but I have also had a distal bicep tendon rupture.  In my case it took a yanking force opposing my jerking motion while my arm was straight.  I have also meet two other that have had the same injury.  One did it in simple fall where their arm was extended when they hit the ground.  The other individual did it lifting a large TV that slipped.</p>
<p>Basically it takes a lot of force and is more likely when your arm is fully extended.  It can also happen when the tendon is already weakened from tendinitis.  Long term tendinitis should not be ignored.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people do it by slipping while carrying furniture or doing bicep curls, especially negatives. That should give you an idea of the kind of direction the force would be on your arm and how unlikely it would be for that to happen while climbing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would I be correct in assuming that the end of the tendon that connects to the bone would &quot;weave&quot; itself through the gaps shown in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bertazzo_S_-_SEM_deproteined_bone_-_wistar_rat_-_x10k.tif" target="_blank">this pic of the structure of bone cortex</a> or am I completely offbase?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a more accurate description is that there isn't an end to the bone and a beginning of tendon, but that the tissue at that point is sort of an &quot;in between&quot; tissue that gradually transitions from mostly bone but a little bit of tendon, to mostly tendon with a lite bone. Both are made of fibrocartillaginous material, just with different compositions of the constituents. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So part of the tendon is literally an offshoot of the bone that gradually morphs into muscle? Does a tendon break or does it tear? Can there be some hypothetical rare condition that turns muscle into bone or vice versa using the same process as a tendon?? So many new questions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You insist on finding a clear differentiation between bone and tendon. That's not the case. Here is the tendon, there is the bone, and in between there's this area where the tissue gradually morphs from one into the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would probably help you to know how all these things work in the first place.  All the <em>work</em> done in cells, including these attachments (and the movement done by muscles) are all done by special molecules called proteins.  There are tens of thousands of different proteins that your cells make all doing a different thing (usually in groups).  The &quot;weaving&quot; you speak of are special proteins that are physically connecting to each other.  The main protein in tendons is called Collagen, and it's really stretchy and springy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, a tendon is specifically the connective tissue that attaches muscle to bone. There are lots of different types of connective tissue: ligaments attaching bone to bone, your blood vessels, myelin sheaths around your nerves, little cushioning pads in your knee joints called menisci, the meninges which are protective layers around your brain... lots of important stuff.</p></div>		</li>
