			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm picturing a bunch of skydivers grabbing each other's ankles instead of random shoulders and stuff.   The fact that the easiest parts to grab also make the skydivers fan out symmetrically makes sense because gravity plays a part.</p>
<p>So is gravity a factor or am I totally off base?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure gravity has much of an effect on the orientation, as in, I'm fairly certain that snowflakes would organize the same way in zero-g. </p>
<p>The organization of the core water molecule as it changes phases into ice is due to the fact that water is polar, and has a weak negative charge on one side of it. In the most stable, lowest energy state, it bonds in a single layer, hexagon shape.</p>
<p>Extrapolate that out to a whole snowflake, of lots of water molecules, as it keeps expanding outward, there's more work that has to be done by the inner molecules to hold the whole thing together, that's when molecules start adhering to increase thickness, starting at the center.</p>
<p>This would also work with your skydiver analogy, as the ring of skydivers gets larger, and has two rings, they'll break up if they don't start adding people to the center to bolster and spread the work of hanging on, around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yay!   Thanks.   Then this is how I will describe it to my kids.  Is the weak negative charge the ankles and the positive the hands?   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a documentary on YouTube called “the shapes of things” an early 80s Nova episode that explains how snowflakes are formed and that’s what I’d learned. You should check it out </p></div>		</li>
