			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! Some of the original experiments done were by placing people in cold rooms (4 degrees C if I remember correctly) and then giving a radio labeled glucose molecule to them, which allowed the researchers to visualize increases in glucose metabolism in areas of the body known to contain brown fat through PET scan. It was found that being exposed to cold temperatures increases brown adipose activity and increases beigeing. Being in a cold climate for a prolonged period of time thus would likely increase BAT activity. The purpose of BAT in the body is to perform “non-shivering thermogenesis” which means it’s a way for your body to generate heat without shivering, hence why cold exposure increases its activity. Keep in mind though that you have to feel cold for the activity to increase. If you have 5 layers on under a big jacket and your body is nice and warm all the time, you might not get this same response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please correct me if I’m wrong, I haven’t brushed up on it well lately, but isn’t BAIBA believed to help promote beige adipocyte biogenesis/conversion? No idea where it stands in actual human studies though, I just recall hearing about it in the supplement industry news. IIRC fucoxanthin seemed to be able to convert WAT to BAT in rodents, and had at least one or two studies showing weight loss in humans, but newer research seems to suggest that the conversion observed in rodent tissue doesn’t occur in human tissue, so I guess it’s not the answer there for us humans either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting! I’m not sure about BAIBA. There were several food molecules that are thought to increase BAT activity and conversion, but I’m not sure how thorough these studies were. IIRC that were molecules like EGCG in green tea, certain molecules in spicy peppers, but again you might want to look into this more yourself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey do you happen to know anything about research on halting adipose formation in the first place? I read something about that maybe a decade ago, and that particular magic pill obviously never materialized...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know too much. The same lab I was in also did basic research on white adipose formation but I never worked on those projects. I had a professor whose research was on a drug called iSLIM1 which he discovered was able to halt lipid synthesis in adipose cells by inhibiting SREBP proteins, effectively preventing adipocytes from growing at all. When Covid hit he actually realized his drug could be used as an antiviral agent as coronavirus also relies on host SREBP to function properly. I got to work with him a bit in April and May of this year, watching his research on whether iSLIM1 could be used as a treatment in humans. In mice and in vitro it was found to increase survival by 95%, but I haven’t heard anything on whether there would be any human trials.</p></div>		</li>
