<p>One tricky thing is that objects with a low emissivity like shiny aluminum could give a false reading in certain instances.</p>

<p>The ring looks &quot;cold&quot; but it's essentially the same temp as the rest of the hand.  You technically need to know the emissivity of what you're measuring to convert it to an accurate temp but I think a lot of things are fairly close.</p>
<p>Also why you can't hide from FLIR cameras that easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>its cool how many different technology areas actually go into something like a infrared thermometer. </p>
<p>it seems simple enough, but under the hood its many, many different technologies all playing nice together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FLIR cameras are basically IR thermometers but way more sensitive and collect a lot more data.  They convert the information into a visible image.</p>
<p>If you want to hide from it, you need to understand the emissivity so you put off the same amount of radiation of the surroundings.  If you cover yourself with a blanket then the camera will just see a square because it's not the same amount of radiation as the ground.</p>
<p>It's kinda cool how sensitive they can be.  At night we'd sometimes get a Kiowa helicopter to fly over our route in Afghanistan.  Their cameras can pick up differences in just overturned dirt or things that are otherwise camouflaged.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It seems like all you need is a head-to-cover suit made out of shiny aluminum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically this is an approximation of black body radiation. Certain things emit IR radiation at different rates. The IR sensor assumes an emissivity of 0.95 ish which is a good approximation of most surfaces you're likely to run into on a regular basis. </p>
<p>An ideal black body has an emissivity of 1, and so most things are pretty close. and the approximation is good enough for a $40 IR thermometer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see this approximation is referred to &quot;grey body&quot; radiation some places, and I like that name.  You're still assuming it's an &quot;ideal grey body&quot;; but black body is technically emissivity of 1 so it makes sense to have a similar term that addresses the difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can get rid of the emissivity issue by measuring the signal at two different wavelengths (bichromatic pyrometers).<br />
Also there are tricks like using black electrical tape on hard to measure surfaces like glass or shiny metals (provided the surface is not too hot).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yes but not completely. Blackbody radiation is the radiation of an ideal object. This ideal object is completely black (absorbs all light) and radiates this ideal spectrum which is temperature dependent.
As you may guess, most things (including us) don’t behave as a blackbody (aka the spectrum is not so “perfect”) but they still radiate electromagnetic waves!</p></div>		</li>
