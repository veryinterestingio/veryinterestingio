			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer.  But just because I can't see a blanket statement without arguing with it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ocean currents are driven by heating from the Sun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a neat application of thermodynamics to oceanography called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Sandström#Sandström_Theorem" target="_blank">Sandstrom's Theorem</a> that says that heating and cooling cannot drive flow unless the heating happens at higher pressure (greater depth) than the cooling.   In layman's terms, warm water rises, but it can't rise if it's already at the top!  If the oceans were simply heated and cooled at the top, the oceans would be stagnant pools of very cold water with a tiny warm layer on top near the equator. </p>
<p>To drive ocean currents, <em>you need to stir the water</em>, so the heat penetrates down into the depths.  And what processes can do that?  Well, the wind obviously, but it turns out that tidal mixing plays an equally important role.</p>
<p>In a very real sense, the &quot;thermally-driven&quot; circulation of the ocean is controlled by the tides.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... we find that 2.1 terawatts [of mechanical mixing] are required to maintain the global abyssal density distribution against 30 Sverdrups of deep water formation.  The winds and tides are the only possible source of mechanical energy to drive the interior mixing...  [This study estimates that] 0.6–0.9 TW may be available for abyssal mixing. A recent estimate of wind-driving suggests 1 TW of additional mixing power. ..</p>
<p>A surprising conclusion is that the equator-to-pole heat flux of 2000 TW associated with the meridional overturning circulation would not exist without the comparatively minute mechanical mixing sources. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, yes!  While the paper I cited argued that wind and tidal action were the only ways to get heat into the deep ocean, later authors found out  that geothermal heat from the seafloor is also significant.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Posting /u/mfb- 's suggestions for simulations here b/c they're excellent!</p>
<p>The &quot;no perturbation&quot; case, run it for a while (over time errors in the simulation will add up but not up to t=500):</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Mass</th>
<th>X pos</th>
<th>Y pos</th>
<th>X velocity</th>
<th>Y velocity</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>M = 200</td>
<td>0</td>

<tr>

</table>
<p>Then set the initial y-position of one M = 10 object to 1 and watch how fast the system gets visibly chaotic. </p>
<p>Reduce the smaller masses to 1 to have the effect happen slower. </p>
<p>For even slower chaos: Set the positions back to the symmetric case, but make one with mass 1 and the other mass 1.001.</p>
<p>For an even smaller perturbation add a small, far away moon with these settings:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Suitable initial parameters: Three objects, masses 200, 10, 10, x-position 0,142,-142, y-position 0, x-velocity 0, y-velocity 0, 120, -120.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would take simulations like this with a BIG pinch of salt. Orbital evolution requires knowlage of the tidal quality factor which varies but many orders of magnitude (10^4 - 10^9, at least in this range) depending on the body in question. This is an essential parameter!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason I linked to the sim is to illustrate how it's basically impossible to get a stable system with two moons of the same orbital period, rather than the accurate positioning a research simulation might provide. Even the smallest amount of outside interference and the orbits become chaotic, resulting in ejection in the worst cases and eccentric orbits at best.</p>
<p>Q results in orbital decay due to tidal heating, which would definitely count as contributing to instability, right?</p>
<p>Also, the timescale of the decay of the simulation orbits into chaos is anywhere from 0-10 orbits. I'd be curious to know if the tidal dissipation has a significant effect over such a short period. According to my (admittedly quick) Google, a fast-case decay with Q~10^4 means you dissipate 1/10,000 of the energy for every revolution, meaning it would probably take something like 100 orbits for the effect to show up on this particular sim.</p>
<p>Granted, I am FAR from an expert on orbital mechanics, so I'd be interested to hear feedback if my intuition is incorrect on this!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, their tidal forces would cancel each other (nearly exactly - something like 1% would remain from higher order effects). Where one moon would cause a low tide the other one would cause a high tide.</p>
<p>There would still be tides from the Sun, of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Easiest way to think about it is throw a ball from a moving vehicle and think about the velocity of the ball in correlation to the direction of the vehicle. So if you throw the ball same way you’re going, the forces are added. Opposite ways, subtracted. At 90* you would just be splitting where the hardest point of the pull would be, but you would still only have 2 tides. </p>
<p>Imagine your vehicle heading in a straight line and you turn yourself 90 degrees and throw the ball. Where does the ball go? (Assuming you threw the ball at equal velocity) it would go right between the two directions which would be 45* from either moon. </p>
<p>I think 😅</p></div>		</li>
