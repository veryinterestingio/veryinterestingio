			<div class="markdown"><p>I had extremely recalcitrant plantar warts. My dermatologist was basically just throwing random stuff at them in desperation. One of the things she suggested was that I get the HPV vaccine (the regular way- not directly into the wart). A couple weeks after my third shot most of my warts suddenly just cleared up. It’d been a 7 year battle. </p>
<p>Seems like the biggest issue with warts is that your immune system <em>can</em> kill that virus, but it’s not good at recognizing that the virus is there. Most of the most effective treatments for warts now center on trying to alert the immune system that it's there. Other treatments I got included injecting candid antigen directly into the wart (causes a lot of inflammation- hoping it would get my immune system interested in the area), high doses of zinc, and topical immune modulator creams. It’s pretty interesting stuff actually.</p></div>		</li>
