			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially you help the person replace unhealthy behaviors with healthy ones. It takes a lot of work and time. It's not impossible but it's not a walk in the park. Like training to become an astronaut, it's not impossible but it requires long-term commitment and diligence. Hopefully neuroscience can make the process much quicker in the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that just a cliche presentation of narcissism though. What if it is more subtle and they know the signs and so would purposefully not brag about themselves, particularly in a therapy session.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An actual narcissist lacks so much self-awareness that they would never realise that they possessed those traits. It simply would not occur to them. They therefore would not really do this in a therapy session.</p>
<p>What you are talking about is someone who has narcissistic tendencies, but is not a full-blown narcissist. Different story. Much more complicated.</p></div>		</li>
