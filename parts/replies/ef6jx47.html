<p>I’d say the risk of complications and the “success” rate of a surgery are two totally and nearly independent factors.  I can perform a perfect sinus surgery where the patient can breathe and smell much better after surgery, which by all accounts is a resounding “success” while the patient still suffered a DVT (deep venous thrombosis,... a blood clot in the leg) and need to be on a blood thinner for months. It was a success and a complication simultaneously. </p>
<p>Complications are easier to measure.  The OP’s initial question of “success rate is much harder to answer , as it depends on how you gauge success .  For almost all surgeries there are multiple articles that gauge “success” on how you measure it; quality of life validated questionnaires improved, less office visits, less missed work days, less use of associated medicines, etc etc. </p>
<p>Buyer beware, surgeons like me may selectively pick and choose studies to quote. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a very well renowned neurosurgeon once told me... a great surgeon should not want to operate on you. Surgery should be a last resort. </p>
<p>Unfortunately this isn’t the case for a lot of surgeons out there because they get so specialized, may have large ego’s, and/or an expensive lifestyle to maintain... that gets paid for by doing more surgery. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a physician who also performs procedures, I would add that this data is derived from clinical studies and registries. As a patient it is just as important to ask the surgeon/operator what their success and complication rates are, and how they track them. It doesn’t help with decision making if the success rate you are quoted is not achievable by that operator. I would also argue that it is good quality for a surgeon/operator to keep track of success and complications so that they can ensure they are doing a good job, find areas for improvement, and properly inform their patients. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a super interesting program that tracks pre-operative conditions, the type of surgery (based on billing codes), duration, type of anesthesia, and then a bunch of post operative complications. This allows predictions for future risks and can help institutions identify potential preventative complications. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always been fascinated by tools like this.  One thing I've always wanted to do is take some of those tools common in a profession but not really in life and use them as a game context.  Imagine taking the idea and using it for a &quot;papers, please&quot; style game where you're responsible for approving or denying surgeries in certain constrains on budget, surgeon time, drug supply and so on while using an outcome prediction system to try to do the most good you can.</p></div>		</li>
