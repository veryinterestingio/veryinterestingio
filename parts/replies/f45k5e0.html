			<div class="markdown"><p>That affect is actually more due to the fibris texture of the cloth. A sponge uses vacuum to suck fluids into the open cavities and then its tiny fibers use surface tension to hold said fluids. While the fibers of a woven wash cloth are much more jagged and have long sort-of fingers coming off of them. Those fingers employ more surface tension to hold small droplets. Essentially the sponge is better at collecting a greater volume of substance that is loosely clinging to a surface, whereas the cloth is better at pulling smaller amount of substance that is clinging  more tightly to a surface.</p></div>		</li>
