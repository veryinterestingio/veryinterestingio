			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, importantly, the Caspian sea hasn't been renamed because the name dictates how underwater resources are split between the countries on the coast.</p>
<p>If it's a sea then every country gets a fraction depending on the length of their coastline.</p>
<p>If it's a lake then every country gets an equal share.</p>
<p>This is relevant as the Caspian sea bed is rich in oil and gas.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are absolutely correct, but renaming the Caspian sea to a lake changes the rules on how it's resources are divided, and that's the problem.
It's not what the rules are, it's that they would change.</p>
<p>As far as why they are different, I don't know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The caspian sea was probably connected sea in the past. Its salty and the land movement etc could have closed it off later. While by definition it is a lake, most lakes arent salty for a reason, they are usually not supposed to be salty, so for me Its still a sea. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know much about the Caspian Sea specifically, but in general, any endorheic basin (no river outlets or outgoing groundwater flow) can create a saline lake/sea. In those situations the only way for the water to leave the basin is through evaporation, which takes the water but leaves the salt behind, creating a higher concentration of salt in the remaining water. When all the water is evaporated, you get salt pans like the Great Salt Lake.</p></div>		</li>
