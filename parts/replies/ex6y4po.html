<p>But wastes electricity or gas by constantly reheating the unused hot water in the lines. Water is the cheapest utility in your home, I'd happily have a few gallons go down the drain every time I need hot water than the added bill from heating the unused hot water in the water line constantly.</p>
<p>My water bill last month was $7.22 for water usage, and $13.54 for sewer, so essentially $21. My natural gas bill was $55, just for hot water because my furnace has been turned off, without a recirc line. There is absolutely zero way that my water bill would be reduced by more than my natural gas bill would increase by having a recirc line.</p>
<p>Convenient to have hot water in 2 seconds, yes. Save a tiny amount of water in the grand scheme of things, yes.</p>
<p>But a huge waste of heating costs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In the summer, it's doubly bad if you run an a/c because the a/c has to work to get rid of that extra heat put into your house. </p>
<p>I've heard there is a kind though where most of the time the water is still and you can press a button and have it circulate a few minutes before your shower. This seems like a good solution to me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My dad installed one at my sister's house. It works great. As I recall the unit is expensive. Something like 5 or 6 hundred.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Depending on how much you spend to heat your house compared to the water - if you have natural gas central heating and electric water heating, it'll be much cheaper to use the gas to heat the house than the water (my electricity is 6x more expensive per kWh)</p></div>		</li>

<p>This doesn't make sense to me.</p>
<p>Are you saying that the added energy cost of heating the water in the hot water line to room temperature is otherwise equivalent to the cost of constantly heating the recirculated water in the tank to 120F or greater with a recirculating system? Or have I misunderstood?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most efficient way to do a system is Point-of-Use instant hot at every appliance that needs it, which is what I'm doing at my place. I might do a small storage tank for the 2 showers, but every sink will have it's own little on-demand electric heater at it. the 1.5ft - 2ft of pipe from the heater to the tap is all that goes down the drain.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So unless their water bill magically quadruples some time, then yes, it's still the cheapest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vegas does not have a water shortage, CA however does.</p>
<p>Vegas uses less than 1% net of the total colorado river flow. All sewer water in Vegas and Henderson is treated and re-used.</p>
<p>Vegas water authority has been running a 'drought campaign' for 20 years, but it's mainly over landscaping.</p>
<p>Water is pretty plentiful here, and there is a fuckload of ground water, some of the large casinos are still running on the original wells from the 50's.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tankless water heaters may not be worth it economically, but it's hard to overstate the value of having hot water even after your spouse takes a long-ass shower or fills the bath while the washer's running. Coming in from working out in the winter cold and having the only option available be cold water is such a shitty experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So my house came with a tankless water heater, but here’s what happens. The shower head fixture builds up with enough calcium that within a month the water flow rate becomes too low for the hot water heater to stay active, so you start out the shower with warm water, then slightly turn it down cause it’s just a tad too hot and within a minute you’re stuck in a cold shower.  You turn the shower dial up to maximum heat but the water heater won’t reactivate unless the flow rate goes to 0 for a minute or so, which it isn’t 0 through the tankless heater but more like 0.3 gpm. </p>
<p>Anyways I got tired of soaking the shower head in vinegar each month so I just took it off. Now I get a solid 2.5 gallons per minute of water. It’s warm within 30 seconds, and I don’t have to spend 5 minutes rinsing soap out of my inch long head of hair. </p>
<p>TL;DR:  my tankless heater made me remove my low flow shower heads and aerators. Water bill didn’t really change.</p></div>		</li>
