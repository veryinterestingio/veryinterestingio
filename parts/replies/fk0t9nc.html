			<div class="markdown"><p>VPNs do not (and cannot) encrypt your data any more than you can. VPN data is encrypted between you and the VPN endpoint, but necessarily your VPN decrypts it the instant they receive it.</p>
<p>Proxies will usually also encrypt between you and the proxy, as well (though it depends on the exact protocol you're using to proxy).</p>
<p>What /u/FoxtrotSierraTango described is actually a proxy. A VPN is a type of proxy. The difference between a VPN and a proxy is that a VPN (as its name suggests) actually makes you a virtual device on another network. Using /u/FoxtrotSierraTango's analogy, not only can you also use your college body to send postcards away from your mother's snooping eyes, but you can also use it to communicate with the college's registrar's office without the registrar's office having any idea that you're physically off-campus. This may be useful in the case that the registrar's office has a security policy that does not allow mail from off campus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They block all known outgoing IP addresses of VPN addresses. Or anything that doesn't look like residential / mobile ISP( it is a public information who owns IP address range/block ). So all cloud servers are also banned. Probably any IP range with high amount of concurrent connections is flagged for manual review. Also it is not hard if reverse DNS for IP has the word VPN in domain name.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For one thing, VPNs aren't only used for accessing websites. What they are really for is connecting over the internet to a private network (hence <strong>V</strong>irtual <strong>P</strong>rivate <strong>N</strong>etwork), and encrypting that connection in such a way that, as far as the client machine and host network are concerned, the client machine is part of that host network. </p>
<p>That way when I work from home, my employer knows all the traffic between my laptop and my employer's network is not open to the whole internet. They can also set it up so it will only accept VPN connections from company-owned equipment, rather than any machine with an internet connection.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Neither are proxies. Some proxies specialize in HTTP and HTTPS, but not all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The concepts are similar.</p>
<p>A proxy works on a connection-by- connection basis, and requires support by the application creating the connection. </p>
<p>VPN software works at a lower level, forwarding traffic without need for application support.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Proxies usually <em>do</em> encrypt traffic between your computer and the proxy, the rest of the issues are true but same goes for VPNs. The real disadvantage of a proxy is that you have to configure it on a per-application level, and even then an application can neglect to use it in certain rare circumstances.</p>
<p>That's how proxies have been pierced in the past, some Firefox bug allowed certain javascript code to access the bare internet by mistake.</p></div>		</li>
