			<div class="markdown"><p>It is true, the water would not enter the plunger (ignoring the responses about boiling and freezing water in space). </p>
<p>Your intuition is probably telling you that the plunger would &quot;suck&quot; in the liquid but there is no suck. </p>
<p>When we think of a syringe sucking a pool of liquid, what's really happening is the plunger is making way for the liquid and the atmosphere is pushing the liquid in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, I understand now: in both atmosphere and vacuum cases, pulling the plunger creates a vacuum. In the atmosphere case, the vacuum is immediately filled with water due to the surrounding air pressure. The movement of the plunger isn't the cause of the movement of the water</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So imagine you had a big sphere of liquid floating in space. (It's a thought experiment, the whole point of introducing the syringe was to not use liquors, but ok.)</p>
<p>You stick the tip of the syringe in the liquid and pull back on the plunger.</p>
<p>What would make the liquid go into the syringe?</p>
<p>There was vacuum outside the liquid before. When you pull back on the syringe plunger, there is still vacuum there. How would the liquid even know you had pulled back on the plunger? </p>
<p>The plunger is basically just randomly moving near the liquid without touching it. Nothing else has changed.</p>
<p>In atmosphere it's different. Imagining our same hypothetical floating sphere, first there was air pressing against all sides of the liquid, in balance with air on the other side. When you stick the syringe in and pull back in the plunger, you're leaving behind a space with no air pushing against the liquid, and so the pressure on the other side of the liquid wins and the liquid pushes into the syringe.</p></div>		</li>
