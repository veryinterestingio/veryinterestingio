			<div class="markdown"><p>You may also see water dripping from the cars ahead of you.  I know of at least two people who bought cars that were used for short trips (one as a local bakery delivery van and the other a relatively short commute).  In both cases, the vehicles went through their exhaust systems in very sort time as the accumulated water rusted them out in no time.  We're talking a new system every 18 months or so.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently, if the system isn't effectively warmed up, then you can have standing water left in the pipes.  Once it is sufficiently warmed up by constantly running, it can effectively be expelled through the system in vapour form.  So those &quot;quick trips&quot; to the store can result in water being left in the system.  In winter, that water can also freeze, putting further stress on the system by getting in the cracks and physically breaking them apart.  I just looked at replacing my exhaust system and the OEM is stainless steel, which is $$$.  If I bought a cheaper steel system to save money, my driving habits may result in another replacement in a very short period of time.</p>
<p>As an aside: I also discovered that stove top vents should be insulated for similar reasons.  You want to the steam from the stove to vent up through the attic and be expelled into the atmosphere.  If the pipes aren't insulated, the steam rises and &quot;rains out&quot; as the pipes get colder.  I guess those pipes will rust out faster if not insulated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The exhaust gets hotter if it is a longer trip.  Car exhaust gasses are at temperatures well above the boiling point of water.  Once those gasses heat the exhaust system itself to that temperature there will be no condensation forming anywhere on it, but it takes time for this to occur.</p>
<p>Heat also speeds up corrosion, though, so before the exhaust is up to temperature any condensation is going more damage than it otherwise would be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short trips, where the vehicle never reaches operating temperature, are also hard on the motor compared to longer trips. Motor oil absorbs small amounts of water, so the oil must reach 212F/100C to boil it off, otherwise the water can stay in contact with internal components. It's a tiny amount in vehicles that warm up regularly (like, once a week or more), so it's really only vehicles that almost never warm up that can have issues. For me, a person with.... too many... motorcycles, this means I don't ride one unless I know it will warm up fully. I also store them for the winter with brand new oil.</p>
<p>This has been related, but off topic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stuff of the exhaust system rusting shouldn't be a problem in newer cars that use high quality stainless steel.</p>
<p>A bigger problem is water accumulating in the motor oil, because the oil doesn't get hot enough to release the water on short trips.
But you can check for that by opening the engine oil cap and having a look whether the cap and opening are covered in lightish brown Cappuccino coloured substance or is the regular black/dark brown. Or the same with the dipstick.
If it does look off, have the oil changed completely, (and not the cheap 10 minute and done way where they only suck out most of the oil, cause that won't remove all of the water).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was scrolling for this and you are correct.  Computers in cars have to compensate for the ambient temperature for a cold engine.. Generally, the colder it is outside, the more fuel an engine will use to keep it from stalling. After the first few minutes, the computer will slowly left off on the fuel it is throwing at the engine as it comes to normal operating temperature.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it is. Actually some of the mist/vapor coming out of the pipe of a recently started cold engine is excess fuel that didn’t burn. As a cold engine is running on rich mixture, not all the fuel burns and some comes out through the exhaust. This is why a recently started car exhaust smells gasoline.</p>
<p>Once the engine heats, it no longer needs to run rich, so there is complete burning(or in other words, the engine runs lean) and there will be no gasoline in exhaust.</p></div>		</li>
