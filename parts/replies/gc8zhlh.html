			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it possible that this is not the only cycle of other types of life on earth, too? For instance, could there have been entire cycles of evolution and destruction of various life forms on earth that we can’t find a trace of now, due to time passing, atmospheric changes over time or even drastically different perceptual capacities?</p>
<p>EDIT: I see below that many others also have this thought.  Phew! Existential crisis averted.  We are not alone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>99 percent of all species which ever existed are extinct.</p>
<p>In simple terms we have had life on Earth for about 4.5 billion years. Although for a long time life would have been simple in structure and with few species, that is a very long history. Looking at the fossil record we can tell that most species don't actually last very long from the time they first appear till they vanish from the rocks (for example the average is about 4 million years for mammals).</p>
<p>Now diversity clearly varies over time (during big extinctions there won't be many species left for quite a while), and currently there are estimated to be somewhere between 30-50 million species on Earth. Now given that each species can only be expected to survive from around 0.5-5 million years, its perhaps not surprising that taken over 4.5 <em>billion</em> years, over 99% of all species that have ever lived are no longer with us.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ll add that there exists in plants an infectious parasite called a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viroid" target="_blank">viroid</a>. Literally just a loop of RNA with no protein shell, and if it happens to bump into the right plant’s DNA, it will get replicated.</p>
<p>My background is computers not biology, so I am a bit out of my depth, but it is easy for me to imagine particles like this arising in a bottom-up fashion as a consequence of information entropy. I suspect it would be likely anywhere you had natural selection working with a complex self-replicating molecule like DNA.</p>
<p>When you have a complex set of information, replicated imperfectly over and over, weird bugs are going to happen. Bugs like accidentally spinning off an independent strand of RNA that can hijack your DNA. Once that happens, natural selection dictates it <em>will</em> get replicated. A lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well put. With the disclaimer that I’m even more out of my depth - when you factor in the vast size complexity of a genome (vast), the messiness of its replication process (not precision manufacturing, but sex in soup), and the enormous number of times genomes self-replicate (billions of bacteria every second in a very small area), the circumstances seem ripe for information entropy, as you put it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mostly agree, but the replication process of DNA is actually remarkably precise and fails rather rarely considering the task. It's just that it's done so much that failures still happen a lot of times, even if it's a small percentage.</p>
<p>I don't think we have any kind of precision manufacturing that could compete with it in both precision and failure rates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a very interesting take. Do you know if anyone has tried to simulate this with computer code? I mean, could you actually copy computer code with random mutations and get this kind of bugs that you talk about? Or something similar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm" target="_blank">Genetic algorithms</a> are a very interesting area. If you don't know how to solve a problem, you can can create a bunch of copies of an algorithm with random &quot;mutations&quot;. You try them all on the problem, keep the ones that are closest to the right answer, and then mutate them slightly and create a bunch more copies. Eventually these mutations and selection can result in a very sophisticated algorithm that humans would not have designed.</p>
<p>There's also plenty of simulations. <a href="http://meeba-farm.github.io/meeba-farm/" target="_blank">I wrote one myself</a>.</p>
<p>Computer code tends to only replicate in a very controlled fashion though. Either it doesn't mutate because we double check and throw out bad copies, or we let it mutate in very controlled and limited fashion  (like simulations or genetic algorithms). This doesn't leave a lot of room for anything truly novel to happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty much what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm" target="_blank">genetic algorithms</a> are.</p>
<p>You try to solve a problem using a whole bunch of randomly assigned parameter, and pick the parameter sets that happened to come closest to the real solution. Then, you use those to generate similar &quot;offspring&quot; parameter sets (adding some random variation), and repeat.</p>
<p>If you've set everything up correctly, over many generations, you'll converge on the &quot;best&quot; parameter set for solving your problem (the caveat there is that you might accidentally converge on a local best, which is just better than anything &quot;like&quot; it, instead of a global best which might be radically different).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We get afflicted by something worse: prions.</p>
<p>We think of infectious organisms as all just various levels of small, I mean we're multicellular, parasites are small multicellular organisms, bacteria are single-cell organisms, viruses are basically just DNA enclosed in tiny shells of protein that can enter cells, but the building blocks of allll that biological stuff is proteins. It's what DNA dose; give instructions to produce different proteins which fold into different configurations to have different biological functions.</p>
<p>So back to prions. Basically they're misfolded proteins that spontaneously unfold other proteins they bump into, so they're even more base scale than an independent loop of RNA bumping into DNA in a way, because that RNA still has to get replicated by the DNA in order to make a bad protein to go rogue. For prions, you just have to have them in proximity to susceptible proteins and bewm, the whole structured mass of, say, your brain, collapses into cheese. We call this CJD (Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease)/BSE(Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy)/Mad Cow Disease. </p>
<p>This is why I will never eat brain; you only need to come into contact with the corrupted tissue once and you're permanently stuffed, nothing will stop it. Even sterilising surgical equipment that has been used on people with CJD will not degrade prion proteins, so it has to be thrown away lest it gets used to perform surgery on another patient and carries prions over to melt their proteins too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm seeing questions in the comments replying to this regarding virus fossils, while it is true that virus don't fossilise in the traditional sense because of how unstable genetic material is in comparison to bones, there is an area of study known as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3758182/" target="_blank">Paleovirology</a> which attempts to study the evolutionary history of viruses. </p>
<p>It makes use on bioinformatics techniques to find nucleic acid sequences in the genomes of plants and animals (known as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2987831/" target="_blank">Endogenous Viral Elements</a>) that have a very high likelihood to be of viral origin and use them to trace the evolution of both viruses and their hosts. Some cool research that has emerged from this is the fact that placenta development during pregnancy is controlled by a protein (Syncytin) that is derived from an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3758191/" target="_blank">ancient viral protein that was captured by our mammalian ancestors</a>. EVEs in the duck genome reveal that the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000495" target="_blank">Hepatitis B Virus has been in circulation for at least 18 million years</a> and helped to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/104/15/6261" target="_blank">map the evolutionary history of lentiviruses</a> (e.g. HIV).</p>
<p>Someone else's comment alluded to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/35057062" target="_blank">8% of the human genome being of viral origin</a>, and this 8% comes from the human endogenous retroviruses that previously integrated into the genomes of our ancestors. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22901901/" target="_blank">Some of these sequences also play a role in our immune system</a>! This process has been termed as virally-derived immunity and occurs when the host expresses the captured EVEs as functional proteins that can help the immune system fight off an infection by related viruses.</p></div>		</li>
