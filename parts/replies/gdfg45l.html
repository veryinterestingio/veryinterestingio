			<div class="markdown"><p>The most common advice to fall asleep more easily when anxious, is to just take a note of whatever your mind is racing with (if possible with an idea for the next step). This way your mind feels assured that you won't miss this tomorrow morning and will let it go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately my mind has to think of several steps, not just the next.  I need a plan A,B,C,D,E,F... Then I have to review each step and figure out what is the best and worst of each, then circle back and see if there are better ways to do each of these steps.  Then my alarm rings! Ugh!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Write down every thing you need to do the next day.  Use a planner or appropriate app. I use google calendar and todooist task app.  This way when I lay down, mentally I know that I don't have to worry about forgetting something important and can relax.  I fall asleep since I'm not in any &quot;danger&quot; since my appointments and task are waiting for me in the morning.</p>
<p>A lot of people have trouble falling asleep because they keep worrying about everything they need to do the next day and don't want to forget.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly why living with anxiety in modern society is not normal and everyone who feels it should not put themselves down for being anxious all the time. Our anxiety should trigger when a lion is hunting us, but in our times, that same anxiety is felt the day before a new job. The difference is the new job most likely won't try to eat your face off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve figured out if I’m worried about not hearing my alarm and have to wake up early, I can make myself so worried I’ll wake up about a hour before my alarm is set to go off. Then a hour later I have to run in a panic back into my room so my alarm doesn’t wake up my baby. 9/10 recommend if you have some super important thing to do. Although high anxiety in the mornings also sucks.</p></div>		</li>
