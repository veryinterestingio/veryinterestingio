<p>Anecdotally, based on my frequent calls and your field, I'd imagine both delirium and UTI are secondary  symptoms of poor care. Infrequent diaper changes, sheet changes, and the like can provide the requisite infectious particles that can cause a UTI, and poor feeding schedules, unhealthy incomplete diets, infrequent health screenings, and things of that nature cause the delirium AND (if I remember school correctly) dehydration and bad eating habits can weaken the immune system, which make UTI's more likely. </p>
<p>Tl;dr UTI and Deliriums might both be caused by the poor living conditions found in most SNF.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oh, no. They definitely don't admit it. If you can actually find a staff member to talk to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Recommendations here in the US are to rule out other causes prior to treating a UTI unless there are signs of systemic infection. It makes sense that systemic infection from UTI causes delirium, and those obviously need treatment. Sometimes the UTI gets blamed for the systemic infection though, it's important to rule out pneumonia, skin infections, ect. so that we treat the infection with the right antibiotics. </p>
<p>In practice, that is hard to do, so patients end up on antibiotics. We certainly need to do a better job.</p>
<p>Edit because another content reminded me to actually link recommendations: <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/asymptomatic-bacteriuria/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiRyePh4bLrAhXwct8KHWfPCm0QFjABegQIBBAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw18i6oE1zwEaknpxiSFATxz" target="_blank">IDSA</a></p></div>		</li>
