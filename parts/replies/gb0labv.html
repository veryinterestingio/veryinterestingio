			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body is a lazy fuck and counts on that making you feel shit is an easier way to get it's blood sugar up, than to actually start ketogenesis and break down fat.</p>
<p>If you just ignore the hunger, the body gives in and starts doing what it's supposed to. It just really doesn't want to. </p>
<p>Like the part of your brain in charge of regulating hunger is the hypothalamus and limbic system, &quot;reptile brain&quot;. Our higher order brain functions has kinda evolved around the limbic system, your cognition, planning, language, reasoning, execution all happens in the &quot;human brain&quot; neocortex.</p>
<p>They don't really work as one. The limbic system mostly cares about staying alive, the neocortex cares about making the limbic system feel satisfied, because the limbic system feeds the neocortex dopamine and other good shit. </p>
<p>Limbic system doesn't really do much planning or thinking at all, that's the neocortex. It will pick up on things like &quot;stomach empty -&gt; out of food -&gt; could die from starvation -&gt; I need food&quot; then it's also learnt that by bullying the neocortex by making it feel like absolute shit the neocortex often figures out a way to order pizza or something. After the neocortex has achieved getting food into the body the neocortex rewards it, which reinforces this link in your head. &quot;Maybe with a even stronger hunger response I can avoid near starvation earlier, I almost had to burn some fat there, scary, maybe add on a fear response to starvation as well.&quot;</p>
<p>The limbic system is again mostly trying to keep the body alive, if screaming at the neocortex to find a way to get the body food isn't working, it will try something else, like breaking down fat. If bitching didn't work and breaking down fat is what ultimately kept you alive another day, that connection will grow stronger and the bitch response grow weaker.</p>
<p>The brain mostly functions on Hebbian learning &quot;Cells that fire together wire together.&quot;, bitching works in getting the body fed, that's the only reason your limbic system does it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow thanks for this explanation. I have had appetite issues for the past 8 years in that I don’t have an appetite at all unless I use cannabis. I can very easily not eat for a full day, regardless of how shitty it makes me feel. I never understood what was happening internally but this helps make sense of it a bit more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is this one intermediate fasting work? I haven't looked into dieting or anything at all but I want to lose some weight.</p>
<p>I have friends that have shed off the pounds with intermittent fasting and it sounds like you skip meals every so often and your body uses its fat reserves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't skip meals every so often, the way intermittent fasting goes is you have a set amount of time where you can or can't eat for example I do intermittent fasting I can't eat for 16 hours out of a 24 hour day but after those 16 hours have past then you can eat for up to 8 hours</p>
<p>You can't eat just anything though because if you put more in then what you're body burns during ketosis you will still gain weight</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure people get to ketosis in such a short time frame; I've done a lot of IF and my longest full fast was around 10 days (it pretty easy after day 2). It's been some time since I used ketosis strips; if memory serves me right, it took a couple of days to get deep in to ketosis. </p>
<p>IF seems to be useful for discipline; I don't think I noticed any difference in fat reduction under a standard restriction, it is easier to stick to though. I've actually stuck with 2 meals a day although I am not strict with timing.</p>
<p>You have to be careful with fasting, it can really shred lean mass, especially as you get deep in to weight loss. I prefer increasing workloads and keeping a moderate deficit from my base rate - even still, after about 2 weeks of reduction I notice not insignificant loss in strength.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Intermittent fasting is great. I usually go 18 hours (including sleep). Sometimes I'll go a full 24 hours and rarely I'll try for 2 days. </p>
<p>Wanna speed up the process? Go hiking or swimming. High caloric consumption, low impact.</p>
<p>I have a sweet tooth. Fasting (for me) helps control the urge to consume the sugar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FWIW, I've been trying to lose weigh with regular dieting for years, and only managed to hold my weight level.</p>
<p>I've been doing an aggressive IF routine (22 hour fast, 2 hour eating window) and have dropped 15-20 lbs in the last four months. (200-205 -&gt; 185).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if you’re someone with a bit of fat, it wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world to fast for 24 hours because you have the stored up fat it can consume, and you lose a bit of weight at the same time?</p></div>		</li>
