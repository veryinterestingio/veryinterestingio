			<div class="markdown"><p>There's an awful lot of speculation in your boyfriends reply.</p>
<p>The reason balls doesn't hurt during intercourse is the same reason why Insects can fall from great heights without damaging themselves. They weigh little, and therefore they don't generate much force when they move like a pendulum.</p>
<p>A foot, on the other hand, is attached to a leg with some of the largest and strongest muscles in your body. A leg is heavy and can generate a lot of power. When you kick someone &quot;lightly&quot;, the kick is just light compared to the amount of power you <em>could</em> have channeled into it. But you're kicking an area loaded with nerves, and a finger flick on one of your testicles is enough to make a man wince. A light kick is still harder than a finger flick.</p>
<p>Also, having your balls slam against someone repeadetly during sex <em>does</em> hurt. However, you produce oxytocin, endorphins and other well-being hormones during sex that also act as painkillers.</p>
<p>Also, sex and pleasure are closely related in the nervous system, so getting mixed signals can actually increase the amount of pleasure you feel.</p>
<p>Also, if you hurt yourself your body starts to produce natural pain killers. So slamming your balls against your partner will gradually introduce more and more endorphins to your body which will mask the pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually it's because no matter how hard a man fucks.  The force of his balls hitting his partner is relatively negligable.  A &quot;Jimmy tap&quot; while just a tap actually would have far more impact force behind it. Slapping someones abdomen with moderate force can damage internal organs easily for example.  Less than a 1kg of force, if you hit the sweet spot, will knock a human being out.</p>
<p>People have trouble gauging power the human body can exert.  A human skull can withstand 1,100 pounds of pressure.  But the swing of a baseball bat will exert around 4 tons upon impact at the highest.  </p>
<p>tl;dr If a man fucks his partner so hard that he hurts his balls.  Its probably going to injure his partner more.</p></div>		</li>
