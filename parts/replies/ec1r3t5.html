			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, difference in compressiblity between water and steel is within like 0.01% or something like that.</p>
<p>Edit: nope, not even close, but here's the bulk modulus for a few things:</p>

<p>I think I got the difference between Steel vs. Water and Water vs. Air confused by the looks of it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Difference between Water and Air: 2.2 / .000142 = 15,492.96</p>
<p>You were much closer with Steel vs Water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that the bulk modulus of air is close to 101 kPa, or 1 atm. This isn't a coincidence; the bulk modulus of an ideal gas is exactly equal to its pressure. You can compare the bulk moduli of various phases and materials <a href="http://john.maloney.org/Structural/overrating_youngs_modulus.htm#Bulk_modulus" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Compressible fluid dynamics is the gateway to jet and rocket stuff, where mach matters and you start doing the math on sideways legal paper. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You also have to use compressible multiphase fluid dynamics for petroleum engineering. We used to have to use super high pressure mercury in experiments since water was too compressible. Also as pressures and temperatures change your fluids can change from gasses to liquids to solids in your pipes which can make things extremely complicated. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Outside of engineering, we basically don't even consider incompressible fluid dynamics in astrophysics, because it fails to be even a remotely accurate approximation. So we have to design our numerical methods from the ground-up to account for densities ranging over many orders of magnitude.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might be intuitively important for some setups to know that water is compressible. For example, in isovolumic measurements of pressure with a latex balloon, you assume the water inside the balloon compresses ever so slightly - so not 100% isovolumic - which can transfer very large pressure measurements to a pressure transducer. If that balloon were steel or you attempted to use a piece of steel to transduce pressure, your results would be attenuated by almost <a href="https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/bulk-modulus-elasticity-d_585.html" target="_blank">2 orders of magnitude</a>. So if a student were assuming that water and steel were both equally incompressible, the results would be awfully confusing. I was that student at one point in time.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or decreasing the pressure moves it from liquid to solid.</p>
<p>I'm thinking specifically, leaving a beer in the freezer long enough to get really cold but remain liquid and not break the bottle. Take it out, open it, which releases pressure, and it changes to ice.</p>
<p>Because the beer is under pressure, cooling it below zero doesn't change it to ice (that little triangle in the phase diagram) but the lowering the pressure moves it vertically down to the solid phase.</p></div>		</li>
