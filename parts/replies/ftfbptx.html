<p>I work in a field where scientists need to apply for government grants, some of which are big enough that they need to be approved by a member of Congress. In order to get that funding approved, the scientist needs to be able to explain to that congressperson what effect this project will have on the world. So, then that congressperson can say their name is on some bill that funded research for x,y,z.</p>
<p>Well, when you're explaining scientific research to a member of Congress who doesn't understand it, a lot of the time, it gets over simplified and dumbed down. Telling them that in a roundabout way, the work you are doing is going to contribute to cancer research often gets misinterpreted as &quot;I'm going to cure cancer.&quot;</p>
<p>Let that info filter down again through the media, and it's like the telephone game, the end result that hits an article is pretty far away from what the scientist said originally.</p>

<p>The problem is overzealous reporting of unreproducible findings brought on by an intrinsic need for researchers to publish &quot;paradigm shifting results&quot; in high impact journals in order to keep their jobs. There was a project called the Cancer Biology Reproducibility project that found that over 90% of landmark studies produced in cancer biology could not be reproduced. It's a massive problem. </p>
<p>Unreported mice ages and strains of cells, not knowing the difference between an independent experiment and a technical repeat, mincing of images to make them appear nice looking and lazy and sometimes shoddy reporting of exactly how they performed an experiment leads to a load of work being impossible to replicate and so media pick up on it, report it and sometimes a whole new field of study is spawned around a false result. Its atrocious and it's been talked about and largely ignored for years.</p>
<p>Another problem is that work must be novel and new, reproduction studies are mostly not accepted by journals meaning you could technically falsify an entire study and get a nice shiny publication in Nature or Cell. More emphasis on the importance of replication studies over the need to publish flashy &quot;paradigm shifting&quot; work every issue needs to be brought to the fore by editors of journals themselves.</p>
