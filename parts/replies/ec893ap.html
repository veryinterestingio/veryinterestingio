			<div class="markdown"><p>Also chef here. Stop giving out the secrets. I work in an area where if people realized they could make ranch like we do I would be out of business. </p>
<p>(for home use its 2 small packs ranch, smallish tub of sour cream, 2 cups mayo and roughly a cup of buttermilk. If it's too thick add more. Too thin add a bit of sour cream) </p>
<p>Edit: lol of course I get gold for the ranch recipe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh it's definitely not good for you. If you are using the heavy duty restaurant style mayo it's even better/worse depending on how you lean.</p>
<p>Also: you can buy the stuff at your local restaurant supply store. They also tend to have really good bulk prices on all sorts of shit you would never expect. Need cases of candy bars? Covered. 100 kilos of frozen breaded calamari? Done. 3 gallon Jerry cans of olive oil? How many you need? Do yourselves a favor and check it out</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. In restaurant, they don't care about your wellbeing and health, they care about the taste as it is what bring the money in. At home, if you buy it premade, you have a nice label that tell you how unhealthy it is. If you make it you realise even more how unhealthy it is because you see all the baddies that you add in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. This one is even easier. </p>
<p>Cup of mayo, 1/3rd cup of mustard (Experiment with different kinds, ive never found a bad one) and a fat squeeze/spoon of your favorite honey. whisk/stir vigorously until the color changes. You will know what I mean. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A cup of so of mayo, a large spoonful each of both yellow and Dijon mustard, a small pinch of prepared horseradish, a drizzle of honey (50-60% of the total amount of mustard you put in, I'd say), a squeeze of fresh lemon and orange juice, salt and pepper. Super flavorful and nuanced yet fast enough to throw together for a quick snack. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah yes. 4 years ago I served a four top. I was collecting plates and one of the gentlemen asked for dessert and a side of ranch with his cheesecake. Weird, but I don't judge. </p>
<p>He sat there, ate the cheesecake and drank the ranch like it was an espresso. It made me instantly distrust people that ask for ranch if they don't have food in front of them. I judged him. I judged him HARD. </p>
<p>He literally sat, one leg crossed over the other and sipped his ranch like they were at a sweet little cafe in Italy and not a basketball restaurant at a theme park. The restaurant has since closed and been changed to a new themed restaurant but every time I go there I have to stare at the spot where part of my soul died. </p>
<p>He tipped well though.</p></div>		</li>
