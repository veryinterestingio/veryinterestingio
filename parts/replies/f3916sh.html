<p>Light always travels at the same speed for any observer, it doesnâ€™t just seem that way. That would presumably be the case as well if the speed of light were much lower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not saying that it JUST seems that way</p>
<p>I'm merely pointing out that this is what is observed</p>
<p>The speed itself is important.  Anything travelling at the speed of light would would have this same effect, however if light somehow travelled slower (ignoring the fact that it can't be slowed down) then it would stop having this effect.</p>
<p>It isn't the light itself that is special, it's the speed at which the light travels that is important (not that the two can be separated from one another)</p>
<p>The speed of light really is akin to an infinite speed in many ways (disclaimer, it is NOT infinite speed, but it is remarkably similar in many ways). Too the point where we sometimes change the units of speeds so that the speed of light is 100% (aka 1) and all other speeds are some percentage of that speed (a number between 0 and 1)</p></div>		</li>
