			<div class="markdown"><p>Happens to me all the time. About once a week at least. But I also have a Derealization Disorder where the world doesn't feel real / I am often hyper aware of my conciousness / existence. So maybe I just have the type of brain that's constantly overanalyzing everything I'm feeling and perceiving.</p>
<p>But yeah, same for me. I always have a loud fan and something else like tv or music going. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same for me. I just accept now that it's going to be a while and start watching a show or something for an hour before I try again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've trained myself to do this on purpose. I was having a horrible time falling asleep, 2-3 hours to get to sleep. Whenever I woke up, I would always wonder: what finally did it? How did I fall asleep? I then made some personal mission to try and stay conscious as long as possible before I fell asleep. Not sure how I did it, maybe just the intention, but over a week I would stay conscious longer and longer while my brain drifted off. </p>
<p>What I noticed is that, as soon as things &quot;started&quot;, I would basically start to hallucinate. I believe it was essentially me staring at the back of my eyelids and making weird shapes, animals, figures, etc, out of them - kind of like when you are on psychedelics. Almost immediately once that started, scenes started to take shape, and dreams began immediately. Usually I would give in to the dream, but for a few moments, I would be thinking to myself, &quot;yep, here we go into a dream.&quot;</p>
<p>Pretty cool stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I do that! The second part. When I’m sleepy I tend to be able to control hallucinations while my eyes are controlled, in a quasi-lucid manner. Although, mine tends to focus on color and intensity rather than shape. I see bright lights, most commonly white, purple, and blue. Sometimes I can force it to be black, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's amazing! This happened to me a few times. You should check out /r/LucidDreaming because it seems you've nearly mastered it. You can enter your dream and be fully conscious of it, and have full control of it, like a video game. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m on NDRIs and probably 7 times out 10, the worrying thought is dramatic enough to startle me awake. Sometimes it’s an auditory hallucination like a voice, or one time an explosion so loud I thought a gas tank outside must have caught fire. Pretty crazy stuff. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not.  Same thing for me, because I identified that the last 10 to 15 minutes before we fall asleep does not get committed to long term memory, much or at all.</p>
<p>So to notice these stages that happen every night, you have to wake yourself up, and stay awake for 15 minutes before going back to sleep, or you'll forget what the stages before sleep look like.</p>
<p>Once they're identified you know you're going to go to sleep in the next 20-30 seconds, and because you can recognize it you get a choice to wake yourself back up or let yourself fall to sleep.  I suspect this would be beneficial when dozing off at the wheel, but I am not going to test that hypothesis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that definitely happens. Due to poor life circumstances in the past I used to often find myself at the wheel nearly falling asleep. When you’re sleep deprived but doing something dangerous you can start to slip into what is called microsleep where you are starting to fall asleep but your brain jolts you awake in that fashion, even without your eyes closing. It can happen multiple times within minutes of each other. You even can start to dream in that time (there was a House episode about it, I think). </p>
<p>Please note I do not condone this behavior if at all avoidable. It’s dangerous and irresponsible much like drunk driving. Unfortunately due to how driving is a necessity in the USA though, sometimes people cannot avoid it.</p></div>		</li>
