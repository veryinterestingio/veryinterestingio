			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right.  I was trying to make the point that the ancient Egyptians were about as old to the Romans, as the Romans are to us.  About 2000+ years.</p>
<p>The ancients did like to travel.  Certainly visiting festivals a couple days journey was not unheard of.  If you were well off, you might go a weeks travel.  The wealthy traveled great distances.  </p>
<p>But even regular people in the army or bureaucracy may well have traveled “on the job”.  Roman soldiers were stationed around the known world and during peacetime, would certainly have wanted to see what they could.</p></div>		</li>
