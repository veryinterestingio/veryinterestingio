Frying oil replaces water that evaporates from the heat, so there is very little actual water left in the finished product.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Time and temperature are both factors.</p>
<p>Ideally, most fried foods you should take out of the fryer before the last of the water comes out of them, because the water coming out of them is exactly what stops the oil from going into them. The positive pressure of the water vapor coming out.</p>
<p>This has another weird fact related to it, which is that most fried foods are essentially being steamed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not true. If most of the water in fries were replaced with oil they'd be totally crisp like potato chips and pretty gross.</p>
<p>Oil only removes water from, and soaks into, the outermost layer of the fry. The rest of the inside is still white, fluffy, potato full of water.</p>
<p>I don't know where this idea comes from that oil &quot;replaces&quot; water in fries (you're not the only person I've heard it from), but it's simply not true unless you're frying for so long that your fries turn rock-hard.</p></div>		</li>
