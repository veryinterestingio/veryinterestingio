			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a good rule of thumb : feces come in 3rds 1/3 bacteria 1/3 dead cells from gut 1/3 undigested stuff . (Not counting water here) in reality the proportions vary considerably but bacteria are always a major fraction</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to be clear, it's not 30%. About 75 to 80% of feces is water; of the rest, about 30% of <strong>that</strong> is dead bacteria, so about 8% to 10% of your total volume.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My eldest was so bad that I had to cover my knee with a cloth every time I fed her and it would still result in the need for a full outfit change for both me and her.  I was reassured this was normal.  Two babies later (they didn't do that) I determined that this was a lie.</p></div>		</li>
