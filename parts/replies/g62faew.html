			<div class="markdown"><p>Manslaughter is when your actions cause someone to die but it was not your intention to kill them</p>
<p>EDIT: sorry an example might help, if you pushed someone and they fell over and banged their head and died it would probably be manslaughter as you had no intention to kill them, just to push them over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I understand this stuff, I see how it gets kind of confusing when you hear terms like &quot;voluntary manslaughter.&quot; That adjective there might suggest to someone that indeed manslaughter could involve intent to murder...but basically, that &quot;voluntary&quot; is referring to a desire to <em>harm</em> rather than <em>murder</em>.</p>
<p>So technically, saying &quot;manslaughter can't be voluntary&quot; might be something we'd all agree is true, assuming we're talking about the murder aspect of it, which I find reasonable, (since, inarguably, the most conspicuous thing about a manslaughter is the taking of life) whereas the term &quot;voluntary manslaughter&quot; still exists. I'd say the replier talking about our language allowing for nuance is being a bit too optimistic and charitable towards language here. Our language about these concepts is an incredibly mess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be involuntary manslaughter. You can get voluntary manslaughter where you meant to push them to kill them but you didn’t plan to do it there and then. </p>
<p>There’s is also criminal manslaughter (or ‘negligent’ in the UK) where you run a red, hit another car killing someone. Anything where you were so stupid, it resulted in someones death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Manslaughter is generally an accidental or unplanned killing. Killing someone by running them down in a car accidentally can be manslaughter, while planning to kill someone by running them down in a car, waiting in a particular spot for them to pass by then doing it would be murder.</p>
<p>Some definitions of manslaughter include an intentional killing in the heat of the moment, like if party A found party B had assaulted a loved one and choked party B to death. Party A intended the killing but it was not premeditated.</p>
<p>Depends on the jurisdiction really.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this is a late response, but that impression is due to the way &quot;slaughter&quot; has evolved in use.</p>
<p>Originally, &quot;slaughter&quot; was very functional word: it refers to the killing of animals for the purpose of meat, something we wouldn't associate with malice, ill intent, or undue violence, but simply the functional job requirements of a butcher -- we wouldn't, for example, say that a butcher &quot;murdered&quot; a cow to make steaks, as we don't apply that sort of ill intention to that killing. &quot;Slaughtering&quot; a cow is killing it, but not for evil reasons. So &quot;murder&quot; would be seen as killing with malice, while &quot;man slaughter&quot; was killing without malice.</p>
<p>But over the years, &quot;slaughter&quot; has become a much more loaded word. In order to convey horrible violence, we've developed the convention of using the words associated with killing animals (slaughter, butcher, etc.) as a descriptive tool for describing a particularly awful murder, as it implies &quot;treating humans like nothing more than animals&quot;. We use those words to convey cold-bloodedness and disregard for basic humanity, to describe serial killers or the villains in horror films, which is why &quot;slaughter&quot; now feels more violent than &quot;murder&quot; -- today, we use the word more often for the purposes of evocative description and hyperbole than we do for its original, more functional meaning.</p></div>		</li>
