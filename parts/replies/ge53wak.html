			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is the many compare electronic to manual with poor technique which would be similar to comparing an automatic drive car to a manual car driven by a novice. </p>
<p>Are there any studies of those with good technique to electric?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, if a big issue with manual brushes is poor technique and switching to electric addresses that, then there's still a clinical benefit. Ease of use is a valid consideration when deciding between products. E: as long as the study isn't purposefully/accidentally selecting subjects who have bad technique.</p>
<p>I would also still like to see a study comparing a good manual technique vs electric though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent point. I think it’s of utmost important for studies like this that look at common health tools to study them exactly how regular average people use them. </p>
<p>How long have dentists been urging people to floss every 6 months, and how many actually do? It doesn’t matter how much benefit it has if you can’t get people to make it part of their routine. In that case tools that make compliance easier and more convenient (like water flossers in this example) should have that factored into their resulting overall effectiveness. </p>
<p>Then again that’s kind of the crux of most public health questions, isn’t it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While you raise a valid point the end result is still important. For the average person an ultrasonic toothbrush is more effective than a manual.</p>
<p>The same could also be said for people who use ultrasonic toothbrushes as well. Some people use them like a normal toothbrush instead of slowly moving from tooth to tooth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for answer, however that is not exactly what im asking about. Electric beats traditional, no doubt about that. My question is whether sonic beats electric and if then how much. Considering that they cost up to 30x times more than an electric one i would expect a lot of info about that but most of the reviews i see are either untrustworthy or made by people who sell them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the bottom link posted above - <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7175112/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7175112/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>By direct comparison of different toothbrushing systems, <strong>most clinical trials show that the sonic/ultrasonic toothbrushes perform better</strong> than purely non-acoustic powered brushes. Sonic/ultrasonic toothbrushes may have the potential to reduce more dental biofilm by stimulating more hydrodynamic effects and also by forcing more efficient brushing motions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The quote pulled by the above poster from the same article seems to have been misinterpreted to conclude that the cheapest electric toothbrush is pretty much just as good as the most expensive ultrasonic toothbrush.  It was awkwardly worded - all three types (electric, sonic, ultrasonic) are electric toothbrushes.  </p>
<p>The conclusion arrived at is that electric toothbrushes that include sonic and ultrasonic are best at providing good oral hygiene.  The cheap electric toothbrushes that are neither sonic nor ultrasonic performed the worst but still better than manual.  That doesn't help you decide it it's worth it, but it does indicate that acoustic powered brushes are better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does answer your question tho. In one of the bolded excerpts it said there is no difference between the benefit of sonic v ultrasonic over manual. IE the benefit does not justify the price</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read that as there is no difference between brands of toothbrushes that <em>combine</em> ultrasonic and sonic (which is common for ultrasonic to also have sonic, as it removes things ultrasonic can't by itself). Most electric toothbrushes do not have ultrasonic.</p></div>		</li>
