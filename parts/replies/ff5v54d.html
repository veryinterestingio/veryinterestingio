			<div class="markdown"><p>Getting more specific about how our bodies keep everything compact, our stomach aren't just huge open sacks. Much like our lungs, our stomachs have the ability to expand pretty significantly to fit large meal, but empty are normally only about 12&quot;x6&quot;. That does leave room for there to be sloshing around if you have too much liquid in your stomach, but not nearly enough for objects to &quot;bounce&quot; uncomfortably.</p></div>		</li>
