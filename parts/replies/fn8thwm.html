			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree. They should maintain any type of sequencing phenomena or alteration that might have occurred due to the translation to cDNA in the published sequence. Will help for troubleshooting later when looking at true RNA sequences (transcriptomes, etc.) and in truth what was sequenced was DNA. Makes me curious now if there are RNA assemblies (“trancriptomes”) of virus genomes available.</p></div>		</li>
