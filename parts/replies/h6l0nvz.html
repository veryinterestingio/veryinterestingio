<p>The breakthrough rate is low.</p>

<p>Is this still the case for the Delta variant? The recent studies from Israel suggest two doses of the mRNA vaccines is only 39% effective in preventing infection from Delta in real-world conditions. While a great deal of protection, this indicates the rate of breakthrough cases is now higher than the rate of individuals that contract covid in the vaccinated population.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that the CDC breakthrough tracking stats that are publicly exposed are no longer tracking breakthrough cases in general, but now only track those resulting in death or hospitalization. I'm guessing they removed the general breakthrough tracking stats because it was beginning to look less optimistic with all the new variants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Israel is reporting the vaccine is 39% effective against the Delta variant. Here is Massachusetts we are seeing a cluster of breakthrough cases on Cape Cod. In June the daily positive cases were under 50, now over 500 a day. Massachusetts is one of the highest vaccinated states and I am surprised how many people I know who were vaccinated and now have Covid.  Fortunately, so far, the cases are mild and no hospitalizations or deaths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The number is actually around 64% against infection period and almost 90% against severe cases, but keep in mind that Israel is doing huge amounts of surveillance testing, regardless if somebody is symptomatic or not. In most other countries, people would write off cold symptoms as a cold and not jump to a breakthrough mild case of covid.</p>
<p>If you want real life data, look at what's coming out of the hospitals here in the US, where doctors are reporting that pretty much 99% of severe covid cases are from unvaccinated people.  </p>
<p>In short, just get the damn shot.</p></div>		</li>
