			<div class="markdown"><p>Congratulations! Sounds like a fun job, and one you’re passionate about! </p>
<p>Would you say there has been an increase in space related degree enrollments in recent years? With SpaceX and NASA working closer towards Mars, I would imagine this to be the case. Is the space industry taking off very rapidly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had that same thought when I learned this in school.  Huh, never thought of that, but makes total sense!</p>
<p>Astronauts are only at risk when they go from the cabin to their space suits when the pressure drops from 14.4 PSI to 4.3PSI (American suits), [5.8PSI for the Russian Orlan suits]. They have strict preparation protocols prior to starting the EVA, such as huffing 100% oxygen for a few hours before they don their suits.</p>
<p>Related, when they come back in and the pressure increases, they have to pop their ears. Inside the helmet is a little V thingy they have to wedge their nose into to make popping their ears easier. But more often, they use it to scratch their face when they have an itch.</p></div>		</li>
