			<div class="markdown"><p>Double-vision I guess. I kinda sorta lose what is in the middle. It increases my vision but the brain can’t focus both eyes like that so it kinda goes back and forth between which eye is dominant</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. If you could turn your eyes to the very edge of your visual field, you still wouldn't see much more than just looking straight, since human eyes are forward facing. At the same time, you would lose focus and depth perception, since human eyes work in tandem.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I can only focus with one eye at a time, and even then it's still difficult and blurry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, how did you train for this?
I can go crosseyed and move either eye back and forth. But at the very end, you have one eye looking straight ahead and doing it. What, if any exercises did you do?</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's the hard part. You've completed Step 1.</p>
<p>I've taught a few people to do this. I picked right as a dominant side to learn, but either one works</p>
<p>Step 2) Try look right with both eyes normally. Then slowly cross your eyes. Then look left. Don't rush it, just do it slowly. Now go back to the right. Congrats, you can move one eye at a time!</p>
<p>Step 3) Repeat step 2, slowly. Instead of starting by looking right, start looking straight forward. Now as you slowly squint, slowly start looking look right while concentrating on focusing through your right eye.</p>
<p>Step 4) Once you are used to it, and can focus through an eye, you can slowly try tilting your head while keeping focus. Have you ever looked through a rifle scope or microscope with both eyes open? You need to try focus on what one eyes sees.</p>
<p>Doing this infront of a mirror, friend or phone camera helps.</p>
<p>I taught myself how to do this when I was 11 and bored.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Since you are using muscles that aren't used to being stretched in this order or sequence, it might hurt a bit. Don't push yourself. I haven't hurt my eyes before, but that doesn't mean that there is no risk.</p></div>		</li>
