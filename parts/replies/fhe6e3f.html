			<div class="markdown"><p>Mercator projection maps generally &quot;touch&quot; the sphere at the equator, but any line on the earth can be used to project a map.  There are map projections that correct for distortion farther away from the center of the map.  And a globe is a better representation, but it's not perfect because globes are usually spheres and our planet isn't - it's flatter at the poles and bulges a bit at the equator.</p></div>		</li>
