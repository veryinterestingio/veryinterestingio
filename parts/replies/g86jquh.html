			<div class="markdown"><p>As a doctor, this is pretty much correct. However it should be pointed out that a full on traumatic amputation of a limb, where it is actually ripped off, has a very high mortality rate as unless there is someone else there to tourniquet the remainder of the limb, and do it properly, it's going to bleed out, and the person will die. </p>
<p>Most people who loose a limb in an accident and survive do so because the limb is so damaged that it can't be saved, and the actual amputation takes place in hospital, and the surgeons can tie off the blood vessels. </p>
<p>During an amputation surgery, the large arteries in the limb are tied off with sutures to stop them bleeding. Cautery is used for small blood vessels, and it's not powerful enough for the large ones and would cause too much dead tissue if it was used. This dead tissue would then start to decay, and there would be a very high risk of that artery starting to bleed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Might be a dumb question, but since the blood vessels are in a circulatory system, wouldn't tying off blood vessels cause all the blood there to build up, since it's being pushed by the heart there with no where to return back. Not sure if I'm making sense</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get what you're saying. </p>
<p>The blood that would have gone down that artery simply goes down alternate paths. The body is very adaptable, and within a few days blood pressure is stable and back to normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I’m aware blood doesn’t run in a simple loop (like you are used to from heating or cooling systems which circulate water). It goes into smaller and smaller arteries then diffuses through tissue into the veins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using something called diathermy. There are two variants- monopolar and bipolar. Bipolar is like a pair of tweezers, and the system passes a current between the two points. Monopolar uses a large pad (approx A5 paper size) placed somewhere on the body, and a probe, often with a flat 'cutting' tip, with current passing between the two. They basically use electricity to heat up and burn tissue. </p>
<p>With both variants, the concentration of the current is highest at the point where the tweezers/probe are, and not damaging elsewhere. But you do have to have careful about placing the pad- you don't want to end up running current through a metal artificial joint, or a pacemaker, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What these guys said, but also I'd like to point out that a fair amount of medical instruments aren't too different from civilian stuff. Some of the bone saws used for various surgeries at the hospital I work at are literally Dewalt fucking Saws all's with special blades.</p>
<p>The hard part about surgery is knowing what to cut and, more importantly what not to cut.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I remember, blood vessels are a circuit - blood is pumped e. g to the fingers and then back up to the heart. How is this addressed in an amputation? Don't all the blood vessels suddenly have dead ends?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do have dead ends, but the blood which would have gone down that route is diverted to other 'circuits' if you will. The tied off arteries will atrophy and shrivel up effectively in the areas where it's no longer functional. Within a few days blood pressure is normally stabilised completely as the body is very adaptable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're pretty spot on! They use multiple other hemostasis measures (methods to prevent massive blood loss) along with cauterization during surgical amputations, including medications and, most importantly, tourniquets. And of course, if anything goes wrong they can get blood or blood products into you a lot more quickly in an OR than if you gash your wrist open in your kitchen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also think theres a bit of relevant information surrounding the situations in which injuries as such happen. Unfortunately a lot of deep cut injuries could be the result of suicide attempts. I feel this would add to the fatality rate to skew it negatively as theyll be alone and inaccessible (locked bathroom home alone, for example). Whereas major traumatic injuries are loud, public and visible. People who suffer those injuries want help, and help is likely more aware of the situation. </p>
<p>This by no means accounts for every cutting injury that is fatal, but I think it's worth identifying as a potential factor.</p></div>		</li>
