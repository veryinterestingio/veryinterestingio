			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for posting.  Follow-up question:  Could you dig sufficiently deep enough into Mars that there would be some place with enough pressure and temperature to hold a breathable atmosphere?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would need to go tens of kilometers deep for the pressure. I don't know the temperature profile well enough but it's probably way too hot. And where is the point? Mars' CO2 atmosphere isn't breathable anyway, to avoid losing oxygen you want a closed system even if pressure wouldn't be an issue. That closed system can be much closer to the surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good point.  I hadn't considered what the atmosphere would contain, but I was fascinated by the idea that you might be able to get Earth-like temperature and pressure on a planet by just digging down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it be easier than creating a dome-city on the surface?</p>
<p>I imagine it as two things: alternative to a dome-city, and to gain access to resources far below the surface (if they exist) for reduced-gravity industry. </p>
<p>Either way it would be interesting to bore deeper than you can on earth. Airlock at the surface, huge subterranean caverns at a depth where the temperature or pressure is desirable, introduce plant life to control co2/oxygen levels.</p></div>		</li>

<p>While that is the case, it would be way easier to live under these circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Humans could go without a pressurized suit - all they would need is an oxygen supply.</li>
<li>Habitats would be easier as they would not need to withstand pressure, and would not lose oxygen that fast if breached.</li>
</ul>
<p>So yes, there is a point, but the temperature issue will make it moot, sadly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe you could seal entrances to caves at the bottom of the trenches, but the mars trenches are only something like 5-10km deep, so not nearly enough just by themselves.</p>
<p>With a millions of colossal giant sized Mars Rover/Bulldozers with enough power and geologic time scales, you could likely make an open pit mine at the bottom of a valley many KM deep. Eventually you would likely hit a pressure/temp conductive to life, but there would be way too much CO2 and you'd need to plant mars corn or something to make more O2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ceres is probably the lightest body in our solar system in hydrostatic equilibrium and its internal pressure <a href="http://zolotov.faculty.asu.edu/publ/Zolotov-Ceres-2009.pdf" target="_blank">is estimated at just 1400 atmospheres while the temperature is estimated to be far below freezing</a></p>
<p>Our deep oil wells regularly get to those conditions and then some. So theoretically it should be possible for us to dig a hole straight through Ceres and keep that hole open with modern day materials.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Falling through such a tunnel dug between Ceres's poles, under the simplifying assumption of a constant density for Ceres, would take one and a half hours, so it would be a time saving too compared to a train going across the surface, assuming similar maximum speeds to current high-speed rail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, it would be an interesting thought experiment, but you would need to set an upper pressure limit (i.e. pick a reasonable pressure that a real world material could withstand) and then work through the calculations of pressure as a function of depth for a variety of objects which will be a function of their internal structure (i.e. the density and thicknesses of the different layers will determine both how gravitational acceleration and lithostatic pressure vary as a function of depth). That's more work than I at least am willing to do for an AskScience post.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To compare, the biggest issue in Earth's deepest mines, about 2-3 miles deep, is simply that as soon as you make a hole in the rock it starts getting squished shut.  If you drill a hole it will be oval in a few hours.  Everything you do has to be planned around the planet trying to shut down your little operation.</p></div>		</li>
