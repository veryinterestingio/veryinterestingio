			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, I may have misunderstood your question OP. If I have, let me apologize, but also elaborate. </p>
<p>If you’re talking about the little balls deep in the skin of the lips, and you can poke them with the tip of your tongue. You can move them around, but they’re not squishy. </p>
<p>These would be your minor salivary glands. I would recommend looking up mucocele, and see if that suffices your curiousity. That’s what happens when the ducts of those glands gets clogged up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. </p>
<p>All these folks talking about cancer are forgetting that you need a mixture of things to have cancer cells (activators, proto-oncogens, etc.)</p>
<p>You’ll get more fibrous tissue forming. Maybe larger traumatic fibromas. Those can get excised easily. </p>
<p>The only problem that can arise is if you were numb after a procedure, and you keep biting. Not feeling what you’re doing can lead to significant damage to your tissue. Your teeth are very strong. Look up local anesthetic trauma. </p>
<p>Other than that, no long term consequences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you are constantly destroying your cells and forcing them to replicate, it increases the chances that one could become cancerous and thus lead to mouth cancer.</p>
<p>I wouldn't worry about it too much but it's something to think about. I bite the inside of mouth like crazy...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because if so I always just bite those off too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you can bite them off, then that’s the fibrous tissue I was talking about. </p>
<p>You can’t bite off your minor salivary glands because it’s too painful. And you need to be biting extremely hard leading to a significant amount of damage.</p></div>		</li>
