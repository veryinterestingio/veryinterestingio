			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose there's a world where it might actually be easier to sell tickets after the game starts, because people are just trying to get in and less likely to argue. one time my dad and I were driving through Indianapolis on the night of the Final Four and decided to grab tickets and got a couple after the game began.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a buyer, I use waiting until the game starts to my advantage.  Those tickets are going to be essentially worthless in like a half hour, so most people are just willing to take whatever they can get.</p>
<p>I've gotten some amazing seats for a very popular and successful sports team for some very low prices using this method.</p></div>		</li>
