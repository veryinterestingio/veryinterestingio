			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. Caffiene was the last drug I couldn't kick. I wanted to prove to myself I could quit. I noticed a month or so later how much less I sweat. I kinda like it. I might drink coffee again this spring. Nothing beats waking and having a cup, read news til you have to pis then out the door for a morning run. I can't see me ever drinking coffee in the middle of the day again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but I quit caffeine because my sleep schedule was garbage. Not that I couldn't sleep, it was the opposite. I fall asleep very easily but have a VERY hard time waking up. Now that I quit caffeine things got A LOT better and I can successfully wake up at 7 after 7.5hrs of sleep, which might not sound like much but it has been am issue for most of my life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Caffeine is a stimulant, so is nicotine. Imagine the glorious morning shits I get once I've started my day with my cup of coffee, my snus(nicotine) and also my amphetamine adhd meds. That's a holy trinity of needing to go right fucking now lol.</p></div>		</li>
