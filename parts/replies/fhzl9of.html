			<div class="markdown"><p>I kinda agree with the other guy. Dying from heart failure at 35 isn't considered dying of old age but dying from heart failure at 90 is. It's about perspective. </p>
<p>With that in mind, apparently lobsters can live so long that they grow too big to feed themselves. Like, they're still fit enough to feed themselves but they can't eat fast enough to keep up with their body's energy requirements (not because they've slowed down but because they require more food than ever because they grow larger every year) so they eventually starve to death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. You don’t just stop living after a certain age. You become weak enough to be killed by something that wouldn’t of killed you when you were younger. You don’t die of old age. You die of heart disease, pneumonia, flu, bacterial infection, cancer etc etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't even have to be a specific disease like that. As you age, your body stops copying DNA correctly. Over time, your organs just can't do what they're supposed to. An otherwise healthy heart can just stop beating because enough cells have failed to replicate properly.</p></div>		</li>
