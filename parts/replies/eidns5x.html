<p>It's literally elementary school level arithmetic.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Your savings account isn't available online, only in person and you have a low daily limit even though you have high stores in it. Trying to spend out of it for your day to day stuff won't be possible simply for convenience sake.</p>
<p>(The fat system is really slow at processing and breaking it down, the muscle is more readily available to break itself down when working than steal from fats) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The last part of your statements is not true, your body starts breaking down fat after 12-14 hours, and doesn’t begin to break down muscle until 24-48 hours.  And even then it almost never breaks down more muscle than fat until the % of body fat starts getting low.  Your body can get the vast majority of its energy from fats, it only needs to burn a tiny bit of muscle to get protein for your brain to run on (glucose synthesis).</p>
<p>And that’s assuming you’re straight up starving,  if that weren’t the case then nobody would be able to gain muscle mass while intermittent fasting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK, that's what happens, but the question implies that muscle is burned before the fat reserve is consumed. I am not sure that happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. It makes no sense at all that the body would store energy as fat for future use and then burn muscle instead. Myth indeed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Initially, muscle is only consumed to provide glycogen, and the rest is coming from fat. But consuming muscle isn't the only way the body reduces energy expenditure. With the Biosphere II participants, they found that of their 180 kcal lower energy expenditure, about 1/3 was from reduced muscle mass, 1/3 was from reduced fidgeting, and the remainder was from a combination of statistically insignificant sources.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But all of that seemed a bit more advanced than an ELI5 explanation would justify. </p></div>		</li>
