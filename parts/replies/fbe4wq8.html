			<div class="markdown"><p>This is fascinating, thank you. I tried to read about this myself but I just don't have the background to fully understand some of what I was reading, so your explanations are helpful. I also noticed a lot of different conclusions were being reached by different researchers. Your bit about memorization is especially helpful. I don't know why I assumed blind memorization to be inherently bad, or a wrong way to learn. </p>
<p>It's been interesting me for a long time. I'm an ESL tutor, so reading comprehension is also an example of this that I notice a lot. They often know what &quot;the, man, is, in, the, and van&quot; mean individually, but if they read &quot;The man is in the van,&quot; they often can't tell me where the man is. I know language learning and math learning are very different, but one example always reminds me of the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah unfortunately math research suffers a ton from to technical in some ways, to dissimilar from other like research (people just make up or use terms to mean different things) and just to many wholes in the research due to lack of total volume. </p>
<p>Furthermore there isnt an agreed upon model for math learning triple code was the prevailing modality for last decade ish but we also know it's not correct we just dont really have many better theories. </p>
<p>Interestingly enough math and language more and more appear very similar at least in how we fail. Studies done on dyslexic students and MLD students (dyscalculia is a less used term in modern research but not gone) find that there isnt a statistical difference in performance on math or language between the two, though both have statistical differences between controls. It would appear the main issue is some form of tract integrity and communication issue between neural networks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would love to see some of your resources! I'm a teacher and my professional development goal this year has to do with intervention strategies. </p>
<p>I also have this really amazing math student who can solve almost any problem I give him (within reason, he's in the 4th grade so up to around Algebra I), but he knows absolutely no math facts, and I find that fascinating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I get back to a work computer I can link some stuff for sure. </p>
<p>If you are focusing on intervention strategies that was the primary aim of our review. In terms of useful interventions the one with the most statistical power behind its efficacy was a program called dybuster calcularis. But graphic organizers especially in word problems scenarios can be very effective specifically the KNWS type. </p>
<p>With your student how would you describe math facts? It's quite possible he has a math fact understanding but may not be able to express what hes doing. I was a lot like that as a student I would preform operations but lack the ability to explain why it how I really did it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, if he needs to know 7x8, he doesn't have it memorized. He'll work it out every time. It's not a problem, and I'd rather have his situation than the other way around. I just find it fascinating. (He scores in the 99th+ percentile on standardized tests, so it's obviously not getting in the way of his success.)</p></div>		</li>
