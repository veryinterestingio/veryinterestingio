			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to river guide during summers and I broke a couple ribs but originally thought j had just bruised them so I finished out the season. after a few days with no paddling or much exercise it got to the point where I could barely breath so I went to the hospital and sure enoigh i had a couple of cracked ribs.  I was having trouble taking deep breathes so they provided me with one of those devices you're periodically supposed to blow into.  I wish I
had a cool story for how I broke them...I was between trips headed to my bunk when I tried to jump over a rope barrier that was swinging and I landed right on it.  My feet flew out from under me and i landed head first then my chest.  Luckily i was wearing my helmet still.  I'm still proud of myself for paddling 20+ miles a day on cracked ribs though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had this since I was a kid. I used to be able to inhale through the pain until I reached the &quot;pop&quot; that released it. As I got older, the attached became less frequent but more intense. I couldn't bear the pain enough to inhale and reach the pop, so I'd have to breathe shallowly until it went away.</p>
<p>Now I'm in my 30s, and I can't remember the last time I had an attack. My life is 10000× less stressful, so maybe that's related.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Make sure it’s not gallstones... I used to get them randomly in my early twenties and in my thirties I got chronic pancreatitis from the damage it did.  If it happens more than once a month for up to a minute, I suggest seeing a doc.  </p>
<p>I just thought it was random “growing pains” and was actually in decent shape (military) and it was infrequent so didn’t think much of it.... sucks now, because of the damage it permanently did.</p></div>		</li>
