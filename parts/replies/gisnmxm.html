<p>Additionally, fossilized remains do not contain cells. They are molds of the cells (bones) that used to be there before the sediment hardened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are sources of ancient animals that MAY contain traces of DNA. OP mentions mammoths, which have been found frozen and preserved such that they still have blood in their veins.</p>
<p>Irish Elk maybe haven't been quite as well preserved, but scientists have extracted Irish Elk DNA from antlers.</p>
<p>and DoDos were around recently enough that stuffed and museum specimens likely still have usable DNA as well.</p>
<p>Now, for species that went extinct much longer ago, there likely isn't much that can be done, but we can definitely get DNA for some extinct animals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. The artificial womb has to deliver all the proper, highly complex chemical signals at the right time. That's hard enough when we have living mother animals that we can monitor. Even if we could put together an intact DNA code we could (in theory) print it out and inject it into an egg, the development would be an entire different problem.</p>
<p>Eventually, though, we might learn enough about the in-womb development process of related animals and maybe assisted by computer simulations that we might get it to work. But that would be many decades out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can't just stick the DNA in a cell; there's a lot of other bits and pieces that need to be there before the DNA is even useful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surrogates. If there's a close enough relation, it could be done. This is what they're doing with the rhinos that recently went extinct by using other rhinos to carry the embryo. A moose could probably carry an elk, maybe an elephant could carry a mammoth. They wouldn't necessarily need to be able to breed each other in order for it to work, it's more that their gestation cycles have to match enough. Heck even getting it to carry partway would be fascinating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One open question science won't answer for ethical reasons, is whether humans could cross-breed with chimps. The theory is that we'd produce a sterile hybrid (like donkeys and horses cross-breeding and producing mules). But there are so many thorny ethical issues that no one wants to try it, and I'm sure there aren't a lot of women lining up to get pregnant with a human-chimp hybrid just to see what would happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The end of my knowledge was that comment. I just know they're working on stuff like that, I don't know specifics. I'd imagine that's a good cross species candidate to try, but because it's a human embryo, it'll never fly. Ditto the other way too. Human experimentation won't happen in this century.</p></div>		</li>
