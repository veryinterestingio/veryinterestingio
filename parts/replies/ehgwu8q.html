			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really hard one to answer.  I am convinced that stem cell therapies will happen, and I truly hope we will see the first stem cell therapies within diabetes in the next decade or so, but there are many potential obstacles that can affect the process until we have an approved drug.  Having said this, there are already some companies out there that are developing these stem cell therapies and at least one of them is in the process of conducting clinical trials. The cells they seem to be using are not as fully developed as the beta cells as we just published, but the proof of principle for such technologies is being developed now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Things can be expedited if the benefit exceedingly out weighs the risks, so weâ€™ll see. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the number one problem I see. Some one is making a large profit off selling insulin and they have a big incentive to not let a cure develop unless they could control the cure and sell it for the average cost of insulin over a diabetics lifetime. We need a way to produce cheap insulin first before we can consider a cure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look into insulin prices. Insulin is expensive due to price fixing and nothing else. Systemic change and oversight is what's needed.</p></div>		</li>
