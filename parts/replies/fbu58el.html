			<div class="markdown"><p>Gem grade diamonds are expensive, but industrial grade diamonds are not; you can buy them for $160/kg - $500/kg, depending.</p>
<p>Diamonds have a lot of scientific and industrial applications, so them being slick isn't really something that is surprising for people to discover; they're pretty useful.</p>
<p>Plus if you ever manipulate a large diamond, the fact that it is slick would be obvious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Temperature works oddly in a vacuum. Essentially, room temperature as we understand it in our day-to-day experience won’t exist. The most effective ways of heat transfer, convection and conduction, don’t work, so you’re left with radiation, which at “room temperature” is more-or-less negligible. </p>
<p>I also don’t mean that a diamond in a vacuum will spontaneously sublimate, but rather the sublimation rate will be substantially higher than it would be at 1 atm. It’s more of a gradual process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really have no idea but it could be by its vaporization pressure of pure C that some is lost. Not a whole phase change but enough driving force for a nonzero amount of diamond to evaporate off</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, everything sublimates a bit in a vacuum. The speed of each particle in a substance at room temprature will follow a statistical distribution, with most particles having a moderate velocity, but with a few outliers. A sufficiently speedy molecule or atom can escape a solid into the environment, and if the partial pressure of that substance as a gas in the environment is too low for the reverse to happen, there will be some net sublimation.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean the amount of material lost will be significant, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One could say there are plausible hypothesis, but I'm not sure I'd say it &quot;isn't really true&quot; we don't know why we sleep.  William Dement, one of the leading sleep researchers in the world famously said:</p>

<p>As far as I know, the only reason we need to sleep that is really really solid is because we get sleepy.”</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's to re-synthesize the depleted neurotransmitters which would've otherwise been utilized if a person was awake. Replenishing neurotransmitters is a continuous process but the rate at which they're used up is greater than the rate of synthesis and that ratio can be reversed by putting the body in a conservative state. This is also why lack of sleep can precipitate seizures as the inhibitory neurotransmitters are depleted causing unchecked excitatory discharges.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a sleep researcher and I can tell you that the “true” function of sleep is not well known. There are many interesting and promising ideas universally with conflicting evidence. This idea that neurotransmitter stores are replenished during sleep is not impossible but this seems unlikely given the fact that most neurons in the cortex do NOT significantly decrease their firing rate during sleep. We still don’t know what’s going on folks.</p>
