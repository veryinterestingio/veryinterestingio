<p>In processed foods Sodium can come from other sources such as the preservative <strong>Sodium Nitrate, which has far more Sodium per molecule and by weight.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's not at all true. NaNO3 has a molecular weight of 85 g/mol, compared to NaCl at 59. So the sodium is 27% of the NaNO3 mass, and 39% of the NaCl mass. In both cases it's one sodium per molecule.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, remember that since Na has an atomic mass of 23 and chlorine is 35.5, the sodium mass on the packet is about ⅖ the mass of salt you'd need to have to get the equivalent - assuming the Na all came from NaCl.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In fact, too much of it can be really gross.</p>
<p>You'll normally see it listed after sugar and salt in the ingredients list.</p></div>		</li>
