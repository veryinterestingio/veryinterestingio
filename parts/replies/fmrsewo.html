			<div class="markdown"><p>That's perhaps true but the difference is both academic (if you die of a heart attack it really won't help you any that you have died because of your immune system going bonkers and not the virus infecting your heart directly) and also we don't have enough data on this yet.</p>
<p>However, the data we **do have** suggest that this may be a possibility. That's why conclusive claims like &quot;does not infect other parts of the body, e.g. muscle tissue.&quot; are extremely premature at best, completely (and dangerously) wrong at worst.</p></div>		</li>
