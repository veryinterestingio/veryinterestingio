			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. It's all about moisture. In hot climates AC dries the air, and in cool climates heating (even just lightbulbs) lowers humidity. The net effect is that occupied spaces are much dyer and that prevents everything from rotting away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In general, humidity is not an issue throughout most of CA (but remember, CA is a BIG state with <a href="https://www.gardenzeus.com/climate-zones/" target="_blank">every major climate zone</a>, so take with a grain of salt).</p></div>		</li>
