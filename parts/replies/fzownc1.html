<p>That's only one side of the coin.</p>
<p>Engineers originated in the military. They are the cause of thousands of times more deaths than doctors could ever hope to save.</p>
<p>These scales aren't balanced the way that engineer thinks they are. And I'm an engineer. I don't work for the military but I understand that historically, 99% of engineers built siege towers, onagers and other military hardware.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No science is the key, the accumulation of factual, verifiable knowledge. And this was only possible once society produced enough surplus, creating a class of wealthy educated men that had the means to devote their life to science. Electricity at first was used in magic shows. It was the continued study and discovering the laws governing it that made it usefull. Steam engines were known by the Romans. But not really used till the english needed something to pump water from the coal mines. Only made possible because of their prestigious scientific Royal Society etc. That period is called the enlightenment. Reason above all. Humanity had to change. The resources were always there, if you knew how to use them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would dispute your assertions on sewage, hygene and sexual health in the timeframe stated in the title.</p>
<p>Of course they're nowhere near as comprehensive as they are today, but the Romans had these things down to a degree thousands of years ago, even if they didn't fully understand them.</p>
<p>Recorded examples of condoms can be found in the 1500's and they likely go back far, far further.</p>
<p>Basic surgical procedures that were survivable have been recorded since 3000 BC (trephining/amputation).  But of course the mortality rate would likely have been huge.</p>
<p>There were plenty of survivors and wounded from the Napoleonic Wars.  Bad wounds were not necesssarily a death sentence.</p>
<p>We're talking about the mid 1800's here, not the dark ages.  That said in comparison to today it might as well have been.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The Romans stood out because that was far from the norm at that time or for hundreds of years since.  Now we have these things much better, on every continent and most of the population. We can do other things rather than fight for our lives</p>
<p>This is why it’s so critical to help those areas that haven’t benefitted yet.  Think of the energy, industry, motivation bringing India forward, then think of how much more potential they have if some of Modi’s public health and education initiatives succeed in bringing the rest of the population along. Think of how far the “developed” world has come and what we could do if Bill Gates’ efforts help so many millions more people past the basic starvation and disease stage so they can participate in the modern world</p></div>		</li>
