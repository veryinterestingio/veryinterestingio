			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the engineering.  Remember, the side of the spaceship facing the sun is having a tremendous amount of heat radiating towards it, and the side away from the sun you are mostly radiating to the background radiation of space, or around 3degrees Kelvin.  So by running cooling loops to both sides you have a lot of flexibility in controlling temperature.</p>
<p>Here is an interesting video from NASA on the how the Parker Solar Probe will survive the temperature in the Sun's orbit. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9laVHZZQo" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9laVHZZQo</a> It will get within 3 million miles of the Sun and will visit the Corona of the Sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on how reflective the spaceship is. It'll just get hotter and hotter as well, you'll need some system to cool it down at a certain rate which isn't easy in space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it does depend on how the spaceship absorbs light, it will radiate heat through blackbody radiation and reach an equilibrium temperature, not heat up forever. As I calculated in my comment, an ideal, spherical black body would reach equilibrium at room temperature about 0.9 AU from the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How about your body itself? Would there be an equilibrium point where the net of heat absorbed by your body minus heat radiated away was similar to being in a comfortable environment on Earth?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. You’re ability to radiatively cool is vastly crappy in a vacuum relative to the dosage of solar energy from the sun. You’d just heat up. Check out the crazy lengths they have to go to just to cool the ISS</p>
<p>Edit: assuming you’re inside an insulated box. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ISS could do without radiators, but it wouldn't stay at a workable temperate. It wouldn't randomly melt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of how you feel when part of you is in direct sunlight and part of you is in the shade on earth. Without conduction or convection, there would be far less heat transfer. A part of you may be at a comfortable temperature for an instant, but any parts exposed to the sun would rapidly overheat and have minimal ability to gat rid of that heat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's in shadow then it will cool off,  eventually reaching some very low temperature.</p>
<p>If light from the Sun or energy from some other source is shining on it,  then it'll heat up. </p></div>		</li>
