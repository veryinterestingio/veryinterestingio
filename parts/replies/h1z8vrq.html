			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you seem knowledgeable on this topic- you talk about the species barrier with prion diseases. I know that they SAY there is no evidence of Chronic Wasting Disease from ungulates (most commonly deer) being passed to humans via consumption of venison, but how likely is it that there's a true species barrier there vs. it just not being adequately detected?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a great question that everyone I know studying prions has discussed in depth. The short answer: all evidence available currently suggests no.</p>
<p>The long answer, maybe...</p>
<p>There is a now, almost 10 year long study done by the CFIA and a European group that kept Rhesus macaques (monkeys) after they infected them with CWD, so model a primate like us. The results suggest that some of the monkeys did get sick, but it wasn't with CWD. It was, weird, since none of the things we observed were consistent with CWD. The histopathology looked really weird, the traditional symptoms were not as consistent, it was just, weird. It wasn't disease, but it also wasn't, wasn't disease...</p>
<p>My general rule is that I don't eat cervids. Also, I'm literally shipping some of my vaccine to a state wildlife and gaming department in the US (not gonna say which one obviously) right now to test in elk, so in, I dunno in 4 years check back with me. ðŸ˜„</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wasn't there also a recent (past 5 years?) Canadian study that showed monkeys contracting CWD from infected venison after a fairly lengthy exposure period? Or maybe it was more indirect like the one you described</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks so much for the information, it's all really fascinating. I'm a later-in-life student (30) and hoping to get into medical school in a few years and things like this have always captured my imagination. Could you expand on why you don't eat cervids? From my layman perspective it seems riskier to eat cow even with a huge unlikelyness vs a cervid with no evidence that it has crossed the species barrier. It seems like choosing between an extremely unlikely yes vs a &quot;current&quot; no.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is related to Elk rather than cows, it looks like Canada is pretty sloppy as theyâ€™re letting meat from herds infected with CWD into the food chain. <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/elk-contaminated-chronic-wasting-disease-cwd-1.5247570" target="_blank">Source</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. I literally used to do CWD surveillance from Sakatchewan for one of the summer projects with the CFIA, and the quality that those samples arrived in had the same consistency as mashed potatoes. But because there isn't evidence for CWD being zoonotic, the whole process is indeed quite sloppy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey thank you so much for this response, fascinating!
Since youâ€™re so knowledgeable on the topic, can I ask if you know what happened with this blood test for the CJD in humans developed by this start-up Amprion? I was just reading an article linked elsewhere from 2016 about how they did develop a test and were hoping to go commercial in a year, but looking at their website now, they only talk about testing for Alzheimerâ€™s, Parkinsonâ€™s etc. Meanwhile I dug up an article from 2019 about how the U.K. thinks that it has about 100,000 people possibly infected who will show symptoms in decades, so of course now Iâ€™m gonna be well paranoid about living here and hopefully never ever needing any donated blood, because omg.
Also if there was a way to test for it and detect it early, could we do anything? Is your vaccine meant to prevent it, or possibly provide a cure too?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I've personally went to many conferences with Claudio Soto. Dude is...interesting and we're just gonna leave it at that. He developed PMCA in 2003, and that is exactly the assay that he is developing for prion tests with Amprion. I don't know the specific progress, but at the last major conference he was working with the FDA and getting his PMCA approved, and it had &gt;90% specificity and sensitivity with blind samples, I think. Any more specifics you will have to ask him yourself lol. COVID probably messed with the timing of all this.</p>
<p>The 100,000 people figure is from an appendix study where they found approximately 1 in 2000 people in the UK <em>could</em> potentially be BSE infected. But that is a big if and the numbers haven't really panned out, leading to the conclusion that the species barrier between humans and cows are greater than previously thought. Prion protein positive doesn't necessarily mean you will develop vCJD, just like a positive SARS-COV2 test (virus) doesn't necessarily you will develop COVID.</p>
<p>As for early detection, it is sort of possible, but very difficult. When you get to ultra high sensitivity you have to worry about specificity usually in the form of false positives. I think that's actually the bulk of work for Amprion, is to not get false positives. Once you find an individual is positive, if done early enough with the correct treatment you could slow the rate of toxic prion buildup, but without some sort of way to remove it, you are just delaying the inevitable. This is akin to aducanumab for Alzheimer's that was just very recently approved. If done early enough, it can definitely help. We just don't have an aducanumab equivalent for prion diseases, yet, but you could logically conclude that if such a monoclonal did exist for prion diseases the same kind of treatment should also work. All just hypothesis though. Could never be 100% sure.</p>
<p>My vaccine is similar to what I just described, but instead of giving an individual the monoclonals to recognize toxic prion molecules, we give a vaccine that is prophylactic and the host will develop an immune response, and that immune response does exactly the kind of thing aducanumab does for AD. I don't know if that makes sense; it's hard to explain in such few words.</p>
<p>Vaccines by definition are almost always prophylactic. Therapeutics do not exist yet, since a cure would imply regeneration of neuronal cells, which is currently impossible. A cure in which you could get back all the cell death that occurred while the disease is in the pre-clinical phase would have broad implications far beyond just prion diseases. It would work for many if not all neurodegenerative diseases. Which is why a cure is about as far away as a cure for cancer is. Preventing prion diseases though, we've made pretty good strides there. Case in point, my vaccine!</p>
<p>Edit: A cure for neurodegenerative diseases would honestly be godlike for humans, since the ability to regenerate lost neurons and other associated brain cells sounds pretty science fiction and not in the realm of technology that currently exists.</p>
<p>Edit: Claudio Soto. Autocorrect.</p></div>		</li>
