			<div class="markdown"><p>How the hell does that thing work. How is it producing lift when upside down and sideways and shit. There's obviously something I'm missing here, the rotors lift it up but when it's upside down how come the rotors don't smash it into the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The blades on those have variable pitch, so they can be angled differently. It's like when you stick your hand out the car window and angle it up and down - depending on how your hand is angled, your hand will move up or down.</p>
<p>Real life helicopters work the same way as well. How does a helicopter tilt forwards? As the blades are spinning, the angle of the blades at the back is steeper than the blades at the front. So the back end of the rotor produces more lift than the front, and the helicopter tilts forwards.</p>
<p>The RC ones just take it to the extreme and can reverse the angle of the blades, allowing them to hover upside-down and do a bunch tricks like in the video</p></div>		</li>

<p>Small correction. Due to angular momentum and gyroscopes being weird AF the pitch is actually increased <a href="https://youtu.be/eTjGTxSevHE?t=122" target="_blank">90° from the direction you want to travel in</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought for certain that RC copter must have a computer controlling it. </p>
<p>Not all the time, just when it’s about to crash the computer forces a correction to stay in the air. And the pilot was just doing his best to beat the correction system and crash it. </p>
<p>But nope. Apparently it’s all human controlled. </p></div>		</li>
