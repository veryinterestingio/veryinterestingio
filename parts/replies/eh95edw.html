			<div class="markdown"><p>Formation of ZnS is per se exothermic. But, with existence of oxygen/water, this compound turns into ZnSO4, which is highly more energetic. (I don't have the reaction mechanisms or energies to back me up, so feel free to correct this.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Micrograin propellants are just elemental Zn and S powders, with no other chemicals. The reaction produces the sulfide, not the sulphate. It's a messy and incomplete reaction, but that's the primary product. I'm sure there's plenty of afterburning in the air, and associated sulphate production, but that's not terribly relevant to the rocket motor operation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This propellant has gone out of favor for several decades, as it is reportedly static sensitive, and has a very rapid burn rate, which varies greatly based on inconsistencies in fuel “grain” (it’s often burned fluffy, but is sometimes thermostats) </p>
<p>Also, standard black powder grains have higher impulse than micrograin, but it is an interesting novelty propellant. </p></div>		</li>
