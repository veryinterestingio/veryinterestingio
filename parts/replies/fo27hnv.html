<li>It protects my bottom line.  Having to sell all my shares at once will no doubt <strong>plummet the stock price to well below market price</strong>.  $97 is a small loss, but I stand to lose more if I do it on the market.</li>

<p>Minor nitpick correction - by definition, if the price on the market plummets when I sell my shares, the plummeted price is the market price (its literally the price on the market). </p>
<p>The broader point is the same - you get a higher amount of money from selling your shares if you can do it over a longer period as it stops the market from pricing in the perceived oversupply.</p>
<p>That's the point you make in number 2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It protects the market price.  The stocks I liquidate does not get registered to the daily queue, so the price does not plummet.  If I own more than 12 million shares of AmaZen, it means the share price(and asset value) of the rest of the shares I own will not be negatively affected by my sales.!</p>

<p>Sounds like very advantageous information for someone to have.  Or is this info public?</p></div>		</li>
