Okay, fine, how about explain it like I’m seven? Or nine? Most of these answers are like college level neuro and physics explanations. </p>
<p>I agree. This one is good.</p></div>		</li>

<p>2) people were still learning how color works</p>

<p>I'll note that the CMY model of how colors work has been known and rather uncontroversial since your great great great grandparents were in school. Your teachers, their teachers, their teachers, and their teachers had no excuse for teaching something wrong that leads to children everywhere getting muddy colours rather than what they wanted, and confusion in science class later.</p>
<p>Point 1 about the pigments is an important one, it's only really since the latter part of last century that cheap, good, safe magentas existed (so only your teachers and their teachers had no excuse for not providing decent primaries, or mayber their teachers too if you're young). For cyans, some of the popular 'blues' were closer to cyan than blue, so that wasn't <em>as</em> bad, but proper, cheap, safe cyan is also just as new.</p></div>		</li>
