O' course they still would need ta find a source o' vitamins n' minerals n' fiba n' electrolytes. Albeit they feel absolutely terrible while switchin' over, N' therez Ain't nuthin' but once tha switch be done they usually feel much betta.</p>
<p>tha food yo' smoke be broken down da fuck into tiny lil' parts. Dem parts give tha yo' goddamn cells energy ta function. Some parts r' made da fuck into electrolytes (or extracted from) dat allow yo' goddamn neurons ta communicate wit' each otha. Proteins from food allow yo' goddamn body ta heal itself n' grow muscle. When the fuck yo' cut off food supply, yo' r' takin' away yo' goddamn bodyz ability ta not only fuel itz cells, N' therez Ain't nuthin' but also propa nerve function n' ability ta heal.</p>
<p>When the fuck yo' die o' starvation, dat shitz usually bcuz' yo''ve used the fuck up all da body fat n' da body then starts ta smoke muscle instead, pullin' nutrients from organs. Dat shit eats itself until tha heart (usually) be no longa strong enough ta <a href="https://lingojam.com/GangsterTalkTranslator" target="_blank">pump blood ta yo' goddamn brain</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, fasting isn't so bad once you get past day three from a hunger standpoint and after 3 weeks from a habit standpoint. Once you break the 3 meals a day habit, eating just doesn't matter anymore. Until you get into catabolysis. Which is the real starvation mode and you'll feel like shit, get weak, and your body eats and your muscles and organs.</p>
<p>Edit: It's been a long time since I talked about this subject and accidentally mixed up catabolysis with ketoacidosis. Both of which are different from Ketosis like people are talking about in the comments below.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if you ever want to open your own eyes as to what's happening with American food, give up all starches for 2 weeks.  no pasta/bread/rice/potatos/anything starchy.  </p>
<p>but allow yourself very small portions of monosaccharides like honey or orange juice so that you don't get hit with lethargy from low blood sugar</p>
<p>at the end of 2 weeks, you will be utterly SHOCKED at how far your appetite recedes.  i used to be a tremendous glutton for food, dreaming of buffets, etc.  but now without any appetite, this diet went from difficult to easy mode</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing to note about this, you can die from starvation and still be fat. Fat cells don't have much protein in them, and getting protein while starving requires that your body breaks down muscle cells. </p>
<p>The ultimate cause of death in starvation is typically cardiac arrest due to a weakening of the heart muscle and a lack of electrolytes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. In the keto diet for example it's very important to get a good protein source, otherwise your vital organs, especially the brain, will deplete muscle protein, converting it to sugars to use.</p>
<p>It's vital to replenish muscle protein on a diet like that. As with starvation you use muscle much less than you use fat, but if you do run out of protein first it will still kill you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how does protein starvation work? Like you get plenty of protein, but little to no fat? Christopher McCandless (the dood from Into The Wild, and from my hometown) died of something called &quot;rabbit starvation,&quot; meaning he consumed plenty of lean proteins, but far too little fat to keep him from starving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a difference between the protein you have made and are digesting. Basically it takes more energy to digest raw protein than you can get from it, so you aren't netting any energy. If you have protein built up already, then it can sustain your energy untill gone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is different. Rabbit starvation is a near lack of fat consumption. Your body needs fat just as much as it needs viamin A. If you don't have fat, your brain stops working (your brain is largely fat).</p></div>		</li>
