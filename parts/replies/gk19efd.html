			<div class="markdown"><p>Well said. Personally, I had pretty bad pelvis rotation (weak core/ass) from sitting so much. Lots of lower back pain. Doing core work and actually building a muscle butt did wonders for my pain. Squats, deadlifts, dynamic core work. Finding one stretch (EASY) for a problematic part actually helps so much as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah shoulder and knee problems here, and basically was taught, to improve that area, you have to work all the muscles around that area, but not directly, cause that would cause more irritation. So hips, calves, and hamstrings for knees. And back, chest, arms for the shoulders. They are very annoying and complicated body parts</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well said. I’m in a PTA program right now and our current topic is spine pathologies (spondylosis/low back pain). I literally just took an exam on this topic and everything you said is correct. Most of LBP isn’t necessarily what is happening at the lower thoracic or lumbar regions vertebrae at all, but moreso thoracic hypomobility or poor posture/deep stabilizer muscle endurance and control.</p></div>		</li>
