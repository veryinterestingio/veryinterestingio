			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, camouflage being one solid colour is a misconception. There may still be things like rocks, trees, dirt, holes in the snow, etc. that add dark colours to the pure white. Having a dark spot or two may be more of an advantage than you think, and that applies to all forms of camouflage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>normally i'd agree on camouflage but bro, if the bear is all white and the snow is white and the sky is white.... i think a white nose would pretty much make you invisible. but i looked at a bunch of photos of polar bears and their ears, lips, paws and nose are all black so now idk. maybe it's just too late by the time you can see their nose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/rVEketS.jpg" target="_blank">Here's a partially shaved polar bear</a> at Buffalo Zoo, at least?</p>
<p>Story (and <a href="https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/20209497" target="_blank">source</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Luna broke the ankle joint in her left rear leg after a fall. The zoo's veterinarian, Dr. Kurt Volle, with help from veterinary surgeons from Sheridan Park Animal Hospital, performed the surgeries to repair the fracture. Since then, she's been kept in the zoo's hospital, where staff could monitor her progress and restrict her movements.</p>
<p>However, last week, Luna progressed enough to be returned to the holding area adjacent to the temporary exhibit space she and her playmate Kali share with the tigers. The playful pair celebrated their second birthdays together with special cakes from their keepers.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While the incoming UV radiation may be less in the arctic than on lower latitudes, the reflection from the snow, 24 hours of daylight, and very low humidity (very low cloud cover) make up for that and cause a significant UV load on bare skin. In other words, use sunblock if you are going to spend time outside in the arctic summer.</p></div>		</li>
