			<div class="markdown"><p>The CDC data set is frustratingly limited. We really need one of the large commercial labs to release all of their serology data. Working as a data analyst for one of those large commercial lab companies, I have access to it and it's honestly startling. </p>
<p>It's still tough to figure out what kind of sample bias we have, but without getting into proprietary information here, our data is not dissimilar from the CDC data for their published regions (I don't know for sure but I'm pretty sure they're using our data + other companies). </p>
<p>The most interesting way we've visualized it is by plotting serology positivity rate with antigen testing positivity rate. As testing capacity increases, a state's plot point should shift down the antigen axis and up the antibody axis. NY is almost off the charts on serology, and barely moves from zero on antigen. States like TX, AZ, FL and GA are just now starting to shift in the same direction, but they have a long way to go. I would suggest that they are less than halfway through their outbreak if they follow the NYC curve.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That NYC population already has widespread detectable antibodies?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The CDC data showed around 23%. Localized pockets might be higher.</p>
<p>Theres a lot of speculation about this, but if we look at Europe, it seems like 20% is a crucial threshold. Whether it's a combination of asymptomatic people having been infected but not having detectable antibodies, partial immunity due to other coronavirus infections, or some other factors, it looks like the outbreak slows dramatically when a fifth to a fourth of the population has detectable antibodies. The big states in the south right now are probably not over 10%. I think Arizona is closest, based on all of the publicly available info.</p>
<p>Obviously that could just be a short term observation. We will know more as we continue to track what's happening.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As has been mentioned, testing postivity is used as a estimate for testing saturation.</p>

<p>How do you account for bias in the tested population?  Isn't the issue that as the test become more common the posivitiy rate goes down as &quot;lower risk&quot; people can get tested?</p>
<p>Thanks</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. In short, positivity is a useful metric, but you have to consider the data generating process (who is getting tested, and why) in order to interpret the data.</p>
<p>For example, let's say we initially have very limited testing capacity and tests are reserved for people hospitalized with serious symptoms and individuals with confirmed exposures.</p>
<p>Later, testing capacity increases and we add to that list: now we will also test people with less serious symptoms, with suspected exposures, and also people who hope to avoid quarantine, return to work, etc. after travel. </p>
<p>We believe that the probability of being infected is higher for the sample in the first time period, so if the positivity rate for the sample in the second time period is the same as or greater than the rate in the first time period we can conclude that the increase in cases is due to an increase in spread, not an increase in testing. </p>
<p>However, let's imagine a third period, where we decide to test millions of college students returning to campus, independent of their history of symptoms or exposure. If positivity rates dropped in this period, we should not take that as evidence that the spread was slowing or decreasing <em>because the sample population is qualitatively different</em>: we are giving tests to people who are less likely to be positive than the people we tested in the earlier periods.</p>
<p>This seems pessimistic: we should take bad news (i.e. increasing positivity rates) seriously, and discount good news (decreasing positivity rates) but the crucial element here is the considering the probability of being infected given selection into the sample. When testing is rationed in ways that correlate with the likelihood of positivity, more permissive testing standards <em>absolutely</em> <em>should</em> decrease the positivity rate. Sadly we do not see this happening.</p>
<p>Now, if we wanted to know what the actual probability of being infected is given various levels of symptoms, exposure, etc. we would need to do surveillance testing, but that's a story for another post.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good answer and illustrates the difficulty in drawing conclusions from the tests.  We have still only tested about 15% of the population, and that is over a period of months.  There is a lot of variance in how each test population is selected, and few populations have been truly random.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The opposite is when you start seeing really high case fatality rates because we are only testing the very sick. Case fatality rates have gone down recently both because of broadened testing but also because of better treatment.</p>
<p>As for testing saturation, like I said, there are normally circulating coronaviruses that we have surveillance for and we base what should be normal off of those. Here's an interesting article on a normally circulating strain that possibly killed millions:  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01315-7" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01315-7" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01315-7</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is the testing rate or the hospitalization rate more important to report on? It seems to me if the testing rate is going up but the hospitalization rate is steady that means we're getting a handle on this right?</p></div>		</li>

<p>In normal circumstances, the percent positive tests should be &lt;5% based on normally circulating coronavirus trends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't understand this logic. Is it because 5% of the population is a LOT of people and we wouldn't expect the virus to be that prevalent at a given time?</p></div>		</li>
