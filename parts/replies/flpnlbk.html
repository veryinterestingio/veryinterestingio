			<div class="markdown"><p>I pretty much wrote the same thing before I saw your comment. The only extra was the increased sensitivity for kids is a natural reaction designed to stop kids from eating literally anything they find- if they think vegetables and green things are bitter and gross, it's a defence against picking poisonous berries and plants.</p>
<p>Although I'm pretty sure it was Mum's cooking. Turns out broccoli by a decent cook is actually nicer than briefly blanching it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do know that there is basically no 'upper limit' to sweetness for children, so i get that sugar is just inherently good to kids taste palettes. I just wondered why there was an inverse for lets say 'savory' or umami type flavors? I donno.</p></div>		</li>
