			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely weird, I haven't &quot;bumped into&quot; anyone with DI outside of forums specifically for it.
Mine came out of nowhere about 3 years back. Started drinking 4 to 5 gallons of water daily, after some scans it looked like I had some tumors on my pineal and pituitary glands.
Super happy to have to the meds, that upkeep was so unrealistic and caused a ton of problems.
Hope you're managing yours well, I know it has its ups and downs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like that could totally get in the way of your everyday life, but I think I would much rather have a crippling addiction to <em>water</em> of all things over some of the alternatives, heh. </p>
<p>It'd be a nice thing if you could just turn it on and off. Sometimes I go days without drinking any plain water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to those changes, the bacterial biofilm in your oral cavity will also produce ill tasting molecules. Those get dissolved by the water you drink and thus the first glass of water in the morning will taste worse.</p>
<p>This can be counteracted by just flushing your mouth with a glass of water before trying to drink.</p></div>		</li>
