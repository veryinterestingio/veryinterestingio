			<div class="markdown"><p>This always is asked about Mars. I have read enough responses to feel like I can answer. Solar wind has stripped away the atmosphere on mars already. That’s why it’s so thin. But it took millions of years to do it. It’s because Mars doesn’t have a liquid rock and rotating iron core like Earth does and this means Mars can not generate a Magnetic field to keep the solar wind from having a atmosphere reducing effect. Switching solar positions wouldn’t increase the amount of solar wind too much. It’s a considerable change in distance yes, but not overall compared to the rest of the solar system. </p>
<p>We can terraform Mars one day when we develop the technology to do so as long as we can produce a greater global effect than the rate of which the solar wind strips it away. But the effect is pretty gentle. We would have more of an issue with radiation from solar flares sterilizing away our hard work. </p>
<p>It’s all pretty exciting stuff!</p>

I thought that cosmic rays caused health problems, and that a magnetic field was necessary to deflect them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The problem is, it's a lot more complicated than this, though this is certainly a large part of it.</p>
<p>For example, Venus is the same size as Earth, however it does not have a magnetic field.</p>
<p>To further complicate things, Venus, with no magnetic field, has an atmosphere 90x thicker than that of Earth's!  </p>
<p>So the presence of a magnetic field is both more complicated than just being sufficiently large, and on top of that, there are other mechanisms that can sustain an atmosphere without the need for a magnetic field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth mentioning, Venus doesn't have an internal magnetic field either.  It does have an externally induced field from solar wind interacting with the thick atmosphere, but that field is 10 times weaker than Earth's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understood the problem with Mars to be that it is slightly too small to retain internal geothermic heat which is necessary to maintain the magnetic force field which helps reduce atmospheric loss from solar wind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As we learn more about the core of Mars I think we will have a better understanding of whether it is just the size of Mars that prevents a magnetic field of it is size and composition of the core.
I’ve often wondered if humans could spend a few hundred years redirecting asteroids if that would allow life to be seeded on Mars. </p>
