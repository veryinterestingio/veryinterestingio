			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great description of the inflection point in the life of Flash. I assumed, in those early months, that Apple would figure out how to effectively support Flash, but as time went on it became clear they figured out how to effectively kill it.</p>
<p>I don't think anyone was really sad about that, other than the people making their living with Flash I think we were all looking for some way to kill it, but there was just too much it could do.</p>
<p>Turns out, if you invent a new platform, they'll figure out the details about how to work on it, and do it sharpish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By the time people were talking about flash not being supported on ios, and making a bunch of jokes with the superhero, I couldn't afford a smartphone. One or two years later, when I finally got my first smartphone, the whole thing was irrelevant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seemed like everyone kinda wanted to get off Flash but Apple banning it on the iPhone is what gave them the courage or the incentive to actually start moving off it.  HTML 5 really accelerated it's demise...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More or less. </p>
<p>This isn’t really an “Apple killed Flash” thing, but more of an explanation of the environment at the time and the factors that caused them to make the choice they did, which as you note is something a lot of people on the tech side of things kind of low key wanted anyway.</p>
<p>Creators loved it, and still do because it apparently made it really easy to develop and deliver animated content, and there still isn’t really a good replacement for it.</p></div>		</li>
