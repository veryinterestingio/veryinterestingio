			<div class="markdown"><p>I fell asleep for 20-30 minutes during an exam because I studied all night long. When I woke up only me, one colleague the teacher and supervisor were in the classroom. My brain did not know s**t after the nap but I managed to pass with my first 5/10 grade in the university. I still consider it a funny story ðŸ˜‚</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know a few law students who take power naps between their bar exams, since they have an hour break or something, and they are quite successful. Granted these are the types of people who can fall asleep in like 5 minutes and wake up 30 minutes later which seems impossible to me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My middle school life science teacher recommended we always sleep before a test, even if itâ€™s just an hour! She claimed sleeping with the information crammed into our brain would help us process it much better. This was contrary to my belief that I should not sleep because I might forget everything I studied in the time I wasted sleeping &gt;.&lt;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a software developer too and I can confirm this. But when I go to sleep while I'm in between of trying to figure out something, sometimes my brain kind of gets stuck in some loops or recursive calls and then next morning I get headache and feel tired.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back when I was a math student I absolutely hated trying to go to sleep after having worked on some hard problems. I would float in and out of dreams all night where I was solving the problem, but it was total nonsense. Not real math. I would feel so unrested the next day.</p></div>		</li>
