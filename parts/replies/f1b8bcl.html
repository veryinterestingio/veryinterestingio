			<div class="markdown"><p>So you mentioned “oil taken away.” My hair becomes an absolute grease pit if I don’t wash it every day. I mean, I’ll shower on a Friday morning, and by Saturday morning I can’t even stand touching it before my shower.</p>
<p>What kind of shampoo removes oil? I’m very curious to know. I currently use head and shoulders because I had a dandruff problem as a teen and over the years I’ve grown to like the scent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All shampoos remove oil.   But some do it better than others.</p>
<p>Don't use &quot;shampoo and conditioner all in one&quot; products.</p>
<p>I have same issue and I find selson blue medicated to be effective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so i actually work with shampoos and the answer is simple but complicated. both ethnicity and sex play huge factors in your hair care routine and what is normal. even then your individual skin type will also play a huge factor. the hard truth is there is no one golden standard that applies for anyone, far from it in fact. that is why there are hundreds of hair products out there including shampoos, conditioners, oils, etc. i honestly cannot give you a single &quot;oh use X and Y&quot; kind of deal. its more how do you normally wash, what is your hair type, what is your skin type, etc. once you get that figured out then you can get closer to which product/combo and frequency.</p>
<p>in your case, a ballpark guess considering very oily hair would be paul mitchell deep cleaning shampoo two, it helps remove oil and reduce oil production, again though without asking numerous personal questions this is a general recommendation guess, people may not like this comparison but its a bit like starting medication for blood pressure, we can widdle it down to a few choices but at the end of the day you just gotta try one for a couple weeks and see</p></div>		</li>

<p>It looks like autocorrect did you wrong here.  From the context it seems you meant &quot;whittle&quot;, ' to carve something down by repeatedly cutting small slices from it' and not &quot;widdle&quot;, 'an act of urination'.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is possible your body just produces more oil than average. It could also be that it is reacting to you washing it so often by making more oil to keep your hair healthy. I think the healthy hair people recommend using shampoo no more than a couple times a week.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I produced more oil, wouldn’t I have acne problems? I think there’s probably something to me washing it too much, but at this point it would be hard to “reset” my hair without the grease factor being super noticeable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try rinsing your hair in cold water at the end of your shower. Good for skin as well. After I discovered the benefits of this my life kind of changed. No more flakey dry skin from hot showers, hair and skin are in good condition.</p>
<p>Before this I got greasy quickly and had kind of bad acne. I think i was having some hormonal issues but the cold rinse at the end of a shower is life changing for me, believe it or not.</p></div>		</li>
