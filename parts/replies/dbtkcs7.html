			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont dream very often when i sleep. I may have a dream only a hand full of times a year.  But every morning i wake up, i feel as if i didnt sleep much at all (very tired and groggy for the next few hours until coffee kicks in). Does this mean I'm not hitting that rem level? The only person i can compare to is my wife who seems to dream every night which i feel dreaming every night is kind of odd</p></div>		</li>

<p>What kind of alarm do you use? I use the &quot;sleep cycle&quot; alarm clock and it's worked wonders. All it does is try and match when you need to wake up with when you're most awake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is just anecdotal, but everyone that I used to smoke weed with back in high school claimed it dramatically affected their brains' ability to recall dreams. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just anecdotal.  Furthermore studies do t attribute it to <em>recollection.</em> MJ, which I'm a user of, limits even an infrequent user's REM, basically eliminating REM for daily users. This could have significant effects on endless things. Recuperative sleep is one of the most essential things in out lives. REM is when we generate hormones eg testosterone and HGH. The list goes on and on. Psychoactive drugs have real impacts on our lives.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've smoked weed all day/urry day for about 6/7yrs now and I never dream anymore. </p>
<p>However, if I have a t break for a week I have the most ridiculously powerful and scary dreams imaginable. Full on bolt upright, desperate gasp of breath as I wake up type of dreams. Fortunately I never have t breaks unless they're forced ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a fact. Smoke often for a long period of time and stop, dreams are the first thing that comes back. In a big way sometimes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not true.</p>
<p>First of all, you dream all night, but REM sleep has the most vivid, memorable dreams.</p>
<p>Second, the stage that &quot;matters&quot; or that is most restorative is deep sleep, stage 3-4 sleep, not REM.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you have any sources for that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Deep REM&quot; is honestly an oxymoron. The deepest sleep is actually called non-REM or NREM. Stages 3 and 4 are the deepest, which is why people who are woken up by loud noises during these stages are actually less likely to remember the noise that woke them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I almost never dream (I know technically we dream all the while we're sleeping but I rarely remember them). What's that mean then?</p>
<p>Edit: I'm also an extremely heavy sleeper. Like, actually slept through a tornado. Anytime someone tries to wake me up (because alarm clocks just don't work) it takes at least 3 tries. :^/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It just means you're a really comfy person. You sleep and go to &quot;the next place&quot; usually reserved for corpses and spirit creatures, whereas the rest of us go to sleep and then reevaluate our lives in our sleep and end up more stressed than before. You on the other hand say &quot;fuck this shit I'm going somewhere impossible on my sleep break!&quot; </p>
<p>Keep staying real peach, you're one of the few people macking this sleep shit. </p></div>		</li>
