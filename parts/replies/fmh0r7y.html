			<div class="markdown"><p>This gave me an interesting question. If our solar system were to pass through a stellar nursery, is it possible that the sun could pull in enough mass that it gets added to Jupiter and ignites it as a dwarf star? Or enough dust gets added to the sun for it to become a different colored star? I'm not very well versed in astrophysics to answer these questions myself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s complicated and depends on a lot of factors.</p>
<p>The main challenge is, the gas giant (or star) needs to gain (accrete) the mass slowly enough that it can hang onto it long enough to compress and fusion to start.</p>
<p>For example, “shooting” another planet at Jupiter most likely wouldn’t work.  The energy of the collision would scatter matter everywhere and would likely disrupt both planets, resulting in two (or more) smaller celestial bodies and a lot interstellar “dust”.</p>
<p>You need something more like parasitic twinned planets where one can syphon mass from the other over aeons.  To support that, you probably don’t want to be a solar system already, that is full of other bodies which could disturb the twinning or syphoning.</p></div>		</li>

<li>
<p>Space is so incredibly large that systems don't really collide</p>
</li>
<li>If our system passed &quot;through&quot; anything, it would probably be destroyed over millions of years. The solar system works because there aren't external forces messing it up.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jupiter needs at least ~13 times its mass to start any fusion (it would become a brown dwarf), and ~80 times its mass to become a star fusing regular hydrogen to helium like most other stars.</p>
<p>You would form a new star, essentially, the initial gas giant would only be a very small part of the mass.</p></div>		</li>
