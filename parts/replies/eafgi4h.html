			<div class="markdown"><p>Couldn't have asked for a better one! I love anything space-related, and ion engines really make me geek out due to the potential future use and of course, efficiency. Might I ask: how far do you think we are from ion drives with a few hundred/thousand newtons of force? Or is that impossible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue is electrical power. The more power you have the more thrust you get. Even small chemical rocket engines are easily in the MW of power. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/JRAAp3U.png" target="_blank">Here is a graph</a> of what kind of thrust to power ratio you can expect depending on the specific impulse and the thruster efficiency (the % numbers of the lines). Basically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_ain%27t_no_such_thing_as_a_free_lunch" target="_blank">&quot;there ain't no such thing as a free lunch&quot;</a>, if you want more Isp you need to spend more energy for the same thrust. </p>
<p>There is no real point operating a plasma thruster below 1000s of ISP because then chemical propulsion is better. So the best you can hope is about 100 mN/kW of electricity if you manage to convert 100% of the electrical power into kinetic energy. On commercial satellites you currently have about 20 kW of power (~ 2N of thrust). IIRC ISS has about 100 kW installed but those are old solar panels. The solar electric propulsion module for the lunar gateway project should be around 50kW. In practice with solar power you are more or less maxed out around a few hundred kW. </p>
<p>For higher power you need some other electrical power source like a nuclear fusion or fission. We have concepts (and even subscale tests) of plasma thrusters that could use up to a few MW of power. But when you get to that sort of power out of nuclear system it is probably simpler and more efficient to use a nuclear-thermal rocket. Basically either use the nuclear reactor to heat a gas directly. You could also tap into the fusion plasma as your propulsion source. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If plasma devices are used, could you generate thrust from the particles they discharge? Like, use the free electrons/neutrons that escape the containing field for propulsion?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's stopping us from making huge solar arrays for spacecraft? If we get 1350 watts/sq meter in space, and the efficiency is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PVeff(rev180813)a.jpg" target="_blank">46%</a>, you get 621 watts/sq meter.  That's only 40.1 x 40.1 meters to get a megawatt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question. You say Noble gasses aren't reactive, which is true because their electron shells are full. However isn't plasma a gas whose atoms have been stripped of their electrons? Wouldn't that make any plasma reactive?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was an article linked recently on /r/everythingscience (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EverythingScience/comments/9z6nuk/silent_and_simple_ion_engine_powers_a_plane_with/" target="_blank">This article</a>) about an experimental lightweight plane that used an ion engine to run (in the atmostphere, taking off on it's own and everything).  </p>
<p>I saw you mention that ion engines only work in space, but it looks like that might change, at least technically if not practically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not exactly the same. See the other discussion <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/a08cfo/what_are_the_properties_of_an_ion_engine_exhaust/eafp5gu/" target="_blank">here</a>. It has been known for a while that you can use ionic wind stuff in atmosphere but  we still need a few orders of magnitude better energy storage to make it practical. </p></div>		</li>
