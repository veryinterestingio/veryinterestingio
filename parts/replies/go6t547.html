			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have a source on hand, but having worked in the service industry for 10+ years and taken half as many food handlers tests, this information IS NOT what is being taught to restaurant workers in my city by our Health Department.</p>
<p>They teach you to <del>let it cool somewhat first, or to</del> use other cooling measures to help it cool more rapidly if it <del>does have to go in the fridge immediately</del> is potentially hazardous. At least they were up until about 4 years ago (that was around the time of my last restaurant job).</p>
<p>Edit: you're not supposed to just let it cool, but rapidly cool the item if it is potentially hazardous</p>
<p>Edit: Here's actually a quote directly from my counties food service standards document. This confirms what I was taught. And seems to apply to all restaurant food whether large quantities or not: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(8) Potentially hazardous foods requiring refrigeration after preparation shall be
rapidly cooled to an internal temperature of 41¬∞ F or below. Such foods in large volume
or prepared in large quantities shall be rapidly cooled utilizing such methods as shallow
pans, agitation, quick chilling or water circulation external to the food containers so the
cooling period shall not exceed six (6) hours, with the food reaching 70¬∫F within 2 hours,
and then reaching 41¬∫F within an additional four (4) hours. Potentially hazardous foods
to be transported shall be pre-chilled and held at a temperature of 41¬∞ F or below, unless
maintained in accordance with paragraph 12 of this section.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. </p>
<p>If you put hot food next to cold food, it thaws the cold food and increases the food poisoning chance. </p>
<p>Especially with larger bulk foods since it can take so long to cool, the retained heat can cause food poisoning in food next to the one cooling. </p>
<p>Ramsay actually covers this a bunch of times in kitchen nightmares.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a ticking clock of 6 hours to properly cool food from 135Àö to below 41Àö (The Temperature Danger Zone).  However, there is no need to waste your cooling efforts (ice, cooling wand, refrigeration energy) until the food gets below 135.  So when you are ready to cool your boiling batch of soup, you just leave it on the counter until it cools from boiling to 135Àö, THEN start the active cooling process, and the timer, to get it through the temperature danger zone.</p></div>		</li>
