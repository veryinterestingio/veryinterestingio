			<div class="markdown"><p>The coolest thing about the HPV vaccines is that they are also essentially a vaccine against cancer! The Gardasil vaccine protects against strains 6, 11, 16, and 18. The last two of which are responsible for the vast majority of the cases of cervical cancer and anal cancer! HPV can also cause cancers in the vulva, vagina, and oropharynx. </p>
<p>No HPV due to vaccine = much lower risk of cancer!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah HPV is one of those rare viruses that actually causes cancer. There used to be a time in science when scientists were on the hunt for viruses that cause cancer, hoping that would be the root cause and we could vaccinate and be free of cancer. Turned out viruses only account for 10-15% of all human cancers:(.</p>
<p>Cool vaccine nonetheless!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People seem to have the wrong idea. HPV isn't the only cause of those cancers, but any cells infected with HPV can eventually become cancerous.</p>
<p>The vaccines currently on the market prevent people from getting infected with HPV. They're useless against cancers caused by HPV, and barely do anything against people with infected cells.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>From 2005 through 2011, for the 24 anti-VZV vaccinated patients, the average number of herpes relapses decreased to 0, correlated with an increased anti-VZV antibody level and clinical recovery of all patients, whereas no improvement was observed for the 26 nonvaccinated herpes patients.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a famous study that HSV sufferers often find. It is true that there is a 10-50% T-cell cross-reactivity between VZV and HSV. (<a href="https://www.jimmunol.org/content/196/5/2205" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.jimmunol.org/content/196/5/2205" target="_blank">https://www.jimmunol.org/content/196/5/2205</a></a>). I have spoken with many individuals who received 2 or 3 doses of the varicella vaccine after getting HSV, and they had a complete elimination of outbreaks long-term. Creating a vaccine for HSV is not difficult if it's a <em>live</em> vaccine, but the FDA does not live vaccines given their risk to immunocompromised individuals. They prefer subunit vaccines, which are harder to perfect, but safer. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hepatitis B antibodies happen to produce reliable immunity against the virus, which makes it easier to use a vaccine to trigger that immune response for protection. Hepatitis C antibodies are ineffective in preventing reinfection, so triggering that particular antibody response doesn't provide protection. They are also completely different viruses and aren't even in the same kingdom - just because they're named after adjacent letters on the alphabet for convenience, doesn't mean that they're closely related at all.</p>
<p>Herpes Simplex Virus is indeed also tricky. It hides in neuronal cells, dormant and avoiding detection, until some trigger (usually thought to be illness or stress) reactivates it. Varicella Zoster Virus, while not an STD, does the same thing.</p></div>		</li>
