			<div class="markdown"><p>I also think it's because it is an appropriate stress. When you workout you are adding an artificial controlled short term stress to life (ie your heart rate elevates and etc). So when you relax you are actually relaxing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Partly right. It does add stress so your body release chemicals to balance it out to preserve homeostasis.</p>
<p>dopamine is basically the bodies equivalent to morphine. To control pain and give you that overall good feeling after a hard workout.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the beta endorphins  (&quot;endo&quot; like endogenous, orphin like morphine) are more analogous to morphine
.</p>
<p>Dopamine doesn't necessarily control pain but it can help you learn to want to repeat a behavior in spite of the pain. Or even to enjoy the pain as a trigger to expecting a positive result--kinda like Pavlovs dogs.</p>
<p>Some opioid addicts start craving the feeling of nausea and vomiting because it has a positive association  (being really high) to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cortisol is the suspected culprit of what you're talking about.  Cortisol is the stress hormone, our bodies are designed to deal with acute stress pretty well, like that lion about to fuck your day up but there's really no analogue to the day to day chronic stress that we deal with in the modern world like having to worry about paying rent every month on top of your car payment, the impending deadline at work.  Cortisol is released when your body goes into fight or flight mode.  Exercise also raises the cortisol levels in your blood, but you are directly doing what you'd be doing on the Serengeti when you're in fight or flight mode while exercising, running, lifting heavy things, punching something, etc.  When cortisol levels are high in your blood your body thinks it's about to get fucked up so it shuts down functions that aren't immediately required to keep you alive like your immune response, your ability to deal with people and reproduction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to that, elevated cortisol contributes to a lot of health issues, including suppressed mood, weight gain, etc., but regular exercise helps reduce the overall level of cortisol in your system.</p></div>		</li>
