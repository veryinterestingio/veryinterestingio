			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha yes unfortunately we are a thing, it's pretty shitty though not to be able to burp. Wish I could! Seems like I am missing out on a lot. Like wtf you can burp through your nose?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah fuck that, I need to no more about not burping. So do you just fart a lot more frequently than most people? Hate to be so forward, I’m just finding out that there are people who don’t burp, and it’s blowing my mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Burping happens in the throat area. Close your mouth and it can come out your nose if it hits right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't even know that was a thing!  I'm on the exact opposite end of the spectrum, I can open my esophageal sphincter on demand and &quot;breathe&quot; with my stomach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy shit I didn't know this was a thing!  Every since I got my tonsils out I've had a severe inability to burp which isn't so bad on it's own, but when my body tries to force it, I can't breathe.  This goes on for up to 30 seconds.</p></div>		</li>
