			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess the dumb question is… what does accepted insurance pay?</p>
<p>I’ve had BCBS and had a Bill once for 97k and only 17k was allowed under contract</p>
<p>1.) I was shocked at the bill</p>
<p>2.) I thought, this is dumb that prices are so wildly different between the insured and the uninsured.</p>
<p>Same thing when my kid was born by C section, 17k went to 4k.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pricing is a clusterflop. </p>
<p>The hospital is supposed to have a price sheet called &quot;the chargemaster&quot;. But the hospital is not legally required to provide that price sheet to patients OR insurers. Think about it like if the Blue Book for auto prices wasn't published, only car dealers had it, and they didn't have to show it to you. </p>
<p>Your policy coverage can also be a bit of a private detail. The hospital might get some basic information like your deductibles from your insurance card, but they don't know what specific plan you have and how it might cover different operations. That varies plan to plan. </p>
<p>So when you go for a procedure, and it's time to select a price, the hospital does some research based on what they know about you. If they're lucky, they know your employer and maybe they've done procedures for other people through that employer with your insurer. That means they know what they got paid last time, so they have a good idea what to charge. </p>
<p>If they <em>don't</em> have that data, they try to estimate your income and make a guess. It benefits them to overcharge a little. If the insurance company rejects some of the charges, they can just come after you for that part of the bill. When you do this for thousands of patients across the country, you get pretty good at figuring out how much people <em>can</em> pay. So you set your prices to exactly that. </p>
<p>If a patient isn't insured, they know they can't extort an insurance company, so they base the price off of income analysis. If they overestimate, oh well, that person just stays in debt and they get it eventually. The insured people help cover the &quot;losses&quot;. </p>
<p>I had a brush with this years ago. I had a procedure lined up with a surgeon and approved by insurance. I had a quote from the surgeon for what a no-complications procedure would likely cost. But my policy was a bit cryptic. For this procedure it said it would cover &quot;90% up to my maximum allowable charge&quot;. I went over and over my policy, but I couldn't find my &quot;maximum allowable charge&quot; anywhere. This mattered a lot, because if it was too low it would mean I couldn't afford the surgery. I called my insurer and they hung up on me. Twice. So I got my company's HR involved.</p>
<p>That connected me to somebody who swore me to secrecy. They calmly explained all of the above to me, and pointed out if the hospital knows too much about my policy, everybody pays more. After confirming I already had a quote, she informed me for this procedure I had <em>no</em> maximum allowable charge and 90% would be covered no matter what the hospital charged and made me swear I wouldn't pass that along to the hospital. </p>
<p>It's all bullshit. It's used car sales where the only person who gets to negotiate is the salesman. It's the only industry allowed to extort you: you can either agree to a price they don't have to reveal or die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tend to think that there should be a few basic changes to health insurance in the US…</p>
<p>1.) Companies should just refer employees to the exchanges, e.g. there shouldn’t be direct contracting. This would eliminate separate pricing of plans (group employer plans tend to be cheaper than effectively the same plan on the exchange)</p>
<p>2.) There should be some type of public option to buy into if chosen, particularly for the benefit of a nationwide level of network coverage. Personally, I’d like to see it marked up a little to pay better than the insurance of last resort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is dumb because 1/5 of the money the hospital asks for is probably the actual price of which the treatment costed. It's just healthcare in USA can make so much more money by billing insurance so they'd rather spend resources on seeing insurance patients because they make more income.</p></div>		</li>
