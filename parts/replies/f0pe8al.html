			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of therapy (particularly CBT) focuses on identifying unhelpful cognitive shortcuts and changing these. </p>
<p>Cognitive shortcuts are literally physical links we form in our mind between two things that commonly occur together. They save us time when assessing the threats or opportunities posed by a person or situation. For example, the link between fire and pain causes us not to touch fire. </p>
<p>The problem is that we then unconsciously shortcut to a conclusion without rational thinking. </p>
<p>They are behind a whole load of behaviours, for example racism and unconscious bias in job hiring.</p>
<p>But they are also behind anxiety and trauma. If you were bullied, you may come to associate social relationships with rejection. If you were abused, you may come to associate trust/relationships with pain. If you’ve had a series of failures, you may come to associate, well, yourself with failure. </p>
<p>A lot of therapy is about figuring out what shortcuts your past experiences have given you, why, and challenging these. In this way you can literally change the hard-wiring of your brain to lead to more positive responses and behaviours to situations that challenge you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. And the thing is its very difficult to deal with this alone because you are literally unable to convince yourself things are different without someone forcefully telling you so and proving you wrong. When i was a kid with social anxiety, oversensitive, shy, etc. i thought everyone is like this they are just so much stronger than i am to suppress their emotions. So for years i suppressed my emotions which just made it all worse. Teachers didnt acknowledge my issues when i told them, nobody helped me, they basically convinced me im just weak. Oh you start crying? Man up. Maybe because im a guy and its not very common because all the other guys make noise and nobody treats you like an individual. Thats life i guess, a torture chamber.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of all that, it is really good to have someone available to point things out that might upset you (&quot;wow it sounds like you really never get anything positive out of drinking and that it's making you miserable&quot;). Friends and family who see you on an everyday basis are sometimes unwilling or unable to do so because upsetting the people you interact with constantly can make life more difficult. </p>
<p>A therapist is able to point out difficult and upsetting truths without having it impact their own day to day life. This is also why it is important to keep the therapist relationship separate from regular social life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your write up is excellent. I think one thing needs to be made more explicit though; what the therapist is doing is handing you and teaching you how to use psychological <em>tools</em> which can help you, but it's still up to you to use them and fix the engine. </p>
<p>The silly thing is, people without mental issues typically use these tools as well, but often unconsciously. They were taught during childhood and refined while growing up. I think, many people with issues that stem from childhood simply don't realise that they miss these tools at all because they aren't even aware of their existence as these tools are so <em>obvious</em> to mentally healthy people. Probably why so many people who would benefit from therapy often say they don't need it and going to therapy isn't for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, definitely  That probably points out a weakness in how I use therapy, TBH -- I do not apply the tools as hard as I could to do better, faster, on my own.  Also, if I'm in a bad state I will generally try to retreat into ruminating on the why-me of it all instead of pushing to actively apply the tools.  But I know I use therapy like some people use the gym -- some people can develop a home workout routine and stick with it on their own, and other people need to force themselves to practice the exercises on a regular basis under the watchful eye of a professional. </p>
<p>I absolutely believe that healthier people have facility with some of this stuff and they don't realize they are doing it.  Hell, my 3yo kid knows how to say when she's sad or mad or needs help, and I was in my late 20s before I was willing to utter any of those words aloud. My husband and I both talk about feelings ad nauseam with her, after both of us had shitty emotionally neglectful childhoods, so I guess it's sinking in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that you've developed the kind of introspection that allowed you to write the first paragraph does show you probably use more of those tools than you realize.. </p>
<p>Anyway: from my experience with my SO (anxiety, depression background) I would urge you to spend time on those tools as well. It's something that was absolutely vital in his long-term mental health management. </p>
<p>He has been through heavy therapy - full time in-house hospital therapy as well at a time before I met him. Actively using those tools has saved him from several relapses since. There will be a point when therapy has done all it's can at that point in time and it's time to go on on your own without regular therapist sessions. It's an important and healthy step to move on and not use regular therapy visits as a crutch. </p>
<p>Knowing how to recognize relapsing behaviors/thoughts and being confident in how to apply the tools <em>on your own</em> without therapist support was key for him. It was also important to the health of our relationship, as during the relapse, he was able to stand his own ground and not replace 'therapist as a crutch to help deal' with 'your SO as a crutch to help deal'. Knowing when you're in over your head and realizing your skills with these tools are inadequate to deal with the relapse and accepting you need to find help asap can literally save you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this response is the most accurate i’ve seen so far with regard to my own experience. therapy really saved my life by teaching me how to get a handle on and take responsibility for my own thoughts</p></div>		</li>
