<p>I think thatâ€™s exactly right. They can be quite cringey. Unfortunately, relatively few prevention programs have been rigorously tested under randomized controlled trials. Of those that have, the majority do not work. Some even make things worse, with more bullying in the treatment schools than in the control schools. The few that do work, tend to have modest successes.   </p>
<p>One exception is KiVa, a program developed in Finland, which has had strong success, reducing bullying by almost 50%. But even KiVa has found that there is one group of students who are effectively immune to their program: the popular bullies. They resist the program because they benefit socially from these behaviors. So long as kids can gain status and popularity from cruelty, it will be difficult to prevent them from doing so.<br />

<p>I think this is pretty interesting, from what I remember in school I wouldn't have expected hardly any of the schools programs to actually have been scientifically tested, most things seemed to come off as a feel-good check the box type of program (for example DARE). Besides the aforementioned KiVa, do you know of any programs currently being trialed?</p></div>		</li>
