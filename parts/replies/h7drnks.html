			<div class="markdown"><p>Best explanation of bridge so far.</p>
<p>I used one in the mid-2000s when I was traveling for business and needed to use public WiFi. In some places, I could only get signal if I was close to a window. So I put the bridge at the window, and ran a long ethernet cable from it to my laptop. As far as my laptop was concerned, it was on an ordinary wired network. I just had to use a web browser to connect to the bridge and select the WiFi network to use.</p>
<p>It was great, but the marketing for it was terrible. They didn't really make clear what it actually did, in layman's terms. So until I got it, I wasn't entirely sure it was the right device for my situation.</p></div>		</li>
