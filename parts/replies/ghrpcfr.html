			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding on to this, the range of colors any particular color generation scheme can create is called the &quot;gamut&quot;. Almost all screens use a a combination of red, green, and blue, called the &quot;RGB gamut&quot;. There are multiple ways to specify RGB colors, each with their own gamut, but even the best ones only cover about 75% of the total color space (all visible colors). </p>
<p>Depending on the exactly display technology the physical display might be capable of more but it's limited by the specifications for the signal it's being sent...for compatibility reasons, most digital color systems don't fully exploit the capabilities of any particular display technology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add further, there are many specifications that contain much more colour information than can be displayed on most displays.</p>
<p>In particular the development of ACES was done with future displays in mind and can contain more colour information than the human eye can perceive.</p>
<p>When professional colourists do their work they use a variety of tools to translate the image to their specific monitor in reliable ways, so that specific hues appear the same on a cinema projector (P3), TV (rec709) or computer monitor (sRGB). But the image/video itself may contain much more information that the display can handle - and actually it kinda should, so that the various look up tables can make good translations.</p>
<p>What this means is that in the future we might be able to display colours like Prussian Blue, even from films made before the technology to display the colours was available.</p></div>		</li>
