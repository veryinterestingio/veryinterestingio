			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, I guess I only implied it in my last paragraph.</p>
<p>But at a basic level you can think of SiC (in the Zinc Blende structure) as a mix of Si and C (both in the diamond cubic structure). Since Zinc Blende is a diamond cubic structure with alternating atomic species.</p>
<p>So SiC band gap can be thought of as the average of the Si and C (diamond) band gaps.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happens to be true in this case, but this trend is not universal for compound semiconductors when the crystal structure changes. Hexagonal SiC is typically used in semiconductor applications, so you can't really think of it as an alloy between Si and diamond - it's a different material with different bonding. </p>
<p>For example, gallium and arsenic are both metals / semimetals with no bandgap, but gallium arsenide is a semiconductor with a bandgap of 1.44.</p>
<p>Edit: just saw you specified in the zinc blende structure. That would be true in that case, but I'm not aware of zinc blende SiC being used in semiconductor devices. I think 4H is most common, with 6H getting some use as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're on point for the crystal structure of the SiC, I don't think you've quite addressed the issue regarding SiC's indirect band gap. The way I was taught about it was that when an electron/hole pair exchange states, there's also conservation of momentum that needs to be considered for some materials. Crystals will have their own intrinsic momentum that's defined by the particle's movement within the crystal. For energy and momentum to be conserved during an excitation event, photons and phonons need to both be produced or absorbed accordingly. By looking at the crystal's K-space (or the momentum space), we can see how these bandgaps line up. When a phonon (or crystal perterbation) is required for an electron to jump from the conduction band to the valence band, we describe that as an indirect band gap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answers you are given are somewhat convoluted - let me try to provide a simpler answe (I'll probably be just as convoluted - science in a phone is hard). Band gap varies as interatomic distance which can be thought of as a proxy for bond strength. The closer two atoms are together, the stronger they are bound. When you push atoms closer together, their electrons cannot occur the same energy - think Pauli exclusion. So, these orbitals hybridize and split. Eventually, they split in such a way that electrons occupy a lot of lower energy levels, but not the upper levels. This is the band gap. </p>
<p>See Fig 2.3.2 which models band energy as a function of interatomic distance: <a href="http://ecee.colorado.edu/~bart/ecen3320/newbook/chapter2/ch2_3.htm#fig2_3_3" target="_blank">http://ecee.colorado.edu/~bart/ecen3320/newbook/chapter2/ch2_3.htm#fig2_3_3</a></p>
<p>Right to left is decreasing interatomic spacing. Moving right to left: first, the election energies hybridize and spread out. Then they spread so much that they split. At around 7 angstroms where the bands are not split, that's a conductor. Moving to the left you develop a gap where the distance between the top of the lower sp band (valence band maximum) and the bottom of the upper so band (conduction band minimum) is the 'band gap'. Even closer and you get a band gap which is so wide it's essentially an insulator! </p>
<p>So - to answer your question. SiC has a fairly large band gap due to strong bonding and small interatomic distance. Of course, there is a lot more going on. There is crystal structure, which says how well packed the Aaron's are and what kind of bonding (Si-Si, Si-C, C-C) is important. You have the energy-momentum landscape (essentially the idea that directionality matters) which comes into play with the symmetry of the crystal as well as many other factors, but bond strength is a great way to visualize it.</p>
<p>As others have said - SiC is not the end all. There are many other materials with higher band gap, but bipolar doping really becomes an issue with wide and ultra-wide bandgap materials which is why SiC is such an important technology. GaN is really the other major competitor (yet) which has a larger gap - odds are you own something with GaN technology. White light LEDs and small form factor laptop chargers for instance.</p>
