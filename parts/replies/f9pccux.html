			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree the style is perfect, but the content is not right. </p>
<p>When the rock is wet, light does not bounce any &quot;bit less&quot; . It bounces just as much, only, it bounces a bit more in <em>one</em> &quot;favourite&quot; direction, and bit less in all other directions. </p>
<p>If that one favourite direction is right toward your eye, then a lot of bounced light hits your eye, and you see the rock <em>brighter</em>.  Did you notice that wet stuff is not only bit darker, but also a lot more shiny? That's why. When you see the shine, it's because you are in the way of all the light bouncing in its favourite direction.</p>
<p>But this means there's less light bouncing in all other directions. So, whoever is not in the right spot to see the shine, sees the rock a bit darker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To tack onto this answer, if your car looks really good wet but looks hazy and not as colorful or vibrant when it's dry, get it polished. The little scratches in the clear coat redirect light in different directions. When the car is polished you get more light into your eyes and it looks glossier.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: since the people are taking the 5 year old thing too literally: Most answers arent simplified either and thats what I'm bothered by. I c√°n understand what they say most of the time but it demands a lot of thinking and I dont think thats the essence of this sub.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or rather: Objects getting wet makes them have less <em>diffuse</em> reflections. Diffuse reflections is when the surface is uneven and light bounces to all directions, including to your eyes. When the surface is wet, diffuse reflections happen less because the object is covered in a thin film of water, filling the uneven parts of the surface.</p>
<p>Light can still reflect pretty strongly in <em>specular</em> or &quot;mirror-like&quot; reflections, which happens when the surface is flat enough. The lack of diffuse reflections makes them look darker from every other angle, but brighter in the direction where the light is actually reflected to. That is what makes wet things have that characteristic &quot;shiny&quot; look with a sort of highlight at one spot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the degree to which the surface is polished.</p>
<p>In the end, we're talking about quite small scale of &quot;uneven&quot; here. To be specific, the diffuse/specular reflection is determined by unevenness at the scale relative to the wavelength of the light. So for visible light, that would be unevenness at the scale of about 350-700 nm.</p>
<p>If the surface finish is rougher than that, then the surface will have diffuse reflections at visible light wavelength. Smoothing it out (moving to finer grit sandpaper) will start to increase the definition of the specular highlight, and reduce the amount of diffusion in the reflections. But even though the object might look diffuse (matte surface) in visible light, it might already appear to have a specular reflection at lower wavelengths, such as microwaves or radio waves. </p>
<p>A surface that's significantly flatter than the wavelength of light hitting it, it will work as a mirror for longer wavelength light and have almost zero diffuse reflection; this level of smoothless is known as &quot;mirror polish&quot; and is actually not completely desirable for most objects. Like cars for example would become difficult to see and could cause issues with glare if they were completely shiny like that. So the surface of most car paints is not rough to touch, but it's still rough enough to cause significant amount of diffuse light reflections, to make the car more visible. Actually, the transparent top coat may be smooth, but the boundary layer between the top coat and the actual paint may not be. That causes some of the light to have a specular reflection (light that reflects back from the top coat surface) and most of it has diffuse reflection from the actual paint surface itself.</p>
<p>This is actually why radio telescopes don't need to be have polished surfaces. In fact they don't even need to be opaque in visible light spectrum - you can use a metal net, and it will be opaque to radio waves with wavelength that is longer than the holes in the structure.</p>
<p>But back to surfaces that look polished in visible light. These surfaces are already flat enough to appear shiny without the presence of water. That means they are less affected by water, and in fact a very polished rock can look like it's wet already. But a worn billiard ball, or a car's paint, with fine scratches and dents and even some dirt can make the surface more diffuse, and water (or wax) can fill up those gaps and make the ball appear smooth again.</p>
<p>So yeah, this is also why new cars have that shiny look that disappears when they have a fine dust/dirt coating, or when the paint gets worn out. And why they start looking shinier in the rain again.</p></div>		</li>
