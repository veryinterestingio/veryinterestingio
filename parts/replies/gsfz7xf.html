And still it all seems to come down to &quot;it just is and doesn't work how any of us think anything would normally work.&quot;</p>
<p>Maybe that's the only answer for now: it just is from things measured?</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's how the universe works. You can understand the physics behind it, but if you're looking for some deeper reason that causes the universe to act the way it does, you're not going to find one.</p>
<p>You can keep asking &quot;but why?&quot; all you like, but eventually it always comes down to &quot;because that's how the universe works&quot;</p></div>		</li>

We just haven't had enough time yet, the universe is billions of years old while intelligent life with resources is barely a few 100 years old. With more time we will find more reasons</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a way I explained it awhile back relating to time dialation (which, in addition to length contraction, is the actual 'how' of this posts question)</p>
<p>The speed of light is the same speed regardless of how fast your going when you measure it. If youre on Earth or on a spaceship going 90 percent the speed of light and you shine a laser in front of you or your ship its gonna go out the same speed. This sounds wrong because if you throw an object in front of you while your moving surely its speed would be your speed plus it's own speed relative to you, meaning logically the laser from your rocket would be 1.9 the speed of light right? But light doesn't work light that, it can't because it's the universal constant. </p>
<p>You see your speed in the universe is relative. Weather your going .99 the speed of light or standing still is completely based on what other object your referecing. For all we know Earth and all things around us could already be traveling 99 percent the speed of light when compared to a system of planets far out on the edge of the universe. In order for a universe of wildly differering speeds to actually work something has to stay constant for everyone across every frame of reference and that's light, but something has to give as well, and that is time. (and length, but we can get to that later.)</p>
<p>Time is the thing that changes the 'speed' of the laser on your rocketship. The truth is that laser beam fired off the edge of your space ship only looks like it's going the speed of light because time itself has slowed you down so much that to you it looks like it's going at that speed. It has to because otherwise a universe of differing refence points wouldn't be possible. </p>
<p>And time warp isn't just noticeable in theoretical scenarios with rocketships, it's happening right now on every GPS satellite in orbit. We actually have to compensate for this time dilation that occurs on the satellites clocks in order to have an accurate positioning system. (Should be noted however that the time warping of satellites is a little different then the one we were talking about, as gravity ALSO affects time and they are much more affected by this dilation then the one from purely speed, however they still have to factor in both to get a correct reading.)</p>
<p>TLDR: The faster you go the more time itself slows you down so that the speed of light is able to stay the same. Same thing happens with gravity and time too which is the plot of Interstellar. In addition to time slowing the length of the universe also contracts in a proportion relating to the dilated time both of which add up to keeping everything in the universe under 299,792,458 meters per second.</p>
<p>Also as a fun side note this also means light doesn't experience time at all. The billions of years it took for us to see a stars light was an instantaneous trip for that photon.</p></div>		</li>

<p>THIS is the easiest correct answer. I shouldn't have had to scroll down so far to find it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Time, gravity and causality.</p>
<p>We keep focusing on the &quot;light&quot; part of speed of light, when it's just that light always moves as fast as its medium allows (doesn't have to pay the mass tax). In vacuum that is the speed of causality. If something moves faster than causality, we break cause an effect and the universe doesn't seem to like that.</p>
<p>On the other hand, AFAIK, gravity can be explained as gradient of time (if two adjacent regions of space have different flows of time, there will be a gravitational effect creating a phantom force from one to the other) but the equations are reversible, so a gravitational gradient also implies time flows differently in every part of it.</p>
<p>It think all gravitational/mass/time shenanigans have to do with the universe wanting to keep things casual :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because everyone is just stating the rule, not explaining it. Unfortunately I'm not sure there is an ELI5 explanation for this, it is wildly unintuitive.

			<div class="markdown"><p>well, to be fair, at a certain point all you can really do is describe what's happening. it's like asking &quot;why does the earth revolve around the sun&quot;. i can tell you <em>how</em> it does, and <em>why</em> it does in terms of things we understand like gravity, but the real <em>why</em> is more philosophical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shit, this was so well written it really struck a chord with me! I‘ve got ADHD and I’m a software developer so I find myself often taking longer to understand something because I can’t find the ‘why’ that makes sense to me. Reading this just dawned on me that a lot of the time, I probably have understood how something works and why I would use it but the ‘why’ I’m looking for is something that probably won’t be answered in some niche programming documentation! - Man, I needed this! Thanks for commenting. I could of gone my whole life without realising this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's the best I can do.</p>
<p>Light moves at the speed of causality. That is the real speed limit. But to be fair, literally everything in the universe moves at the speed of causality. It's just confusing because the universe is four dimensional. Causality moves in time as well as spatial dimensions. Or rather, it's all the same thing, spacetime.</p>
<p>You sitting in a chair in your living room is moving at exactly the same causal speed as an astronaut in orbit around the planet, and both of you are moving at exactly the same causal speed as a beam of light moving through the vacuum of space. It's just that your motion is mostly through time with a tiny bit through space, the astronaut's motion is mostly through time but a tiny tiny tiny bit more of it is through space, and the light beams motion is 100% through space, none at all through time. It's an exponential siding scale.</p>
<p>So, why can't you go faster than light? Well, as you accelerate you spend energy to trade your causal motion thought time into motion through space. The faster you go through space, the less &quot;speed&quot; you have left in time (time dilation). Eventually your speed will be so much in space and so little in time that there's no time for you to continue spending energy to accelerate. You can never quite reach the speed of light, but you can get really close to it. If you could reach the speed of light, all time for you would stop and you would have no time to continue accelerating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's quite intuitive. You have a 1 meter stick. You can point it in any direction. From your point of view you can say, &quot;the tip is .95 meters in front of me, and .15 to the side (if at an angle of 30 degrees). Set the stick down on the ground and walk away (so the next paragraph can happen)</p>
<p>A friend walks up, stand over the stick but pointing in a different direction, and tip is a different distance front vs side vs what you measured. There is nothing mind blowing go on, it's relative to what angle you are pointing. The stick itself is always 1 meter long. Length front vs side changes, but not the stick itself. </p>
<p>Well, we live in space-time. 4 coordinates, x, y, z, t, where t is time. And we are all going at C (the length of the stick). But based on our relative speeds, we see different things. Your clock is slow, mine is fast, or whatever. Time is just another dimension, and if true (it is) it is perfectly normal that we'll see it differently, just like we see the x,y,z differently.</p>
<p>BUT, the stick is 1 meter, and the speed is C. That's the constant. So no matter how you twist that 1 meter stick, no measurement will be &gt; 1m, no matter how you orient yourself relative to it. And we are all moving at C, so nothing will ever measure faster than C, no matter how you orient yourself relative to it. </p>
<p>We can see the whole stick, but we can't 'see' the 4d speed, so the latter seems quite confusing, but it is essentially the same thing (It's different in that space-time uses hyperbolic relationships, but that's not important for the intuition). If a 2D person was watching you wave a stick in 3d they'd be mystified, as the stick would seeminly arbitrarily get shorter or longer based on how much it is tilted up. Mind blowing and unintuitive to them, until you explain there is a dimension they are not seeing directly. Then it is just &quot;ohh, duh, obviously&quot;. It's a 1 meter stick, but one component of it, up, is invisible to me. Well, same thing for us and space-time.</p></div>		</li>
