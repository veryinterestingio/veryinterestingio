			<div class="markdown"><p>Jumping in on that last point - the current fashion in quantum gravity is to consider the total number of bits of information that can be stored in a finite volume of space (which is surprisingly thought to be finite even if space itself is not quantized). As a given volume of space expands, more information can be stored in it, so in this sense the number of &quot;bits&quot; is indeed growing in a finite volume universe. I'd probably consider this still in the realm of conjecture due to the lack of direct experimental probing of the Planck scale, but theres a ton of mathematical evidence that this is quite likely the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love arguments based on information theory - thanks for adding that!  But surely the number of bits that can be added depend on the &quot;size&quot; of the bit, and it seems like you're assuming that is fixed in meters, yes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In principle yes, but the weird thing about this counting of bits is that the total number is proportional to the surface area bounding the region, as opposed to the volume of the region. Furthermore, it's unclear whether this counting holds for any given region of space or only for special geometries (such as those bounded by some event horizon).</p></div>		</li>

Interestingly it scales with the surface area and not the volume.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Distance isn't even a conserved quantity in the normal universe... If you're moving toward/away from something the distances itself change. With infinite energy (say a rocket that could forever accelerate at 1g via some magic), you can travel anywhere in the universe in a human lifetime, assuming it's not moving away faster than speed of light, because the distances shrink as you accelerate toward them.</p></div>		</li>

<li>There is the possibility that the &quot;dark energy&quot; is indeed a &quot;vacuum energy&quot;, ie intrinsic to space and quanta, but that's at the conjectural level since any computation gives a energy density (for the dark energy) that is 10^120 off the real answer.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Calling it &quot;computation&quot; is overselling it. We can't do such a computation. We can just hand-wave around that - if we could do it - we might expect the result to be somewhere at the Planck density. But the same hand-waving would say that e.g. the Higgs mass should be at the Planck energy (or at least the GUT scale). It clearly isn't. You could also hand-wave around and say that e.g. the electron shouldn't be too much lighter than the Higgs boson. But it is. We already know that this sort of hand-waving doesn't work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now you're underselling it. What you call &quot;hand-waving&quot; is actually the foundation of modern effective field theory and it works perfectly well in most scenarios. The fact that it doesn't work for the Higgs mass (and also not for the strong CP angle and vacuum energy) actually just tells us that we are either missing some very important ingredients of the universe or we got some of our basic understanding of quantum mechanics completely wrong. Or we could place it on the landscape and anthropics, but that's kinda lame and also bad for funding theory departments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is nothing in QFT that would tell you the absolute energy density of space. Sure, you can naively add things, and then say &quot;well, we probably stop doing that at the Planck scale, and things probably don't cancel nicely&quot;, but that isn't really well-motivated.</p>

<p>Indeed. That's why this &quot;should be at the Planck density&quot; estimate is extremely naive. We already know this type of estimate doesn't work well in places where we can test it, so why should it be different for the vacuum energy.</p></div>		</li>
