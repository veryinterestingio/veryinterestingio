			<div class="markdown"><p>Another reason for some viruses such as influenza is that their genome is actually segmented! If a host has more than one strain of influenza, the segments can be mixed up and you have a rapid sudden form of mutation called antigenic shift. The other commonly known form of mutation that occurs over time due to replication errors is called antigenic drift.</p>
<p>Edit: It's actually antigenic shift/drift not genetic as I had mistakenly put before. Thank you /u/insulinjockey for pointing that out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My office had a critically bad flu outbreak at the end of January.  Out of 22 workers, 18 got sick, including those who had flu shots.  3 people went to the ER/prime care and got tested for corona.  Corona was negative, but one came back with Influenza A, another with Influenza B, and the third had both!  They actually recommended shutting down the office on fears of mutation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, it’s a good analogy! But it is not sexual reproduction. It’s just random mixing of segments of their genome while the host machinery assembled the virus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AFAIK It's similar in the effect that it adds genetic variability, but it is distinct from sexual reproduction. Someone else may be able to better explain, as I'm usually not too good at it but I can try. In the case of sexual reproduction, male and female gametes are required to pair to be able to reproduce whereas in the virus, it's just reproducing normally and the genetic material of two different strains just got mixed in together because they happened to both infect the same cell and are using its components for replication. I would say technically viruses aren't alive and therefore don't really reproduce so much as trick host cells into creating copies of the virus, similar to how the cells in your body would make copies of themselves to create new cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thats right but not for corona. The SarsCov2 actually encodes a Rna-Polymerase which has a proofreading function. So it doesnt mutate that much, which is propably good for us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically separate from the polymerase.  Nsp-14 is the proofreading exoribonuclease (and also a methyltransferase), the RdRp is nsp-12.</p>
<p>Edit: naming is based on SARS.  I assume they have the same proteins, but I don't actually know for certain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SARS-CoV-2 has 30k letters in its genome. Influinza has only about 14k. So coronaviruses can mutate a good bit more without changing anything. Most mutations have no effect and for us to need more than one vaccine the part of the virus that our immune system recognizes has to change. So the 4 strains are likely pretty much identical to our immune system.</p></div>		</li>

<p>However, SARS-CoV-2 has a polymerase proofreading gene, dramatically cutting down the number of mutations it sees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wrote this in a similar thread and it seemed to help some people there understand. Hope you don't mind me piggybacking.</p>
<p>Think of a group of 10 identical people. Now change the hair color of each of those individuals a single shade randomly. They have all been mutated. They are now all different. Now, put a plastic bag over their head and see if any of them live. In this scenario, the bag is a vaccine.</p>
<p>New scenario. Take one of the 10 and instead of changing their hair color, move their nose (and all the underlying necessary bits) to their chest. Put the plastic bags over all of their heads and the one with the relocated nose will survive. Kind of a rudimentary analogy, but it might help you understand a bit more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. There will always be mutations. However, it's completely random and there are some redundancies in place. The genetic material is a sequence that codes for proteins. A sequence of three will code for an amino acid, or signal for protein construction to start/end. Mutations may change the coding sequence but may lead to any number of things. It may lead to a new protein with a different function, early termination of the protein so it is no longer viable, or even the exact same protein, since different genetic sequences can code for the same amino acid. The likelihood that mutations due to antigenic drift suddenly creating an even more dangerous virus is relatively small.</p></div>		</li>
