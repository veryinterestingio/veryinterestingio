<p>That said, we can manufacture sugar alcohols that fit into these receptors even better than natural sugars (think artificial sweeteners like sucralose aka Splenda).</p>

<p>Artificial sweeteners don't have to be sugar alcohols; for example, aspartame is a methylated dipeptide (so it's protein-like). And sugar alcohols generally aren't particularly sweet - typically a little less than sucrose actually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, yes thank you for making that point! Many sweeteners are not necessarily even sugar-like at first glance, but their electronic structure compliments the ligand binding site of the receptor similarly to the sugar.</p>
<p>I think my point was that some artificial sweeteners are manufactured to bind similarly to sucrose but at much lower concentrations, as sucralose does for example. (But you're right that it is not a sugar alcohol, and I mistakenly related the two. Sugar alcohols do not bind as strongly and aren't as &quot;sweet&quot; as a result.)</p></div>		</li>
