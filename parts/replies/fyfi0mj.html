<p>(so the probability of at least 1 of said floods occurring in 100 years is 100%). </p>

<p>Just wanted to point out that that’s not how probabilities of independent events add up. A 1% chance every year would add up to a 63% chance of happening within a given 100 year span. Over multiple hundreds of years, the average per century does come out to pretty close to 1, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For anyone else who didn't understand how we get to the 63% figure:
The probability of the event <em>not</em> occuring each year is 99%. So the probability of the event not occuring the for two years in a row is (0.99x0.99=) 98%.</p>
<p>Repeating this process a hundred times, we get the probability that the flood doesn't occur for a hundred consecutive years to be (0.99)^100, which comes to 36.6%.</p>
<p>If the probability of the flood never occuring in a hundred years is 36.6%, it means that the flood will occur <em>at least once</em> in the rest of the scenarios (100-36.6=)63.3%</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add that probability shouldn't be interpreted subjectively (most of the time, unless dealing with the Bayesian interpretation of probability).</p>
<p>It should be discouraged to think the 63.3% as &quot;there's a 63% chance of it happening in the next 100 year&quot;, but more like &quot;if there were 1000 parallel universes, approximately 633 of them will have the event occurring in the next 100 years&quot;.</p>
<p>Since it is a single event, it either can happen or won't happen (unless you have extra data/assumptions). Even if the probability is 99.999999%, you might just hit the 0.00000001%, and it shouldn't be surprising.</p>
<p>Even if 99999 out of the 100000  universes &quot;should&quot; have the event occur, there's hardly any evidence to suggest that you could not be in the one universe that it doesn't occur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Furthermore, this can be generalized that for any 1/n probability occurrence sampled n times (here n=100) will have a chance of no
occurrence approaching 1/e~36.9% as n gets large.  This is because the problem is set up very similar to the definition of e.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, there definitely is not 100% chance of at least 1 100 year flood every hundred years, or it'd be impossible to ever be overdue. </p>
<p>100 year flood does mean you'd expect 1 to occur in every hundred year period, in the expected value sense, but it also means that even if you haven't had one for the last 35 years or whatever, you still only expect one in the next 100 years, with a 1% chance per year.</p>
<p>Very informative explanation otherwise, but that would have cost significant points on a statistics exam.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that an event has probability zero doesn't mean it's impossible. (in probability theory, at least).</p>
<p>But still, your analysis is correct</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, thanks, I removed that. Apparently writing answers right before bed is not a good plan. Hilariously, I go through the exact calculation with my intro geology class re the probability of a 100 year flood happening in a 100 year time frame, but that didn’t pop in my head while writing this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention a lot of these things we are &quot;overdue&quot; for are measured in periods of hundreds of thousands of years.  Saying we're overdue for an event measured on that timescale is like profusely apologizing for showing up a few seconds late to a party.</p></div>		</li>
