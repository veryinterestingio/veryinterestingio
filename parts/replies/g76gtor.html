			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was in high school, I viewed NASA as the most awesome place. I had tons of admiration for the agency but I never thought I would end up working there -- it was more like a dream that I didn't thought was reachable at the time. I enjoyed my math classes, I was a bit of a nerd haha. I also enjoyed science classes, and in High School I took a Computer Science / Programming elective class that I enjoyed a lot. Because of that, I decided to study computer engineering. One day at the university I saw an ad saying that NASA was interviewing for summer internships, I decided to apply thinking I was not even going to be selected to interview, But I was! One thing led to the other and after a summer internship, then a CO-OP program, I ended up getting offered a full time job at NASA. Dream come true! -JOP</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was in high school I found my passion for science really came from finding meaningful connections. Yes, a lot of course work in science and math helps, but you won't really enjoy what you do unless you have a context you're passionate about. Clubs and internships are really the way to determine that you really care about the career, not just that you can pass the test and get the grade. Careers change in so many ways as we progress professionally, so it's also really important to be well-rounded. I started as a chemist, then a biochemist, and now I work in the education department doing outreach and teacher programs. I think NASA is special because we're not just experts, we're really excited about what we're doing. -BR</p></div>		</li>
