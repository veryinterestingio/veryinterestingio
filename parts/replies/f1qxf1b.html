			<div class="markdown"><p>French has an academy as well and, while less messed up than English, I'd hardly say you could read it phonetically (not a native speaker though, so others might wish to argue). Polish on the other hand didn't have an academy for a long time since there wasn't even a country to support such an institution, but the pronunciation is very uniform and straightforward.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Anyone below arguing with this is just simply WRONG. Large parts of most words are not pronounced at all and pronunciation is all contextual. French is absolutely NOT pronounced phonetically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Copied from my own comment below:
I think the confusion is that the pronunciation of French words is surprisingly predictable from its spelling once you've internalised its rules: - es, -ent and -e are just not pronounced as they are verb endings, no exceptions. Combinations such as 'eu' and 'oi' are always pronounced one way (and if you wish to show they're pronounced separately, you have to write 'eü' and 'oï'). However, the reverse is not true: the pronunciation of a word doesn't tell you how to spell it.</p>
<p>So French is phonetic in the sense that spelling informs pronunciation, but not the other way around. Spanish, by and large, goes both ways, as does Polish (which does have letters changing sounds based on context; compare the pronunciation of 's' on its own with 'sz') . On the other hand, English does neither consistently. Consider the infamous '-ough' being pronounced at least three different ways, while words like 'some' and 'sum' are pronounced the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea the French Academy mission is to maintain the &quot;purity&quot; of the French language.   </p>
<p>&quot;The problem with defending the purity of the English language is that English is about as pure as a cribhouse whore. We don’t just borrow words; on occasion, English has pursued other languages down alleyways to beat them unconscious and rifle their pockets for new vocabulary. &quot;  --James Nicoll</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spanish is very consistent which I appreciate. Once you know how to pronounce all the vowels and consonants and the pronunciation rules, you can easily read unknown words the correct way. Would already put you ahead of like 50% of the native speaking population.</p></div>		</li>
