			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm just making up numbers here, but if you're playing music at 30 db and the outside noise is another 40 db. And noise cancelling reduced this 40 db to 20 db. Wouldn't this reduce ear damage even if you're not changing your music volume?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea but that's not the question. 40 db plus 30 db may be 40.4 db, but that is surely less than 40 db plus 20 db.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The music is hitting your ear drum way harder than the outside noise, like AirPods emit 85 to 110 decibels, at higher volumes, directly into the ear canal.   </p>
<p>If walking past a jackhammer, or riding on the subway I find I have to go almost all the way to maximum volume with regular AirPods.</p>
<p>As I mentioned previously, you won’t have to have your music as loud, with noise cancelling buds.  So there could be a savings if you reduce the volume accordingly.</p>
<p>If you can keep them at 60% volume, then you’re in the ok range.  But if you’re cranking that volume up anyway, then you’re likely doing more damage than the noises in your surroundings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no way this is true.  I listen to music on noise cancelling earbuds on the bus every day, and if I turn off the sound and noise cancelling simultaneously, I often jump at the sudden jet-like loudness I hear.  This isn't even factoring in that the earbud design itself is somewhat passively noise reducing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, two different sounds dont add together constructively. They have different wave forms unless both are exactly the same sound.</p>
<p>Not sound related, but for waves: Sin(x) can be -1 to 1, cos(x) can be -1 to 1, but sin(x) +  cos(x) is never 2.</p></div>		</li>
