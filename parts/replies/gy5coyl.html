			<div class="markdown"><p>Ask for a different type of pressure check. Say the word &quot;tonopen&quot; and they likely have one. It's way more gentle, and generally more accurate too.</p>
<p>Eye Pressure is an important health metric. As crucial to your eyes as blood pressure is to your cardio health. Make sure they get a good reading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. I found a trick that works for me. Ask to borrow that eye cover paddle they use to make sure you aren't cheating with the alternate eye... cover your closed eye with it. The combination of less light entering your closed eye and the physical contact helps immensely to combat that reflex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have “droopy eyelids” that will probably require surgery someday so I can’t really open my eyes really wide.  So I sit there while they tell me to open really wide...sorry but it’s as wide as it’s  gonna get.  The other annoying part is you stare at the green dot...and stare...and stare...and then when you finally blink the puff happens.  Never fails.  I always get the manual test anyways so not sure why they put me through that.</p></div>		</li>
