			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. Eggs prepared a certain way for me are a definite trigger. But if I eat them mixed with something else, it's like I can trick my body into thinking there aren't any eggs involved at all lol </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, diarrhea, vomiting, indigestion, food poisoning - basically any adverse reaction related to digestion - <em>is not necessarily a result of the last thing you ate</em>.  This is a common myth.  That's why food poising cases require a lot of victims and a lot of investigation and data to actually find the source.</p>
<p>Many digestive problems are the result of delayed reactions as food passes through the multi-multi-step process of digestion.  Your body may only recognise (or misinterpret) a &quot;problem&quot; long after you've eaten something and have since eaten many other things.  Different parts of your digestive tract are sensitive to different things, and as you food is digested, changed, and &quot;revealed&quot;, new &quot;problems&quot;, irritants, toxins, etc. may cause issues.  </p>
<p>Also, bacterial contamination (which is the usual root cause of &quot;food  poisoning&quot;) can also take from hours <em>to days</em> to present symptoms depending on the type of bacteria and the level of contamination and can present mild symptoms (mild diarrhea) to life threatening symptoms (fever, delirium, etc.).</p></div>		</li>
