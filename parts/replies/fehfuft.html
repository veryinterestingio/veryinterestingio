			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pushing 40, so I grew up with most of this tech and for the last 20 years or so electronics has become a major hobby for me.  Fascinating to see just how much more physical engineering was involved in older consumer electronics before everything was replaced with compact circuit boards.  </p>
<p>I design and fabricate circuit boards for fun, solder everything together, and throw a little programming code into a microcontroller without a thought, but just looking at the intricate system of dozens of interlocking mechanical parts involved in the 'simple' action of inserting a VHS tape into a VCR blows my mind...</p></div>		</li>
