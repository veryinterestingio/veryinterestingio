			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure for lactamase specifically, but yes, in general pumping out lots of any enzyme has a measurable cost to a fast-growing bacteria, and the benefits of making the enzyme had better be worth that cost or the bacteria will quickly evolve to not produce it. </p>
<p>It's a pretty common pattern that if you stop giving antibiotics to a bacterial population that's developed resistance, those bacteria will start to lose their resistance.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It isn't so much as &quot;lose their resistance&quot;. Most of the genes responsible for resistance are inducible. When there is no substrate, genes aren't induced.</p></div>		</li>
