			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool fiber optic fact - you can send light in both directions at the same time by using different wavelengths - they do not collide in the fiber.  I just started working in fiber optics and just learned this.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another fact, AM and FM stand for 'Amplitude Modulation' and 'Frequency Modulation'. They operate on the same signal and frequency. Your radio tunes to the frequency and transcribes the signal and what plays is based on if you choose AM it measures how tall/short the wave is or if you choose FM, how frequent the wave is.</p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Amfm3-en-de.gif" target="_blank">Here's a cool image that shows how it functions.</a></p>
<p>Also, microwaves operate the same frequency as 2.4Ghz band Wi-Fi access points and can interrupt Wi-Fi signals if not placed properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, and you have to be specific about how they are different. They can interfere, for example, if one wavelength is exactly half (or one fourth, or one eighth, etc) of the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electromagnetic waves. Generally wifi is either 2.4 ghz or 5 ghz. I think more people need to be taught what electromagnetic waves are, and how amazing how much changes depending on the frequency of the waves. Low end? Am radio, mid range? Microwaves, higher end? Light, Top end? Ionizing radiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shockwaves are more like sound, radio is more like light. But yeah once you get any output you can measure somewhere else you can send information. It gets super complicated with radio where there’s lots of interference; wires are somewhat more isolated and simpler.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah good ol' packet headers with ttl and packet loss correction.  Is actually impressive how much information gets passed between points in a wireless setup and how much of it is corrupted but it all still works.  For the curious, dive into network stacks and you'll quickly see why your internet sucks when you have 1 or 2 bars of WiFi signal.  There's a lot that can and does go wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of answers here about wireless, and many are incomplete, incorrect, or outdated. I’m a wireless engineer, so I’ll make this as simple as possible. </p>
<p>The user who answered “pulse” is correct, but only for low and outdated slow modulators. It’s an extremely inefficient use of the medium. </p>
<p>The user who answered “shifts in frequency” is correct if you’re talking about “FM” radio, which is an analog signal. </p>
<p>Modern wireless systems use “symbols” to encode digital data. To imagine a symbol think of an old X/Y graph plot where X and Y are mathematical properties of your wave that sum to the observed property. </p>
<p>This gives your four quadrants and is the basis for modern Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM). This means if your resolution is simple (positive vs negative) your have 4 possible symbols you can encode, { (-,-) (-,+) (+,-) (+,+) }</p>
<p>This effectively doubles the bandwidth of a binary bitstream because you can encode two bits per symbol (00, 01, 10, 11). This would be called 4QAM. now imagine you double the resolution so you have 4 dots in each quadrant, because you have resolution of 0.5X/Y, you now have 16 symbols (16QAM) and you’ve increased bandwidth again, but rely on higher signal levels to give you a clear signal. </p>
<p>Now keep adding resolution and you get higher rates (32QAM, 64QAM, etc...) which correspond to established data rates (check your wireless device data sheet for exact mappings and required signal levels). </p>
<p>Additional reading, see the “Digital QAM” section of the Wikipedia article for pretty animated pictures.
