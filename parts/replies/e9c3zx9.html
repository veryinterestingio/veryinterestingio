<p>EDIT: earlier it was mentioned his sentence was doubled to 9 years and 6 months. I doubled that again as a joke but I think some of you guys missed it? </p></div>		</li>

But in reality it’s more like an old blanket made of scratchy wool with some holes.  It will keep you warm, but parts of it are downright uncomfortable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if it works. I would assume that someone who is going to illegally smoke on a plane is also going to want to cover it up as much as possible.</p>
<p>Like, isn't smoking on a plane a serious crime? I wouldn't want to leave evidence and have the next person coming in to find the ash and butt. I'd probably extinguish the cig in the sink and then flush it so I could hide all the evidence.</p>
<p>On a related note, why are e-cigs banned? I guess they can be annoying, but they could implement a rule which says only oderless low-vapour e-cigs are allowed or something like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>People may see someone using a vaporiser and assume it's ok to smoke, especially if the language on the aeroplane isn't their first language</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vapour can create a &quot;layer&quot; of fogginess, which could potentially be dangerous in flight</p>
</li>
<li>It's hard for cabin crew to distinguish between someone vaping and someone smoking at first glance</li>
</ul>
<p>(Source: I use a vaporiser, and would never think of using it on a plane)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>They can trigger a false smoke alarm and the required emergency response.</p>
<p>Only allowing certain types makes it impossible to enforce (and communicate) the rules effectively.</p>
<p>They are also high-current Li-Ion powered devices that are often cheaply built, increasing the risk that one of them catches fire, and a Li-Ion fire on board is a very undesirable situation.</p></div>		</li>
