			<div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate on your point, an &quot;octane rating 100&quot; would be a gasoline with the self-ignition properties of 100% octane. Gasoline is a mix of multiple different chemicals, and the most stable of these being octane. Any rating lower than 100 has the same self-ignition properties of a ratio between octane and heptane. Heptane being the least stable of the chemicals commonly found in gas.</p>
<p>So a gas rated at octane rating of 91 means that it has the properties of a mix of 91% octane and 9% heptane despite this not being the chemical makeup of the gas itself.</p>
<p>Funnily it's possible for the gas to contain literally no octane and no heptane at all. Though there is no natural reason this would ever be the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also have fuel with an octane rating &gt;100 meaning it's more resistant to knock (detonation due to pressure) than pure iso-octane. Ultra-high performance cars with aftermarket turbos or non-street legal race cars can require fuel with octane ratings over 100.</p></div>		</li>
