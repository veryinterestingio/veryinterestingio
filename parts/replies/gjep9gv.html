<p>Preventing concentration from growing or enhancing dilution allows indoor spaces to decrease risk significantly.  For an outdoor setting I think you would see concentration quickly approaching zero from transmission source.  Not zero but close to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. You essentially can’t catch COVID outside alone. Unless you walk right into a cloud of virus particles that someone seconds before coughed into the air, you cannot be infected. I’m sure there’s some bizarre rare event where the air was absolutely still, the sun was down and the virus remained suspended in the air just long enough ...but then your innate immune system still shuts it down, and even in this extremely rare event ...you would likely get an asymptomatic case. </p>
<p>Now if you are outside in a crowd like an outdoor concert...outdoor wedding then the odds increase</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a Chinese study where they tracked COVID in 7000 people or something, only one contracted it outside and he’d been in a close conversation with an infected neighbor.</p>
<p>Of course if you’re catching it randomly it’s harder to track where exactly you got it, so the percentage is probably a bit higher but still much safer out doors</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing I don't like about this otherwise very good article is that they always combine ventilation and shortening time into one step. Shortening time is often not doable or already done</p></div>		</li>
