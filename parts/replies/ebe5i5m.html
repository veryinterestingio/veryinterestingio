			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually music theory doesn't tell you what is good music.  It's an attempt to describe some of the grammar of music, an attempt to describe in a standardized way the music that you hear.</p>
<p>Thus, if you're trying to compose a song, it's easier to say to yourself I'd like to compose a II V I progression with some variation rather than randomly trying out chords.</p>
<p>In other words it's a way to codify music so that you can easily recall what is good to you.  But it doesn't necessarily tell you what is good music</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The short answer: no. </p>
<p>The long answer: Music theory isn't what makes music good, it's how music is put together.  Think of a language class.  Foreign language courses don't teach you what makes those languages good or bad but instead the grammar and vocabulary. </p>
<p>There are all sorts of branches of music theory, but the main one people study is tonal theory (based on rules from 16th century italian church music to 19th century German music.) These teach pretty strict rules (this chord comes after this chord, this voicing leads to this voicing.)  Ironically, almost no popular music follows this theory today.  They use the most barebones basics of having tertian-based chords and some system to set up a tonic.  This music has its quirks and patterns, but they're loosely based on what people study. If you want a good example of a musician/group  who's studied these patterns to use in their music, look at MUSE.  If you want a good example of somebody who studied theory and just threw everything out the window for creative freedom, look at Jacob Collier. </p>
<p>There are some courses on aesthetics and mathematical theories like the golden mean in music, but aesthetics ultimately falls more into psychology and philosophy of music.   The closest theory gets to that is form and analysis courses which teach you standard patterns to try to get to that ratio.   At the very best, theory teaches musicians standard patterns people use.  Humans like patterns, so it's more likely to make our music more enjoyable.  As somebody who's taught freshman theory courses and graded papers though, I can promise you: knowing theory does not mean you write good music. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's because a language can't be &quot;good or bad&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neither can music in its most abstract form. Music is generally considered to be the intended organization of sound, normally to communicate some emotion or concept. </p>
<p>However, people can speak a language with poor grammar or pronunciation. We can write with poor spelling or ineffective vocabulary. Music theory is less &quot;here's good music&quot; and more &quot; here's what people have decided make the grammar and spelling rules to communicate in this language.&quot; Good and bad gets into philosophy, intent of communication, sincerity, reception by the listener. Mastery of craft/grammar certainly helps, but it's neither the requisite nor metric.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might think that, but music theory is more analogous to the grammar and syntax of a language.</p>
<p>Music theory develops after the music and varies between styles. The terminology that you learn studying classical theory is thrown out the window when studying jazz, and all that goes to hell when you look at rap.</p>
<p>The point there is that different musicians use different language, and while &quot;rules&quot; are made in adherence to a specific style, there isn't a method set in stone for &quot;good&quot; music. Rather, good music is like literature in the way that it stands the test of time and is multilayered, or perhaps it reflects the culture in a way no other art has captured.</p>
<p>That kind of &quot;good&quot; can't necessarily be quantified. Rather, like all other art it's left to interpretation. </p></div>		</li>
