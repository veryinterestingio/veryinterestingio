<p>The autonomic nervous system responds to stressful situations similarly across the board. It rules that we require more oxygen to our muscles, and thus our brain sends signals to open the glottis, the muscle that allows air to flow from the larynx into the lungs - and keep it expanded so long as we are stressed.</p>
<p>Expanding the glottis does not cause the familiar pain, but it does indeed hurt to swallow against this flexed muscle - which we unfortunately tend to do, due to all this mucous we create when we bawl our eyes out. This is because the glottis is closed when we swallow, since our bodies draw no benefit from getting mucous, saliva or food into our lungs.</p>
