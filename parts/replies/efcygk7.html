			<div class="markdown"><p>We just covered some of this in our stories from the Philippines. Check it out <a href="https://www.npr.org/theplastictide/" target="_blank">here</a>. The Philippines is considered one of the top offenders in terms of plastic marine waste. Local activists are now working globally with groups like #breakfreefromplastic and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (<a href="https://twitter.com/circulareconomy?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank">@circulareconomy</a>) as well as Greenpeace, etc., to address this issue. It's important to look at this holistically. These countries like the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam have an approach to waste management that was effective in their context. Once plastic packaging arrived in a big way through the use of single-use packaging called sachets, their capacity to manage it was exceeded largely because those single-use plastics are not recyclable, not anywhere. The big manufacturers of consumer goods such as Unilever, P&amp;G, Nestle have promised to make those sachets recyclable by 2025 but in the meantime, enormous amounts of plastic are still making their way into the waste stream. Keep an eye on what the big brands are doing. Keep an eye on the petrochemical industry as well.  <strong>--Rebecca</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your reply. Are there any efforts in international politics (eg UN, ASEAN) to improve this? Rather than grassroots activism/NGOs, whose input is of course very commendable but quite limited in power in the short-term. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Is that just a nice way of saying &quot;throwing shit on the ground and in rivers works if the shit is biodegradable&quot;?  If so, is it really the job of manufacturers to adapt to the garbage disposal practices of developing countries, or is it the responsibility of those countries to adapt to modern society and the modern disposal methods that have already been developed and could easily be adopted?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree it would be great if the Philippines (and other countries) were able to implement modern waste management systems.  However, they are poor, with a per capita GDP 5% of the US, so implementing that would compete against other priorities like health and education.  Also, they have a very challenging geography so it would be that much more expensive to implement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Based on your numerous comments in this thread, you seem less concerned about pollution than you do about making foreigners look guilty for it and making liberals look stupid. </p>
<p>Who cares? Why waste time grinding those axes?  It really bugs you that NPR doesn't play the same blame game that you insist on playing, doesn't it? Let it go and get on board with advocating for progress, even if it means building up and encouraging groups of people you may not like, understand, or agree 100% with.</p></div>		</li>
