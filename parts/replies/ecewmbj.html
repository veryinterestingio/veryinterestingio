You don’t need to drown in debt with a college degree to earn a great living.
I’m a early millennial, or as a later terms has come out I’m a Xennial (crossover between Gen X and millennials) born 84, never attended college but do have a trade certification, I have three kids, home owner, steady job. I also understood that when the bank approved me and my wife for a 599K mortgage, I didn’t HAVE to spend it all. Our home cost 306K which is a very easily manageable mortgage for a dual income household. I have lots of money in saving and retirement portfolios at only 34. A lot of millennials need to realize how to live within their means for one, and for two, need to get off the instant gratification bandwagon. The down payment saved form my house was through just that, saving. Sacrificing the concert tickets or the 7 dollar avocado toast or the new flannel shirt for a greater goal at the end. I’m proud to be a home owner, and by buying a moderately priced home, instead of my top echelon mortgage availability home, I don’t have to sacrifice the avocado toast or whatever it is anymore because I have planned for my future accordingly. My house does all the same stuff the big expensive ones do, yet I’m not mortgage poor. </p>
<p>When my three kids need to take a look at going to college, not only will I be set up to finance them if they need, but it will also mean I don’t have to dip into a home equity loan putting myself behind the 8 ball again so to speak. </p>
<p>So many people don’t know how to save for a rainy day nor do they know how to accurately calculate interest or payments to realize just how much they actually pay for something when they finance it. Or they just don’t care but personally I don’t want to pay 92k for a truck that is priced at 65K just because of interest.
I pay interest on my mortgage because I don’t have that kind of cash laying around, but I won’t pay it on anything else. Stupid to give your money to someone else for doing nothing, you work hard for your money so why they fuck would you hand it over to someone else for nothing? </p>
<p>Oh and the save for a rainy day thing, I was able to drop 875 dollars on a new furnace part and labor a week before Christmas without even feeling it in my day to day life...... how many millennials can say that?
875 bucks a week before Christmas would cripple a lot of households for many weeks or months. </p>
<p>Learn to save and learn to make your money work for you, quit making it work for credit card companies and finance companies just so you can have something immediately. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m a field level employee. Probably never be more than a foreman. My hands get dirty every day, I have to work shift work, but it’s a job that is recession proof and it’s manual labor a lot of the time. The money’s good, and the work isn’t going anywhere. </p></div>		</li>
