			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a big thing in most diarrheal diseases. You die from dehydration and loss of certain ions. There is a super cheap treatment that is basically half a mushed banana in one litre of boiled water with a tablespoon of salt - to replace the water and key ions. I imagine a similar drink could be used here without the salt</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are other important salts than NaCl, like potassium chloride. It's common among endurance athletes to consume salt tablets to replace salt lost from sweat but this is often a bit misguided since few athletes know what their sweat rate is. Beyond that, we lose sodium and chloride (and potassium etc) at different rates so you can still end up with too much or too little.</p>
<p>On a related note, excessive hydration can be super dangerous if you aren't replenishing what is lost. It's not unheard of for very slow marathoners to die or be rushed to medical for hyponatremia because they drink water at every aid station over 6+ hours but never take in any salt.</p></div>		</li>
