			<div class="markdown"><p>since this has been a point of confusion for like half the people i know, including myself, i feel honor-bound to point out that viscosity is resistance to flow. a more viscous liquid flows slower than a less viscous one. almost everything becomes more viscous as it cools. honey is more viscous than water.</p>
<p>edit: you on it. remember, kids, more viscous means more thickness. donâ€™t be like me, pass that middle school chem test</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also &quot;high viscosity&quot; means slower flowing since a higher viscosity timing or poise rating means that it's a thicker fluid. &quot;Low viscosity&quot; means it's thinner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By the way, the standing time when pulling anything out of the oven is actually part of the recipe for this very reason. Not all of the cooking magic happens inside the oven, some of it happens after! Time is just as much an ingredient as anything else. Too much or too little at any stage can break your recipe</p></div>		</li>
