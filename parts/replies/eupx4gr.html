			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have an internal monologue. I only know they exist from discussions like this on the internet. I've had people describe theirs to me, and I just don't have anything like that.</p>
<p>I can choose to have an imaginary conversation in my head if I want to rehearse something I'm going to say, or win a past argument that I actually lost, or practise explaining something to be sure I understand it properly, but I don't think that's the same thing. Many people describe a stream-of-consciousness or constant narration of what they're doing / looking at. Often they say it's something they struggle to silence. That's just not there for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you can have a conversation in your head then you’re pretty much like everyone else. I’ve never heard anyone say their internal monologue is constant. It’s not like looking at a tv and hearing in your head “tv...tv...tv...tv...”</p></div>		</li>
