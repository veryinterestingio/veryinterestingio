			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably easier to tell you the worst times.</p>
<p>First thing in the morning.  Anytime on Monday.  First day of the month.  Last day of the month.  Lunchtime.</p>
<p>Other times will generally be better.  If the place you're calling is open 24/7 then calling late at night will generally get you straight through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>5 minutes wait time sounds insane, when I worked in a call centre anything more than 2 had unacceptable levels of people dropping out of the queue.</p>
<p>Edit: can also confirm it was not a great working environment. We'd get written up for not logging in and out of our phones exactly on out scheduled breaks. Even if we were on a call.</p></div>		</li>
