			<div class="markdown"><p>Every condiments dispensing apparatus is special in it's own way, the mustard bottle he is referring to is extra special. Two seperate peices of plastic the out side screws a quarter turn open or closed, allowing the mustard to envelope the central framework of the system, and when closed the central framework/ base sticks out of the dispensing hole of the outer/twist peice.</p>
<p>As opposed to a hinged cap covering a hole like many other condiments</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a brand where all sauces have a nozzle like that.  Then there are other mustard brands that come in jars.  Sauces that come in glass bottles with metal caps.  Sauces that have a hinged cap.  Sauces that have a screw on plastic cap.  I think this question must be very regional.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The upside down bottles are only pretty new in Australia (at least where I am). The twist up nozzle is by far more common, for tomato sauce (ketchup) and bbq sauce.  Upside down is getting more popular for mayo or pizza sauce though</p></div>		</li>
