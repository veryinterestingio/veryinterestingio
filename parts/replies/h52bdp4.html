<p>Yes, if you start falling at the platform in NYC, using nothing but gravity to accelerate you, then in the absence of friction you‚Äôd come to a stop precisely at the platform in LA. If you don‚Äôt apply the brakes when you arrive, you start falling back, coming to a stop precisely at the platform in NYC. Repeat <em>ad infinitum</em>, because you‚Äôre effectively orbiting <em>inside</em> the Earth.</p>
<p>Fun fact: The trip will take roughly 40 minutes. If you dig another tunnel from LA to Tokyo and put a train in it, the trip between those two cities will take‚Ä¶ roughly 40 minutes. Cut out the stopover by digging a tunnel from NYC to Tokyo, put a train in <em>that</em>, and the trip will take‚Ä¶ roughly 40 minutes.</p>
<p>In fact, dig a straight tunnel which connects any two points in the surface of the Earth and a gravity train trip will take the same 40ish minutes regardless of how close or how far apart the endpoints or the tunnel are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obviously this is in the theoretical absence of air or friction,(although isn't that what a hyperloop train is supposed to do?) but wouldn't that mean the train is going <em>thousands</em> of mph at the bottom?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd just have to add enough force to cancel out the frictional forces, which is at least much less force than getting there without the aid of gravity at anywhere close to similar speeds. </p>
<p>And yes, you'd be going pretty fast. If you passed through the center of the earth, your <em>average</em> velocity on the way to the center would be something like 6 thousand miles per hour. Luckily your acceleration never goes above 1G, so it wouldn't be dangerous assuming the vehicle can handle those speeds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;gravity&quot; train will accelerate at 9.8 m/s squared. You would feel weightless while it is accelerating, as you would be falling with the train. Half way in transit, the train would start to slow down, and I think you'd still feel weightless?? Because you would be slowing down at the same rate as the train?? But you would feel earth's gravity behind you? Not sure how this would feel, aka amount of gs put on your body.</p>
<p>The &quot;hyperloop&quot; train proposed by NOT Elon Musk (he just stole the mag-lev vacuum train) attempts to eliminate all of the standard friction by removing all air and making the train &quot;contactless&quot; with the ground. Problem is, creating and maintaining a vacuum is, and I don't mean this lightly, extremely difficult. Any hyper loop built would be the biggest vacuum chamber on earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A sketch of the proof is that for a sphere of uniform density (which isn't actually true for the Earth), the force of gravity inside the sphere is proportional to the distance from the center. This gives us the well known differential equation for a harmonic oscillator. An important property of harmonic oscillators is that the oscillation period does not depend on the starting amplitude (in this case, amplitude is the distance from the center). This is why the period of a pendulum does not depend on where you start the pendulum, because pendulum are (up to an approximation) also harmonic oscillators.</p>
<p>What this gives us so far is that if you have a tube through the center of the sphere and were to drop a ball from somewhere in the tube, the time it would take the ball to return to the starting point does not depend on where you drop it from.</p>
<p>To prove that this is true for any straight line through the sphere (a chord) we define two axes, one parallel to our chord (call it the X-axis) and one perpendicular to it (call it the Y-axis). We want to prove that the force of gravity along the X-axis depends only on the X coordinate, and not on the Y coordinate: Write out the force of gravity at some position as a vector, and decompose that vector into the X and Y components using the Pythagorean theorem. You will get that the force of gravity is (-gx, -gy).</p>
<p>Once we have proved this, we can consider another hypothetical straight line that starts at the same point but passes through the center. Now consider dropping two balls, one through each tube, starting from the same X coordinate. We already know that the ball that goes through the center of the earth takes a certain amount of time to return to the start, and that time does not depend on where we drop it from. Now consider the second ball, because it has the same X coordinate as the first ball it must experience the same force in the X axis. This means it will also have the same X velocity, and therefore the same X position as the first ball after some amount of time. In fact, after <em>any</em> amount of time the second ball must have the same X position as the first ball. But since the first ball has a constant period, the second ball must also have the same constant period.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That‚Äôs an interesting question, and I hadn‚Äôt thought about it until now!</p>
<p>The short answer is: yes. The slightly longer answer is that it depends. If the tunnel goes through the center of the Earth, it just looks and feels like a hole straight down. It will look and feel like that until you get to the center, at which point it looks and feels like a hole straight up.</p>
<p>For any other tunnel, well, think of it like this. ‚ÄúDown‚Äù very generally means ‚Äútoward the center of mass of the Earth‚Äù. On the surface that‚Äôs straight‚Ä¶ down. (Sorry for the circular definition.) A tunnel that doesn‚Äôt pass through the center of the Earth will be at a some angle off ‚Äúvertical‚Äù, and that‚Äôs the degree of ‚Äústeepness‚Äù. But now consider when you‚Äôve gone halfway through the tunnel, you‚Äôre closest to Earth‚Äôs center of mass, and the line between you and it is perpendicular to the tunnel. At that point, the tunnel feels level with no ‚Äústeepness‚Äù. Then it starts to get steeper as you move to the other end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>So, from the perspective of someone traversing the tunnel, you fall steeply, then level off, then rise steeply. It feels like you‚Äôre following an arc, but you‚Äôre moving in a straight line. It‚Äôs the pull of gravity that is shifting, not you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How severe an angle would the tunnel be at in relation to a tunnel/hole going straight down to the center of the Earth? I can't imagine it would be much more severe than a steep hill (maybe not even that steep), going from LA to NYC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>About 0.3141 degrees.</p>
<p>The easiest way for me to figure this out was to use half the distance between the cities:</p>
<p>The radius line from one of the cities to the Earth's center will be at a 90 degree angle to the surface at the surface.</p>
<p>The line from the halfway point to the Earth's center forms a 90 degree angle to the tunnel where they meet.</p>
<p>The distance from that point to the first city is D/2 = R*sin(theta), and we need to find theta, the angle between the radius line from the city to the line at the midpoint, measured at the Earth's center. </p>
<p>Using trigonometry, theta = arcsin(D/2R)</p>
<p>From geometry, the interior angles of this triangle we've made sum to 180 degrees.  We know one of them is 90 degrees, so the angle of the tunnel at the city's surface (either end) is:</p>
<p>180 - 90 - arcsin(D/2R) </p>
<p>and, using the numbers from my earlier reply:</p>
<p>180 - 90 - arcsin(2446/(2*3959)) = 0.3141 (approx)</p>
<p>Finally, we know that the radius from the Earth's center to the city is perpendicular to the surface at the city,  so the angle between that radius and the tunnel is also about 0.3141, by similarity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>a fun physics problem is called the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_train" target="_blank">gravity train</a>.&quot; Assuming the tunnel is frictionless and the planet is a uniformly dense spherere, how long would it take an object to move from one end of the tunnel to the other just by gravity? </p>
<p>What about a tunnel straight through the middle?  </p>
<p>What if the planet was a different size?</p>
