			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that just how memories work? Memories aren't hard coded into our brains, instead memories are pathways the electricity in your brain takes, if that makes sense. Its why repetition is a form of memorization, if you repeat A B C, over and over, when you hear A you automatically think B which triggers C. </p>
<p>When you get a song stuck in your head, it's like hearing B, thinking C but knowing that's not the whole sequence but there's nothing to trigger A so you just repeat B C over and over, trying to remember what comes next.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, memories don't work that way. If you think of your mom, do you then think of your dad and then of your mom in an infinite loop with music and rhythm until you see them?</p>
<p>Also the stuff you're saying about pathways and &quot;hard coded&quot; is pretty nonsensical and self contradictory so I don't know why I'm even trying to discuss with you</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a feature of how the human brain responds to auditory/verbal cues as they enter our working memory.</p>
<p>Neurological researchers are still trying to identify the neural pathways in the earworm occurrence. There is a concept being explored called the phonological looping model of working memory.  This is a model of how short-term storage of auditory information is processed in the brain. This model suggests that the phonological store is akin to an “inner ear” that holds information for an extremely short duration. Spoken words are thought to directly enter the phonological store.  By capturing phonological input, the brain stores traces of auditory information through the process of articulatory rehearsal. Articulatory rehearsal means that we use our inner voice (or subvocalization) associated with generation of speech to repeat the auditory inputs that entered our phonological store. Like a phone number you are trying to remember when you can't write it down. To avoid forgetting the digits, you repeat them over-and-over using articulatory rehearsal.</p>
<p>So when a song is stuck in our head, we are repeating it with articulatory rehearsal. Something about that song, as a result of its melody, lyrics, emotion, has excited the brain into giving it attention, and less effort is needed to keep it in the phonological loop than a phone number.  For this reason, the song stays stuck on repeat by overtaking part of your working memory.  Until the articulatory rehearsal is disrupted, the song will likely continue repeating.</p></div>		</li>
