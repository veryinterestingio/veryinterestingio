			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be a silly question, but I wonder, where does the comet's ice come from? Actual water already present, some gas that condensed somehow, or another scenario? Could said ice be replenished during the next cycle?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ice that's already present. There's a whole lot of potentially cometary bodies, many of which are water ice or frozen CO2 mixed with dust and rock, in the &quot;Oort Cloud&quot;, a gigantic loose mesh of extraplanetary bodies outside of Pluto's orbit, many of them billions of years old. It's like a bigger, sparser asteroid belt, way further out. Every once in a while something disturbs the orbit of one of them and sends it into the inner solar system.</p>
<p>There were a lot more comets when the solar system was younger. Jupiter's gravuty well helped clean 'em up.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>And the asteroid belt is <em>already</em> super sparse. Science fiction has lied to us. The density of matter in the asteroid belt is about 1kg per <em>cubic kilometer</em> of volume. In other words, imagine a brick somewhere in a small town, but it could be up to 1km in the air. The rest is empty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This just brought up a (probably very stupid) question in my mind. Is the asteroid belt an actual belt, or is it like a &quot;sphere&quot;? If it's a belt, what's stopping it from being spherical in shape? I imagine if a belt can form, another belt can form perpendicular to that, and then at 45* and so on. Does the rotation of the sun cause everything in our solar system to orbit on the same plane?</p>
<p>I took medicine for my cold about an hour ago and I'm about to fall asleep so these questions may be stupid and make no sense, but just got me curious...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The gist is that when the solar system was formed, it formed from a huge gas-cloud left over from the previous star's supernova and/or red-giant expansion.<br />
So a huge HUGE cloud of hydrogen, oxygen and a bunch of other elements, with vast quantities of dust, mostly iron-based.<br />
The lighter elements, mostly hydrogen and oxygen, got pushed out by the solar wind of the forming Sun. These coalesced into the gas-giants (which is why Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are all outer planets and all gas-giants) and some of it formed water-ice. Most of that water-ice was formed out well beyond the edge of the solar system in the Kuiper Belt and Oort cloud. Forming a cometary halo.<br />
So there's actually millions or billions of tons of ice just floating out far beyond pluto.  </p>
<p>That's where most comets come from. A chunk of that ice gets disturbed by the orbits of (typically) jupiter or saturn and it falls in-system. Keep in mind that the orbital velocities of those chunks of ice are maybe 200m/s, rather than the thousands that things in the inner solar system have.<br />
So it doesn't take much to disturb them.<br />
That said, the orbits of those chunks of ice can range from decades to millions of years in length.<br />
So there are comets we might literally only ever see once because the last time they were here we hadn't evolved..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to point out, water molecules and many other volatiles can solidify beyond the so called frost line, which is closer to the sun than the orbit of Jupiter. But most of the stuff in that region got disturbed by the giant planets, either colliding with them, or getting swung towards the inner or outer solar system.</p></div>		</li>
