			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, 100% learned. At around 13 months my kid learned this angry grunt I do when I'm frustrated, it's nice since when ever I could be getting angry he makes me laugh with his little grunts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm the kind of guy who bottles things up, I'm trying to be very conscious about venting in productice ways (gym &amp; rugby), but I know it's impossible to spend the next 18 years without getting really angry at the poor kid. I'll try to focus on calming down quickly and apologizing, and to teach him it's okay to have strong emotions, but that does not excuse poor behaviour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have the same struggle as a parent — but one thing that may make it easier — try a little less hard to mask your anger (definitely try to address your instinct) but show your child that after you do get angry, you calm down and you realize that you made a mistake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't learn to roll my eyes until I was maybe 6. I was showing my grandmother how many times I could roll my eyes round and round to make myself dizzy and she told me not to roll my eyes because it was an ugly thing to do when I was annoyed at someone. So I tried doing it when I felt annoyed and I suppose it must have taken after some time. So really... if my grandmother hadn't said anything I wouldn't have known for a good time the real intention of eye rolling.</p></div>		</li>
