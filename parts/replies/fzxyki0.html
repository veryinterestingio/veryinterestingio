<p>Some countries are moving away from censuses towards administrative records, but they will only do that when coverage of those records is good enough to approximate what a census would have found. </p>

<p>Interesting, in NL we did a census till 1971. There was a bit of an uproar there and at the next census the expected non-response rate was 26%, so they just stopped doing them. Since then we use proxy method plus reasonably accurate administrative data.</p>

<p>Could corruption be actively distorting estimates of population? Maybe. As noted above, population counts are important to policy. Politicians from a particular area have an incentive to make that area look as populous as possible in order to get more power/money out of the national government. </p>

<p>The famine in China was caused by people at all level fudging the statistics causing the leaders to think there was a lot more food than there actually was. So the leaders sold it, and then there was a shortage.</p>
<p>Bad statistics kill people. Even dictators know this.</p></div>		</li>
