			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation. The way I’ve always made iced coffee at home is to brew some double strength coffee and then immediately dilute it by adding the same volume of ice. That cools it down quickly and gets you back to regular strength coffee.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can buy various coffee oil products, it is put into some high end beauty products.</p>
<p>It is however very expensive because of the complexity of capturing them and the demand for their use (back into the coffee it was taken from). It's a decade since I worked in coffee engineering but back then we reckoned a barrel of coffee oil was worth around £20,000.</p>
<p>Edit: As just an example, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/NATURAL-Pressed-Cracked-Psoriasis-Conditions/dp/B01M3P8J1E/ref=pd_lpo_121_t_2/257-0573439-2785810?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B01M7OZG9G&amp;pd_rd_r=08cc65a7-70ae-4cb6-8742-2ba8e05030f3&amp;pd_rd_w=FIvf2&amp;pd_rd_wg=X3bsM&amp;pf_rd_p=3366510f-1771-44b5-99e2-20c1889506ac&amp;pf_rd_r=VXS46SYQWZ8KX3M9YPSD&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=VXS46SYQWZ8KX3M9YPSD" target="_blank">here</a> is a coffee oil extract. Now obviously price doesn't scale like this but that is roughly £110k for a 55 gallon oil drum of the stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always brew iced coffee like this. Cold brew methods taste bland to me, exactly because of the chemistry detailed above. </p>
<p>If you let coffee sit out, those oils go stale and/or evaporate over time. That's why it tastes bad. </p>
<p>If you hot-brew, cover, and chill ASAP, you just get &quot;coffee, but cold.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The jar retains the original flavour of the coffee? I'm surprised that it doesn't just dissipate the second you open the lid. Maybe the pressure within the jar slows the evaporation process? I can't imagine the oils would evaporate out of the coffee then somehow be reincorporated...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've done both without any problems, although I would let it sit at room temp for at least a little while first if for no other reason than to reduce the load on the fridge. Personally, I usually just leave it on the counter because I prefer it to be room temp rather than ice cold.</p></div>		</li>
