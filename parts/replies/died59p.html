<p>When you first hear a loud constant noise (say, roadworks outside) it bothers you - but after a while you stop noticing it, because the central executive registers it</p>

<p>Although if you have ADHD, this doesn't happen, and you end up compelled to go investigate your distraction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes this is probably true to varying degrees for those with ADHD. I have ADHD and while I CAN filter out noise, it won't stay filtered out for as long as I need it. When it &quot;comes back&quot; it's like it's a new noise. Well, it FEELS new even if I know it isn't at least. When something like this distracts me it helps to take a quick peek and see what's the cause (if I can), verbally acknowledge it (&quot;Huh. Guess the neighbors are having that old tree taken down,&quot; I say to no one), and then turn back to my work and say something like, &quot;Now back to studying.&quot; That usually helps somewhat.</p>
<p>The trick is to not start day dreaming about why the tree is being cut down, or memories you have of climbing trees as a kid, or wondering if their kids climbed that tree,or what size it was when they moved in, or when that was anyway, and what did the rest of the neighborhood look like then, isn't their some Google Maps historical aerial views thing? Better Google it. Oh I wonder what my old neighborhood looked like. Hey there's our old swimming pool! Should we get a swimming pool? I wonder how much it would cost. When did my wife say she'd be home again? Okay what was I working on. Oh I better get something to eat it's already 3 and I barely ate breakfast. Shit we are almost out of bread. Ok. Now. What was I working on? I'm not sure. I better unload the dishwasher. Oh look someone replied to me on reddit! I'm just gonna check it and then back to housework... </p>
<p>Adderall helps...  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Talking out loud definitely helps.</p></div>		</li>
