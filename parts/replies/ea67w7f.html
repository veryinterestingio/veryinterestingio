			<div class="markdown"><p>That would describe a &quot;neutral buoyancy&quot; gas.  A lifting gas at that altitude would support some weight besides its own.  In fact, it would require ballast just to keep from rising above that altitude.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>because normal air is less dense than venus's atmosphere (at ground level), it would naturally float up to that 50KM point similar to how helium will float in our atmosphere </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Venus' atmosphere is mostly CO2, which is denser than nitrogen or oxygen, the main components of an Earth atmophere. As such, a bubble of oxygen+nitrogen would float upwards in Venus' atmosphere (even though both are the same pressure).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost, although Bespin appeared to have breathable air at that altitude, and this suggests that we'd need assistance in that regard, as well as some extra layers of clothing.  So, almost more like a Bespin/Star-Lord (from GotG) situation, if you may allow me to mix fantasy universes.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Venus's atmosphere is largely CO2 with 3.5% N. Not only is it not breathable, but the the 150ppm of SO2 is an issue. SO2 at 150ppm just so happens to be considered the lethal amount at a 10-15 minute exposure. At 50KM, you wont need a pressure suit, and perhaps not even a jacket, but your going to need a pretty good chemical suit.</p>
<p>Edit;</p>
<p>I should also mention, that direct exposure to an atmosphere of 96.5% CO2 would also kill you, due to absorption through the skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Confused why people keep talking about the extra clothing, unless they're saying relative to perfect weather in highly populated places on Earth? 50 degrees Celsius certainly wouldn't require extra clothing (unless you mean a cooling suit), and people regularly function in well below 0 degrees Celsius. The latter requires extra layers, but again, it seems like people are implying it would be more cumbersome than that? Correct me if I'm wrong though</p></div>		</li>
