			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming that only Cs-137 is the impurity here for this question, it looks like the radioactive impurity must decay by a factor of a million... using a 30 year half-life, it would require around 20 half lives, or 600 years. I'm sure there are a lot of other factors to be considered though, I'm just an interested layman</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your math is correct, but the assumption is maybe a bit wrong. You're looking at the time to go from 8N to 14N, which is indeed about 600 years. But an ingot of iron with 8N and only impurity Cs-137 would be actually quite radioactive and somewhat dangerous. (0.3 millicuries)</p>
<p>In reality, the contamination of a random object from testing fallout is quite small you might only have maybe a couple 10s of Bq activity. The point I raised isn't that we have to go from 8N to 14N, it's that we can't do better than 8N, so we can't take (for instance) 12N to 14N or even higher (for especially sensitive tests, like trying to establish lower bounds on certain half-lives, you'll want your background as low as possible, and one decay every hour is still too much).</p>
<p>It all hinges on the desired sensitivity an initial contamination though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Looking at bomb contents they seem to range from 14 minutes to 7000 years, but I'm not sure if any others are produced at detonation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most fission product isotopes have short half-lives. The transuranic elements have the super long half-lives (as well as long decay chains).</p>
<p>Thankfully, the amount of transuranics in fallout is actually quite small. Transuranics are generally caused by neutron capture, which is less likely at higher neutron energies (which are where fission occurs in a bomb due to lack of moderator) and because most of the problematic transuranics require several captures in succession, which isn't going to happen over the course of an explosion, but happens easily over the course of many months in a reactor.</p>
<p>There are exceptions to the rule of thumb about half-lives, for instance Tc-99 is the most notable, having a long half-life somewhere above 100k years (I don't recall the exact value off of the top of my head). But for the most part, we should be good in 300 years or so (which is incidentally how long nuclear waste would be dangerous if we reprocessed and recycled it), if we don't keep exploding weapons. (I'm looking at you, DPRK.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>A great many reddit posts fit this same description.</p>

<p>The internet shall metastasize it's poisons.</p>
<p>Okay, alcohol-fueled jokes aside, can the consequences of nuclear fallout be accounted for an adjusted for using modern materials? I ask because the pre-atomic era wasn't &quot;perfect&quot; either, so clearly there must have been some set of benchmarks by which the characteristics needed for these materials was initially gauged... which suggests to me that we merely need to re-calibrate our technology. Or would that be too expensive or &quot;too hard&quot; or something?</p>

<p>The dark matter experiments need to purify other materials already, as you can't get things like xenon from historic sources. XENON1T purified their xenon to have an activity below 20 μBq/kg. Yes, that's microbecquerel. XENONnT will purify it even more, and DARWIN will make that level look like nuclear waste in comparison (they aim at 0.1 μBq/kg - that's one decay per kg and 4 months).</p>

<p>Yeah, sorry, I clarified further down.</p>

<p>Wow! How do they isotopically separate to that degree? Are they still using gas centrifuges? <del>They can't just wait out the decay of Xe-136, (but then again, it has a really long half-life, so maybe it's not necessary?)</del> They're also looking for the neutrinoless decay of Xe-136. This is awesome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lifetime of xenon-136 is long and its decay energy is low enough to make that not a big issue (and if it does neutrinoless beta decay then that is a signal on its own). The main problems are radon-222 and krypton-85. The latter is one of the issues with steel as well. Distillation mainly.</p></div>		</li>
