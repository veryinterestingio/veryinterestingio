			<div class="markdown"><p>The white is just sebum. Sebum is white. Sebum that oxidizes turns yellow/black. Hair follicles have only extremely small muscle tissues that are involved in goosebumps, or making your hair &quot;stand on end.&quot; This function is a vestigial function from our much harrier ancestors that would &quot;poof out&quot; the hair to make you look bigger. These muscles are incapable of pushing anything out of a follicle. Pimples that do have immune responses are pustules -- big, yellow, angry. The pus inside a pustule is partly the dead remains of white blood cells.</p></div>		</li>
