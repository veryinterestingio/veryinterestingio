<p>This where the mycelia (made up of hyphae) connect with plant structures.</p>
<p><em>Many</em> species of fungus form mycorrhizal associations, not just a specific type.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not exactly related, but even plants have a microbiome of sorts.</p>

<p>No need for the &quot;of sorts&quot; qualifier! Plants definitely have microbiomes. It's not just mycorrhiza; tons of different bacteria, archaea and fungi live both on and inside a plant. Like with the human microbiome, some of these microbes are parasitic; some are symbiotic; and some have no particular effect on the plant.</p>

<p>It is suspected even mitochondria started as a prokaryotic/bacterial symbiont</p>

<p>I'd say this was upgraded from &quot;suspected&quot; to an accepted fact within the last couple decades. Mitochondria can even be placed on the bacterial family tree using DNA analysis (they appear to have evolved from the group known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphaproteobacteria#cite_note-Ferla2013-7" target="_blank">alphaproteobacteria</a>).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Terminology nitpick: a parasitic relation is a form of symbiosis. Symbiotic relationships that are beneficial to both are called mutualistic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not op, but here's a good Wikipedia article regarding the endosymbiotic theory of mitochondria and chloroplasts!</p>
<p>Mitochondria can even assimilate DNA from other organisms other than their main &quot;host&quot; (for example, <em>Amborella</em>'s (an angiosperm) mitochondrial genome contains the full genomes of two mosses! <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0137532" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have a reference (learned this in college level bio) but chloroplasts have a similar story AND mitochondria have their own DNA, which we use to track some maternal genetics since sperm do not have mitochondria while eggs do</p></div>		</li>
