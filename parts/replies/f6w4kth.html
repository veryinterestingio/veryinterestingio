			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello, this is Adam. This is a great question. As one example of dietary supplements having shown clear health benefits, the National Institutes of Health sponsored a major study with almost 4,800 adults (2001) called the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), which looked at the effects of a dietary supplement on the progression of Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), and a second study (2013), Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2), which tested changes to this dietary supplement. More than 4,000 people aged 50-85 years participated in AREDS2.</p>
<ul>
<li>AREDS showed that a dietary supplement containing high doses of vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, zinc, and copper can help slow the progression of AMD.</li>
<li>AREDS2 investigated several modifications of the original AREDS supplement formula in people with AMD who were at risk for progressing to the advanced stage of the disease. The results of this study showed that: </li>
<li>Adding omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil) did not improve the effectiveness of the supplement combination.</li>
<li>Reducing the amount of zinc from the supplement combination did not decrease its effectiveness.</li>
<li>People who took beta-carotene were more likely to develop lung cancer compared with people who took lutein and zeaxanthin. At least half of AREDS2 participants were current or former smokers.</li>
<li>Adding lutein and zeaxanthin (two carotenoids found in the eye) to the supplement combination improved its effectiveness in people who consumed only small amounts of lutein and zeaxanthin in foods. The results also suggested that substituting lutein and zeaxanthin for beta-carotene might improve the supplement combination.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to investigating the claimed health outcomes of a dietary ingredient or supplement product, there is also the important consideration of testing to be sure supplement products are meeting their label claims, meaning whether they actually contain the amounts or percentages of the specific listed ingredients.  FDA regulations require manufacturers to analytically test their productsâ€™ contents, and there are also independent testing labs that administer certification programs, such as the United States Pharmacopeia (<a href="https://www.quality-supplements.org/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.quality-supplements.org/" target="_blank">https://www.quality-supplements.org/</a></a>), NSF International (<a href="http://www.nsf.org/consumer-resources/health-beauty/supplements-vitamins/supplement-vitamin-certification" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.nsf.org/consumer-resources/health-beauty/supplements-vitamins/supplement-vitamin-certification" target="_blank">http://www.nsf.org/consumer-resources/health-beauty/supplements-vitamins/supplement-vitamin-certification</a></a>) and ConsumerLab.com (<a href="https://www.consumerlab.com/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.consumerlab.com/" target="_blank">https://www.consumerlab.com/</a></a>).</p></div>		</li>
