			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually think it has more to do with the amount of water. Myth busters did an episode showing a tiny layer of water could protect a hot dog from molten lead. In that case there is more than enough heat energy to instantly evaporate the water. But with a lot of water in an oven mitt, it doesn’t evaporate it all into a layer, so you get transfer instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it does - the sound you hear when you put out a candle with wet fingers <em>is</em> water boiling.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter that the amount of energy is small - if the surface temperature is high enough some amount of water in the boundary layer is going to boil. Dispersing the thermal energy away from the boundary isn't an instantaneous process.</p>
<p>If you throw a a hot pebble into the sea the boundary around it will boil for a brief moment until the energy transfer through the boundary is no longer large enough to get water to boiling temperatures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Though there's a lot of heat in a deep fryer vat. A coworker used to show off by wetting his hand and quickly submerging it and pulling it back out and I could never bring myself to do it lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is an unrelated effect called the leidenfrost effect.</p>
<p>Essentially the water on the skin quickly evaporates to create a kind of insulating vapor glove.</p>
<p>The same can be done in liquid lead or liquid nitrogen. </p>
<p>The temperature difference must be very large for it to work well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>is the candle example not just a very small scale application of the leidenfrost effect?</p></div>		</li>
