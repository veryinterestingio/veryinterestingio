			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything needs a food web, and food webs start at the bottom with food producers that take energy and convert it directly into food. Everything else gets energy by eating those or eating something that eats those or eating something that eats something....</p>
<p>The abyssal planes are far too deep for sunlight to penetrate, so there's no light energy for anything to convert into food. There are sometimes hydrothermal vents spewing heat and chemicals up from underneath the sea floor, and those are the basis for some food webs. But for most of the abyssal planes, the only source of energy is whatever falls down from organisms dying or pooping in the zones where there <em>is</em> sunlight to feed a vast food web.</p>
<p>The other problem is access to nutrients like calcium, phosphorous, and other minerals. Those normally come from the soil or substrate, but out in the open ocean that substrate is <em>way</em> far down. Even with all the sunlight in the world, without those minerals the producers can't really do anything with that energy and can't make food. Reefs grow where it's shallow enough for waves to lift and circulate the substrate so the minerals get mixed into the water column, making them accessible to free-floating plankton and spreading them around for the sessile corals and macroalgaes. That means there's less of a limit and those producers can actually use more of the sunlight.</p>
<p>All of that means there's a lot less food available out in the open ocean, which means there's even less food falling down to the abyssal plane. And at least the food stops falling when it hits the bottom, so it can accumulate somewhat. In the bathypelagic zone - where it's too deep for sunlight but still far above the ocean floor - there's a whole lot of nothing, so it's very difficult for life to survive. Life does, of course, survive there, but the food web isn't robust enough to support large populations.</p></div>		</li>
