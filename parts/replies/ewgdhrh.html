			<div class="markdown"><p>Our bodies have a very complex system of coagulation that detect any cut thanks to chemical signals released in case of a cut, and then &quot;clog&quot; up the cut (forming the red &quot;crust&quot; over your wounds) by using the cells in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Then they indeed regrow back, as the cells forming the vessels divide and regrow back to ensure normal function.</p>
<p>The problem is that this system has its limits and the flow of blood in each capillary is tiny compared to an artery or vein. So it can't easily work on larger cur with larger vessels, leading to death by hypovolemia (not enough blood in the body)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In reality the &quot;crust&quot; and scabs are dried up blood and parts of the body's non-immediate response. Along with vasoconstriction, it's really the platelets that clog up cuts. You notice that when you get a cut, it bleeds for a few moments and then stops bleeding, even though the wound still looks open.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to that the chemicals also cause the affected vessels to “close up”(vasoconstriction), further preventing blood loss.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is another incidental method there, though.  Because blood vessels are kinda springy, they end up pulling back into the flesh of a severed limb... which (combined with the natural &quot;grab the thing that hurts&quot; response) can physically squeeze the vessel closed to prevent catastrophic blood loss while clotting and other repair mechanisms kick in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about your body like a giant water tank. 1,000 gallons. </p>
<p>An artery is like an 18-inch diameter pipe coming out of it. If that gets cut, LOTS of water is going to come out very fast. You can patch it, but only if you've got pretty specialized equipment. And the problem is if 100 gallons per minute are leaving through the hole, you've only got 10 minutes before the tank is empty. In 1 short minute you've lost 10% of your blood!</p>
<p>But most of your blood vessels are more the size of a drinking straw or smaller. Imagine a leak of that size. It might take 5 minutes for a gallon to come through that straw, and it's not hard to block the flow completely. You've got 5,000 minutes to clog it up before the tank is empty. That's a small job.</p>
<p>That's more or less how it works. Your body can cause blood to coagulate and clog up vessels that are broken. But the bigger a vessel gets, the longer it takes to coagulate enough blood to slow the bleeding. Once the vessel's past a certain size, you simply don't have enough blood for coagulation to stop the bleeding before you die. This is exacerbated because the more blood you lose, the worse off your body is.</p>
<p>Why don't we clot faster? That can be bad too. Some people clot too fast. Sitting down for too long, like on an airplane trip, can cause the blood in their legs to pool and start to clot. That can clog their blood vessels and lead to death. Maybe those people could survive worse cuts to larger vessels without dying. But since &quot;sitting still&quot; is a safer activity than &quot;getting cut really badly&quot; it turns out that trait's pretty undesirable too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The smaller your blood vessels get, the more of them there are and therefore the greater the surface area of the vessels. It's a physics thing, but basically as they subdivide you get less and less pressure. When you cut smaller vessels, low pressure and small diameter makes them much easier to clot off and repair. Arterial bleeds are hard because the pressure there is so much higher, and any clot you form can easily get blown off.</p></div>		</li>
