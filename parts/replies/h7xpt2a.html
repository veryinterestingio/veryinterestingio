			<div class="markdown"><p>Silent to chew? Not quite sure about that one! Personally one of the main reasons I don't go to the cinema very often is the constant crunching sound around me in Dolby Surround. I don't think there's anything more annoying than the sound of people eating popcorn while you're trying to watch a movie. Seriously, I think buying popcorn at the cinema is disrespectful of the rest of the audience.</p></div>		</li>
