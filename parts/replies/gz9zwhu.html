			<div class="markdown"><p>I was also in a car accident as an early teen, in an old caddy. So the backseat was just lap belts, we hit a tree head on after hitting black ice. My brother broke his arm, my mom broke her nose and a cpl ribs bc she hit the steering wheel. But they both had chest straps as well.
I on the other hand was pretty jacked up. The lap belt, saved my life, but ripped my intestines so immediately started throwing up a lot of blood. In the ER the immediately put a nose tube/stomach pump in...I still have nightmares about that 25 yrs later....randomly.
I was in the hospital for a cpl weeks. And ended up going back 3 years later bc my intestines had closed off from scar tissues so I couldn‚Äôt eat/digest much food.
Thank god for modern medicine or more thank smart people...And thank Sweden who made the 3 point seat belt...Volvo I believe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obligatory mention that the original patent for insulin was given to companies for essentially free without even wanting royalty payments because of how life saving it is. Yet companies charge huge amount for it.</p>
<p>So double thank Volvo for sharing it <em>and</em> being smart enough to keep it as their own to protect the availability of it's free widespread use.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And yea this is why we put the tube down to drain. It doesn't always tell us where the bleeding is coming from, but tells us if it is stopping or not. Stopping is good. Not stopping bad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Am also a doctor. Can confirm this is right. A lot of the other posts (even the highest up voted ones) are inaccurate.</p>
<p>I'm specifically an ER doc. So I'd be the Dr this kid saw. Wouldn't pump stomach without good reason (like the ones mentioned here). There are risks to pumping stomach as well. Has to be weighed. My guess is it was #1 that got the stomach suctioned. </p>
<p>Iron toxicity definitely not anywhere on my list of concerns with this patient presentation.</p>
<p>Edit: TL;DR I concur.</p>
<p>I posted this after a night shift and damn my phone blew up. Thanks to all the Dr's for coming out to concur!</p></div>		</li>
