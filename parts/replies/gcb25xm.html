			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess is they would just accept it, relax as best they can and sleep it off. Most problems humans have with stuff like migraines is that we try to force ourselves to keep functioning, go to work or follow whatever other plans we had for the day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've wondered the same. My dog is notoriously independent (husky) and cat like- wants to be in the same room but don't look and definitely don't touch unless I give permission. So on random nights when I roll over and find huskybutt in my face so I can't breathe for the fluff, I immediately go to she must be feeling ill or something.<br />
But mostly I think she's just getting more cuddly as she ages out of puppyhood, which is nice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m a dog groomer. I don’t know if they have headaches, but they certainly do have off days. Sometimes it’s explainable by other factors but honestly, why wouldn’t dogs get headaches sometimes? Their brains are made of the same basic stuff ours are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure you're tired of constant requests for advice but I'll give it a shot since it's on topic. We have a 14 year old pit mix who looks like a skeleton wrapped in skin, she's mostly blind and suffering from dementia with most episodes at night. She's otherwise very healthy without any lung, heart or physical issues. Our vet said she's old as dirt but otherwise great considering her age. She eats normally, goes to the bathroom without issues and no accidents, moves up and down our stairs slow but fine, likes walks and mostly seems great during the day. </p>
<p>However, nearly every night she has an anxiety fueled freakout session where she whines, pants and paces around incessantly. Teeth chattering, confused and disconnected look on her face, runs into walls, digs at rugs or on the carpet constantly. It last anywhere from 2-6 hours. </p>
<p>Occasionally she'll just sleep through the night but it's rarer and rarer. We give her 200mg of trazodone twice a day but it's seemingly becoming less effective over time. Just curious if you have any insight on treatment or anything else we could try to make her nights better. We've tried the thunder coat and it didn't work, tried liquid melatonin, tried CBD.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not the vet you're replying to but I'm a veterinary nurse. You should definitely talk to your regular vet about these concerns. There are other medications that you could try instead of or in conjunction with Trazodone or your other supplements. In my experience, supplements like melatonin and CBD don't work well on their own. However, medications can have counterindications so your veterinarian would have the best insight into which kinds of medications are best for your pup.</p>
<p>As far as monitoring overall quality of life, one my favorite doctors to work with recommends owners make a list of their pet's 5 favorite things (playing, eating, greeting you at the door, etc). As long as they still do 3 of those 5 things, they're probably doing okay!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Older animals can sometimes get dementia similar to humans, and often “sundown” where symptoms are worse at night as well. It’s called Canine Cognitive Dysfunction. There’s an FDA-approved medication for dogs with this disease called Selegiline. It’s not super widely used and a lot of vets aren’t familiar with it so it might not come to mind, worth mentioning to them and having them look into it for you though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey no problem.</p>
<p>Rough. As animals age they face both cognitive decline but also decline in their perceptive faculties. It's a pretty nasty recipe that can result in them becoming very anxious. </p>
<p>In these guys we tend to do blood tests to check for an overactive thyroid (rare)  overactive adrenal glands (more common) and diabetes (common). If we find these diseases, we treat. </p>
<p>Medically, we don't have great treatments if it is cognitive decline and anxiety. Trazodine isn't too bad, and in some cases we'll look at antidepressants. Nutritionally, omega 3s (fish oil) may help these guys. Melotonin before bed isn't a bad idea. </p>
<p>Training wise, routine is very important. I'd consider attempting to crate train as it can provide a safe space. Leave lights on at night. Large fatty meal before bed to reduce cortisol. </p>
<p>Just some thoughts and good luck :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, I am going to call your credentials into question now. Anyone working in the veterinary field would recommend they speak to their regular veterinarian (as I did and another after me).</p>
<p>An Omega 3 fatty acid supplement and a &quot;large fatty meal before bed&quot; are very bad recommendations on a patient you're not familiar with. Both of those can cause some bad diarrhea and possible pancreatitis depending on the patient's medical history. u/Agent9262 please do not take this person's advice. Speak to your regular vet. They are either not a vet or not a vet you should trust. If you live in the US, I recommend an AAHA certified practice.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> To further call this person's credentials into question, Trazodone is so frequently prescribed, I can't imagine they'd ever spell it incorrectly. Also, Trazodone <em>is</em> an antidepressant (although we also use it as an anxiolytic). None of what they said adds up.</p></div>		</li>
