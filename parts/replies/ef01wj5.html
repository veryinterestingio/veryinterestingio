			<div class="markdown"><p>T-mobile basically didn't have very much 3G at all - as a company they <em>almost</em> skipped the 3G generation, mostly going straight from 2G to LTE.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the 3G plant they have came with the MetroPCS acquisition.</p>
<p>In my experience, if you happen to be in a territory where your signal goes from LTE to HSPA or UMTS (often displays as 4G/3G respectively), you're almost definitely roaming on AT&amp;T (Band 5/UMTS 850) rather than T-mobile natively. </p>
<p>Saw this as recently as last week in northern Michigan and the UP (which is otherwise being rapidly replaced with B71), however YMMV. I've also noticed in some coverage areas it doesn't work at all for no apparent reason - usually in areas where they <em>should</em> have coverage, but you're on the cusp of the coverage radius so even when your phone roams on to another provider there's zero actual working connectivity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd think, but I still get resellers making the mistake of importing devices from China without consulting me (or anyone else) on the specs first, and the devices are only just barely compatible with 3G (even on non-US networks).</p>
<p>Usually they are coming to us wanting to procure T-Mobile, but then I'll ask for the device specs and it will turn out they have zero LTE and only support WCDMA 850/2100, so they will only work with AT&amp;T in some but not all coverage areas. Some devices will have 1900MHz as well if they're lucky but it's rare. </p>
<p>Either way, they don't work on T-Mobile, and with AT&amp;T usually being about 30% more expensive it kicks the business model they thought they had right out the window (everyone thinks they're the first company coming to us with these ideas), but usually they've just gone on Alibaba or DHGate or whatever and thought to themselves &quot;oh I only have to order like 1,000 of these phones to get my logo embossed and startup animation in the firmware... sign me up!&quot;</p>
<p>This has happened twice in the last week alone, but usually at least a couple or 3 times a month.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Relative to their overall footprint, I'm not sure I would call it &quot;widespread&quot;, especially prior to the Metro acquisition, and relative to other carriers 3G footprints, they weren't even in the same ballpark.</p></div>		</li>
