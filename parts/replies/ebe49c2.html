			<div class="markdown"><p>Yet especially AI a.k.a. Machine Learning relies heavily on statistics. The pieces created by these algorithms predict melodies and sounds that are the most likely, based on its training sets or some other metric. So in the end it's still not the machine or function that decides the &quot;goodness&quot; of its creation. It is still humans who either through programming or data decide how &quot;well&quot; the machine does. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Statistics is one avenue of AI, but it is also being pursued through logic programming. Someone built a logic program called ANTON which composes musical scores, using rules derived from music theory. The rules of classical music theory were encoded into it, as well as some constraints as to how often it could break those rules (because most good music breaks rules), and it was able to produce some decent music.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AI =/= ML. AI is a term used for a whole broad slew of approaches to solving problems, usually using human proof or intuition to help with decision making. ML is a subset of AI wherein the computers fits a predictive algorithm to a dataset in order to predict similar outcomes in the same situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And most PhD mathematicians that I know write code use single character variable names that are impossible to follow, the first 3 always being x,y, and z. From there they seem to use what seems to be a random combination of letters with a random combination of capitalizing or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(Former) professional classical musician here. They have not composed any actual classical pieces, any more than a AI has written actual books. It might sound like classical music to someone that don't really understand classical music, but it lacks the cohesion, or structure, that makes it <em>a piece of music</em> and not <em>soundclips put together in a semi-random order</em>. </p>
<p>Classical music is like a language. One that can be appreachiated without understanding the nuances, but a language nonetheless. Professional artists can tell almost immediately that a piece was written by an AI, because you very quickly hit the &quot;well that phrase was pointless&quot;-point. You can recognize bits of known pieces, but they lack the setup and payoff that gives those bits meaning.</p>
<p>In well-composed classical pieces, all notes are connected; every note informes the others in some way. The artistic interpretative process is largely a question of choosing the finer details of your playing so that everything you play will make sense, reflect these patterns. In excelent music, you can find a way where details are consistent with the emotional or structural progression of the piece. This can elevate both the piece and your interpretation. In bad music the interpretation comes at the expense of the written piece, forced on top of it to make it more pallateble.</p></div>		</li>
