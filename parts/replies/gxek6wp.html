			<div class="markdown"><p>A friend of mine used a more modern version of one of those, it was neat.  It had a crank, and you could crank it while filming, but that you did was crank it up ahead of time and it wound up a spring like a music box or somthing, and that would let it go at constant speed for a minute or two.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, I'm pretty sure it was based off old as fuck cameras.  I mean, this was back in the 90s and the camera already looked like it was 30 years old.  And from looking at this history of cameras on wikipedia, it looks like this sort of thing was there almost from the beginning</p></div>		</li>

<p>The frame rates of the cameras were incredibly low and when played back on devices with a much faster frame rate, it speeds everything up.</p>

<p>Why not play them back on devices with the correct frame rate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In many cases, no-one knows the correct frame rate. Playback was hand-cranked as well, and up to the projectionist to make it look right.  </p>
<p>When transferred to new stock, the material was copied frame by frame.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So why not adjust the frame rate until it looks right, like the projectionist used to? We may no longer use hand-cranked projectors but we can still adjust the frame rate.</p></div>		</li>
