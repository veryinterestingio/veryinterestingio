			<div class="markdown"><p>The service brakes have their own separate chambers and use pressure to apply. Pressing the brake pedal does not release air from the park brakes, the park system gets left alone full of air whenever the park brake is released.  </p>
<p>The only time air is released from the park system by the foot pedal is in an emergency situation when the service brake system loses air but the park brake system still has pressure. Then the park brake modulator valve starts operating and releases park brake pressure when the foot pedal is pressed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect. The parking brake is a fail-closed brake as you described. The regular brake system that works when pushing down the pedal uses air pressure to apply the break instead of hydraulic fluid like a “regular car”.</p></div>		</li>
