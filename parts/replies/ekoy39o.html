			<div class="markdown"><p>Was gonna try to respond with a much more simplistic answer. But I feel as though there’s nothing left to say other then what’s been said. So out of curiosity, how did you get into meteorology? </p>
<p>I’m just a self proclaimed cloud nerd but would love to get some input from someone really in field on what it’s like</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure!</p>
<p>I’ve been interested in it since I was a kid; Hurricane Katrina was both terrifying and fascinating to me. There is so much complexity in the weather, and so many lives you can save with a good forecast.</p>
<p>I considered and was somewhat interested in maybe majoring in engineering etc, but after a hurricane hit my town (which is rare, since I grew up in the <em>northern</em> US) when I was in high school, I was sure I wanted to go into meteorology, so I applied to various colleges that had good programs for it, and now have my degree in it :)</p>
<p>Thanks for asking, and let me know if you have any more questions!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took an intro-level meteorology course in college (literally &quot;Intro Meteorology&quot;) and loved it. I'm a biology major (natural resources/conservation field) but weather and climate are two subjects that have always fascinated me, ever since I was 10 years old taking weather &quot;readings&quot; out in my backyard with a pencil and notebook. I always wanted to study climate in particular, but there's a catch: I'm horrendous at math. I even struggle with 100-level college algebra classes. If it weren't for that I'd have probably gone into meteorology. I'm working on my bachelor's and pre-calc is the highest math class I have to take, and I'm not anticipating a good time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s awesome! Good for you finding something you care about and makes a difference. If you don’t mind can I just ask like what you actually do? Like do you work for a government organization or more for like a media source?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So here’s a question I’ve always wanted to ask a meteorologist. What is the area used in the PoP calculation? I get it’s the confidence precipitation will occur somewhere in the area multiplied by the percent of the area that will get measurable precipitation. But what is the area used? Does it vary or is it standard?</p>
<p>For example when they say my town has a 50% PoP is that just the city limits? Is it the entire metro area? Or is it calculated at a point? I figure like 20-30 years ago the areas were larger but now using computers how has it changed? Are the areas smaller?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that’s a tricky one, and honestly I’m not entirely sure what the size of that area is, as it varies each time I think. For instance, let’s say you’re forecasting for a metro area, and you’re 80% sure there will be rain over the northern suburbs of your city, but only over 50% since they’re a bit scattered, then that would be a 40% POP over that area at any given time.</p>
<p>It’s rather general, so unless you’re forecasting for a point, we try to give you more information than a vague percentage, and to round to every 20% so it’s never an ambiguous 50% chance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! That’s kind of what I figured. The inevitable “it depends”. Haha. Although I never realized you tried to avoid 50%, but makes sense.</p></div>		</li>
