			<div class="markdown"><p>Your nerve cells all have axons, which send the signal, and dendrites, which receive the signal.  The end of the axons meet the dendrites of the next nerve that the current is going to. </p>
<p>When a stimulus occurs, it causes the axons to release a neurotransmitter that binds to the sodium and potassium pumps the line the membrane (wall of the dendrite, but technically animal cells don’t have walls.  They have membranes.) of the dendrite.  When the neurotransmitter binds, it opens the channels and allows sodium and potassium to flow back and forth between the space between the axon and dendrite, and the dendrite itself.  </p>
<p>The nerves are already polarized, so they must become depolarizer for an signal to be sent.  When the threshold is met, somewhere around -55 mV, the “electrical” impulse is sent.  The impulse occurs in the soma, the cell body of the nerve cell, and it the signal shoots down the axon to for the process to start all over again.  This will occur multiple times until the signal reaches the correct location. </p>
<p>Sometimes it can take one single nerve, and other times it can take five or six nerves.</p>
<p>Edit:  this is for any nerve cells in general, not just those in the brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything u/wormsblink said is correct.
But if you still are confused:
if it helps to know, the brain cells are not like wires. &quot;Electrical impulses&quot; as in &quot;flowing electrons&quot; do not travel down the axons and dendrites (brain cell tentacles)</p>
<p>Rather, it is a more abstract &quot;chain of influence&quot; that travels. Electrons only move from the inside to the outside when  discharging and vice versa when charging. When neurons discharge, the ions cause electrons to flow from the inside out. This causes the adjacent gated ion channels further down to open, making electrons flow out, which causes ones adjacent to those channels to open, which causes electrons to flow out, which causes channels next to those...</p>
<p>you get the idea.</p>
<p>point is, the critical thing you need to know is neurons have no wires. I like to think of them as &quot;resettable electron bombs&quot; that spew electrons outward when triggered.</p></div>		</li>
