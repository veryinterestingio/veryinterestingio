			<div class="markdown"><p>Most modern diesels will run just fine on stuff like vegetable oil or kerosene, with a bit of modification for the perfect ratio and such. </p>
<p>Here in Sweden we have a lot of busses that run on rape oil, and there's a place in Denmark where they'll clean out the engine and fill you up with rape oil, and you can come back and have them clean it out and go diesel again. I know a guy who goes there for work for a few weeks every now and then who runs on it while he's there. The biggest downside is that the entire car smells like popcorn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rape oil it is a relative of canola oil. Rapeseed is a type of plant similar to turnips and cabbage. Rapeseed oil was used as a fuel source for lighting and eventually for lubrication but was not considered suitable for human consumption until Canola was bred from multiple rapeseed varieties in the 70s. Canola is a trademark name for the rapeseed variants used for food. </p>
<p>Edit: I figured “rape oil” might be disconcerting for people unfamiliar with the term. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Leopard 2 at least used to have multifuel capability (being able to run on all sorts of substandard fuel, although it worked best with diesel) and it's a lot more fuel efficient than the Abrams (despite being almost as heavy).  </p>
<p>The main reason they chose a turbine for the the Abrams is because they envisioned a war in Siberia/Alaska, and the Turbine does have a much better cold start ability once temperatures start creeping below -30C.<br />
The Leopard 2 on the other hand was designed for a defensive war in Europe, where fuel efficiency (to the degree that it applies to a tank) and a lower heat signature was considered far more important.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I own a 1968 M35a2 Deuce and a half. It has a White Hercules LDS-465 multifuel engine. I can confirm it will burn anything. I once drove it as my daily driver for a whole summer because gas was $5 a gallon. A buddy of mine works for Sysco foods. Sysco left a pallet of 5 gallon clean cooking oil jugs outside and it could not be sold. So he loaded them up brought them to me. 35 jugs total. All I had to do was pour the veggie oil right into the tank and away I went rolling down the road smelling like burger king. Smoked like a beast though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent overview. One small correction: Turbo engines are generally lower compression ratio than high performance normally aspirated (NA) engines. The reason is because a turbocharger compresses the air charge before it goes into the cylinder, which adds heat. And because there is more air in the cylinder before compression begins, the effective compression ratio is far higher than you can achieve with a NA engine. An engine with a compression ratio of 10:1 will have an effective compression ratio of around 20:1 under 15 psi of boost.</p>
<p>For example, let's compare the 2019 Nissan GT-R and the 2019 Nissan 370Z. The 370Z's normally aspirated 3.7L V6 produces 332 hp with an 11.1:1 compression ratio. The GT-R's twin-turbocharged 3.8L V6 makes 565 hp at 9.0:1 compression ratio.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how the car is tuned. Some turbocharged cars are tuned so that you can only use premium fuel. Some are tuned to use regular. The more sophisticated (usually newer) engines use an engine control system that can change mixture and timing depending on the octane--this is done automatically in the background. Your owner's manual should have all the details for your car.  </p>
<p>For engines that give the owner the option, the engine will usually produce more power when using premium. For example, Ford claims 310 hp for newer Mustangs equipped with the 2.3L Ecoboost (turbocharged) engine. The owner's manual recommends the use of regular gas (87 octane using the (R+M)/2 rating method), but also says owners should use premium fuel for &quot;improved performance.&quot; Independent testing has shown the engine produces  only 275 hp when using regular fuel. It's nice to have the option to use cheaper fuel or when premium fuel just isn't available, although I believe most people who buy these cars will use premium so they don't give up the extra power.</p>
<p>For the Escape with the 2.0L Ecoboost, Ford also recommends regular, and again says premium will provide improved performance. For this vehicle Ford adds a caveat that owners should use premium for severe duty usage such as trailer tow. The Escape is rated to tow 3500 lbs with the 2.0L engine, but the engine will likely see constant boost if towing that amount. The recommendation to use premium is because the engine will be generating a great deal of heat, and premium will provide a greater detonation margin. I would guess most owners of this vehicle will burn regular gas exclusively, which means their engines will not be producing the advertised 240 hp. I would also guess most Escape owners do not know this, and wouldn't really notice the difference between 220 hp and 240 hp anyway.</p>
<p>Just so you know, unless the owner's manual for your car says otherwise, there is no benefit to using premium. The engine's control computer must be programmed to take advantage of the higher octane fuel. If it isn't you're just wasting your money. Premium fuel is not &quot;better&quot; in any way than regular, it's just a higher octane. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the same thing though in the end, the ultimate compression ratio IS higher for a turbo, it's just that the compression isn't done entirely in the cylinder. Point being that the higher octane fuel serves the same purpose in a high compression engine regardless of whether it is turbo or not, onpy difference being when/where the compression is applied.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Compression ratio stays the same because the piston isn't changing it's stroke.  It's still 14:1, or whatever, regardless of how much air is in there.  Compression ratio is determined by maximum cylinder capacity to it's minimum capacity.  If compression ratio was dependant on atmospheric pressure, then compression ratio would change depending on whether you're in Denver or if you were in Miami.  All a turbo increases cylinder pressure not compression ratio.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer! If I may nitpick, in my experience at least, most turbo motors have lower compression because the air is already compressed by the turbo before it enters the motor. There are obviously examples that go the other way, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking the same thing as I read it, but if you take the cylinder compression and boost compression as a whole, you're probably getting similar or slightly higher numbers. Turbo engine-management can back off the boost a lot easier than an N/A engine can reduce its compression.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. Once you have the cylinder at top dead center and the spark is about to fire, it doesn't really matter where the compression came from, what matters is the conditions inside the compression chamber at that instant. The reason to track the difference, as far as I know, is twofold. First, the amount of boost is variable based on the position of the wastegate / heat of the ambient air / heat and condition of the turbo / altitude or just barometric pressure, whereas the internal compression should be a fixed rate (8.1/1 on my last turbo car). Second, the compression from the piston happens really really fast. Someone who knows more than I do can maybe elaborate or correct me, but I believe you can get different results (detonation/not) based on how fast you compress the air/fuel mixture inside the cylinder, meaning that the piston compression and turbo compression should be measured separately. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't matter if the compression happens in the cylinder or before, in the turbo.  The air/fuel is still compressed more in total than a naturally aspirated (non-turbo/non-supercharged) engine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True but OP specifically said &quot;compression <em>ratio</em>&quot;, which as a term refers to the volume of the cylinder itself.  Turbo engines generally have lower compression ratio than atmospheric engine, even though the absolute pressure inside the cyclinder is higher.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most diesel engines don't have an air/fuel ratio. Air is compressed and adiabatically heated, then fuel is injected directly into the cylinder full of air which is well above the autoignition temperature of the fuel.</p>
<p>Edit: Gasoline engines work a bit differently - but you certainly wouldn't compress the air/fuel with the turbo. That is all kinds of dangerous.</p></div>		</li>
