			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know what circular breathing is in woodwind playing? It's teaching yourself to blow air out your mouth at the same time you inhale through your nose. So I would do that and air goes out mouth, directly into nose, and I hopefully was the only one to notice. I'd be mortified to have someone notice bad breath on me. Some people have real problems with bad breath (I'm not one) and getting in the elevator with one teaches me the limits of holding my breath. It's not their fault, but it's soooooooo bad. That smell just really makes me nauseated. I would never in a million years tell someone their breath stank. </p>
<p>However, sucking and licking my teeth, I can tell when the film is building up, and I'd brush my teeth. The nice thing about disposable brushes is they have paste dried on them, so you can do it right at your desk without a sink. A quick brush, swallow the foam (it's not that bad) and you're good as new. </p>
<p>Unfortunately carnivore breath is a constant thing and no amount of brushing gets rid of it. It's far less offensive than stink breath though. It smells kind of fruity but sour. Hard to describe other than nail polish remover. Chemical smelling/tasting. It's coming from the lungs, they come out as you exhale just like carbon dioxide. I don't think anyone would notice it if you're not mouth breathing though, or being intimate. You would need to be nose to nose almost. </p>
<p>I also picked up a habit of flossing often when I quit smoking a few years back. It replaced my oral habit with a healthier oral habit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You do lose muscle mass from extended fasting in most cases, however I also meant animal muscle protein. Our bodies steal protein from our organs too and that's the risk of long term starvation. You can rebuild most muscles, but if an organ is damaged....</p>
<p>The glycogen you're talking about is the quick energy we have after rest. The fight or flight energy. The &quot;I'm sleeping 8 hours without eating&quot; energy. </p></div>		</li>
