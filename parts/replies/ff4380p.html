			<div class="markdown"><p>Because we are bigger and our skin is \~30 cell thick. So it takes a bit more time and more ethanol.</p>
<p>But if you jump into a bath of 70% ethanol and wait a few minutes, you'll die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also because you're diluting the alcohol with stomach/intestine content, absorption has a limited rate, and after that, you're further dilluting it in your blood.   </p>
<p>Drinking 70% alcohol is fine, but having even 0,2% of alcohol in your blood might be deadly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, no it is not. Methyl vs ethyl alcohol. Never drink the 70% isopropyl please ! IT is not safe even if you just take a small shot of it ! Also most of it in stores has poison added to it on top of that... so please do not drink. Sure death ...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our skin has multiple layers of dead skin. So it doesn’t affect the living cells too much.</p>
<p>You can drink a little bit of alcohol because your body produces enzymes to break down that alcohol. But you can only drink a small amount of 70% alcohol or you’ll suffer alcohol poisoning. Your stomach has mucus that protects your stomach and intestine linings from damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you get alcohol poisoning because it’s stronger therefore it takes less to make you get alcohol poisoning, or is it because it’s 70% that causes something else to happen in your body that gives you alcohol poisoning? I know they sell some grain alcohols meant for drinking as high as 97%. Of course not designed to drink strait, but people still do.</p></div>		</li>
