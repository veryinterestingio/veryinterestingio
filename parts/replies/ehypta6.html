<p>this never made sense to me, all those roman ruins that were just stone columns... what was that all about?!?  </p>
<p>then i realized...  </p>
<p>wood and cloth doesn't stand up to the elements for 2000 years very well.  </p>
<p>it's highly likely those columns supported wooden roofs, stone ceilings were heavy AF  and so were used far more rarely... mostly for the wealthiest buildings...  </p>
<p>like how 2000 years from now our suburbs would largely just be paved foundations... ...and wires\~ while the pricier buildings made with steel and such would remain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Most of the time, those random rows of columns in the middle of nowhere used to be the ancient equivalent of storefronts, sometimes even inns/taverns/etc.</p>
<p>...It's no coincidence I'm also a huge urbex buff, haha. </p></div>		</li>
