<p>A lot of TV  manufacturers don't make the amp run out of power early because that tends to mean a good chunk of the volume slider just sounds rubbish, rather than making the sound louder, that and you have to be able to compensate for quieter programmes, so depending on the sound going in, it's definitely possible to damage the speakers by turning the volume up too high.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's a common misconception that the volume slider gives you an indication &quot;how much&quot; is going to the speakers. There's also a misconception that there is more risk when you turn up a quiet audio source vs. when you turn down a loud one. On top of that, you can and should avoid the problem when you are pairing external speakers with a receiver, if you go that route. The distinction is necessary.</p>

<p>Can you give an example of a TV model this happens on? It's a very bad idea from the manufacturer's perspective to let this happen. Excited about a brand new TV, what's something a lot of people do? Play a movie with the sound turned way up. That would mean lots of returned, broken TVs.</p>

<p>Gain is entirely independent from power. A sufficiently &quot;hot&quot; source of audio can drive an amplifier to clipping, even when the amplifier is turned all the way down (ignoring the muting feature where lots of amplifiers mute the inputs when you turn it <em>all</em> the way down). That's true of every amplifier. In TVs the audio sources are all internal, so they're somewhat in control of the extent of it. But everyone benefits when there is more than enough gain, and it's one of those rare things in electronics where it doesn't cost a thing to add more. The only downside is that too much gain makes the higher &quot;number on the display&quot; volume settings less useful. I.e. if the quietest dialogue of the quietest movie is a bit too loud at &quot;20&quot;, then there's no reason to ever use 20 through 100, putting a lot of responsibility on the 19 levels that leaves to use.</p>

<p>If the speakers have decent power <del>handle</del> handling and sensitivity*, as most larger TVs do these days, &quot;early&quot; here is already &quot;too loud&quot;. Even if it's not, cutting the power in half is -3 dB, which is barely noticeable. (-1 dB is completely inaudible in all but the most extremely ideal conditions.) It's important to remember that the -3 dB loss in volume only exists at the loudest sounds the system can physically produce, or it burns out, whichever comes first.</p>

<p>Turning up quite programs requires no additional power, only gain.</p>

<p>This doesn't follow from the volume discussion, but I thought I could give you a concrete example to show why. Those toy-quality karaoke machines don't get &quot;loud enough&quot; at any setting. So they get turned up to the level where loudness and &quot;badness&quot; of the inevitable distortion are balanced. That's right at 100% power. Still gain and power are separate. The AUX input will have 20 ~ 40 dB less gain than the microphone input so that the volume of the singer is similar to the volume of the backing music. Even when you turn it up and down, the two inputs have separate gains. On the other hand, there's a lot of volume knob past where it sounds bad, yet it cannot break itself. (It's already running at 100%.)</p>
<p>Compare to a bigger, more expensive, louder karaoke machine. There's still more gain in the mic channel(s) than the auxiliary channel. There's a similar amount of overall gain. The most noticeable difference is that the volume keeps going up past the point where the cheaper one crapped out. You might even get to &quot;too loud&quot; before &quot;bad audio&quot;. Again 100% power won't break it. It better not: their target market is loud drunk parties/bars where they'll be turned all the way up anyway. </p>
<p>* Sensitivity is basically efficiency: sound pressure level (loudness) divided by input power, but accounts for things like how it's louder in front of the speaker than behind.</p>
<hr />
<p>Besides all that, it costs less to use a lower power amplifier. Long story short, since it doesn't add any value for the consumer to have enough power to damage the speakers, manufacturers won't spend extra money to make that happen.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand everything of what you've said there. </p>
<p>However. </p>
<p>I had a Samsung plasma TV from about 2007, which I'd had second hand, from a friend of the family. They're a family that love parties and get togethers, a lot of which involve karaoke. </p>
<p>The speakers in that were absolutely <em>trashed</em>. I had to use that TV with a soundbar to get acceptable sound out of it. </p>
<p>So yeah I do understand that in theory, it shouldn't happen, but I'm here to tell you that it does happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can definitely damage speakers by sound that is too loud. The power rating only tells you how much power they can take without the coil overheating. There is also Xmax and Xlim. The former is maximum excursion after which the loudspeaker starts distorting, Xlim is the limit beyond which the speaker gets physically damaged. You can easily cross those without going anywhere near the power rating, since the excursion also depends on the frequency and the enclosure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue that it's still not loudness, since excursion depends on frequency and pressure. You can hit Xmax with virtually no sound. (Point taken though, it's not power either.)</p></div>		</li>
