			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been watching for this.  So far, the most obvious impacts of the pandemic on air quality are over cities and other industrial regions.  A colleague just sent me some satellite comparisons of the air quality over Lima, Peru -- a then vs. now sort of comparison, and WOW.  We have seen that over other regions, like in China, parts of Europe, etc.  Beyond air quality, I'm not sure about weather patterns changing.  I'm an ecologist, and so I tend to focus on the receiving end of climate: the ecosystems that have to adapt or perish in the face of a rapidly changing climate system. The pandemic has, temporarily, lowered greenhouse gas emissions, which is good for ecosystems. But will it last, or will we come roaring back once the economy gets moving again?  That's the question, isn't it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you very much for your thoughtfull answer. That is very interesting. I would say it will be sadly coming back when everything is back to &quot;normal&quot;. It would be great if this could at least be some positive example to provoke lasting effects.</p></div>		</li>
