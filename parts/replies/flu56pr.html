<p>I got VR last Christmas but returned it partially because of my nearsightedness and glasses not fitting well.  Would love to invest in this and give it another shot</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>3rd party. There are a few companies that sell these, but as far as quality goes, <a href="https://widmovr.com" target="_blank">https://widmovr.com</a> were the best in my opinion. My vision is -3.5 in both eyes and they had lenses available. </p>
<p>I have an original Vive and bought the mod kit which is far superior in clarity from the OEM fresnel lenses, but the prescription adapters donâ€™t fit the new lens housings.</p></div>		</li>
