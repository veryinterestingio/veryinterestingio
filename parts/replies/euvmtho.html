<p>What questions are at the forefront of research in this area, and what are you focusing your efforts on?</p>

<p>Major hurdles to expanded PSH development in the US include environmental, policy (regulatory and market), and economic barriers. As the economist in the group, Iâ€™ll focus on the last one. We are working to improve our understanding of the value offered by the following types of services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bulk power capacity and energy value over PSH lifetime</li>
<li>Value of PSH ancillary services (regulation service, contingency reserves, etc.)</li>
<li>Power system stability services (inertial response, governor response, transient and small signal stability, voltage support)</li>
<li>PSH impacts on reducing system cycling and ramping costs</li>
<li>Other indirect (system-wide or portfolio) effects of PSH operations (e.g., PSH impacts on decreasing overall power system production costs, benefits for integration of variable energy resources, and impacts on power system emissions)</li>
<li>PSH transmission benefits (transmission congestion relief, transmission investments deferral)</li>
<li>PSH non-energy services (water management services, socioeconomic benefits, and environmental impacts)</li>
</ul>
<p>While there are production cost models, energy storage valuation tools, and other tools that can be used to partially address these questions, there are none that fully address these issues. Further, even if the value can be defined, the value may not be captured in markets or recognized in Integrated Resource Plans filed by utilities. At PNNL, we have been working on this question for batteries for several years and have recently expanded into other non-battery technologies, including PSH, power-to-gas, and hydrogen fuel cells. While the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has taken steps through its orders (e.g., 755 and 841) to improve market operations for energy storage technologies, there is still a distance left to travel. </p>
<p>Here is a <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/publications/shell-energy-north-americas-hydro-battery-system-final-market-assessment-report?utm_source=Reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=PSH" target="_blank">link</a> to a report we completed for a Shell Energy North America small, modular 5 MW / 30 MWh system. There is also an ongoing 5-lab consortium project that is exploring the value proposition for large-scale PSH.</p></div>		</li>
