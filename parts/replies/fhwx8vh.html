			<div class="markdown"><p>most coastal trees and vegetation are somewhat salt tolerant due to frequent salt spray from particularly strong long storms that in some places such as the foot hills round a delta or large shallow bay can be carried further inland for considerable distances. against even a moderate tsunami most trees will simply be toppled and as has been mentioned the sediments, sand and clay can lengthen the recovery time with a locally thick layer swept inland.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aside from sediment and salt, are there dangers from the water being contaminated with pesticides or other man made contaminates which contain nitrates and chemicals like phosphorus? I know where I live contaminates from the tobacco fields get into the river causing algae blooms leading to red tide. I wondered if there is something similar that can happen in a tsunami.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tsunamis have caused soil contamination due to anthropogenic contaminants in the past. The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-20075-z" target="_blank">2011 Japan tsunami</a> led to spilled oil in the Gensui river which required an oil fence to be constructed to prevent the oil from floating to the surface and downstream followed by manual oil removal by humans. </p>
<p>The 2004 Indian Ocean tsumani contaminated and <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2006WR004876" target="_blank">destroyed 40,000 drinking wells in Sri Lanka</a>. This potable water was contaminated with salt and also nitrates. Referring specifically to eutrophication, <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8520/bac32828ef235afe609e33b52257f9986e80.pdf?_ga=2.185808425.161776825.1581954652-1966409705.1581954652" target="_blank">the ecological consequences are not fully understood</a> because huge tsunamis are quite rare. Tsunamis alter the physico-chemical parameters (organic content / granulometry etc.) of the area they impact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Partly yes, think of the oceans as the washbasins of our planet. <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/whysalty.html" target="_blank">A small percentage of the salinity in the oceans is a direct result of runoff</a> from land that introduces a multitude of elements into the ocean system. These nutrients are essential for life and thus ocean ecosystems directly depend on chemical inputs from the lithosphere.</p></div>		</li>
