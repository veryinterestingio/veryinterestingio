			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the question. I’m excited to be here to talk about contact lens health. It seems like this is a common practice among contact lens wearers and I know it’s tempting to want to stretch your contact lens supply for as long as possible. While the effects of not replacing contact lenses as regularly as recommended by an eye care provider have not been fully examined, studies have shown that contact lens wearers who do not follow recommended replacement schedules have more complications and self-reported discomfort than contact lens wearers who follow the replacement recommendations. Some contact lens wearers have also reported poorer vision as a result of wearing contact lenses longer than indicated by their eye care providers. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do those studies indicate a causal effect, or simply a correlation? There’s a whole host of reasons why people who don’t follow instructions  regarding their eyecare might be more prone to complications.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know mine is causal. Because changing my lenses has always been reactionary for me, I change them when they get uncomfortable. </p>
<p>I feel like I can tell pretty all, I've been wearing them a full 20 years since I was 10 or 11</p></div>		</li>

<p>Add me to the list of people who experience discomfort. If I were to stretch something like 2 week contacts to 2 months then it actually feels like the edge of the contacts is disturbing my eye while they're in. It's probably them just drying out or something but either way its the most annoying thing because I feel it every time I blink and sometimes it seems like I'm trying my hardest just to blink them into place.</p>
<p>I don't stretch my contacts out anymore but that was some rough stuff and oddly enough it took me a while to figure out what the problem was</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to ask a couple of follow-up questions to this.</p>
<p>Is there any difference between daily, weekly and monthly lenses? It seems like it could be cheaper for a manufacturer to only make and stock one type of lens and then package each type of lens differently.</p>
<p>Are there any problems with using daily lenses for a few hours over a week (I use them for sports, so they get 4-10 hours of wear)?</p></div>		</li>
