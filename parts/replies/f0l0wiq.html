			<div class="markdown"><p>That is the advantage of logographic written language - unless the meanings of the characters change (or the way characters are written changes), it will still be understandable in written form.</p>
<p>Spoken? Absolutely not. The various dialects of Chinese have changed just as much as any other language has over the centuries.</p>
<p>Past that, I doubt that anyone in China today other than people who explicitly study it can understand Oracle bone script. Chinese characters haven't stayed unchanged since they were created. Just like other writing systems, they evolved effectively as simply glyphs that evolved. Oracle bone script goes back to around 1200 BCE, and evolved from there, but you don't see what you'd consider modern script until the end of the Han dynasty (so around 200 CE). Prior to that, I highly doubt it would be understandable.</p>
<p>Also, the modern Regular Script didn't stay unchanged either, and didn't really become what you recognize <em>now</em> until the Tang dynasty, so around 600-700 CE.</p>
<p>It would be like asking someone who speaks, writes, and reads English... to read English written in the Etruscan alphabet, and then the Greek alphabet, and then Phoenician, and then as Egyptian hieroglyphs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern Chinese being able to read ancient Chinese is an exaggerate thing,even if original text is rewritten into modern characters,one has be excellent good at the grammar and vocabulary of ancient Chinese to fully understand the meaning, which means at least finishing high school.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry but that's not true at all. I speak and read Mandarin Chinese pretty well, but apart from a word here and there I don't understand anything at all of old texts (even if they are written using modern characters, recognising the characters is not the problem). Lots of words changed meaning, grammar changed, new characters came in use and old characters got out of use. It's a totally different language.</p>
<p>A native speaker would probably do better, but that's because they had old Chinese in school.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Didn’t Mandarin simplify most of the characters at one point? IIRC, it’s Cantonese that has the traditional characters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it's not about dialects.</p>
<p>Every traditional character has a direct simplified character translation. </p>
<p>For eg Taiwanese also retain traditional characters and don't speak Cantonese.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The dialect does not matter for the characters. It's like using a different alphabet to write the same language. There are Cantonese speakers using traditional characters (e.g. Hong Kong), Cantonese speakers using simplified characters (e.g. Guangzhou), Mandarin speakers using traditional characters (e.g. Taipei), and Mandarin speakers using simplified characters (e.g. Beijing)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not so difficult for someone using Simplified Chinese to read Traditional Chinese and vice versa, the two versions of one character usually look similar and if they don't,one can still understand the character by referring to context, since it means the same thing.</p></div>		</li>
