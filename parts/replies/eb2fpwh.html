<p>It has less to do with heating the batteries and scraping the connections than it does this. </p>
<p>Series connected batteries (which are the norm in most everything I have) donâ€™t drain equally, and the last battery in the series drains quicker. Swapping them around puts a slightly stronger battery at the end of the series. </p>
<p>This post needs more upvotes because the others, while technically sound statements, are not the actual reason why swapping batteries helps. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! Everyone else has replied that it's because &quot;your hands heat them up&quot; and &quot;it removes corrosion from the contacts&quot;, both of which (for normal batteries) are so negligible that there's no point mentioning them. The answer that batteries discharge unevenly (one does more 'work', one does less 'work') is the correct answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha I know. I was reading some responses and though they are technically correct, I think my reasoning was probably the most impactful cause of OP's question </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for confirming. This was my initial thought but started to doubt my 2 engineering degrees (no specialty in batteries) from reading the other comments.</p></div>		</li>
