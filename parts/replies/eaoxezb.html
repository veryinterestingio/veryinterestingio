<p>Truth is, you can print a brand new 20 out of an inkjet and pass it off 99 times out of 100.  That 100th time though, you go to pound me in the ass prison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anyone that knows their money wouldn't take one printed on an inkjet; American bills are made with Intaglio printing, giving the hatched and crosshatched shaded areas a definitive &quot;ribbed&quot; texture.  </p>
<p>As an asst manager at <del>Hell</del> a fast food joint for 11 years, this was my number one way of teaching cashiers to spot the difference (our markers came up missing daily.) On just about any bill, use your thumbnail to &quot;scratch&quot; at the portrait's collar/lapel, a phony will be smooth and typically &quot;waxy,&quot; the real deals are always ridged/ribbed/textured in general.  </p>
<p>It's by no means 100% effective, but if the cashier had doubts after doing that, I'd tell them to contact the supervisor on duty for verification (this always applied to $20 bills and below, anything over we had to check regardless.) The Intaglio texture is something so esoteric, low level counterfeiters would never consider it when &quot;wearing&quot; a fake (rubbing/weathering one to make it seem circulated.)  </p>
<p>Sorry about jumping in like this. Maybe this derpy little nugget of knowledge can help someone that reads it eventually.  </p>
<p>Edit: reread your statement of <em>&quot;99 times out of 100...&quot;</em> it would pass as a real one. Possibly. But personally I check every damn bill I ever come in contact with - even $1s - because I work far too damn hard to get shafted with a fake bill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure, the paper weight also feels off.  But if we are talking about cashiers so unfamiliar with American currency to doubt older designs... well, maybe not.  And if they are wearing gloves, and there's a line, and maybe it's in a stack with some legit notes...</p></div>		</li>
