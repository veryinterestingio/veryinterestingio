			<div class="markdown"><p>Polyploidy is not unusual in plants at all. I don't know how it happened in the case of watermelons but I wouldn't be surprised at all if humans did it because it's really, really easy to artificially induce if you have some extremely basic lab equipment and thirty bucks.</p>
<p>Oryzalin prevents cells from dividing, so if you apply it in very small amounts the chromosomes will replicate but the cell will not die. Twenty five dollars gets 473.2 mL of 40.4% oryzalin online and if heavily diluted it makes polyploids. You don't need that high a concentration at all but I haven't found it for smaller and cheaper amounts. IIRC 1/9 or so will be stable tetraploids after treatment and once that's done they can be propagated like normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, thanks, and /u/lollipopeclipse, too. I was aware of polyploidity, but for some reason it didn't cross my mind, I just imagined that some cultivar has 25 chromosomes and another has 28 or some shit like that, derp.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A regular watermelon has 22 chromosomes. Using Colchicine makes the watermelon have 44 chromosomes.
Breeding the first watermelon with the second creates a watermelon with 33 chromosomes. They technically have seeds, those little white soft ones that you don’t even notice are there, they just don’t fully develop. </p>
<p>Basically. This is extremely generalized, but it’s the jist of what happens.</p>
<p>Edit: I only put the first number of the amount of chromosomes and not the second (guess my numbers were supposed to be diploid, tripled and tetraploid and my morning brain wasn’t having it?). I had just woken up, my b.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it the reduction in chromosome count which cause seedless watermelons to be less flavorful than the old seeded ones?  I swear the flesh of seedless watermelons is tougher, less sweet and less red than the old varieties that were long and full of seeds. Does anyone else think so?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh! I know this one! </p>
<p>I only know about one type of watermelon, the kind you typically see in stores in the U.S. For plants, it is entirely possible for individuals of a species to have extra copies of chromosomes for some traits, such as seed production. It doesn't mess them up like it does in most animals. (Honestly, I think it might be all animals but I haven't looked that part up.)</p>
<p>The seeded kind of watermelons have either two chromosomes for seed production or four; as long as there's an even number you will get seeds. If you breed a two-chromosome plant with a four-chromosome one, you get one with three  chromosomes (one from &quot;mom&quot; and two from &quot;dad&quot;) for seed production and the seeds won't develop in the daughter plants.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, they are considered to be the same species, just as you would consider a person with a chromosomal disorder to still be a human. The DNA is the same, they just have more or fewer copies of some sections.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you know and don't mind answering, why is it that plants have so many different ways to reproduce whereas animals don't seem to have such a versatile set of reproduction paths?  </p>
<p>I'm not saying I want to breed a cow with a chicken to make an animal that produces both milk and eggs for my breakfast but I'm not exactly ag'in' it.  </p>
<p>Also, thanks for listing out all of those methods.  I've never studied much biology beyond high school and it's all very confusing for me, even after someone explains it.  Plants seem very complicated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's difficult to explain and I'm not entirely sure it's true.</p>
<p>A lot of what I mentioned is just variations on one thing, which is that plants are very regenerative and so even small parts removed from the adult can regrow. There are some animals that can do this too. Sometimes the plant sheds pieces of itself naturally, other times not, but it works so well because their anatomy is decentralized enough that no single part of them is completely essential for survival and cannot be replaced if lost.</p></div>		</li>
