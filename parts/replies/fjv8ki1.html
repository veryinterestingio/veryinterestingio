			<div class="markdown"><p>At the time there were no such thing as a correct way to write things. If you hear both the English and the French name in the modern language, you can actually kinda make the name out in both of them. Also names change over time and get adapted into different languages. </p>
<p>The name Ioannes was butchered in such a way that both the name Ivan and Hans derive from that name. </p>
<p>Also different languages have different sounds and some sounds are not pronounceable for some languages. An example:</p>
<p>In english you have the very common sound: „th“. Now every english person could pronounce it, islandic people too although they would use Þ. (Which was also used in old english). So now we go to the german language. The german language doesn’t have this „th“ at all. Therefore you see a lot of german people pronouncing „th“ as „Zh“ or something like that, because we don’t have that sound in our language. </p>
<p>Therefore the name Wilhelm became William. Also if you say Wilhelm really fast you kinda get William, just drop the h and you are already kinda close. </p>
<p>Now i‘m no expert on the french language, only being able to speak a few sentences in that language i cannot really tell you how they pronounce stuff, but it’s a similar process. </p>
<p>Lastly: we actually don’t know how people pronounced names hundreds of years ago. We only have written texts, which like mentioned above didn’t had any rules on how to write stuff correctly. Voice recordings and stuff like that didn’t exist back then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool! That makes a lot of sense then, kind of a combination of how writing and pronunciation changed over time rather than how it was actually used in the period. So as English evolved the name into &quot;william&quot; and in French into &quot;guillaume&quot; nothing says that at the time, it might actually have been pronounced and spoken (just as an example) more like &quot;wilhelm&quot;? And in writing it would likely have been a kind of free-for-all?</p></div>		</li>
