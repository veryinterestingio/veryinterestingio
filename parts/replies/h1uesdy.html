			<div class="markdown"><p>[CHK] Step one is knowing that the renewable energy field is not just for engineers and scientists! When I was an undergraduate student, I had no idea of the variety of skill sets required in making the energy transition happen. In fact, the required technologies are more or less already there - we now need the markets, policies and societies to align, and this presents unique challenges in different regional contexts. Renewable energy needs creativity, strategy, advocacy and local leadership just as much as it needs technological innovation. It needs policy researchers, business strategists, and communications experts. Find out which aspect of the transition you are best equipped to contribute to by getting an internship. The renewable energy community is very supportive of young people wanting to get into the field. You will find your way from there!</p></div>		</li>
