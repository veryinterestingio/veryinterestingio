I don't know how true the Renaissance painting thing is but here is a Van Gogh self portrait after he cut off his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Portrait_with_Bandaged_Ear#/media/File:Vincent_van_Gogh_-_Self-portrait_with_bandaged_ear_(1889,_Courtauld_Institute).jpg" target="_blank">left ear.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if lifelike art was so difficult, why are statues from the same period so realistic? If you compare, say, an ancient Greek statue of Apollo to a painting, the painting will be flat and simplistic and childlike, but the statue will include individual hairs and fabric wrinkles and other incredible details. How are the tools for creating perspective and detail so different from sculpting to painting?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a professional artist (animator) and have dabbled in all kinds of media over the years. In my experience it is FAR more intuitive to sculpt a subject (either in real life, or in computer 3D modeling) because you're pretty much just duplicating whatever the thing is, in a different material. You're basically only concerned with the form and proportions.</p>
<p>Drawing / painting is not as intuitive, you are really creating an optical illusion that tries to mimic a visual image. You need to be aware of perspective, foreshortening, light angle, how shadows fall off over curves, how highlights relate to light sources, etc... this all needs to be done intentionally, whereas it just happens automatically on a sculpture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best answer. It is why kids draw people with two eyes on the side of their head, even in profile. They *know* we have two eyes, and they're drawing what they *know*, not what they see - which is the first bit of advice you'll get in a charcoal or figure study class.   </p>
<p>&quot;Draw what you see. Not what you KNOW.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>David Hockney (not an artist I particularly like) once did a very good series of programs about how perspective drawing is so complex and why it's hard to paint 3D scenes realistically, whereas sculptures are objects that you can interact with and see from multiple angles that hey are correct</p></div>		</li>

<p>I suspect a lot of the reason we don't think of the Romans as more realistic painters is just because we don't have a lot of Roman-era paintings around, they haven't survived as well as marble sculpture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Firstly, the sculptures <em>and</em> art of the Greeks and classical antiquity were absolutely a vital step towards the realism of the Renaissance artists. It was literally a rebirth - and continuation - of Greek theory, philosophy and art. There was a 1500 year pause for Reasons but in many ways it's a continuance of one tradition.</p>
<p>Secondly, it's far more natural to perceive and recreate a three dimensional shape in three dimensions than it is to do so in two. Someone basically had to decide what the representation of depth on a flat surface might look like, and it's tricky - it required a lot of understanding about perspective and light, which was also facilitated by advanced optics (funnily enough, more mirrors and lenses!) For a 3D shape you can get some clay, make a cast and straight up capture reality. This might not have been the methodology for every bust or sculpture, but it's a simple method and it would set the benchmark.</p></div>		</li>
