			<div class="markdown"><p>Flailing around bees is not helpful, you quickly learn to keep a handle on it. Slow, soft movements. You also learn how much pressure is ok. You don't just grab something that could have bees on it, but gently touch it, so anyone beneath your hand has time to crawl away, <em>then</em> grab it. I got stung about once a year, maybe just their way to remind me that &quot;Ya, we're peaceful, but we CAN!&quot; </p>
<p>In the video the bees look grey, could be carnica. They're a super docile (and productive) breed. Once I dropped a full hive box, frames and all. They SHOULD have stung me for that. I walked off, calmed myself, then went back and scooped them up. Poor girls. </p>
<p>You know what gets them grumpy, someone mowing the lawn nearby is bad, or cutting hedges and then going to the hive still smelling of cut plants. They're also quite vocal. You can hear what they're up to. Usually the hive produces a low droning hum, if they sound like a mix between a hissing cat and wind in dry leaves, you back away slowly and reschedule whatever you wanted to do some other day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It smells like grazing cattle, and large animals can damage a hive. So the bees get ready to drive anything off that might get too close. It's an instinctive, ancient reaction. Bees have no idea that lawn mowers are different from a herd of gnu.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cut grass smell that everyone loves? That's the pheromone scream of plants saying &quot;oh shit I'm being destroyed! Save yourselves and add more bitter to the sap!&quot;</p>
<p>I guess that smell (either the pheromone itself or the bitters in the sap) irritates the bees?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm feeling quite guilty at the moment mowing my lawns, as I have quite a bit of clover in it in flower.  We're in an urban area but someone clearly has a hive nearby, since we are seeing honeybees this year (yay!)  So here I am mowing the lanws, cutting off some of their food supply, and I also end up taking ages &quot;bumping&quot; each of the bees I see off the flowers before mowing over them. </p>
<p>Poor wee things :-(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of those areas where you have to keep the lawn short? I try to mow around flowers, or leave it another week or two. But my backyard borders on pastures and farmland. No one cares about other people's &quot;lawn&quot; or lack thereof. Sometimes what needs to be done simply needs to be done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you bump the hive by accident they hiss. If it's just a little hissing here and there, in a hive that has an old queen it's the princesses battling it out. They're ferocious and kill each other as quickly as possible until one is left standing. Battle royal for real. A hive without a queen sounds weird too, either they're dead silent and don't do anything, or they burst in random bouts of frantic activity that looks and sounds uncoordinated. </p>
<p>But most commonly it's heat stress, or robbers trying to get into the hive. When it's hot bees have to bring water into the hive and cool it by evaporation. It's an effort and disturbing them while they're at it gets them annoyed. Better come back in the evening when they can relax again. </p>
<p>Beehives get robbed by other bees, other insects, or larger animals. Large animals you can chase off, for smaller critters all you can do is narrow down the entrance hole of the hive that's under attack and make it easier for them to defend. Then get out of the way. Crushed plants are a warning signal that a large animal might come close and trample or bump the hive. It's not usually enough to get them to hiss, but it does get them anxious and ready to fight. </p>
<p>Bees get parasites, and need to be treated against them. That's the one way I got mine to hiss for a whole day at a time. The treatments stink and are somewhat irritating to bees too, but they kill the mites first. The bees don't like it. At all.</p>
<p>Oh, an award, thank you!</p></div>		</li>
