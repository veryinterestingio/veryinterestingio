			<div class="markdown"><p>That &quot;connective tissue&quot; is doing a LOT of work. I remember dissecting cats and pigs in biology class. I expected the intestines to just flop out like noodles. Nope, it's all secured in place, to itself and the organs around it, by thin membranes that have to be cut or pulled apart. All the soft tissues are like this, to one degree or another. They don't show it in anatomical drawings, because there's a ton of it, and you really only need to know about it if you're a surgeon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep - and it being inflamed is what leads you to having a specifically located pain (i.e. appendicitis pain) compared to a normal stomach ache which is a rather diffuse pain across your midsection.</p>
<p>The organs themselves have a low density of sensory innervation compared to the Mesentery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do so love the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wandering_womb" target="_blank">&quot;wandering womb&quot;</a> notion of medicine:</p>
<p>&quot;In the middle of the flanks of women lies the womb, a femaleÂ viscus, closely resembling an animal; for it is moved of itself hither and thither in the flanks, also upwards in a direct line to below the cartilage of the thorax, and also obliquely to the right or to the left, either to the liver or the spleen, and it likewise is subject to prolapsus downwards, and in a word, it is altogether erratic. It delights also in fragrant smells, and advances towards them; and it has an aversion to fetid smells, and flees from them; and, on the whole, the womb is like an animal within an animal.&quot;</p>
