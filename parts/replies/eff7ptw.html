			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't this be true for a whole human and not just the eyes though? Maybe minus hair.  EDIT: So the answer seems to be your eyes do freeze it just takes much longer than your extremities because they are heated by your brain. Ànd the part In brackets in the post above wasn't there when I made my comment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Somewhat, but the skin actually received much less blood/energy than the eyes do consistently, while having a vastly larger surface area and again, being less conductive (warmth passes much more slowly from the bloodstream to the surface of the skin than the bloodstream to the surface of the eye).... In addition, the extremities(most likely to suffer damage from cold/frostbite) begin to lose circulation in cold temperatures as the body conserves heat for more &quot;critical&quot; functions(aka your internal organs. </p>
<p>So yeah, sort of... But not really</p></div>		</li>
