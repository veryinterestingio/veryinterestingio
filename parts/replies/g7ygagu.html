They didn't just wake up and go &quot;Ya know, I'm gonna worship just one guy today and not all the other ones I've grown to believe in&quot;. They were ...&quot;heavily persuaded&quot; to change their beliefs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very apparent in Danish history. According to the popular myth, the Danish flag, Dannebrog, fell from the skies as a sign from God, which turned the tides of battle and the danes won. </p>
<p>This battle is the battle of Lyndanisse(1219), one of the main battles during the Danish crusade of Livonia.</p>
<p>Should probably point out the flag is a literal cross.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to remember that for many pagans who practiced polytheism; simply adding another God to the list of ones they were already worshiping wasnâ€™t a big deal faith wise. </p>
<p>Itâ€™s easy to see how over time a God who requires churches for their own worship and claims to be the only god would replace the other Gods who didnâ€™t require as much effort for worship,</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually lasted longer than one would think.  In Norway we had norse rituals being practiced well into the reformation era. That said, easier for this to happen when no noticable church official lives within a weeks travel of you. And your village is basically just 200 people. Not so much when you live under other conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Catholic church wasn't that hard core in their conversion process usually. It was usually sufficient to just move into a new area, build a place to worship, and once you start teaching and converting then you eventually get to bring the children up in it. In 2 or 3 generations the whole place would be catholic. It's all about the long term planning combined with prolific reproduction with that religion. You just out breed the competition over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am the Lord thy God; Thou shalt have no other gods before me; Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image; Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy</p>
<p>That's the first few commandments and at the times they were taken extremely literally. I'd call that pretty hardcore.</p>
<p>Although by comparison it was normal for vikings to be raiding their neighbours and in particular sacking churches for their riches and they practiced human sacrifice which the Catholics found totally abhorrent.</p></div>		</li>
