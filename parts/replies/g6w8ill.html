			<div class="markdown"><p>That's consistent with what I said. Fission-only weapons aren't thermonuclear because they don't rely on high temperatures to fuel charged particle reactions. A device which makes use of fusion, as modern designs do, does use high temperatures from a fission detonation to ignite fusion, so that is thermonuclear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't most of the energy of the detonation of a fusion bomb comes from U238 that's rendered fissile at those high energy / through high speed neutrons? I mean fission inducing fusion which in turn induces even more fusion. Does that kind of fission also counts as thermonuclear?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Little boy was temperature independent, thus nuclear. However, the later stages of the Tsar Bomba need heat and pressure from the first nuclear stage to start fusion. Thus thermonuclear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Temperature independent and temperature dependent, that's a succinct way to explain the difference. Fission is temperature independent and fusion is temperature dependent. Thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh this makes sense! The big fusion reactor in France, ITER, is an abbreviation of International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor. But they've dropped the expansion of ITER now because they were worried about negative connotations of &quot;thermonuclear&quot; with atomic weapons.</p></div>		</li>
