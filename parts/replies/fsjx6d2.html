			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you got a few details wrong. Modern orchestral notation utilizes transposed parts also for brass instruments. Old scores (pre 1900 more or less) didn’t have <em>key signatures</em> for brass parts but the part is therefore not necessarily in C. It is instead written for an instrument we now call natural (french) horn / trumpet.  There were no different fingerings to memorize, because these instruments had no valves.</p>
<p>edit: The harmonic series for the natural horn/ trumpet fulfills the role of „identical fingerings“. Say you have a part for an Eb horn and a D horn, then middle C would in both cases refer to the fourth (?) tone in the harmonic series. So the situation is similar to the woodwinds. But with a modern, valved instrument you then need to transpose (as you wrote).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The material doesn’t matter; people can make trumpets out of wood, but that doesn’t make it a woodwind. Woodwinds are so named because, yeah, they used to be made of wood. But now they could be made of any materials. What woodwinds have in common is that air is passed over something, be it a reed (clarinet, saxophone, oboe, bassoon) a mouthpiece (flute) or a fipple (recorder). Either the reed vibrates or the air is made to vibrate directly. Brass instruments rely on vibration of the lips to make a sound.</p></div>		</li>
