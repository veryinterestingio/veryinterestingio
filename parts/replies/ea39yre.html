			<div class="markdown"><p>It reduces hangovers by binding alcohol in your gut and preventing further absorption. You could also reduce the hangovers by not drinking as much when you are already drunk. This would give the same effect.</p>
<p>The bloating and gas are reduced if something you are eating is causing it, or if you have small bowel bacterial overgrowth. All it is doing is binding to things in your intestines and preventing your body from absorbing them. This includes food, vitamins, and nutritious things you eat as well as alcohol and any toxins you might ingest. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is absolutely no reason to use this to brush your teeth other than the cool color. Fluoride toothpaste is good for your teeth. Activated charcoal is just colorful for your teeth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely not the same thing, since you just put it in your mouth and spit it out afterwards. So as long as you're not dissolving any meds in your mouth or eating while brushing your teeth (and wtf does that?), you won't face the problems mentioned above. However, there are no proven benefits to brushing your teeth with charcoal (although some people claim whitening properties) and being an abrasive, it totally could damage your enamel or irritate your gums. Again, it won't kill you but I simply wouldn't do it and also see no point in doing it.</p></div>		</li>
