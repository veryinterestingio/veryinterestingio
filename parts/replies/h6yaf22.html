			<div class="markdown"><p>Additional tidbit of information to build on your post, here are the energies required when heating up water</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>heat -20°C ice to 0°C ice (typical freezer ice cube):  42 kJ/kg</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>transform 0°C ice into 0°C water: 334 kJ/kg</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>heat 0°C water to 100°C water: 420 kJ/kg</p>
</li>
<li>transform 100°C water to 100°C steam: 2265 kJ/kg</li>
</ul>
<p>So, vaporizing 100° water still takes 85% of the heat necessary to vaporizing 0° water.</p>
<p>And similarly, 90% of the refreshing capacity of an ice cube comes from the melting, and not really from the ice temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The amount of energy needed to turn ice-cold liquid water into boiling liquid water is about 1/5 as much as the amount of energy needed to turn boiling liquid water into actual steam.   So boiling liquid water would be about 80% as effective at cooling down fire than ice-cold liquid water.  So... as long as the water is liquid, it barely matters what temperature it's at. </p>
<p>Neither steam nor ice does as good a job at putting out fires than liquid water, because liquid water -- at any temperature -- does a better job than ice or steam at keeping air (oxygen) away from the fire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The phase change of water takes a lot of thermal energy compared to simply raising the temperature. Specific heat is the wording to search for on this topic.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the wiki page for it has a graph for water at the Measurement part of the article if anyone wants to see the above in picture form. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_heat_capacity" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_heat_capacity</a></p>
<p>Fun fact: old style churned ice cream was frozen by adding salt to ice. This effectively melts the ice without heat, which absorbs heat from the ice cream, slowly freezing it during churning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would the last bit of what they said be a justification for this? It would literally be the exact opposite.</p>
<p>With a stainless steel ice cube, there is no melting involved, so all of the energy needed to melt the ice (that would cool down your drink) would not be consumed. It would just be the temperature difference (though you’d have to use the specific heat capacity of stainless steel and not water).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming your body heat is roughly 40 C (a bit lower but making the math easier), 0.4×420=168 kj/kg for heating water from 0 to body temp.  Ice to water is 334, so 334/502~67%, not 90%</p>
<p>Very good point, just being a stickler for the math.</p></div>		</li>

<p>it removes heat</p>
</blockquote>
<p>your answer is correct, but displacement of oxygen doesn't really come into it, in practice.  you don't smother the fire, you remove the heat.  (you may possibly displace the <em>fuel</em> with a water stream and a small fire, though if this was all you did, there is a chance of rekindle.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that's true. My understanding is that the reason water doesn't put out a grease fire is that the oil floats to the top of the water and remains in contact with the air. But I don't know any reason water would remove any less heat in that case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's less that oil floats and more that for oil or grease to be on fire, it needs to be HOT and (at least for large fires, say a deep frier or something) the water violently boils throwing the oils everywhere, increasing surface area and in turn causing more fuel to ignite</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was told by several firefighters that because oil floats on water, the flammable oil is quickly spread around when it is &quot;soaked&quot; with high pressure hoses.  What they do is to use a fine mist to cool the flames, rather than a heavy stream.  Hopefully, that can buy them time to use other ways to contain the oil (and fire) in smaller areas- dykes, chemicals or non water methods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Smother it mostly. Like if you have a pan of oil that ignites and you can place a lid on it, do that. If it's small enough you may also be able to cover it in baking soda to smother it out.</p></div>		</li>
