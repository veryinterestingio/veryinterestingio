			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding on it's consistency in measuring and shape.  You don't need a mold to have consistently shaped cookies but you do need to have them be the same size, not using a spoon to measure out about the right amount, and having the same shape, no lopsided blobs of dough.  There's also the quality control at the end.  Anything not meeting quality requirements are taking out so you don't see the defective ones, though those should be few or you're not going to be making cookies for long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Managing your defects/waste products is a huge part of it.  In many molded plastic products they may have regrind.  It's not as impure as recycled but helps reduce waste when materials don't meet specs.  Baby Cut carrots are a prime example of a product that couldn't be sold to humans because it wasn't pretty and sold for feed then reprocessed, cut to be pretty and small, to be sold to humans.  At the same time if you're making a peanut butter cookie and everyone is buying chocolate cookie pieces you'll struggle (not a literal example but used for illustrative purposes).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually some biscuit recipes create TONS of failures, but that's okay so long as you have a second product that can use biscuit crumbs. Quite a few biscuit factories also produce biscuit crumb bases for ready made desserts.</p></div>		</li>

<p>yeah, but we're talking cookies.  (Sorry, I had to).</p>
<p>That is true that there will be tons but it's not going to be a large percentage.  Even then it only helps as long as they have those outlets.  A large business like Mondelez will have several products across their portfolio to take care of rejects but they didn't always exist.  Graham crackers were around for a long time before Graham cracker pie crusts (as an example).  A newer company won't have those sources to sell their rejects.  Another example of that is saw dust is a byproduct of making lumber.  It used to just be burned because no one had a way to get rid of it.  Then it started being sold to make pulp for other processes, particle board, or filling for food products.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As others said you don't want to always count on waste having value nor other side build a business around someone else's waste, in manufacturing I've seen people burned on both sides</p>
<p>Waste outlets tend to have lower margins so their is incentive to always eliminate it. And if you build a pie business thinking you have a cheap crust and your supplier fixes his process, now you need to pay more to buy good product to crumble.  Best to see if your business can be sustainable at that model and take the times you can get the waste as increased profits... Same on the supply side always eliminate the waste and plan to have to dispose of it and take the sale of waste as extra profit if you find an outlet.... Leads to better decisions long term.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I pop it into the freezer for 5 minutes then convince myself that it made a difference lol</p></div>		</li>
