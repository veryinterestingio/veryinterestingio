			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to heat, 'current leakage' is an issue. When currents move so fast, the 'gates' stopping them aren't strong enough to halt their flow. They can also degrade over time and get weaker.</p>
<p>No analogy is perfect, but I like to think of it as cars and an intersection. If all cars are moving at a reasonable speed, we have time to see the red light and stop. If we're driving 200 mph, we see the red light but we can't stop in time so we cross into the intersection with cars moving another direction - which causes a crash.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is that like when you're playing Kerbal space program and you've fucked up and your rocket's speeding so fast that the CPU tick rate doesn't have time to realise it impacted something because it's already moved through it?  </p>
<p>Except... it's real life?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The odds of that happening with current setups is extraordinarily unlikely. That being said, I still blame this or cosmic rays flipping a bit all the time whenever some spooky stuff happened only once, could never be replicated, and the code very clearly doesn't allow for that failure state to occur without the introduction of sorcery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an electron doesn't see the light and attempt to decelerate, I find this analogy works better. Hold a piece of paper under a dripping faucet. When the water hits the paper, it abruptly stops. But over time, as more water drips on and stops on the paper, the paper becomes waker and weaker until water is allowed to drip through it. Not all at once perhaps, maybe there is a slow beading of water on the other side. The same as when an electrons force compels it to seek an exit, the water too will find a way through the weaker barrier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And if we had superconductor cpu so theoretically it has no resistance = no heat what would be the limit? I've heard that current cpu frequencies are almost all we can get from silicone so I assume it's somehow tied with element itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Superconductors won't help you, the heat generated by CPUs isn't because of resistance.</p>
<p>To turn a transistor on you have to charge a capacitor on the gate, to turn it off you have to discharge that capacitor to ground.  The energy is burned off in the channel of another transistor that is pulling the charge out.  Changing all the copper and gold wires in the CPU to a high temperature super conductor would save you maybe a watt on high end CPUs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course the heat is generated by resistance, there is no other thing that makes heat out of current. Charging a capacitor itself does not create heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the question becomes whether high temp superconductors could be used for heat transfer. Theoretically, the whole piece of superconductor would be the same temperature. So if you have continuous superconductor from the core to a big sheet of it in a tank of cooled liquid, you may have a really efficient cooling mechanism. Also, you could mechanically separate the liquid from the electronics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To turn on a transistor you do not charge a capacitor. Since you used the word &quot;gate&quot; then I am assuming you are talking about MOSFET. A MOSFET only needs voltage applied. Current doesn't need to even flow into the gate to turn on a MOSFET, well there's capacitance already be gate but this that is easy to drain and don't get me started on Miller's or paracitic capacitance.  I think you might be confusing by SDRAM which uses a capacitor but that capacitor is not too turn the transistor</p>
<p>The majority of CPUS are built in CMOS or finFET process none of those use a capacitor to turn the transistor on. Google &quot;CMOS logic gates&quot; then you'll see how the FETs are arranged you can even try it out with real transistors.</p>
<p>If you wanted keep a MOSFET on for a long time, then you would charge a capacitor and connect it to the gate, but then it would be much easier to get a p channel MOSFET and tie the gate to ground to keep the transistor on.</p>
<p>Back in my younger days I used to build CPUs and other logic circuits out of discrete transistors. I have tried all different methods RTL, TTL, DTL, PMOS, NMOS, CMOS etc, etc. I like CMOS
Now days is much easier, I just use an FPGA, and describe the logic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Within reason. We can only cool the surface of the processor, which to be fair is fairly thin. But at the core, where the heat is being generated, that heat can only reach the surface by heating up it's surroundings. It's basically the square-cube law but for heat generation in computing. </p>
<p>We can move heat roughly proportional to temperature difference, which means the hotter something is, the quicker we can move heat away from it. </p>
<p>This is good to a point, because taken with the top consideration, there will be a point in which your heat generation overtakes the benefits of an enhanced temperature difference. </p>
<p>And the rate at which heat is generated is not proportional to speed. It's more like speed squared. So a doubling of speed is 4x the heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given that heat is the limiting factor there must be very expensive cooling systems in existence that can allow processors to run at least a little faster. </p>
<p>Do you happen to know how fast, the fastest processor in existence is?</p>
<p>Edit- never mind Googled it - 8.429 GhZ although it required liquid nitrogen and helium to keep it from melting...</p></div>		</li>
