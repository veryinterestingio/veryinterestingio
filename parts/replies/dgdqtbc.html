<p>Basically, things get solid because when they're colder, the molecules are moving slower, and if they're moving slow enough, they stick to each other and kinda snap into place.</p>
<p>With water, the molecules are very small and simple, so there's really only one way they can snap together. So once it gets below a certain temperature and they're going slow enough to snap together in that way, <em>all</em> of the water snaps together and becomes a solid crystal pretty suddenly, because it's either cold enough to snap together or not.</p>
<p>But things like alcohols are much more complex, they're long chains of atoms, so there are <em>lots</em> of different ways for them to fit together and snap to each other. So as it gets colder, the molecules start going slowly enough to snap together in some ways, but not others - so depending on how they run into each other, they might stick, or they might not, and you get a kind of in between syrupy stage, where some of the molecules are sticking and some aren't. If it keeps getting colder, eventually they're going slow enough that any time the molecules get close to each other they stick together, and you get a solid.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you look at something like various simple alcohols, they also have a hydrocarbon tail, which gives more ways for the molecules to interact with each other. So when it's cold enough for this particular interaction to be stable, there's still that other one that's going to keep everything moving. Thus an increase in viscocity. And then length of the chain matters. If you have both methanol and isopropanol in a dry ice bath, the iso will be visibly syrupy while the methanol is pretty much the same as room temperature.</p>

<p>Would that mean that viscosity comes in discrete stages?</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's a really interesting question.   Supposing it was feasible to quantify all possible intermolecular interactions, I suppose the distributions would not necessarily be smoothly continuous.   However, the bulk properties of the substance is going to be a composite of all those interactions, and I doubt the deviation from continuous behaviour would be within our ability to measure.</p></div>		</li>
