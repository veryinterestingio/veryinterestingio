<p>My mother in law has been given 13 months to live, but it doesn’t seem like anything has changed for her at all. </p>
<p>This gives me a little perspective on how things will progress.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My father was given 6 months. Made it 7. He was fine until about 3 months from death. That's when his health was very noticeably declining. I had talked to him about doing one last golf trip about 2 weeks before he passed. Prepare yourself, cancer sucks. And in my dads case it was fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My friend's father was diagnosed, he was told he would likely live for another six months. He lived for three months. His funeral was a week or so after he passed, and a week after his funeral his wife fell ill. She passed away a week after that - still within the same month of her husband's death. It turned out she'd had ovarian cancer but it was never diagnosed - they found out post-mortem.</p>
<p>Cancer: it is pernicious and relentless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's how my Dads was, well the cancer that finally ended him he had 7 bouts over 10 or so years. Turns out working every day in the sun smoking 3 packs a day is bad for you, who knew? I did get to be with him the last month. He was a commercial fisherman and he loved his job. We took the boat out one last time with the owner and office staff just to be out on the ocean one last time. Got a call some fish were spotted so my Dad said fuck it and pulled in one last haul. I'll never forget that day</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry to hear that. I know all too well how a terminal diagnosis can progress. A close personal friend was diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer. He had about 6 months. Unfortunately he passed away about 2 years ago.</p>
<p>That's not to say everyone's experience with terminal cancer will be the same. She may go downhill in a couple days at the end or you may see a steady decline over that year. I pray to God it's the former. As someone who has seen it happen, watching someone waste away is.....heart wrenching.</p>
<p>It's your spouse's (and your) job to not treat them like a cancer patient or someone who is already dead.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>my dad was diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer, metastic to spine, femur, everywhere and he was healthy as a horse when diagnosed. No doctor thankfully ever gave us a timeline. He lived another 7 years. enough time for me to go to med school, graduate, start residency. The last 3 years were rough, mostly from all the therapies and all the mass effect of the tumor itself.</p>
<p>Edit: he was age 60 when he was diagnosed and black. I added this bit because there are sometimes controversy around PSA testing recommendations</p>
<p>Edit #2: I am seeing lots of statements about Prostate Cancer being the least aggressive. &quot;Most people will die of something else with their prostate cancer rather than die from it&quot;. These are indeed mostly true. Most forms are indeed indolent and slow growing. Most, not all. If you're black or have a family history of early-ish prostate cancer, consult with your urologist and weigh your options very carefully. Those popular narratives may not apply to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>God yes.  Quite a few family members have died of cancer, and I've watched it progress fast and slow.  100%, I'd prefer fast.  My grandmother went slow, and she ended up with a basketball sized open wound, a hole in her side, for months.  Her body was too worn down for it to heal, so she had to have nurses clean and pack it with gauze, but she couldn't do much.  Couldn't move around, lived in constant pain and misery.</p>
<p>I'd far, FAR rather be fine, then suddenly get very sick and die.  Everyone dies, it's not death I really fear, it's spending months suffering like that with an inevitable, inexorable death at the end of it.  That's what's really terrifying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you don't have personal experience with a family member, you can look at the state of the world right now. Country feels fine, sure it's one or two people, it's grand. Then within a week it's a few hundreds, and within a month it's a few thousands and it just doesn't seem to stop.</p>
<p>That's how it works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, here's the way exponential growth feels from the ground.  </p>
<p>Let's say I know about 100 people.  Right now less than 1% of the country has had Covid19 so it is unlikely that I would know anyone who has gotten sick.  </p>
<p>Now let's pretend the number of patients doubles everyday (this is wrong.  So far it looks more like every 3-5 days.  Also, the doubling rate will slow as more potential hosts already have it.)</p>
<p>When I finally know one person who has it, that means that probably about 1% of the people in the country have it as well.  From 1% to 64% in exponential growth (doubling everyday) is 1 week.  </p>
<p>So from the time it actually becomes personal for most of us to the time we all have it will feel instantaneous.  At least versus all these weeks in which we are hiding out and waiting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, its starts as nothing more than being a little more tired than usual.  That's because your blood is overtaken by white blood cells and there isn't enough room for red blood cells.  You also appear pale and get unexplained bruises.  Its then that you go to the doctor and are diagnosed.</p>
<p>And people continue to feel fine enough.  Its the medicine that makes you feel the worst.</p></div>		</li>

My world fell out from under me when I heard the &quot;c word&quot;.  Agressive surgery removed it, scans and blood tests show no further cancers, but everytime I get a red spot or white head I worry until it's gone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Melanoma survivor here! I had all of my lymph nodes in my leg removed. The good side about Melanoma is that it's not the type of cancer that &quot;goes into remission&quot;. once it's out of your body, you're cured! </p>
<p>if you're unlucky to get it again, they are separated and unrelated cases. Visit your dermatologist!</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm sorry this happened to you.</p>
<p>You have to remember, however, the reason you got scared, that your world crumbled, is that you felt you had more to gain from this world. You wanted (want) to live your life. If you live in fear, however, you are not allowing yourself to actually live the life that you so wanted. Be attentive, but never scared. Your life is too important to waste.</p></div>		</li>

<p>P.S. A biochemical blood test in January did not show anything abnormal. I tend to do these a lot, at least twice per year.</p></div>		</li>
