			<div class="markdown"><p>If you dump a bunch of puzzle pieces on a table, you increased the entropy of the system of puzzle pieces. It took energy to dump those puzzle pieces on the table. Energy from the sun, that was inefficiently converted to sugar by plants, that you ate for energy. So the entropy of the puzzle pieces increased as did the entropy in the whole of the universe because of the energy expended to throw them on a table.</p>
<p>You can then lower the entropy of the system of puzzle pieces by putting the puzzle back in the box how you found it or by solving the puzzle. However, that takes more energy still. The entropy in the whole of the universe still increased when you lowered the entropy of the system of puzzle pieces. </p>
<p>Another way to look at it is that increasing entropy means that some parts of the system will be more orderly than others at some points. In that case, it's just more likely by sheer chance that order will sometimes increase locally, even if overall, everything tends towards disorder.  If you shake a box full of billiard balls, it's more likely that you'll get clumps in some places and empty spots in others instead of a uniform distribution that's the same everywhere but if those balls started stacked in perfect little pyramids, it's going to be hard or next to impossible getting back to that configuration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scrolling through the answers, but I'll jump in randomly here.</p>
<p>How is it that none of the answers I read so far give honorary mention to gravity, a force (or phenomenon, if you prefer) that is in direct opposition to entropy?</p>
<p>In the example here of the table, there would also be an additional aspect that the table is curved or warped, so even if you dumped puzzle pieces on the table, they would increase in entropy only if the shape of the table is not sloping inward, because if it is, entropy would decrease as they all bunched at the bottom.  Just an analogy of course, but gravity does have a similar effect against entropy, shouldn't we say?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this a bit, I believe the reason *why* some of these interesting forms of localized lower states of entropy exists and persist in a stable form for long-ish times is that they facilitate the flow of usable energy in a way that increases the entropy of the system faster.</p>
<p>So a river is like a localized lowered state of entropy that facilitates the flow of useful potential energy of water up high into less useful energy in the form of heat, etc. Water could still get down without a river, just not as fast. And a river is somewhat stable in that if you obstruct it a bit, the flow of water tends to remove that obstruction over time.</p>
<p>Some other examples of localized lowered states of entropy: organisms near hydrothermal vents that transfer the heat into the cold ocean more quickly, plants, soil bacteria, and probably a whole bunch of other interesting things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok so things are actually very &quot;entropic&quot; and in &quot;disorder&quot; around us(our sun and galaxy)</p>
<p>The universe is mostly empty(like reaaaaaly empty) the pockets of order like our &quot;local&quot; position in universe are really a few compared to rest emptiness, like microbes in you glass of water, very few compared to water itself  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And planets them self try to get further away from sun even each moment(year), and the sun will eventually die killing what remains of our planet</p></div>		</li>
