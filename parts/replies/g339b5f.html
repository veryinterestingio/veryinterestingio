			<div class="markdown"><p>Your PCP can do it for you usually. It’s not very invasive or dangerous because it’s literally just some OTC drops. That or they’ll just flush your ear with normal saline and use a plastic tool to scrape out earwax.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had one of those come out too. Went to the clinic complaining of slight hearing loss in one ear. They used a syringe of just warm water and a pan under my ear to catch the water and flushed it. Ended up with something about the size of what you had. They did the same thin to my other ear as well and found about the same size clump! Leaving there it was like i could hear colours! You ever watch a movie where someone suddenly has psychic powers and can hear everyone's thoughts...it was like that! Like I could hear my pants rubbing against the seat of my car. </p>
<p>Since then I bought one of those bulbs you use to suck out snot from a baby's nose and flush out my ears every few weeks. Get a raisin size clump a month or so. I asked if there was anything I was doing wrong to have my ears make so much wax and the Dr said no, it just happens. I never use q-tips luckily otherwise I bet things could have been really bad!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahhh, I’ve had one of those raisins before. I could hear it moving around inside my ear for a couple of days and then it kind of just fell out on its own when I was sleeping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For anyone who wishes to clean your ears out from compacted wax, 1st I would recommend going to the regular doctor in a box to have a first time cleaning. Any time I went they used a ear washing kit with drops.</p>
<p>You can actually buy ear washer kits which is basically a spray bottle with a small tube that flushes your ears of the wax. Use the drops to soften the wax and then the flush kit to clean out the ear.</p>
<p>Of course if you don't feel comfortable doing it yourself or are worried about damaging your ears, any regular quick care facility will usually do it pretty cheap and fast.</p></div>		</li>
