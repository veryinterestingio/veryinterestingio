			<div class="markdown"><p>I think people are just used to calling them baked potatoes, so it became the name for any whole potato prepared in the oven. Some people wrap their baked potatoes in aluminum foil, but that steams them, it doesn’t bake them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think roasting (at least in the context of potatoes and other veggies) is often at a higher temperature as well though. </p>
<p>When I bake potatoes whole I want to bake them at a lower temperature so the inside can be cooked before the outside browns too much. When I'm roasting, I have usually either parboiled the potatoes or have cut them up small enough that roasting at 425F conv. is enough to cook them through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I think there are probably plenty of variations now, but you have to think traditionally, and where the name originated from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Light coating of oil, and then salted, helps give a nice thick crust for a good baked potato (IMHO).  I find that without the oil, the skin is often just soft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly. What is being described above is just oven-roasted potatoes which further supports the answer</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup this is what I came here to say.  When something is roasted, I picture it being either slathered in fat or oil, or otherwise having enough fat it it naturally that it gets that crustiness naturally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this isn’t really correct. The difference has to do with temperature, with roasting typically ranges from 400-475. While Baking occurs at temperatures lower than 400, usually ranging from 300-375. Something that is baked is also sometimes covered throughout all, or a portion of cooking. While Roasting can contain fat on the exterior so can baking. Also you can think of roasting as breaking down a foods particular structure, while baking can be considered as creating a structure, although this isn’t always the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope if you read the part where I said it is generally dependent on temperature but not always true. Seeing as you are creating a structure it would be baking.</p></div>		</li>
