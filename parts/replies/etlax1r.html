			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps if food levels dropped it became more advantageous to be smaller because you need less food to survive?</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, it will always link back to natural selection and evolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought that one reason species are smaller today is that the larger species were wiped out in mass extinctions and only the smaller ones survived. That would back your suggestion as perhaps there had been enough time between mass-extinction events for the previous animals to have grown to such a size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They have not just become smaller over time. At various points they have become smaller and bigger based on the climate they are in at the time. Often they will be doing both at the same time in different places in response to the local environment.</p>
<p>Early man dealt with elephants that were much bigger than the ones we have now, but they also dealt with elephants that were much smaller than what we have now, only the size of a fairly large dog.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also,
Warmer climate favors smaller animals cause they have more surface to volume ratio. Therefore they radiate heat better.
Mammoths vs. Elephants come to mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another very important event is that humans learned to Hunt. Big animals are usually slower and take longer to reproduce. </p>
<p>On mobile now but I remember I Read some here that once humans set foot on ground in Australia, almost all large animal species were extinct in a short periode of time.</p></div>		</li>
