			<div class="markdown"><p><del>The five second rule is just a cheap way of communicating this message to the masses that food left on the ground for extended periods of time is less safe then newly dropped food.</del></p>
<p><del>There isn't a cutoff point. There's just a point that's pretending to be a cutoff point to spur you into immediate action. I'll still be much better if the food was only on the a ground for a single second then it would be at three, but nothing will eliminate the possibility of infecting germs in your food completely anyway. There even a chance for getting infected without the food ever touching the ground, through airborne germs.</del></p>
<p><del>The five second rule is a health mentality to live by but in strict reality, things are much much muddier then that.</del></p>
<p>Edit: The next guy summarizes it better and kinder then I do. Read him instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, it shouldn't be a timed thing, it should be a &quot;how sticky is the item&quot; rule.  if I drop a dry cookie on the kitchen floor, it can be there for half an hour and its still fine, as dry stuff isn't picking up the dirt and gross stuff, like dropping pudding on the floor... Now THAT there is zero second rule, sticky/wet items will be taking \~half of the dirt/grime/bacteria within a microsecond of it touching...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So there is no number of seconds, use common sense and judge based on what the food is.... Hard candy? pfff 10 hour rule. Fresh apple slice? rinse that thing off even if was only there for .420 seconds</p></div>		</li>
