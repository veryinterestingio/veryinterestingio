<p>Bread is supposed to be soft, so adding nitrogen to the bag wouldn't solve anything, but it would add to the cost.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Seriously though, I'd assume that since the reason for chip bags being crinkly is that it associates to crispy chips in your mind, then since you hope your bread is soft, they make a soft and quiet packaging for it? Just my guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly because chips oxidize and bread does not. The oil on chips will oxidize and give the chips a rancid taste. The plastic used for chips (usually a biaxially orientated polypropylene, 2 layers with aluminum metallization) is good at keeping oxygen molecules out of the package and from reacting with the oil to make the rancid flavor.</p>
<p>Bread behaves much differently and does not oxidize (at least not in the same way) and therefore uses a Low Density polyethylene film that just keeps moisture out/in but let's oxygen into the bag. Bread usually goes stale by loosing moisture. So a film that doesn't let moisture through it will keep moisture in the bag with the bread better.</p></div>		</li>
