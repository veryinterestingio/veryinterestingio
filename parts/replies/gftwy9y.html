<p>Computer equipment can apparently be easily discounted around black friday. Some models went down from $800 to $650 and back to $800. Never heard of any  haggling about computer prices though. This is all in Europe, so your mileage may vary.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't see this changing any time soon.</p>
<p>Basically the computer industry is split into two categories: Apple and Not-Apple.</p>
<p>Not-Apple products have <em>really</em> tight margins.
Bought a $500 graphics card on sale?
The retailer probably only made a few bucks off you.
Every stop along the chain (manufacturer, OEM, distributor, retailer, etc.) is seriously fighting over pennies.
It's one of the most competitive markets with the tightest margins.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, this is why you often find computer stores trying to shove non-computer stuff at you whenever you buy a computer.
Cables and shit have margin.)</p>
<p>Apple products have big margins, but they're all Apple's.
Apple is such a strong authoritarian that retailers are pretty much totally powerless to charge something that Apple doesn't want them to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure the computer shop in my city makes 90%+ of their money from selling warranties and building peoples’ computers for them. There can't be much money in price matching Amazon. I still buy from them to “support local” but I do wonder how much I’m actually helping as a person who walks in with a list of best prices, builds myself and denies all extended warranties.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just the right store but the right model. I worked for one of the UK based retailers (Richer Sounds) that sells both TV and audio. </p>
<p>For TV's our profit on a set could range from -£50 to +£600 the average though only being between £10 and £30 profit so we rarely knocked money off unless you were trying to haggle on one of the high profit models, high price not being the same as high profit. Or if you came in for the loss leader in which case we would often sell you the next model up at close to cost to protect our targets.</p>
<p>Audio was where there was a lot of room to negotiate. Speakers had an average of 40% profit, the separates again has a very healthy margin. Cables were almost all profit, the cheapest speaker cable sold for £1 per metre but cost 9p, the £20 per metre cost £1.20, interconnects were no different. If any audio was involved in the deal then we were always happy to knock a little off of the total.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to be in home theater sales until about 7 years ago. When flat screens were the newest rage, we were all bringing home huge ass checks from commission. I was in a store that could negotiate and we had A LOT of room to work with. Was making about 80k a year and was barely trying, it was that easy. Then, all the manufacturers dropped the profit margin to barely anything so negotiating became damn near impossible as well as any decent commission. TV stands would have to take the brunt of the price cut as furniture has always and will always have a high mark up.</p></div>		</li>
