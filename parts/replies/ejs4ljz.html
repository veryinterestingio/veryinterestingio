			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially, yes. It’s been about 4 years since I did this so I don’t remember the exact derivation (
I just realized this as I was was writing the initial post). I’ll need to look up my notes for this though. What I didn’t like about the course was that we just ended up deriving 1 or 2 phase transition cases, I wish we dug through more examples. I was doing this class for fun so I was pretty interested in doing as much as I could.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP asked explicitly whether scientists expect there to be a difference between 10^-10 K and 10^-15 K, implying they know about superconductivity and BEC.</p>
<p>You didn't answer the question at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apologies ! I completely forgot about that. I actually don’t know what happens at that level, it might be possible to theoretically formulate that but it’ll be very weird (and interesting). </p>
<p>Ranting on that, I wonder how much of a statistical variation would exist for matter particles at those temperature ranges. Maybe there might be different ways to formulate ensembles.</p></div>		</li>
