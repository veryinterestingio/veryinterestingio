			<div class="markdown"><p>Whenever I go to bed and lay on my side... It takes a minute.. Then I flex that knee and it goes POP and althought I don't feel anything... It &quot;feels&quot; good.</p>
<p>But I can crack my eel non stop. Sometimes even when I walk. I fear it might cause me problems later on tho</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I rotate my left foot and &quot;stretch out&quot; my leg at the same time, my knee, shin(?), and ankle all pop so loud and it feels so good. No idea what's happening really but I'll get it amputated later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are different kinds of pops. Some pops come from tendons or ligaments catching and snapping, which can be varying degrees of painful and/or damaging I believe. In my anecdotal experience any type of repeatable popping is harmful to me if I do it repetitively and probably harmful in the long term to some degree whereas non-repeatable pops are fine and never cause any soreness or discomfort</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This needs to be upvotes, not every crack and pop is gas escaping from facet joints, it could be articulating cartilage, or ligaments rupturing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A great example would be my hip, which I’ve broken.  There’s now narrowing in the joint, causing hip impingement.  So when I move certain ways I get pops.  They don’t hurt, but it’s caused by increased friction and is damaging to the cartilage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Knuckles I don’t know. My left ankle pops as a result of a teenage injury. I’ll notice some soreness in my knee because the bones in my ankle have shifted ever so slightly, causing my walking gait to change ever so imperceptibly. I don’t feel anything in my ankle but if I pull on it at a certain angle, it makes a huge pop and the soreness goes away.</p></div>		</li>
