			<div class="markdown"><p>Expanding on this to explain how it’s measured.</p>
<p>A blood pressure cuff is inflated until blood flow is cut off to the lower portion of the arm. A stethoscope is then placed below where the blood has been cut off.</p>
<p>Pressure is slowly released until the blood is able to pass the inflated cuff, this blood flow is able to be heard with the stethoscope and is called the Systolic blood pressure.</p>
<p>The cuff pressure continues to be slowly released until the pulsing sound goes away which is the point at which the resting hearts pressure is no longer meeting resistance at the cuff and that is referred to as Diastolic blood pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Expanding further on this - the Unit  of measure used is “Millimeters of Mercury” or mmHg. Old Blood pressure monitoring devices used to have mercury in them (like old thermometers) nowadays we still use the unit of measure but the devices no longer have mercury in them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do they have something that's physically equivalent to mercury, or do they read a different number and convert it? Or is the scale on the device skewed so it does the conversion at reading?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My doctor has used the manual method for about 25 years, on me anyway. The nurse will sometimes use the machine, but if the Dr ever checks it, it's manual, and it's always a different number by 5-10...uh...pressures, or whatever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of them still use microphones. They are a huge time saver but you gotta watch out for variables. Too big or too small of a cuff can affect the reading. Anything wild gets a manual measurement, nothing beats your own ears.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A BP below 120/80 is considered “normal”. Although it varies from person to person, generally BP is considered low when it’s under 90/60 and high when it’s 140/90 or above. The more important thing is to look at what your blood pressure normally is for you, and to look for trends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slight correction, 120/80 exactly is the textbook figure rather than below 120/80. </p>
<p>The normal range is as you've said with high/low values. Anecdotally I'd put a common range between 110-135 systolic.</p></div>		</li>
