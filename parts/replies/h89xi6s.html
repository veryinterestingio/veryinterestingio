<p>This wasn't even delta/lambda etc. strain, it was late last year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention they’ve found virus particles deep in ducts that could only have been reached by air borne spread assisted by central AC, I’ll take a look for the article but there’s no question that if extra precautions aren’t taken for an individual AC unit (I.e. higher merv filters etc.) then the AC can spread the virus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>what kind of filter will block a virus? I would think you need something more than HEPA filter since the virus is so small? Also if there are filters that good, its going to kill your air conditioner due to how much the compressor will have to work. </p>
<p>how do you filter for a virus then?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's difficult for an infected individual to emit isolated virus molecules into the air. The vast vast majority are suspended in drops of water with countless others. If you capture the droplets, you capture over 99% of the virus. </p>
<p>That said, it is common for hospitals to have separate ventilation systems in the infectious vs non-infectious floors or areas to further reduce the spread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeahhhhhh.... I had to deal with that after using &quot;the best&quot; filter which one supposedly changes every 3 months.  Now still use the same filter but has to be changed at least monthly.  Froze the compressor, the pipe, and the evaporator coil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Viral particles are usually moving around within little water droplets, so a HEPA might very well catch most of them maybe?</p>
<p>Airplanes have been shown to be relatively low at spreading COVID because of multiple reasons (masks required, etc) but one reason is that the recycled cabin air is HEPA filtered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this. A news article I read stated it’s also because planes refresh the inside air every couple of minutes. They illustrated it nicely here: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/17/travel/flying-plane-covid-19-safety.html" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/17/travel/flying-plane-covid-19-safety.html</a></p>
<p>Air is refreshed roughly every two to three minutes — a higher rate than in grocery stores and other indoor spaces, experts say. It’s one reason, in addition to safety protocols, that there have not been many superspreader events documented on flights.</p></div>		</li>
