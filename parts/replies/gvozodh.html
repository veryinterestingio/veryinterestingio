			<div class="markdown"><p>I've noticed that a lot of people who are into using these wipes are weirdly insistent that they're okay to flush, even when they have to call a plumber who then also tells them to stop flushing the wipes. Like that's happened multiple times, just in my own little anecdotal world. </p>
<p>It's interesting too because I don't think anyone flushes baby wipes used to wipe actual babies, but for some reason when an adult uses one it's like oh yeah of course this goes in the toilet. If you could flush these, wouldn't parents have been tossing them in the toilet for years now instead of keeping them in a gross little specialized trash can in a bedroom?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was under the assumption there is because false advertising is straight up lying about your product. It's not &quot;misleading&quot; for the example of &quot;flushable wipes&quot;. </p>
<p>It clearly telling users this is safe and ok to do even though many waste management facilities have come out &amp; said stop, this is not OK. These wipes are not flush-safe.</p></div>		</li>
