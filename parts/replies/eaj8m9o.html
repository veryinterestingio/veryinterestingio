			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but I'm pretty sure that happens in non-schizophrenics too. Thinking a word and hearing it (or saying it) activate very similar brain regions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. I believe one of the main differences are the feedback loops and the usage of the muscular system, for whether or not we want to vocalize something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but when you remember someone's voice that area is activated too. That happens in the temporal lobe. The problem in schizophrenia is more global, although it primarily happens in the frontal lobe, where you cognitively interpret those &quot;sounds&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Post-birth and during puberty, your brain network undergoes a lot of changes. From memory -- and it's been a while -- post-birth is trimming down unneeded neural pathways that are superceded or not required, while pubescent changes involve turning lots of simple pathways into complex networks, then trimming away the unneeded and/or now-redundant simple pathways when they've been replaced by a complex one.</p>
<p>This is why prolonged/chronic drug use during puberty can have an effect on brain chemistry - you're playing with receptors while your brain's trying to actually reconstruct itself, to a degree. It isn't going to do a grand job with all that interference.</p>
<p>A neurologist is probably going to come in here and bitchslap me for my comment.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all schizophrenic people hear malicious voices. But when that happens it's another associated problem, usually related to the brain amygdala, which is a cluster of several nuclei that participate in the negative emotional associations.</p>
<p>It's not completely unrelated to schizophrenia, it's not necessarily a coincidence. Some of these synapses problem are not local, but global.</p>
<p>But it's not a well understood problem in its entirety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard from psychologists and testimony from some schizophrenics that the voices generally aren't malicious or &quot;dark&quot; until people tell them they should be, or that they're crazy or broken for hearing them. Until then it was just running commentary, essentially. Outside stigmatization made it negative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i just finished living with a best friend of 10+ years. we had always smoked a lot of pot together thru uni, we parted way for a while and then living together the past year...</p>
<p>he was open and honest about hearing voices, would often ask me to confirm if i had said something. but he was getting himself at work by speaking back to the voices; and did the same with our neighbours. </p>
<p>he was convinced (and still) that the voices are a sort of super power and let him know deep truths about what ppl r thinking etc.</p>
<p>this guy has a philosophy degree, no fool. maybe not enough love. he’d found his father’s pot stash at 12 years of age and so began smoking waaaay too early.</p>
<p>i’m a terrible pot head, have been for more than half of my life. this is the first iv really seen pot induced schizophrenia. i’m also a psych graduate and generally am in my element helping people thru mental health crises... but this shit was fucked. </p>
<p>he stopped smoking pot but the symptoms were continuing, amidst his relationship and family breaking up, i think i heard every one of his family members cut him off, standing by the partner he’s disease often targeted. some nights i would think he was out to kill her the vitriolic spiels 5towards the only person in the world looking out for u and raising ur kids...</p>
<p>legit lost my best mate over it.</p>
<p>i think w regard to the question about a malicious tone in the voices, i think u need to appreciate the psychomimetic properties of the brain mistakenly feeding misinformation back on itself. </p>
<p>eg i am insecure socially. these cyclical thoughts which i align as other’s speech will turn cynical/ malicious in confirming suspicious / insecure thoughts. like someone above said, it affects the neurology globally... and so all thoughts funnel down to the belief in our to confirm i guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good question. There is a cultural componant to this. In the U.S. those with schizophrenia who have audio hallucinations often hear negative, adversarial voices, while in India it is not uncommon for those with schizophrenia to hear positive, supportive voices of family members.</p></div>		</li>
