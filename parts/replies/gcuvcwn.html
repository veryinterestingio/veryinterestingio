			<div class="markdown"><p>In this specific mRNA vaccine, the live virus is not present at all. Rather a synthetic copy of its genome, allowing your body to build up antibodies against the spike proteins on the surface of the virus once the synthetic mRNA has been translated by the patient’s own ribosomes. In layman’s terms, this copy lets your body build up a defense against the virus, without being exposed to any real or weakened virus. It’s actually an incredible step in vaccine development.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh boy, going to bed here but always was a battle with doctors who seemed like they couldn't backseat to a Transplant specialist who was overseeing our daughter's care.</p>
<p>Once ENT tried to give her ibuprofen after her ear tube surgery, this was before transplant but in renal failure. This doctor knew of the history as well. I advised she couldn't have it due to kidney function, nurse shot back, &quot;no it's OK she's old enough (she was over 1 yr old at this point). I said go back to her Renal doctor and clear this. They came back with Tylenol.</p>
<p>After a survey doctor ordered IV solution (dx50 which is basic dextrose solution) however this was one dxK or something like that... The &quot;K&quot; for potassium. Again this was pre-transplant and the added potassium was not recommended for her poor kidney function. I advised the nurse to remove the IV... They tried to hang it again. I told her to get out of the room. The nurse then came back with a regular dextrose IV, and said the doctor corrected it.</p>
<p>Numerous times when dehydrated due to illness, emergency department doctor would not initiate contact with renal transplant team in regards to standard of care required, so I would end up ordering them to start maintence/bolus IV fluids and a range of blood tests and cultures. They didn't like that and ultimately did what I wanted because I had the supervising team call the ER. </p>
<p>We have had 12+ years of dealing with doctors and various specialists in regard to her kidney disease, and I always had to watch, correct, ask questions and speak up. I'm sure I'm forgetting things, but as a parent who's first child had numerous medical issues from the beginning, it made learning to raise an infant a trial by fire.</p></div>		</li>
