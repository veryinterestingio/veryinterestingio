			<div class="markdown"><p>Unexplained secondary infertility. We pretty much had our daughter by just staring at each other for a few minutes and winking.</p>
<p>Tried for two years before going the medical routes. Did the Chlomid thing, IUI'S with one loss very early into one of those rounds. It was a loooong, stressful journey. </p>
<p>A couple of months into the IVF prengnacy, we found out our four year old daughter had a brain tumor. Went through that, our daughter losing her sight in the second of four surgeries, all while pregnant.  Then had a kiddo birthed three months into our daughter becoming blind and starting a bunch of daily medications and life changes due to the lack of a pituitary gland and said blindness. </p>
<p>We became better parents than a couple through everything, unfortunately.  And then other crappily unexpected things followed. </p>
<p>But we have two incredible kids, so I'd do it over, even through the tremendous hurt. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you explain the small tube inserted into the mom part? And the rest, please? Why does it requires fewer blood tests? The tube is inserted where in the mom? Is the time tube open... Just anything, the science etc? Would appreciate it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as blood tests - there are some ivf protocols that do not stimulate the ovaries as much to produce a ton of eggs. If you’re not doing that it requires much less monitoring. Sometimes this is called a “natural IVF” cycle.</p>
<p>The tube: is placed in the mom’s vagina for the embryo to grow, then the tube is removed after 5 days, and then the now-blastocyst is taken out of the tube and placed back in mom’s uterus so it has a chance to implant and dig in and grow like a normally conceived embryo would. (Sidenote: mom’s uterus must be in the perfect, plush part of her cycle to receive the blastocyst. If it’s not the blast may be taken out of the tube and frozen until mom’s uterus is ready).</p>
<p>It’s less expensive because you’re not paying for laboratory space or monitoring from the lab professionals during those 5 days.</p></div>		</li>
