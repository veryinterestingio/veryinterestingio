			<div class="markdown"><p>So in fact as the KT boundary marks a transition to a completely new geological age, you should expect the number of fossils at the boundary to be <em>lower</em> than the layer below or above it. With the exception of the animals which died on the day of the event or within months afterward, the total animal population for the following several million years was relatively lower than before. </p>
<p>So <em>lack of fossils</em> is what you’d look for in an extinction event.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or to put another way, which scenario generates more bodies?</p>
<ol>
<li>A million creatures that all spawn a new generation, and then inevitably die... plus their descendants, plus descendants' descendants, and so on for a mere ten thousand years.</li>
<li>A million creatures that all go extinct in a single year,  followed by 9,999 years of nothing.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And when you consider the actual chances of fossilization, it’s perfectly plausible that there are few fossil beds dating from that exact day. The idea that there even is one of them is a testament to how predictive the meteorite theory turned out to be. Not knowing what they were looking for, researchers probably would not have found any.</p>
<p>And if people are wondering how rare fossilization is, I believe that the rough odds of a single specimen being preserved as a fossil and then discovered by us have been calculated as somewhere in the range of one out of a billion, or 0.0000001% if I haven’t dropped a digit somewhere.</p>
<p>That would mean essentially that of all the living humans today, one might expect the fossil record to yield only 6 specimens (most will never be found as they are buried under kilometers of rock or water), to some future researchers in 100m years. Of all humans who ever existed, just 100 specimens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer is 1., right? Which begs the question of is there are isolated locations of large amounts of fossils from the single year in 2.?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right.  Fewer total animals alive during a period means less chance any of them get fossilized.  Unless the extinction event itself happened to be uniquely suited to CREATING fossils...like a planet-wide mudslide or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I read the question, I immediately thought about the event in that article. While everything everyone has been saying about the number of death in a time period is true, there is also the matter of whether a particular event could change the frequency of fossil creation. Perhaps the major modes of deaths in the KT extinction meant that it was <em>less</em> likely for fossils to be created? Or some other type of event made it <em>more</em> likely. This kind of thing could happen as well as the normal fossil creation rate.</p></div>		</li>
