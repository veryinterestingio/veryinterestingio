			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there are many people who don't realize that there is a &quot;proper&quot; way to speak two languages at the same time. There are no written rules but there comes an understanding of when to switch back and forth between languages and at what point in a phrase/sentence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes this seems like the answer. I spend a lot of time with a Korean toddler and he's just learning both languages, so often he'll make a sentence with, &quot;It's a *insert Korean word here*&quot; or &quot;Ladybugiya!!!&quot; it's really cute lol</p></div>		</li>
