<p>Thankfully, modern techniques allow us to make steel without including the radioactive impurities of the air. However, this process is very expensive, so the pre-war steel is still often used.</p>

<p>It can be done, it's just cheaper to pull steel from shipwrecks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just melting and recasting it doesn't expose it too much. However, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_oxygen_steelmaking" target="_blank">smelting process</a> from pig iron into steel involves blasting a huge amount of high-pressure oxygen into the melt to increase temperatures and control carbon concentration in the output.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't need to melt metal to reshape it. we can do a lot with cold forming.  </p>
<p>You can heat good steel up without needing air too, air is used in a blast furncae to drive the 'blast' and burn out a lot of impurities in the ore. If you start with goodish steel, you can basically heat it up in an electric crucible before forming.</p></div>		</li>
