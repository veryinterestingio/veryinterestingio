			<div class="markdown"><p>On that subject, why doesn't every photon create a black hole? Aren't they basically point entities without any size? As little energy as they are, if divided by an infinitesimal volume that results in near infinite energy density. Am I misunderstanding photons?</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's your misunderstanding, they're not point sources. It'd be like asking how fast a string with zero length is vibrating</p></div>		</li>

<p>For example, a charged battery would register as ever so slightly heavier on a scale than an uncharged battery. This doesn't mean the battery is more massive or that there are more particles of matter present, </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, it does. It means the battery is more masisve, in both the gravitational and inertial sense. It's a frame invariant energy to that system, it's mass.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>This has funny consequences, like a kugelblitz- since light has energy it will curve spacetime, so it would be possible to create a black hole without any matter by just shining enough light in one spot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How massive is the least massive black hole? Do different types of energy have more or less gravitational influence than others? So many questions.</p>
<p>E=mcÂ² tells me that the amount of light energy required to do this would be virtually unimaginable.</p>
<p>Edit: smallest &gt; least massive</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The schwartzschild radius is defined as r = 2 G * m / c\^2. If the mass m is within the radius r, its  a black hole.  </p>
<p>So in principle you could have an arbitrarily low mass to form a black hole, you just need to put the mass (= energy) into a small radius. But there are at least two limits:</p>
<ol>
<li>hawking radiation: black holes &quot;evaporate&quot;. smaller ones faster, so very small black holes are very short lived. </li>
<li>quantum physics. When the scale is small enough, physics starts doing weird stuff. One example of this is that mass cannot be precisely localized. So the mass cant be confined to an abitrarily small radius, which puts a lower limit to black hole mass and radius. This mass limit equals roughly the planck mass, or 2.2e-8 kg</li>
