			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the very good and clear answer.  I was still alittle unsure, from what you said, if &quot;phase space&quot; itself can get capacity problems? The example of playing music in a room works, and maybe you can never fill the room, sound-wise, but the sound can become unintelligible. You can only get so much signal across a wire without losing intelligibility even though you can chop it up by frequency or time. Seprately, the memory palace examples - odern day contests - that there is a cost to store each memory and perhaps some limit on how many can be stored - but that may be an iput probrlem not a storage problem?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Richard Dawkins put forth a theory in 'The Selfish Gene' (I don't think it was completely original) that ideas and memories actually drove our brains to get larger and become more focused on this function.  He actually coined the term 'meme' to describe this phenomenon.  Susan Blackmore expanded this concept into 'memetics' and wrote a book about it called 'The Meme Machine'.  The concept is basically that ideas are using us as vessels to replicate and evolve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The meme as the idea analog to genes. This is one of my favorite descriptions of the natural phenomena of thought and memory. You can trace various ideas, almost like a tech tree in a strategy game. We have the technology, but we also have the culture. </p>
<p>This is why I implore people to think about the history of the ideology they follow. So many will latch onto the work of one person, and not explore the context in which that work was written. Almost all works of philosophy are responses to other ideas put forth at the time; it is imperative that one examine the historical context of any idea they explore. </p>
<p>Also, the idea that these ideas are evolving, meaning there are selective pressures on ideas to adapt or perish, is prudent these days, as we see an ideological struggle between Western Liberalism in the tradition of the Enlightenment, and the sort of Fascist Authoritarianism that creeps up every couple of decades to test democracy.</p>
<p>The problem is, the fascists don't see their historical context. They've been gas-lighted into believing they are on the side of liberty, that the other people seek to control their very existence. Which is sad, if only because it ruins healthy debate. Anyways, I ramble. Good plug on the Dawkins.</p></div>		</li>

<p>DUDE that's fuggin metal! Ive never heard of or thought of that before lol that's bananas! I like that idea but its also somewhat scary</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are physical limits to everything, but they may or may not be relevant.  As you overlap waves in any given medium, their combined amplitudes or frequencies could reach limits (e.g., sound waves cannot produce negative absolute pressures, wires begin to act as antennas) and losses due to, e.g., friction typically increase non-linearly with those amplitudes.  The more signals you want to distinguish in a given range, the more precision you would need in detecting them, and the more energy you need to represent them.</p>
<p>It's not uncommon to fail to recall something, only to have it come back later.  And in dementia it's not uncommon to recall very old things but fail to recall more recent things.  These errors hint at failures to detect patterns which clearly exist, failures to &quot;write&quot; new memories, or etc., but there is so much more going on than a simple metaphor can convey that it's probably a mistake to try and draw conclusions from it.</p>
<p>As another commenter pointed out, a key to &quot;functional&quot; memory is not just recalling information, being being able to connect one thing to another; our memory is useless if we can't remember the specific thing that we need at that moment, so finding the relevant thing among the millions of others is as important as being able to retain it in the first place.  Some memory failures are almost certainly in this associative behavior alone; all the necessary information is present but unreachable.  Other failures are probably in too many associations, resulting in a flood of useless information.   Unfortunately, as a system gets more complex the number of ways it can fail seems to increase exponentially.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A simple way to think of it might be to go back to the music example. If a few instruments play together, you can usually pick out one if you focus on it. If you try to cram too many sounds in at once, they're still all there but you've lost the ability to differentiate.  Organize them better, though, and you can increase the maximum number of instruments that still let you pick one out at a time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very interesting answer, and provides a good jumping off point  for a very complex and poorly understood phenomenon, but I would be very cautious about using neural networks as an explanatory model for brains. Their resemblance is mainly in name and inspiration at this point. what exactly the memories of a neural network would be is certainly not clear.</p></div>		</li>
