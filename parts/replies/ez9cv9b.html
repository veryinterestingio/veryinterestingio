<p>2005-2019 Both networks show similar data, and no significant warming. But they do show that those years have some of the hottest on record if not the hottest(2015-2018)</p>
<p>Before 2005 we only used one network, and if you use that previous data, you can clearly see a warming trend.</p>
<p>Are both of those statements true?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2019 is hotter than 110 of the last 125 years but is cooler than the last 3 years.</p>
<p>If you look at the data, it is pretty noisy.  Over a given 10 year period you will see 2-3 deg of variation, but over the last 100 years the average has gone up by 2-3 deg as well.  If you cherry pick data, you can say stuff like &quot;2013 was cooler than it was in 1901&quot;, which is technically correct but also misleading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The weather stations are all US based. So the US hasn't seen the same temp increases that the entire world has seen.  As the temp goes up it does so unevenly and some areas will get hotter faster than others. Some areas may even get cooler; the earth overall is getting hotter though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, both of those statements are true. They miss the point of the new data set however, which is to see how well our older data gathering correlates to the new highly accurate and unbiased sensors. Since the current data from the old gathering systems, and the current data from the new set correlate very well together, its incredibly likely that the old data is accurate as well. </p>
<p>And the old data shows a significant warming trend over a long period.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The wording is throwing me off.  What do you mean “correlate” and “correlate very well”.  Also what aspects of the data sets are being correlated. </p>
<p>Here is how I think of what I have read so far: Set a shows trend. Set b shows no trend. No correlation of trend. </p>
<p>It seems like the conclusion you are advancing is that the sensors for set a show a warning trend in whatever region they are deployed, while there is no warning trend in the regions where sat b is deployed.  In that case, the first set of sensors still needs to be verified for bias in some other fashion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The new network also confirms the accuracy of the old network. Since they are coming up with similar data, we can infer that the old system was indeed accurate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be honest - I see people on my side of climate change use weather to try and prove climate change.  It goes both ways.  A hotter than usual summer is not always the best evidence for climate change because there are many factors weather related that go into that - same with colder than usual weather.  The best test is the overall temperature.  And climate change doesn't mean every single place will be hot... it's more like - places that weren't hot will be and there will be some physical effects in the world around us due to that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it really is. Like he said, you would <em>expect</em> some to be lower. And none have been. So it's an unlikely outcome. </p>
<p>Which isn't necessarily proof of anything, but it's suspicious at least. </p>
<p>It's like flipping a coin 10 times in a row, and they're all heads. A perfectly valid and possible outcome, but wouldn't it at least make you question that there might be something wrong with the coin?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2005 is not an arbitrary date in this case, this is based off the 114 new weather stations placed by NOAA  throughout the US (the US Climate Reference Network) that actually comply with the National Weather Services's setting standards.  Meaning they are at least 100 feet from any artificial heat source, whereas up to 90% of the 1221 pre-existing weather stations did not comply with this standard, most them being in highly populated areas with an extensive amount of artificial heat.  Many were placed in unpopulated areas decades ago and had profound urban/suburban growth around them.   The new network doesn't have these issues and thus doesn't require the adjustments to the data made over the years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a very good point. </p>
<p>* If you look at a lot of major airports, where most official observations come from, the runways and ramp spaces have undergone massive expansion over the past few decades... DFW, ATL, ORD, etc.  These surfaces are huge heat sinks that drive up temperatures quite a bit in the summer.  It's hard to comprehend how any of this data can be used for long term averages.</p>
<p>* Urban sprawl is also very extensive in many cities now compared to the 1950s/1960s, and this has an effect on any stations embedded in these microclimates.</p>
<p>* Many official stations worldwide actually have terrible documentation and it's usually impossible for anyone to find <em>exact</em> coordinates, much less be able to review siting, insturmentation, and exposure.  Sure you'll get official lat/longs that get you down to the general airport site (US, UK, etc) but in most other cases (Russia, India, Mexico, etc not at major airports) you only get a ballpark coordinate for somewhere around the city, even in WMO records.  As an example, go try to find the sensors at Chicago O'Hare. Sites like Airnav report the KORD lat/long, but that's just the airfield reference point.  NOAA/NCDC metadata reports a location that is just aircraft aprons on satellite with no instruments visible at all.  And good luck trying to find a history on the equipment components.  We really can't start reviewing climate from aviation and synoptic sites when the records are in such shambles.  This is why networks like CRN are important; their documentation is immaculate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's true.  But to put it in context, a comparison of the <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/national-temperature-index/time-series?datasets%5B%5D=uscrn&amp;datasets%5B%5D=climdiv&amp;datasets%5B%5D=cmbushcn&amp;parameter=anom-tavg&amp;time_scale=12mo&amp;begyear=2000&amp;endyear=2019&amp;month=12" target="_blank">data for the new network and the other sources</a> line up nicely.  The result of the new network is primarily better confidence, not different conclusions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very good point, but the current consensus on this is that the USCRN data very closely agrees with the existing weather station network, so it is highly likely that the historical observations from this network are accurate as well.</p></div>		</li>
