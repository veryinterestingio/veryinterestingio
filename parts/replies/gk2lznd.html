			<div class="markdown"><p>A relevant part is that in situations like that you tend to walk when you are outside and not just standing still. So your legs do a lot of work moving you around and that generates a lot of heat in the legs.<br />
There is a clear difference in the amount of isolation you like to have on your legs compared to the upper body if you stand still versus move around.</p>
<p>The legs and arms can also handle lower temperature than the rest of the body and still work, so if you are out for a short time the temperature in them can drop and it do not feel cold the same way</p>
<p>It is also a question about the temperature because if it is cold enough you like to use snow pants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is the reason that when you go for a run you never do a complete stop afterwards, the cooldown part of running is for your heart to compensate for the lack of blood flow brought by your legs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, I can go fishing in high 40 F weather with wind chill as long as I have some thick leg insulation.  </p>
<p>It's amazing how much extra heat you feel when you walk around as opposed to standing, freezing your ass off, and telling yourself to power through and catch one more fish before you head home.</p>

<p>Astronomy forums recommend dressing for &gt;20°F colder than it is when you want to spend the night under the stars. I work on cars in the cold and thought I knew better. I didn't. And I'm the type to wear a hoody all winter long</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like you are joking but this is actually a thing in colder climates. What you would do is to get some woolen long underwear with a pattern that you could wear in public, think more like tights. Then when you go into somewhere from the outside you can remove your pants and walk around in your long underwear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I basically do this when I am going skiing. I have a three hour drive to the mountains and I don't want to overheat in the car so I just wear my long underwear and an extra layer on top to be comfortable. I can go into a store or pump gas without feeling underdressed..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd do this living in cold winters.  Just get rid of the cold layer thats often damp from the elements.  Mostly it's cause wearing pants when you don't have to just sucks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pro-tip: make leg warmers to cover your knees, these can be easily pushed down around ankles if you get too warm. To make: cut off the toes of old socks, pull the toe-less socks around knees, done. Note also that knees are often a source of pain and legwarmers provide welcome warmth as well as compression on your knees. Final note, many winter sports (skating, skiing) require the knees to provide a huge amount of stability in slippery conditions, so the leg warmers can provide relief for the knees while you may still shed heat from thighs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My current town is so cold in winter that I usually wear two pairs of thermals, but since I don’t go outside often, I have been wearing knee-high socks under one pair of thermals and jeans. </p>
<p>Knee-high socks are also good for spring and fall when it’s cold in the morning and warm in the afternoon.</p></div>		</li>
