			<div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer is yes. </p>
<p>It’s more complicated, obviously! Therapy and things like meditation, exercise, and yoga can all help reduce cortisol levels. However, once you’re in overproduction, it’s hard to get it to reduce. </p>
<p>Also, stressors at other periods of life can cause an increase again. </p>
<p>As an anecdote, I had many factors leading to depression in my teens. I was better for a couple of years in my early twenties, then had some crises occur, and went back to therapy and started meds. I was able to taper them and stop meds and therapy before I was 30. When I was 39, I had several fairly intense stressors and went back on medications. A year and a half later, I tapered them again. </p>
<p>A decade of life events with no need for medications or therapy felt empowering! But I also know when to ask for help, and that’s a strength, too. </p>
<p>Others need lifelong medical support to balance their hormone levels.  Each of us responds differently and has different needs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't NEED meds but they can make it a hell of a lot easier to live day-to-day whilst learning strategies to deal with your depression. </p>
<p>Most common depression meds are SSRI's (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors). These meds prevent your brain reabsorbing some of the serotonin it produces, therefore allowing more of it to remain available to your brain and modulating your brain's behaviour. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It's thought that SSRIs work by increasing serotonin levels in the brain.</p>
<p>Serotonin is a neurotransmitter (a messenger chemical that carries signals between nerve cells in the brain). It's thought to have a good influence on mood, emotion and sleep.</p>
<p>After carrying a message, serotonin is usually reabsorbed by the nerve cells (known as &quot;reuptake&quot;). SSRIs work by blocking (&quot;inhibiting&quot;) reuptake, meaning more serotonin is available to pass further messages between nearby nerve cells.</p>
<p>It would be too simplistic to say that depression and related mental health conditions are caused by low serotonin levels, but a rise in serotonin levels can improve symptoms and make people more responsive to other types of treatment, such as CBT.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ssri-antidepressants/" target="_blank">NHS.UK</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other options like MAOI's exist that work in a different way, but generally these are only used if SSRI's are not working or not appropriate as they have harsher side effects / potential drug interactions (notably, SSRIs and MAOIs taken within a few weeks of each other can be fatal).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the meds, depends on your brain chemistry, but the short answer is yes. Sometimes it takes multiple tries to find the right meds or the correct dosage, but once you do, it certainly does help. You won't suddenly feel like a superhero or anything, but you'll gradually notice improvements in your daily quality of life and in your reactions to stressful situations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meds are a fucking blessing at times, especially combined with therapy and a strong work ethic and willingness to improve, but the meds make it much easier to function, they do a good job of alleviating the symptoms and letting you focus more of your energy on your lifestyle and the exercises in therapy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never been one to whine, to the best of my ability. But, after an abusive father who left, a terrible school experience (imagine a midwest Friday night lights school, where you're 6'4&quot; and fat but don't want to play football), and a career as an air traffic controller, punctuated by a death sentence from cancer, maybe there's some merit in why I'm so fucked up with this pandemic. </p>
<p>I've been burning what leave I have left for the fear of getting the disease and drowning in my own fluid (raised by a nurse, spent time in Healthcare, I know it's a bad way to die).</p>
<p>I'm due for scans this week, which are long overdue. I'm trying to control my drinking, but this really puts it into perspective how the brain works against your best efforts.</p>
<p>Although I loved this job for a long time, it really has eaten a hole in what's left of my stomach, liver, and soul. I really wanted to live until 40, have a nice farm in Idaho and a girl. But here we are! That's life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish I didn't have a similar life story  (though I live in India and the sheer ecosystem I have had and am having is very different from yours): I read your stuff and thought &quot;oh my! this guy is me having different situations but ending up reaching the same gut-bleeding conclusion&quot;.</p>
<p>I won't say I see hope for myself. I really wish you to have some solid basis to have hope. I am just trying things with a zero plan, I pespire and get drenched when I try to analyse and plan.</p>
<p>I see how I worked myself into the hole I am in and despise myself. </p>
<p>However I have fought my way out in past when I was young: now I am old. I have some things that I will try and after that it is game over for me. I sort of self-pity a lot. </p>
<p>As I write this I wish I could say &quot;But now things are changing for better and more for me (partially my own efforts and largely getting emotional or physical support from the very few people who want me to live and believe I am productive enough to be worth the resources I consume&quot;. </p>
<p>I have very little to say the above mentioned &quot;But now things ...&quot;</p>
<p>I am just grappling without a plan and it hurts to know how important it is to have a plan.</p></div>		</li>
