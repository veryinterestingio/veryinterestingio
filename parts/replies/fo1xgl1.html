			<div class="markdown"><p>The oil itself can’t break the surface tension.  Try spraying some non-stick cooking spray on it instead, which has Lecithin in it.  The Lecithin is an emulsifier and will break the surface tension of the water and allow the oil to spread over the whole surface of the water.  (I’m pretty sure this science is right, but I’m not 100% on the details.  Regardless, it works when I do it, way better than just oil alone.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oil in the water is a common mistake.      </p>
<p>Do not put oil in your water, it will make all the sauce slide on your pasta. You don't want that. Only add a fair amount of Salt. </p>
<p>The other common mistake is to rinse your pasta, don't rinse out the flavour you've added in your pot! (Salt!)   </p>
<p>Do not cook pasta in simmering water, have a lot (strong) boiling water for the whole duration. Use a bigger pot if that is needed to prevent mess</p></div>		</li>
