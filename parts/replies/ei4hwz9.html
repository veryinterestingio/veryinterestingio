			<div class="markdown"><p>I find it amazing that the will to survive is so engrained into DNA that technique becomes instinctual. Like the Net Casting Spider that holds its web and ambushes its prey with it. You would think that is an action that must be taught, but I've never seen spiders bonding with their kids like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont think that's a good way to phrase things.</p>
<p>Some have suggested that in humans, we actually do not have less innate behaviors and that makes us intelligent,  but that we are intelligent because we have more innate behaviors, such as the propensity to learn language (which is innate, but also must be learned, which describes a lot of innate behaviors in other species as well).</p>
<p>As far as insects and spiders, the field of bee cognition always has some really shocking results. Bees seem to be able to perform math, complex mapping of their environment, language, rapid learning and memory, and what some researchers have claimed to be signs of metacognition. I'd  encourage anyone to read up on that, its a fascinating field. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All intelligence is &quot;cognitive intelligence&quot; and yes, insects definitely have intelligence and problem solve...</p>
<p>Unless you think &quot;picking up a spider carcass at exactly 2:03pm Tuesday march 10th just south of the oak tree&quot; is stored in their DNA, then they obviously learned some things / solved some problems along the way, thus have [cognitive] intelligence.</p>
<p>And emotions: we just have absolutely no idea one way or the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ant nest construction is interesting to watch as compared to their wasp and bee cousins. It's still &quot;programmed&quot; but far more dynamic in response to environment and the situation. I'm now curious what they will do when exposed to caffeine, <em>etc</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a stretch but I always see “nest building” as more of an art form than more geometrically stringent building bees and spiders do. If you gave me the ability to shoot silk out of my ass, I am pretty sure I could construct an effective spider web pattern. If you told me to weave a nest for my Young from twigs and sticks, I’d probably just look at you and say, “Nah, I’ll do like Cuckoo birds and hijack a smaller birds nest”. But I’m hyper left-brained. </p></div>		</li>
