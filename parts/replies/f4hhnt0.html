			<div class="markdown"><p>I fucking get it!!!</p>
<p>My wife and I have been married for 15 years and are very affectionate with each other. I went out of town for work for 6 weeks last fall, and that was the longest I‚Äôve ever been away from her(previously about 2 weeks). The last day out of town was a 10 hour work day and I was so ready to be home, instead of waiting to leave the next day, I packed my shit and drove 13.5 hours home nonstop, completely in the dark. That first kiss and hug was absolutely fucking magical!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coffee and a couple extra of my adderall prescription guided me along the way. I got home, greeted my wife and let my dogs maul me for a while since they probably thought I abandoned them, unpacked all of my shit, had some sweet sweet nookie, and then slept for probably 12 hours. üòú</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I‚Äôm sorry to hear that. I know that must be hard to come to terms with... Don‚Äôt go looking for and forcing a relationship, the one that is right for you will show up when you‚Äôre not even expecting it. </p>
<p>Man, it‚Äôs been a long journey together. We‚Äôve trucked our way through extreme highs and lows through the years. We‚Äôve never even thought about giving up on each other, even when the vast majority of others would have. It‚Äôs just been in the last 5 years that we‚Äôve have found our marital groove and we‚Äôve grown to be connected and bonded on a totally different level. Part of that is we‚Äôve both had good roll models for parents. My parents are celebrating 50 years next month, and hers are something like 55 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Male emotions have been treated like a weakness for so many years that it‚Äôs not an option for most situations, even if they do, people would likely find it ‚Äúunusual‚Äù for some reason they decide to stick to it. Not in this day and age, right? Sadly not, even if a third party isn‚Äôt there, sometimes guys will use the possibility of ‚Äújudgement‚Äù as a reason to not engage emotionally. The emotional capacity gets crushed so far down in them that when some people finally do get the chance for that, men opt for a firm handshake instead or the ‚Äúbro hug‚Äù one or two pats on the guy‚Äôs back, then back off. I‚Äôve known some people to even twitch or recoil if they‚Äôre not used to something gently making contact with them. Some people who say they ‚Äúhate being touched‚Äù are really just so disconnected from that part of the self they are afraid to give it a chance again (always ask though as there is exceptions and circumstances where physical contact might actually be truly an issue).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do this and it's embarrassing as hell. I'm quite touch deprived and will totally twitch out involentarily recoil at an unexpected touch. This usually results in the person deciding they should probably refrain from touching me again. Aaand the cycle continues</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do miss it, but it‚Äôs very hard for most men to express it in any way. Many of them have been told to conceal it their entire lives, and that‚Äôs it‚Äôs not okay. I suffer from this myself a bit, and I‚Äôm young still and live in a progressive area.</p>
<p>All we can do is try to help them see that it‚Äôs not weakness, and to tell them it‚Äôs okay. I know it helps me.</p></div>		</li>
