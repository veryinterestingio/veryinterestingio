<p>I was imagining our moon always being above Australia and when the first European settlers arrived them wondering what the big rock in sky was</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks everyone for the great replies. Would be a fun story for someone to write</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what's called a geostationary orbit, and where we like to put things like communications satellites, which means for example your satellite TV dish doesn't have to constantly move to keep itself pointed at the satellite.</p>
<p>it's a stable orbit, but only maintainable in a very specific distance and location (has to be at the equator, and at the specific height where the orbital velocity required to maintain the orbit gives the object an orbital period that matches the rotational period of the body it's orbiting.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, this makes satellite TV more and more difficult to to get the farther north you go. If I recall my days as a DISH employee, there’s a latitude limit because you’d have to be pointing the satellite dish below the horizon during part of the year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One caveat to this, is that geostationary orbit is constantly moving outward as the planet's rotation slows. Once a planet tidally locks to its moon, as Pluto and Charon are today, then the moon will stay &quot;stationary&quot; (actually makes a figure 8 shape as it processes through its orbit)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pluto and Charon are like this. &quot;Mutually tidally locked&quot;</p>
<p>Also, the moon would eventually be able to tidally lock the earth given unlimited time and no outside forces interrupting things. Here's an article which talks about it (they estimate it would take about 50 billion years):</p>

<p>should not have written &quot;unlimited time&quot; since 50 billion years is a limit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The technical term for this is tidal equilibrium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. Pluto and Charon are both tidally locked to eachother, so both is above the same spot of the other. Not sure how possible it is with an Earth Moon sized system though. Pluto and Charon are a lot closer in size than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All two-body systems will tidally lock given enough time and no outside influence. The moon is drifting away because it is robbing the Earth of its rotational energy. Eventually it will equalize and Earth will lock to the moon. The amount of time this takes is dependent on the mass ratio of the two bodies (Pluto and Charon are super close, near 1:4; Earth and Moon are 1:81) as well as distance (starting closer together will cause locking to be faster).</p>
<p>Earth will eventually lock to the Moon, but it will also eventually lock to the Sun, which will unlock it from the Moon and actually put the Moon in retrograde orbit as viewed from the Earth (if the Sun doesn't steal the moon from us).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The closer an orbiting body is to its... orbitee? (word for this?)</p>
<p>... the more likely they are to be tidally locked ...</p>
<p>would that be tantamount to:</p>
<p>... become tidally locked more quickly. ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe one commenter mentioned this above, but all objects in orbit will eventually become tidally locked. This is due to the force of gravity being stronger on one side of the object causing it to eventually lock in. So basically because the universe is 'so old' it is very likely that most observed orbits are tidally locked. I hope I'm explaining this understandably.</p></div>		</li>
