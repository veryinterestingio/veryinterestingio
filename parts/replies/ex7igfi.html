			<div class="markdown"><p>It's crazy to think the Empire State Building is approaching 100 years old. I mean the thing was built in a time when radio was first becoming widespread and traffic lights were first being installed. And yet there it still stands, well over a thousand feet tall and to this day one of the tallest buildings in the country.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. I live i Norway and manage couple of large buildings. We get the water super hot about 120C. And we use it to heat the building and showers. We mix it down with cold water to get the right temperatur</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>HVAC engineer here- yes, that's considered &quot;medium temperature water&quot; and it's delivered under pressure. Usually ~1.75 to 2 bars above the saturation pressure for steam at that temperature. If it were delivered right at the saturation pressure, you'd get steam spontaneously occurring in pumps (this is known as cavitation) which is bad for the pump and plumbing system.</p>
<p>So for 120C water, it's pressurised to about 4 bars of absolute pressure (3 bars gauge pressure).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the love.  Its comes with about 10 bars presure. And in the cold water er have about 6 bars.</p></div>		</li>
