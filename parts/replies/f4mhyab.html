			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah okay. I just spun my arm round to see what stops it, I tense my muscles in my arm and this stops my arm. Why does that not work up there? Is that because of the characteristics of the suit as one of the other commenters explained?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The muscles in your arm stop your arm, but what stops YOU is that gravity is pulling you down into your chair. If that weren't the case, the movement of your arm would cause your whole body to move. When you think about your muscles moving different parts of your body, you always think of it in the context of being on earth gravity. Every single movement you make takes gravity into account. Makes sense, considering that until about 70 years ago that's how every human ever experienced their entire life, and even since then only a tiny percentage have any different experience</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not perfect but it definitely gives you an instant and intuitive understanding of how your center of mass and momentum are affected by even the tiniest movement of an extremity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about swimming. If you are submerged and swing your arm you would rotate as the effect of gravity is somewhat mitigated by the water. However since there is water and still gravity you will only spin a small amount. In space there is neither so the effect that made you spin underwater is magnified in space</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the original comment was trying to say that when astronauts move quickly, the reaction of their body is to start spinning in the opposite direction. This makes slow and deliberate movements much easier, since you have time to compensate for your body's motion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can get a first hand experience of these typical forces right here on earth.  The next time you are seated on a chair with wheels, preferable on a hard floor, lift your feet off the ground and throw your arm out to the side.  The chair will move slightly when you do this.  In the absence of the weight of your body on the chair (gravity) causing friction between the wheels and the floor, this initial motion would continue indefinitely without an outside force to stop it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>False. Linear and Angular momentum need to be conserved. When you throw your arm out to the side, they eventually stop since well, your joints have limits. This exerts a counter force/torque than what you exerted initially and stops movement. Your center of mass will always remain in the same spot unless acted on by an external force. Rotationally it's the same, if you started out not spinning, you'll never be able to spin without holding another object that you can transfer angular momentum to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Early Gemini mission flights had that problem. Astronauts flailed about in space, going into a panic because they couldn't control themselves and continually over-correcting. Their heart rates skyrocketed to dangerous levels as the astronauts struggled.</p>
<p>Buzz Aldrin was the first one to figure out spacewalking. Unlike everyone else before him, he took it slow and deliberate. Aldrin also introduced underwater training for EVA's. The slow and deliberate approach along with underwater training is still done today.</p></div>		</li>
