			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah not sure why I had to scroll so far down to see this one. Let me also add that we know the relative percentages of each element in the universe, and there's a hell of a lot more of the lower end of the periodic table (someone correct me, I've heard that 99% of atoms in the universe are hydrogen ?) So when you consider that, and the other options for building blocks - the favourite being silicon in place of carbon, it's like sure it's possible, but just by the relative numbers of those elements in the universe, it'd be waaaay more unlikely. </p>
<p>So I guess it's what we look for because it's the most likely. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Elements in the same column in the periodic table exhibit the same pattern to their outermost electron orbitals, and thus tend to have similar physical properties- note that copper, silver, and gold all appear in one column one after the other, for example, and they're all lustrous malleable metals that are non-corroding and outstanding conductors. This is in fact why it's called the 'periodic' table: because it shows where physical properties of known elements should 'periodically' reappear as one increases atomic number. Similarly to copper, silver, and gold, carbon and silicon share an outermost electron orbital structure, which is why they're both capable of the same trick of forming four covalent molecular bonds simultaneously- or of forming a strong triple-bond and still being able to bond to something else. However, the energy requirement for forming these bonds goes up as you go down the column, which is a barrier for complex chemistry, and as a result carbon is the only atom where these sorts of complex bonds tend to occur naturally. Also, things further down the periodic table get less and less common in the universe. Silicon is the only other quad-bonding element which is frequently occurring enough and with a low enough energy requirement for bond formation that forming complex patterns naturally seems even remotely plausible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is in the same column but is quite different in its physical properties as similar molecules of carbon. There is a good article in scientific American about why silicon is less apt at being a good basis for life than carbon.

<p>I'll correct you - it's closer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_the_chemical_elements#Solar_system" target="_blank">90% of the atoms and 74% of the mass.</a>  Then, about 24% of the mass is helium, 1% is oxygen, 0.5% is carbon, and the remaining 0.5% is everything else. </p>
<p>The hydrogen and most of the helium were created during the big bang. The rest can be <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Nucleosynthesis_periodic_table.svg" target="_blank">created in stars, supernovae, or extreme events like colliding neutron stars.</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd like to add that the Big Bang is still happening, and that the first atoms took quite a while to appear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Firstly the periodic table is universal. There's not a different set of elements hiding in Andromeda or anywhere.</p>
<p>So we can find what they're made of by Looking at them, basically what we've found is that each of our elements responds to/emits light in a constant and specific way.  So we can look at distance Star, break down the image to the different wavelengths of light and match it to specific elements.  That way we know if a star has more carbon than nitrogen, etc</p>
<p>Spectroscopy? I think is the term for this analysis of determining what stuff is made of</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By what color it is. Yep, pretty much that simple. Turns out the way light interacts with materials to make it a certain &quot;color&quot; means you can look at the color of things (or more precisely, what color it isn't), in a very precise way, and draw conclusions about what it's made from. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great explanation. The 4 most abundant elements in the universe are hydrogen, helium, oxygen, and carbon. Helium is inert, but the other three make up the two major building blocks of earth life - water (H and O) and carbon. </p>
<p>Also to add, it’s important to recognize that carbon is extremely unique as an element. There are <em>substantially</em> more known carbon based molecules than all other elements combined. Life is just complex chemistry, so it stands to reason that carbon is by far the most likely building block. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s because carbon is the only element that can really “do” life. It plays by <em>completely</em> different rules than all other elements. That’s why we categorize chemistry as either organic (carbon based) or inorganic (non-carbon based).</p>
<p>That categorization of organic vs inorganic isn’t some kind of human bias because that’s what we’re made of. If you looked at all possible molecules, 95%+ of them would be carbon based.</p>
<p>Carbon is like building with legos - everything else is like building with regular wooden blocks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a hypothesis that something with carbon-silicon chains won't have quite the same weakness that purely silicon based life will. The thing is, if that were viable you'd expect to see that on Earth where carbon is relatively quite rare in comparison to silicon. Pure carbon-based life likely outcompetes life trying to use silicon as a base molecule. Carbon is lighter, its bonds are stronger, etc.</p>
<p>You make a steel chain, if one link is made out of copper, the chain is not stronger for it. If iron is extremely scarce, you could have a steel core with copper spokes or something, though.</p>
<p>For us to find silicon based life, it would probably need to be a planet with almost no carbon whatsoever. So it'd be a world with silane rather than methane, no carbon dioxide, just sand, etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And they have AMU of 1, 4, 12 and 16. Are  C and O so common because of intrinsic stability or simply star chemistry? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just down to the star. Hydrogen is fused into helium, then once hydrogen starts to dwindle helium fuses into oxygen I think, oxygen and helium can fuse later into carbon, and really late on iron and some other elements are produced, then virtually all the rest of the elements are produced during supernovae.</p>
<p>Someone correct me if I’m wrong though, it’s been 5 years since I last took any physics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is great answer that I would like to add a few things but I want to address some things mentioned in other posts. There is something in chemistry called the uniqueness principle. It basically says that the second period elements (lithium, Beryllium, Boron, Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Fluorine and Neon) are significantly different than the other elements in their respective family (ie Carbon’s properties are different than those of Silicon, Germanium, Tin and  lead) . The biggest thing is that they readily participate in a type of chemical bond called a pi bond. Sometimes these are called double bond or triple bonds. Notice of these second period elements, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen are the main elements that make life. Everything that we think as the chemical structural components of life require pi bonding. These are things like sugars, starches, fiber, protein, fats (although less so than others) and so forth. For pretty complex physical chemical reasons, Pi bonding is also a necessary for most of enzymatically (special proteins) catalyzed chemical reactions to occur. The lack of ability to readily pi bond makes it extremely unlikely for other  elements like silicon based life to occur. In fact, I will never say it’s impossible since I’m a scientist but I’m basically as close to saying it is impossible as I could be. </p>
<p>The other thing is the importance of hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen bonding is the main force that holds proteins in their shape. And their shape makes their function. If you get too cold there are is not enough energy for necessary life inducing chemical reactions to occur. If you get too hot, these hydrogen bonds start to break and then chemical reactions don’t occur since special proteins called enzymes lose there structure. Enzymes are there just to make chemical reactions happen faster (sometimes so much faster that the reaction would literally never occur with the enzyme). So this is the driving factor in optimal temperature. You want it to be as hot as possible so reactions occur pretty quickly but not too hot that the proteins breakdown. That’s the physical chemistry behind normal human temperature (about 98.6 F or 37.0 C). If you get hotter than this proteins start to lose structure. If you get colder than this reactions get to slow. Hydrogen bonding is main reason we think life must occur within a rather narrow range of temperature. We have have recorded as high as 7.2 trillion degrees Fahrenheit and as cold as -459 degrees Fahrenheit. Considering we only know of life that exists in ambient temperatures between -70 and 350 Fahrenheit, we can eliminate a lot of planets based on ambient temperature alone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course, now we've found life in conditions that we used to think life couldn't exist in, such as thermophilic bacteria etc.  Now many think life actually started in those conditions.  So life of some sort could exist under &quot;exotic&quot; conditions.</p></div>		</li>
