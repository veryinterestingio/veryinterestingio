			<div class="markdown"><p>A good example of this- <em>fear</em> and <em>excitement</em> might have exactly the same physiological parameters- butterflies in the stomach, racing heartbeat- but the <strong>meaning</strong> of them is different. </p>
<p>Much of that meaning is created by what we focus on- the danger or the pleasure of the roller coaster, for example.</p>
<p>If we're aware of this we can choose what we focus on, and what it means, which gives us a degree of choice about the emotions we experience.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or am I misunderstanding what you meant in your comment about &quot;biologism&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure nobody who knows anything about neuroscience or even biology would argue that everything we are depends on our biology (what would that even mean, that everything we do is pre-programmed regardless of environment? That's outdated). Environmental factors are, obviously, very important. Though I don't really get why you are painting a line between thoughts, feelings and biology - thoughts and feelings are a product of our brains, after all. </p>
<p>I think you are making a strawman for the purpose of starting some conversation, though I have no idea what your end goal is here. You are probably going to attract comments from people who don't really know much about the topic (nothing wrong with that!) who will agree with you because they don't want to be the bad 'biologismsts'.</p></div>		</li>
