			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. Look up 'radiative cooling' and black body radiation. Essentially everything with temperature above 0k naturally radiates heat in the form of electromagnetic radiation. The hotter the object, the more it radiates and the higher the frequency. Like how a metal will heat up, turn red, then yellow, then white. This is still happening even if the object doesn't appear to be glowing. For example, if you have an infrared camera you'll see humans glowing in the infra-red spectrum. This radiating will gradually cool objects down even if there isn't any matter to bump into and transfer energy directly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.</p>
<p>There are three types of heat transfer. Conductive (solid:solid contact). Convective (fluid gas or liquid flow). Radiative (as discussed).  Some every day examples of heat transfer using the three methods are: touch a hot pan (conductive), use a hair dryer (convective) and sunbathing (radiative).  They are not all perfect examples, so can you think why when sunbathing you might also feel conductive and convective heat transfers?</p>
<p>So with that new understanding of radiative heat transfer it’s possible to understand how <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/15/whitest-ever-paint-could-help-cool-heating-earth-study-shows" target="_blank">this paint </a> will help to actively cool buildings.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Overheating is actually a problem in space as for example you in a space suit make more heat than can leave your body.</p>
<p>But take off the space suit and something happens: In space (unlike your suit) there's no air pressure, this means that the boiling point of water gets really really low. So all the liquid in your body turns into a gas. As the gas leaves your body it takes heat with it, thus cooling you down. Eventually (12-26 hours) you'll freeze solid, but don't worry, you'd be dead way before then.</p>
<p>Another way things cool off is black body radiation: Any object them has heat actually emits some of that energy as light (luminous beings are we). Have you ever seen a piece of metal heated up till it glows?  The piece of metal is always glowing, just less brightly. This light can't be seen by the human eye though, it's very dim and outside of our visible spectrum. So you're glowing, neat, but why does that matter? Every photon that you emit takes a tiny bit of energy with it, so very slowly you get colder. It's not much, but a rock that hasn't had any heat added to it in several billion years will end up being pretty cold because of this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Point of note, the liquid in your body doesn’t all instantly turn to gas.</p>
<p>It’s not like that scene in event horizon, in fact several astronauts have been exposed to vacuum in testing and they’ve left unscathed, they did note that it feels like soda on your tongue because the water in your mouth is boiling.</p>
<p>Not saying you’re saying this but it’s a common misconception.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This looks like a quote from one of The Expanse books. They talk about how keeping ships cool enough, with all the heat from bodies and electrical systems, is a bigger problem. Vacuum is an excellent insulator so the heat inside the ship has nowhere to go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An object  in space that is radiating heat is using <em>the entire universe</em> as a heatsink. Really - that electromagnetic radiation is eventually going to hit some far off space dust, planet, star etc a few billion years from now and make them ever so slightly hotter.</p></div>		</li>
