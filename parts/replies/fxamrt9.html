<p>--- cut here ---</p>
<ul>
<li>The modern move of the Queen started in Spain during Isabella  I's reign, perhaps inspired by her great political power, and spread  from there, perhaps being spread by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing#In_Europe" target="_blank">invention of printing</a> and the 1492 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsion_of_the_Jews" target="_blank">Expulsion from Spain of the Jews</a> who carried the new chess rule with them as they fled.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the 15th century the queen's move took its modern form as a combination of the move of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rook_(chess)" target="_blank">rook</a> and the current move of the bishop.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(chess)#cite_note-13" target="_blank">[13]</a> Starting from Spain, this new versionÂ â€“ called &quot;queen's chess&quot; (in Italian, <em>scacchi de la donna</em>), or pejoratively &quot;madwoman's chess&quot; (<em>scacchi alla rabiosa</em>)Â â€“ spread throughout Europe rapidly, partly due to the advent of the printing press and the popularity of new books on chess.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(chess)#cite_note-14" target="_blank">[14]</a>  The new rules faced a backlash in some quarters, ranging from anxiety  over a powerful female warrior figure to frank abuse against women in  general.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(chess)#cite_note-15" target="_blank">[15]</a> </p>
<p>At various times, the ability of pawns to be queened was  restricted while the original queen was still on the board, <strong>so as not to  cause scandal by providing the king with more than one queen</strong>. </p>

<p>I couldn't help but laugh at the last bit (emphasis mine).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the record, a pawn can promote to any piece. Most often it's a queen, but occasionally a knight is preferred.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually it can't promote in a king or a pawn. Also there are cases where underpromotion to rook or bishop is the better move (its often to avoid cases where a queen would cause a stalemate).</p></div>		</li>
