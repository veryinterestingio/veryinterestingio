			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, a friend showed me this trick on my Dodge 600 back in the day after my engine died, must've been mid-late 90s.   A car parts store was within walking distance, so we got and replaced the part (I want to say it was an alternator), and went on our way.  My mind was blown and felt 300 IQ for the rest of the day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure the accuracy of this, but I've been told that often times, dealers will make more money off of their service departments than the actual sales floor. Again, I can't verify that, but if it were true, it would explain why they want you to not figure things out on your own and bring it in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's true, while it's less gross money, the profit after direct is much higher on service or parts sales. Where I'm at usually sales makes up 60-75% gross income for the year, but only 10% profit. Rest is split between parts and service. I sit through this meeting once or four times a year. The plan is always, get as many things with our brand on them out in the market as possible, drive home the value offered by our service and parts departments because that's what keeps our lights on.</p>
<p>Could get into it, there are some differences but mostly boils down to.
Once you tool a service department at a car dealer you're done buying things for them, save a new special tool. The car service departments I have seen are usually working on flag hours, so if it says it pays 6 hours, takes you 4, you get paid 6, if it takes you 8, you get paid 6, usually no guaranteed hours. So if they don't work, they don't get paid. The support staff are just making quotes, fixing warranty claims to pay, and trying to sell more work, so almost every person is generating revenue.
Compared to sales, you have to keep the lot looking nice, there are constant ads and promotions to get people in the door, the initial price of buying the vehicles to sell. Support staff is way higher, so even more overhead. Have cleaners for cars, inspectors for used vehicles if you don't pay service, managers, receptionists, finance guys, and so on. So on this side it's only the salesmen and the finance guy that are generating revenue, usually on some sort of a commission, everyone else is on a salary paid by the department using them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who took advantage of an oil change coupon at the dealership only to have them try to rope me into $700 worth of other work, I 100% believe this. Had to tell multiple people, multiple times, &quot;I'm just here for an oil change. Just change the oil. Thanks though.&quot;  </p>
<p>That $700 they wanted to charge me ended up being about $100 in parts and a case of beer &amp; dinner for a buddy who refuses to take cash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Toyota built a brand new dealership in my city. Suddenly every visit for an oil change turned into a huge bill. I just started going to an independent shop. Poof, just like that my car didn't &quot;need&quot; extra repairs every time. Literally my bills were $60, $60, $60, new dealership, $600, $800, $600, $1000, stopped going to Toyota, $60, $60...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I leased an electric vehicle.  Great, no more $100 oil changes, fuel fillups, etc.  Nope, the stealership kept calling me every year to flush the brake fluid.  When I asked them why all their other ice vehicles only required brake fluid flushes every 80000 miles or 10 years, they told me &quot;it could void the warranty and the brakes could fail on your car&quot;.</p>
<p>Every six months they would want me to bring in the vehicle for a &quot;software patch&quot; and hardsell tire rotations, cabin air filter changes, wipers, etc.</p>
<p>My understanding is the money they lost on regular oil change services they're trying to make up on other made up service.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Eh, it's the same everywhere.  Everything needs to be a &quot;Service&quot; now so that you can be milked for everything you are.  The old adage &quot;possession is 9/10ths of the law&quot; simply means you have to never let your customers possess anything.</p></div>		</li>
