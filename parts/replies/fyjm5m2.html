			<div class="markdown"><p>This is likely because higher energy light (blue and UV) is more likely to destroy pigments. Blue and purple pigments reflect those wavelengths more effectively, giving them their color.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct:</p>
<p>White is the reflection of all colors. Black is the absorption of all colors. All colors in-between are absorbing some shades and reflecting others. A blue object predominantly reflects blue light and absorbs orange light as orange is the complementary color of blue. An orange object predominantly reflects orange light and absorbs blue. Blue light has a shorter wavelength meaning it is more powerful than orange light. So the blue object reflects the more intense light, and the orange object absorbs the more intense light. Consequently orange fades faster than blue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Laundry detergent takes advantage of that. Ever wonder why so many detergents are blue? It’s called an optical brightener. That dye stays in your clothes and counters the yellowing of whites without bleaching. You don’t notice it on other colors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I second this. I also think it could be that the blues are less degraded because they reflect more and absorb less of the higher energy rays, like blue, violet, and ultraviolet (which again is what is actually doing the damage). If you looked at the spectrum emitted by a blue part of the image, it would probably span a range, just a higher overall frequency than other colors.
So I'm proposing that blue is less degraded because it is blue.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I like this. Interesting that blue often represents stability while red is mercurial.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes sense: red dye has a hard job: it has to absorb violet (higher-energy) photons. Blue dye only has to absorb green and lower-energy photons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the absorption spectra in this case would be  more of a bell curve, not a low-pass or high-pass filter. But the point still stands- blue has it easier. You can see something similar if you look up absorption spectrum of chlorophyll- it has two bells around red and blue so it looks green.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was not always the case, though. I remember reading an article about blue in medieval paintings and iirc blue pigment was super expensive and some cheaper ones faded very quickly. There was an example of a painting where the sky was all brown, but had been painted blue originally. For the life of me I can't find that article or even the painting though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Historically, high quality blue pigment was made from ground up lapislazuli. While easy to make synthetically these days, in the old days it was a very expensive natural ingredient.</p>
<p>All the other pigments also tended to be some sort of mineral. That explains why red and brown tones were so readily available.</p>
<p>I don't know what alternative blue pigment was used when lapislazuli couldn't be sourced. Maybe it was something that reacted with the air? That was a common problem for a lot of the white pigments and is one of the reasons that many old pictures look so dark. Or maybe this mystery blue pigment used organic compounds that broke down when exposed to UV light.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Wikipedia suggests that the cheaper replacement dye might have been indigo</p></div>		</li>
