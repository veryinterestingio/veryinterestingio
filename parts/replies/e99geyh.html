			<div class="markdown"><p>Sandy soil with a lot of drainage matters more. I have cactus in Colorado and in Arizona, same species. The Colorado cactus doesn't grow away from the sand patches but seems to grow back no matter what I do to kill it. The Arizona cactus thrives in the yard but if some grows too close to the roof runoff it will get rotten.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cactus that I've seen here in Connecticut don't always grow in sandy soil. Their roots tend to rot and they need to replant themselves from pads that hit the dirt, which slows them down but can be taken.</p></div>		</li>
