			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because all the juveniles still all look alike (you can sometimes sex them off their first set of wing feathers but it's hit or miss on accuracy). You usually can't tell a hen from a roo until the roo attempts to start crowing, which at first sounds like someone choking a rooster underwater while it's crowing. Yes it's as <a href="https://youtu.be/nHIt0q844bg" target="_blank">hilarious and pathetic</a> as you're imagining.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Juvenile hens and roosters look very similar. For roosters, their comb might be a tiny bit larger, and their legs a bit bigger, but the differences will only become clear when they are 5 or 6 months old (depends on the breed tho). In late July, I incubated half a dozen random eggs from the market, and one of the chicks was a leghorn, and I wasn't 100% sure if it was a rooster or a hen - leghorns are quite large generally, but then it started crowing only a few weeks ago - definitely a rooster then.</p></div>		</li>
