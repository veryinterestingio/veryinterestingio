<p>How do you measure that sort of growth in industries where you're not just trying to improve and expand the audience of one product, but where you have to release a new product every couple of years to stay competitive? For instance, was/is Tesla a startup? They have released new models of cars every 2-3 years, and I would assume that their growth has been largely shaped by spikes around the release of new models. Someone else who made a similar comment to yours mentioned that a successful startup should be growing by 5-7% every week; it seems like that would work differently for something like Google, where you just want 5-7% more people to use your search engine every week, and keep refining and updating your algorithm accordingly to bring in new customers, than for something like Tesla, where your growth is profoundly shaped by the release of entirely new products on a scale of years, rather than weeks or even months.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Tesla is a startup, yes, as it experienced rapid growth for a period.  Is Tesla still a startup?  Probably, but again there isn't any hard rule. Growth doesn't have to be exactly linear, it can be really fast and then level off for a bit, and then fast again. One of the drivers of rapid growth like this would be to release new products, yes, once the rapid growth of your previous product slows.  Or release your existing product in a new market (ex: Zoom for schools).</p>
<p>Google was a startup but isn't anymore, their growth is too slow.  But Google also doesn't sell &quot;more people&quot;, they sell &quot;more eyeball time&quot;.  So even if you don't get more users, as long as you can get your existing users to use Google more often, that's still growth, as you now have more ad inventory to sell.  They could make that happen through a lot of different things, like releasing a new product (Gmail, Google News, Amp, etc), or just making their existing product better so that people want to use it more often (improving the algorithm, the rich search results it provides beyond just links to pages, etc)</p>
<p>Also its hard to know if you're in the rapid growth stage while you're standing in it - you can only really know for sure looking backwards.  I mentioned the rapid growth and then leveling off - sometimes the leveling off is temporary and you go fast again, sometimes its permanent and you're out of your startup phase.  You just can't know until you start to grow again - or don't, for a long enough time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was a super helpful explanation, thank you so much! That totally makes sense to me, and also answers my underlying question (I'm waiting to hear back about a potential job offer from a new company, and I was trying to decide whether it counts as a startup or not, haha – based on this, I think the answer is probably &quot;yes,&quot; just with a more Tesla-like model than a Google-like model).</p></div>		</li>
