			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. So often when we talk about food preservation, it’s under the guise of “natural vs. artificial”, whereas the principals are are the same whether you’re talking about sauerkraut or American cheese.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See that's all fine and good but milk is pasteurized. It doesn't go bad. It might get chunky and gross tasting after a while but it never &quot;goes bad&quot;. It's still edible and safe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry mate, I think you’re confusing Pasteurized with Sterilized. Pasteurization reduces the amount of bacteria by a factor that is dependent on the type of pasteurization, whereas Sterilization kills ALL of the bacteria.</p>
<p>For example, High Temperature Short Time (HTST) is the most popular method in the US, and will keep in the refrigerator for about 2 weeks. Ultra-High Temperature (UHT) pasteurization, most popular in Europe, is much more intense, and will give milk a shelf life of about 6 months. The downside to more intensive pasteurization methods is that is changes the flavor of the milk.</p>
<p>With that in mind, if we sterilized milk (or killed all of the bacteria), we would have a longer shelf life, but it would also taste pretty bad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Incorrect. Milk does not go bad. You can drink it when it's  chunky and smells like eggs. It won't kill your or harm you in any way. It's totally safe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And just because now I would feel responsible for you dying of food poisoning; it’s pretty much impossible to tell apart spoiled food (old food with microbes that may not kill you) and pathogenic food (food containing dangerous microbes). And reheating said food will NOT make it safe again due to weirdo shit like spore-formers &amp; toxin-forming pathogenic microbes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>... it's pretty much impossible to end up in the situation where your eating spoiled or rotten food. It's so disgustingly obvious that it is bad that you just toss it. What the fuck is wrong with you checking out all the rotten food. Milk doesn't do that though. It's just gets chunky and gross tasting. Still totally safe to drink though.</p></div>		</li>
