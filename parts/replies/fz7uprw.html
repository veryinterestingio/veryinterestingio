			<div class="markdown"><p>I took a few Linguistics courses, but not enough to be able to respond to this fully. However, my professor in those courses did not seem to believe that the colloquial understanding of this subject was super compelling. Children might learn a bit faster but there are a couple things that were pointed out for the lay man:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The expectations of the level of acquisition for young children vs adults are drastically different. You would think a child was very clever and articulate, but think the adult was unremarkable for the same level of acquisition.</p>
</li>
<li>Children are simply braver than adults with language, less egostical. They are willing to take risks in exercising their language and are willing to be wrong much more than adults. This results in a lot more practice in that language.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, I am not saying on way or another whether children are better at language learning. They very well might be. But be aware of those differences when considering the topic.</p></div>		</li>

<li>Toddlers have a lot more time and effort to devote to language learning than an older person who also has other classes/a job, social responsibilities, etc. A child spends the first several years of his or her life in a focused, personalized 24/7 language immersion program. Adults who move to a foreign country and conduct 100% of their communication in the target language also acquire a high level of language competency in two or three years (the catch is the 100% of communications -- few people do this because it's so lonely and stressful to have no contact with people who speak your native tongue).</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both your answers and the parent seem to be considering practise the way we acquire language, why is that? Krashens data on comprehensible input seems more valid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, it's higher reward for small children. They don't have a fluent fallback language yet so they're geared towards attempting to communicate better day to day already.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The evidence is so overwhelming that it's Law of Gravity level, and has been for nearly half a century. Human brains have a critical period in which they acquire (not &quot;learn&quot;, <em>acquire</em>) the languages they are sufficiently exposed to perfectly and unconsciously. The exact age varies, but the critical period will end sometime in adolescence.</p>
<p>Looking more closely, there are different critical periods for different subsystems -- the one for phonetics/phonology ends earliest, then morphology, then syntax. Lexis is more open -- after a certain age you will <em>never</em> be able to speak like a native, but you <em>can</em> still learn words. Just slower and with more difficulty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much for saying this. I took a college linguistics class last year and this is exactly what I learned, but I didn't have the words to say it. (A lot of the class focused on this specific thing)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People <em>acquire</em> their native languages. It's an automatic process and is unique. People <em>learn</em> languages after the critical period. It's a conscious process that is no different than learning math or to play the piano, and it's characterized by studying, practicing, memorizing, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comment has accurate information but wrong conclusions.</p>
<p>Your description of the critical period is indeed correct, but it isn't &quot;Law of Gravity&quot; level confirmed. It is still a debated topic within linguistic circles even if it is nearing mostly accepted. </p>
<p>The distinction between acquire and learn is also accurate, but the task of acquiring is still a learning process and it is by no means efficient in children. Our standards are lower for their acceptable level of speech and adults can converse on far more complicated topics and master phonology faster than a child would. Children are just able to acquire the language more accurately without as much active effort on their part. </p>
<p>Adults can still reach a native-like level (or even higher than the average native) it just requires more active effort.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well that'll be news in psycholinguistics and developmental psychology! Where are you coming from? Applied linguistics? </p>
<p>There's some strange and borderline anti-scientific balderdash coming out of applied linguistics these days. Many seem to be opposed to the very concept of the native speaker, for misplaced ideological reasons -- a strange mix of post-modern drivel and postcolonial shirt tearing. Those folks have moved beyond the pale of science.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Yes, I know.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Never said it was efficient, just unconscious (mostly) and automatic.</p>
<p>As to whether it's a learning process, sure, a layman would call it that. Hell, maybe a discourse analyst or pragmatician would, too. But the learn/acquire dichotomy has a specific set of meanings when it comes to language, and I use the terms as such.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>You do come from language pedagogy/applied ling,  don't you? Cause they're the only folks who think this is true of anything beyond lexis.</p></div>		</li>
