<p>Most spectroscopic imaging will be limited to detecting the cloud-tops on the gas giants, since that's where most wavelengths of light first encounter something opaque.</p>
<p>A few wavelengths of lights will penetrate to different depths. At 889 nm, for example, just outside the visible range into the infrared, methane absorption is particularly strong, and you can only sample the stratosphere well above most cloud-tops before the methane haze gets thick enough to become opaque to that wavelength. On the other hand, certain regions of the microwave spectrum can penetrate below the first few layers of the cloud deck before being rendered opaque from the concentration of deeper water vapor (and is exactly why the Juno spacecraft currently in orbit of Jupiter includes a microwave detector).</p>
<p>No wavelengths of light will go much deeper than that, so detecting the core or even the liquid metallic hydrogen mantle with this technique is basically a no-go.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We can map shallow ocean plankton because they reflect sunlight in a different colour than normal ocean. The same would apply to a gas giant, if light escapes from somewhere we should be able to characterize it.</p>
<p>There are, of course, other ways of sensing. particularly using microwaves, these can even penetrate soil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a super helpful response, thanks for sharing. I work on compiling IPCC inventories for developed countries, where each country is required to report on their annual emissions based off the best scientific guidelines published by the IPCC. What this means in practice is that countries extrapolate data based on &quot;emissions factors&quot; or proxy data to calculate emissions from each sector. Countries don't measure exact emissions, but take the best educated guess using the same methods and accounting approach year after year, while this is reliable to calculate changes between years, it is not as accurate as it could be and countries are constantly changing the methods and recalculating. It also depends on national statistics and government to publish this data, meaning it is not always the most reliable, transparency, or honest. Some countries (as you can imagine) don't want to be open about their national data.</p>
<p><strong>All this to ask you: would be ever be at a position to calculate more accurately national emissions directly through satellite as opposed to relying on national statistics?</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you bring up is a major problem identified in the IPCC reports and the GEO community of earth observation entities have identified CO2 as a critical observable that the earth observation community can use to support the sustainable development goals and IPCC reports.</p>
<p>There are already carbon observatories (but these are not yet mature)  - here is NASA's OCO-2 (OCO-1 sadly didn't get to orbit)  <a href="https://ocov2.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank"><a href="https://ocov2.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">https://ocov2.jpl.nasa.gov/</a></a> </p>
<p>And here is the European Space Agency vision:  <a href="https://www.governmenteuropa.eu/satellites-monitoring-co2-emissions/93413/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.governmenteuropa.eu/satellites-monitoring-co2-emissions/93413/" target="_blank">https://www.governmenteuropa.eu/satellites-monitoring-co2-emissions/93413/</a></a> </p>
<h2>The European Space Agency (ESA) has announced its plans to launch a fleet of satellites which will monitor carbon emissions around the world.</h2>
<p><em>The three satellites are set to launch in 2025 in order to collate data for the United Nations’ (UN) global assessment of greenhouse gas emissions in 2028. Once the satellites are in orbit around the Earth, they will form the world’s first planet-wide emissions observation system: currently, CO2 emissions are measured by conducting ‘inventories’ of fuel burning on a country-by-country basis; which, while it can provide a workable estimate of global emissions figures, is affected by poor measuring and reporting protocols by a number of national governments.</em></p></div>		</li>
