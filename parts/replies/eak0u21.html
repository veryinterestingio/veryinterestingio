<p>However not all audio hallucinations are derogatory. I worked with one patients voices would tell him jokes. So you would often see him sitting around laughing. He was a great patient to work with always friendly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was A Stanford study that showed that the interpretation of the hallucinations is shaped by your culture as well. Which makes sense as your brain is merely interpreting the stimuli and that interpretation would be affected by your experiences. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I worked at Burger King, a man used to come in, get coffee and sit in the corner each day. He usually had a Walkman and headphones with him. One day I sat near him and could hear that he was just listening to white noise. It took me a little while before I recognized that when he didn't, he'd appear to be talking to an invisible person next to him. I don't know if he was for sure schizophrenic, but something was going on and the white noise seemed to help him cope with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A therapist I followed always told the patients those negative voices were just their own negative thoughts that they could hear. Several of them actually reported an improvement in context of auditory hallucinations with just therapy, although it didn't reduce the actual amount of hallucinations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC western countries seem to have it the worst with negative hallucinations, and areas like Africa seem have more positive hallucinations. </p>
<p>I could totally be misremembering though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if that's to do with positive cultural and spiritual associations with hallucinations, and high status given to some individuals who can reach different states.
I imagine shame about these abilities must have an impact on how you see yourself and what you hallucinate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope that's right. If I remember correctly it has to do with the Western believe in spirits/demons who are always evil, while other cultures also have helpful or prankster spirits.</p></div>		</li>
