<p>Michael: Why don’t you explain this to me like I’m five.   </p>
<p>Oscar: Your mommy and daddy give you ten dollars to open up a lemonade stand. So you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar. And now you find out that it only costs you nine dollars.   </p>
<p>Michael: Ho-oh!   </p>
<p>Oscar: So you have an extra dollar.   </p>
<p>Michael: Yeah.   </p>
<p>Oscar: So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer…   </p>
<p>Michael: I’ll be six.   </p>
<p>Oscar: And you ask them for money, they’re gonna give you nine dollars. ‘Cause that’s what they think it costs to run the stand. So what you want to do is spend that dollar on something now, so that your parents think it costs ten dollars to run the lemonade stand.   </p>
<p>Michael: So the dollar’s a surplus. This is a surplus.   </p>
<p>Oscar: We have to spend that $4300 by the end of the day or it’ll be deducted from next year’s budget.</p>
