			<div class="markdown"><p>Well you could just give everyone interferon rather than bother with the second virus. The only problem is interferon triggers your cells to go on high alert and kill themselves if anything suspicious starts happening (like double stranded mRNA floating around from a virus). This is a great strategy to slow viral replication but its also not very pleasant and has its own risks and side effects.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I find this a bit hilarious. IIRC, aren't rhinoviruses unlikely to escalate to anything more severe on their own due to their preference for the type of tissue we have in the nasal pathways/sinus cavities?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This means the virus is well adapted for human hosts. The selective pressure for viruses and infectious diseases isn't death if the host, but prolonged infection if the host to increase spread. Pathogens that are mild inconveniences to the host survive to reproduce and spread. Pathogens that quickly kill are probably accidently infecting the wrong species. Covid-19 is one of the rare viruses that happen to be very effective in the new species, and yet still can have lethal effects. It's messed up.</p></div>		</li>
