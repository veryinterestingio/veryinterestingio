			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>Follow up</strong>: I have never heard of two obviously „related“ plants (I am missing the right vocabulary) having different DNA lengths (if I understand your answer correctly). Can you please elaborate how one watermelon has X genes and another 2*X genes? This blows my mind. Does this exist in the animal kingdom as well?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This has to do with number of copies NOT length of the DNA. Take humans for instance, we have two copies that we get, one set from each parent, but lets say we got the wrong number of copies, like lets say dads side gave us two copies and moms gave us one. This can and does change the way the offspring appear/survivability (mostly for the worse). </p>
<p>Plants are kind of cool in that they can have/breed having mulitple multiple copies so like 8X or 12X the number of copies of DNA. Which can have effects like bigger fruit (strawberries for instance).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite.  Bayer is a huge chemical firm, it's best known in North America for Aspirin-brand acetylsalicilic acid (I've probably misspelled the acid name).  It's a German firm, and one of the 6 that were combined into the now-infamous IG Farben, which the allies forcibly shattered back into the original 6 companies again after WW2.  They bought Monsanto in 2018 for their CropScience division.</p></div>		</li>
