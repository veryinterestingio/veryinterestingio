			<div class="markdown"><p>Strengthen the opposing muscles so that when you contract them, the tense ones can relax. Depending on what you mean by shoulders, you might want to strengthen your chest or upper back. I don't know too much about anatomy but I play around with stretches and contracting different muscles; it tends to work for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure about the top of the shoulders, but I get the shoulder blade tension a lot, too. That one is hard for me to treat but I have a hunch that it's a muscle imbalance between my back and chest. Doing some wide chest pushups helps sometimes. Or that one yoga thing on all fours where you alternate between rounding your back and arching it. When I round it, I contract my chest to the point where it feels like I'm pulling my armpits in. Other than that, we shall both look into it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That could be stress related. Lots of people hold tension there. Try this: shrug and squeeze your shoulder up and back hard then release with a big breath out. Better?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This could be because the muscles at the front of your shoulders and chest are stronger than the ones at the back. The ones at the rear have to work super hard to balance the front ones and end up in spasm. I used to have this from doing lots of pushups and chin-ups (the latter also work the pec minor at the front of the shoulder), and had regular tightness in muscles from my neck down to between my shoulder blades.</p>
<p>Adding rowing-type strength movements fixed this for me. Try that out, might work for you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are hyper-mobile you may not need more stretching there. Contracting and stabilizing may end up feeling better.</p>
<p>Also consider stretching is not necessarily the opposite of (or antidote to) tensing. Relaxing is really where it is at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have had the same experience as you my whole life. The best remedy for me had been &quot;self-massage.&quot; My favorite tool is a little green spikey ball called foot-rubz; don't use your hand to push it into your body, put it on the floor or against a wall and use your body weight and gravity. Theracane is also pretty good but I find it works better if you have someone else pull it for you.</p></div>		</li>
