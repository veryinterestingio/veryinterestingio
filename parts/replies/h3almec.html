			<div class="markdown"><p>Every time.  I drive to Baltimore from Central Florida and back once a year (sometimes up to NY instead).  Sometimes my wife will drive part way, but usually I do most, if not all of the driving while she sleeps or plays on her phone.</p>
<p>It's about a 12 hour drive one way and it used to be brutal until I bought a Mustang GT Premium.  That made a huge difference in how I felt at the end of the drive.  </p>
<p>I just traded it in on a Jeep and made the same drive.  It wasn't as bad as it used to be, but wasn't as nice as in the Mustang either.  Still, I was surprised by the ride quality because I had pretty low expectations regarding long road trips in this thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't feel phantom vibrations, but after a very long trip especially as a passenger, I will feel sort of phantom &quot;motions&quot; of being in a car as I fall asleep.</p>
<p>I get this effect very strongly if I ride a boat, at the end of the day I'll fall asleep feeling sort of imaginary rocking. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, and as driver and somewhat even as passenger, your brain is in a constant state of high vigilance for dangers that could appear quite suddenly and result in serious injury or death. Not the same when you're chilling on the couch.</p></div>		</li>
