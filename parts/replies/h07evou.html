<p>Interesting, I wonder why video doesn’t work.  I wonder if higher video/audio quality helps.  Maybe a 3D TV with 3D glasses.  Or perhaps a VR headset?<br />
(Not suggesting a child should ever be taught this way, of course. Just curious why video doesn’t work)</p></div>		</li>

<p>2018:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People on pre-recorded video cannot engage contingently with a viewer in shared experiences, possibly leading to deficits in learning from video relative to learning from responsive face-to-face encounters. One hundred and seventy-six toddlers (24 and 30 months old) were offered referential social cues disambiguating a novel word’s meaning... The results show that the addition of communicative social cues to the video presentation via video chat was not sufficient to support learning in this case.</p>

<p>2007:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rather than helping babies, the over-use of such productions actually may slow down infants eight to 16 months of age when it comes to acquiring vocabulary, according to a new study by researchers at the University of Washington and Seattle Children's Hospital Research Institute.</p>
<p>The scientists found that for every hour per day spent watching baby DVDs and videos, infants understood an average of six to eight fewer words than infants who did not watch them.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This suggests to me that zoom etc. Might be better than pre recorded video? Are there reliable studies on this?</p>
<p>I have a kid who was born during lockdown, and has regular zoom meetings with grandparents as a result, so I'd be pretty interested in the results!</p></div>		</li>

<p>This genuinely makes me wonder about videogames, since they’re by nature an interactive medium and you the player have agency in the conversations and decisions.</p>
<p>I basically learned to read &amp; speak English fluently almost entirely from playing games - specifically story-heavy, Role playing stuff where I took on a character role and interacted with other characters while exploring the environments. </p>
<p>I wonder how much the interactivity and branching paths aided in that learning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple of things at play. Generally we use 'child directed speech' where rates are slower and we pronounce more clearly to children. We make sure we have a shared point of focus so each speaker knows what the conversation is about. A video of adults talking won't have this. But personally I think the main thing is feedback and opportunity to talk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We'll I'm doing Diploma in Elementary education. In our child psychology textbook it's mentioned that. A normal child at the age of 2 learns new words with average rate of 2500% and have about word stock of 6000.</p>
<p>That's when the question popped in my head. It's not mentioned which study or research they're refering to.</p>
<p><strong>Edit :</strong> I texted my professor about the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Edit :</strong> she replied. She said , it's probably printing mistake and author probably wanted to state that at about age of 2, kids learn from about 2500 to 6000 words within that age. That's why this age is often referred to as &quot;word stock explosion&quot; age.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What does &quot;rate of 2500%&quot; mean? Usually rates are in the form of number of things per unit (often time or distance). For example: dollars per hour, events per second, molecules per cubic centimeter. Do you mean that a child knows 2500% more words on their third birthday than they did on their second birthday? Meaning 25x more?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Going from 230 words to 6,000 words, say, from the start of age 2 to the end of age 2 - that's roughly a 2500% increase. </p>
<p>But I don't see that being the right numbers?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After children begin understanding words in the first year of life, their receptive vocabulary size increases rapidly. At age one, children recognize about 50 words; by age three, they recognize about 1,000 words; and by age five, they recognize at least 10,000 words (Shipley &amp; McAfee, 2015). </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the idea that the typical 2 year old or even 3 year old has a 6,000 word vocabulary seems completely crazy if you've spoken to a toddler recently.  4,000 to 8,000 words puts you in the &quot;advanced language user&quot; category (B2 to C1 category). Toddlers can string together simple sentences at best, they aren't carrying on advanced conversations.</p></div>		</li>
