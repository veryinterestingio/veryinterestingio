			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting note on termites - macrotermitae (mound building termites) do not rely on gut biota to digest wood. They instead rely on fungal symbionts external to their body but internal to the mound (in itself a physiological organism in many ways). Their gut biota appear to be important in keeping the mound free from parasitic/competing fungus and bacteria however!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, indeed! Or the fungi are super skilled termite-herders, depending on one's perspective!</p>
<p>Edit: Or, the mound-building termites are. Other termites (e.g. the ones found in North America) have a gut biome that helps them like That_Biology_Guy said.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's unlikely food sources would provid bacteria capable of colonizing in the gut. The microbes that do colonize are fairly specialized to the task. Even probiotics containing known human colonizers seem to struggle to colonize.</p>
<p>Evolutionarily this makes sense. If exogenous microbes could colonize easily it would be hard to see how we could maintain gut homeostasis or immune tolerance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be able to colonize in the gut, wouldn’t the microbes have to make it past the very acidic stomach? Or would the microbes already be adapted to that? (Basically I’m asking if insects also have an acidic internal environment that the microbes have already adjusted to.)</p></div>		</li>
