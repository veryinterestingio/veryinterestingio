<p>Would it be possible to use lenses to concentrate sunlight into a beam to get around the inverse square law as opposed to using lasers?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ion thrusters seem better.</p>
<p>Stay curious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What does the Earth have to do with anything? I'm talking about putting lenses, or better yet, mirrors in orbit around the sun to both concentrate and...parallelize... the photons into a beam which are directed at an interstellar sail. If you can use the JWST to focus on a galaxy billions of lightyears away, why couldn't you direct photons from a star one AU away at a sail a couple of light years away using a similar setup? Instead of the secondary directing light at a sensor you aim it at the sail (obviously with a different focal length).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking of this when he mentioned the laser idea, but I figured they had probably already thought of that since it seems much easier than building high powered lasers.</p>
<p>Though if the lense idea wouldn't work, I'd still be interested in hearing the explanation as to why it's not possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lenses have the exact same inverse square law that light from the sun suffers from.</p>
<p>The underlying issue is that light expands outwards like a wave and diffuses off to the sides. So as light moves through empty space the front of the wave becomes larger and larger. The cross section of that wave against whatever you're trying to push in space will determine how much of the energy from the photons it gets.</p>
<p>So a laser or a focused mirror would help but all you're doing is moving the distance at which the solar sail becomes ineffective as a means of accelerating.</p>
<p>Ground based lasers could be a reasonable way to push something. We would just build a ton of them and focus them together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For well done science fiction the authors research the topics beforehand in detail and often have friends or contacts that are experts in those fields to get an idea of something that would put the &quot;science&quot; in science fiction. There are tons of theoretical concepts that physicists, astronomers etc. have come up with way in advance of that stuff being realistic/practical so I think the relation is often the other way around.</p></div>		</li>
