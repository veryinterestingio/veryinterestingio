			<div class="markdown"><p>Even given the number of objects that strike Earth, the odds of them coming in perfectly perpendicular are so low that it can essentially be ignored though. The alignment required there with the Earth's various velocities make it statistically unlikely to say the very least.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm sure you've seen vortex bowls before, like marble raceways with a dish that's depressed in the center with a hole. Even the tiniest amount of momentum on a marble will cause it to deviate from going straight for the hole, it'll shoot off or graze it and go into a spiral orbit around the hole until it finally loses enough momentum to fall in.</p>
<p>It's like that, only much much worse because gravity works over such large distances and virtual nothing is perfectly free of motion relative to something else due to varied influences.</p></div>		</li>
