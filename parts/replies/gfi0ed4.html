<p>Everything that came into your In-Box today (Short Term Memory)
Needs to be filed away in the filing cabinet (Long Term Memory). </p>
<p>Some things go into existing files (associated with memories you already have), some things get their very own new files, some things get the circular file.</p></div>		</li>

Not sure how accurate that is, I just remember reading that.</p></div>		</li>
