			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s absolutely an answer to his question! It’s an aspect that others answering here seem to have overlooked. That is, the fact that all  the bacteria in your body are constantly interfering and fighting over the same resources. An important one being iron!</p>
<p>Many of these bacteria that are normally considered “good” or “normal” are only that because of the constant interference and competition. Examples being the clostridium difficile (as you mentioned) and staphylococcus aureus. Both become pathological when the competition is shifted.</p>
<p>Of course this does not touch on why bacteria and viruses don’t interfere in our body but your answer is important to be able to understand the full explanation to the question! Great job!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To those who aren't versed in the ecology. When competition shifts is basically taking oral antibiotics. In essence antibiotics wipe out or good bacteria. The ones that help break down our food, produce nutrients and vitamins we can't make ourselves, and most relevant here keep pathogens at bay. When the natural gut microbiome gets the equivalent of firebombed by antibiotics, it allows new opportunities for antibiotic resistant pathogens to get a foot hold. Hence Clostridium difficile infections which are notoriously difficult to treat, and why fecal matter transplants help to re-establish balance in gut microbiomes which are taken over by C. difficile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But antibiotics also wipe out any &quot;bad&quot; bacteria too. So they might have some therapeutic use for someone perhaps who has an unhealthy gut biome (the chronically sick/those with weak immune systems/the obese etc)</p>
<p>Eg if you followed up a course of antibiotics with a clean diet and exercise, you'd give the body a chance to essentially reset the biome and introduce beneficial bacteria.</p></div>		</li>
