			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, this is the answer I was looking for.  I completely agree that there is no point in taking a risk, when it comes to allergies.
If someone has a severe peanut allergy (anaphylactic level) are they also much more likely to have an anaphylactic reaction to other legumes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a chef, so I experience and educate myself on a lot of allergies, but I cant say with certainty. It seems like there isnt much scientific evidence that if you're allergic to peanuts you're much more likely to be allergic to legumes. The most common legume allergies I've seen together are peanuts and soy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While the commenter you are responding to isnâ€™t wrong about cross contamination because peanuts and tree nuts are frequently stored together/handled by the same factory, it is worth noting that 40% of people with a tree nut allergy also are allergic to peanuts (including me) so cross contamination is not the only culprit here.</p>
<p>I have no answer for why itâ€™s relatively common to be allergic to both, I developed both allergies spontaneously in my mid 20s after eating both peanuts and tree nuts without issue for all of my life leading up to then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See also: oats do not contain gluten, but are usually processed in the same place as wheat, barley, rye products, so if you're gluten free, you need to buy gluten free oats that aren't coated in gluten through manufacture ðŸ™„ (what a money spinner)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The coconut is actually a stone fruit, but we eat the flesh and drink the milk on the inside of the stone.</p>
<p>I know this because we used to play a &quot;is it a fruit, nut, grain, animal, vegetable, whatever&quot; game with my son who probably was 5 when we started doing it, we had to look up coconut on wikipedia for this information.</p></div>		</li>
