			<div class="markdown"><p>This is absolutely right.
You cant imagine how little of the space an atom &quot;takes&quot; is actually empty.
The comparison with the piece of paper is good because its something everyone can picture. In reality a normal paper you write on is still soooooo much thicker than the compressed brick would be.</p>
<p>The problem is that we just cannot imagine these sizes that exist on an atomic scale. You try to picture it but no matter what you think about, its still like 1000 times bigger than the actual atom. These things are just 1000-10000 times smaller than the resolution of the eye lets you see. So if you imagine the smallest grain of sand or dust you ever saw, it has 1000x the diameter of an atom (which again is 99.99999% empty space)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Gives a good idea how pretty much everything is just empty space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my favorite comparisons of the size of an atom that I canâ€™t entirely remember is think of the nucleus as a city. Many, many miles away there is a golf ball.</p></div>		</li>
