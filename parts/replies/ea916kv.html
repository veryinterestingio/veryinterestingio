			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, and seeing as the speed of light doesn't change, the only thing that can change is time being &quot;shorter&quot; (so distance/time equals the same value, the speed of light).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hope I’m breaking this down correctly: </p>
<p>We treat the speed of light as a constant - it doesn’t speed up or slow down. When we see it curve around a source of gravity its rate of travel still doesn’t change despite the increase in distance (as in it gets there just as quick as if it were traveling in a straight line). Time instead changes along the curve to accommodate it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Time is relative. There is no such thing as changing time itself because time can only be perceived. </p>
<p>For this example we are using light as the traveler. For the sake of explanation let’s substitute light with a train </p>
<p>If train is going from station A to station B in a straight line let’s say it takes exactly an hour. Think of gravity as a lake right in the middle of Station A and Station B, if the track is built to circumvent the lake (gravity) the train will take longer time to get from station A to station B, probably an hour and 15 mins. </p>
<p>For another example pretend this is a piece of paper. </p>
<p>——————————-</p>
<p>Now let’s put two points on the paper </p>
<p>————o————-o—</p>
<p>Now let’s make the distance between the points shorter by bending the paper</p>
<p>————o-v-o—-</p>
<p>The notch in the paper represents gravity</p>
<p>Hopefully one of those two examples makes sense. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I understand that the way we percieve time as humans is subjective and distorted but I don't understand what you mean by no such thing as changing time.</p>
<p>I'm thinking of say a singularity, or some cosmic event. Regardless of anybody's perception, the fact is that it changed in its state (static space, then suddenly all kinds of new interactions, matter, energy, etc). That original hypothetical static state no longer exists. </p>
<p>Unless all time exists somehow infinitely and unchanging somewhere, I don't get it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is something I never understood, so a bit of an explanation would be welcome. Time in this context always seems to be bound to the observer and is relative. However, the event itself is happening in a particular time, regardless of observers. It would be perceived by observers with different speeds at a different relative time, but technically the event happens at a single point in time.</p>
<p>Isn't there a concept of absolute time, which isn't bound to events being perceived? In that sense, light (or travel time of information to the observer) should be irrelevant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Forget about light specifically for a second. <em>All</em> electromagnetic waves propagate through a vacuum at the same constant speed, c, which also happens to be the speed of light, because it's one form of EM radiation. These waves are a big part of how atoms interact with each other, because they carry the energy that passes in between atoms. Now, a gravitational field is created by the presence of matter, and the more matter in one place, the more space is stretched and distorted around that matter, which is what produces gravitation. However, because space is stretched within the field, there is effectively <em>more space</em> in between all the atoms of the matter inside of it. This means when a wave of energy needs to cross from one atom to another, it has to go farther. But because the speed of EM waves is always constant, that means the interaction takes longer, effectively slowing time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So because the rate at which changes happen at the atomic level is altered by the presence of gravity, and time as we know it is our perception of these changes happening, then changes in gravity will literally lengthen or shorten the duration of any process or change in that portion of the universe including the electric signals in our brains and our bodies which control our rate of perception. </p>
<p>That was a long sentence.</p>
<p>Because of that constant speed, and how the gravitational field will affect an entire area universally, our perception changes at the same rate the other processes change. It's an actual physical and measurable effect on the world but is impossible to perceive unless from an outside perspecrive. </p>
<p>If I'm right then your explanation helped me work it out the best.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But surely since the speed of light is measured 'per second' then this must also be dependent on the units of time being constant also. If the duration of a second is variable, then the respective speed of light is indirectly impacted?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if light is bent by gravity, and light directly affects time, would that mean that if I were to be on Jupiter right now, and given I was able to survive, then time would be moving differently for us? And would this affect how long we would be able to live in comparison? </p></div>		</li>
