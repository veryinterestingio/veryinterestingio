			<div class="markdown"><p>My days vary by the season because the projects that I focus on shift throughout the year. For me, this is perfect. There is no way to get bored or feel like things are too repetitive. A typical non-COVID year, in the summer I have numerous groups in the field. These are usually youth groups, but I also offer tours, work days, and opportunities to connect with research. In the fall, I am focused on bringing more university and public groups to the ranch and we launch curriculum for educators. In the winter, I track cougars and lead that project, while also bringing k-12, public, and university groups to the property and running virtual curriculum for educators. In the spring, I shift back to a similar focus as the fall with planning for summer in there. Typically there are always research projects happening that the public can visit and be a part of. Recently, we've been working on several documentaries and I also teach numerous classes depending on the season that focus on wilderness skills, tracking, or other topics. The seasonal changes in work flow are an ideal situation for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have found that in places or fields with limited job opportunities, personal connection and networking are key. If you can volunteer somewhere so they get to know you as a person and not just an email or a resume, that really helps. And if you have to hand over a resume, make sure it shows your passion. Pack that thing with as much relevant experience as you can. If you search our Vimeo channel, you can find a talk I gave about my rambling path to where I am. The short answer is I am passionate about education, the natural world, and connecting people to both. It was not a straight shot to where I am, and there will be more past this point, but as long as I am living with purpose I feel successful, so I took every opportunity that came my way that met that purpose. So far so good!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I focused my graduate studies toward improving my writing and my ability to run stats, so that's what I mostly do now. I'm often in an office. I also do quite a bit of outreach regarding lead poisoning in wildlife, so I frequently give talks to various groups.</p>
