			<div class="markdown"><p>Not if you're really wealthy. You just spend a bit more money on on a generator system for your mansion. It's a big wad of cash to pay, but you'll save big bucks over time because your energy is cheap. The middle class family can't afford to pay this big wad of cash, so in exchange for occasional power outages, they get cheaper electricity, when it's available.</p>
<p>The idea is: &quot;Why should a wealthy person subsidize the masses?&quot;</p>
<p>Which completely explains the push for voting laws that are expressly designed to make it harder for working class Texans to vote. Unless you can afford to take time off from work, drive many miles and wait in line for hours, you probably won't vote, while the wealthy business owner can easily find a valid reason to get a mail in the ballot. This assures wealthy people's interests will be be over represented.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Policy observers blamed the power system failure on the legislators and state agencies who they say did not properly heed the warnings of previous storms or account for more extreme weather events warned of by climate scientists. Instead, Texas prioritized the free market.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They vote for what they think are their economic interests. They get promised lower rates and want more money in their pockets. Sometimes it works out that way, sometimes not, but few have the ability to track it properly. WSJ looked at rates in Texas and found that consumers paid $28 billion more in rates over the last couple of decades when the rates (not overall payment) were compared to areas that had a similar pre-deregulation setup, which remained lower and had better reliability over that time period than Texas.</p></div>		</li>
