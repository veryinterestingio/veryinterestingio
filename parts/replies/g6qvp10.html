Some still will. The reason it seems so effective, is the disease never gets around as much... why anti Vaxers think they have it figured out... they don’t- it just seems like it because everyone else took the risk of taking the vaccine, and are now not  passing the disease along... Why herd immunity is the most desirable result. .,meanwhile anti vaxers are walking petri dish’s, allowing disease to thrive, attack those who vaccination wasn’t as through, and perhaps mutate into something new.</p>
<p>Seatbelts and airbags, and all the other things that help you survive a crash... and even ambulances and emergency rooms, are perfect analogies.</p></div>		</li>
