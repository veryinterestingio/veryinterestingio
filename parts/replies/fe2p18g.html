			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on, most up and coming artists these days usually start off independent (without a label) and then a song would blow up which eventually attracts A&amp;R's from all the major labels. (e.g. Lil Nas X, Billie Eilish, Lorde, Halsey)</p>
<p>With the rise of streaming and TikTok, it has come to a point where labels do not scout for talent in bars or public as often, since they prefer going after an artist who made a viral hit online independently. It saves them time and effort to promote the artist from scratch since they already have a following. You don't even really need talent or something. As long as you're capable of making a song with the right amount of Auto-Tune that gets the general public crazy over your song, the label will still take you in because you can earn money.</p>
<p>Besides, labels these days rarely take in demos or listen to them anymore. Bringing a demo tape to a label executive or anyone who had connections could score you a record deal if the A&amp;R or the label executive loved your demo tape back in the days (e.g. Mariah Carey). This practice have slowly died out because labels got tired of the amount of demos they are sent on a regular basis (at least to my knowledge).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading that someone sent a recording of a talent show performance she did to an A&amp;R, not that she was &quot;discovered&quot; at said performance</p>
<p>Might be misremembering, though</p></div>		</li>
