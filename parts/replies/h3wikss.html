			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not sure I agree with your comment about evolution and energy. Higher energy requirements evolutionarily, or maybe a better term would be <em>in the context of steady state</em>, would favour glucose <em>sources</em> that have a higher <em>ability</em> to release glucose. The steady state concentration should be kept roughly the same, but the source should be different to account for the possibility of a quick ramp up. The main evidence for this would be the literal branching of glycogen in athletes, allowing the body to release glucose from the tips of lets say 100 branches in the athlete versus 15 branches in the non athlete, allowing the athlete to maintain exertion or recover MUCH faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing you said disagrees with what I said. You’re talking about glucose storage and transport capability, and the physiology of these things are indeed quite sexually dimorphic in substantial ways, in addition to the fact that simply more muscle tissue by volume means more glycogen storage and therefore glycolytic capacity if the lactate threshold is passed. The topic of this post is serum glucose.</p>
<p>Further, the sexual differences in resting serum glucose is a separate topic from serum glucose during and after substantial anaerobic exercise, which goes up quite a bit.</p>

<p>Did you mean to say glucose stores? Glycogen is just a large polymer of glucose molecules branched off a protein, it does not contain fat. Fat stores are primarily triglycerides, which is three fatty acids bound to a glycerol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whoops yeah, said fat stores, meant glucose.</p>
<p>The disagreement was with higher energy requirements evolution manifesting as lower serum glucose levels. That part doesn’t really make sense. My point was that higher requirements are offset by the ability to more quickly release glucose, not by a lower serum concentration in general. It’s if the pool drains faster, evolutionarily, the offset is to refill the pool proportionally faster, not to let the pool level decrease.</p></div>		</li>
