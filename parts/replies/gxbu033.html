			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the technical term is thigmonasty. Imagine a sleeve of water filled cells, firmly gripping a shaft. That’s happening at the base of the leaflet. When you touch the leaf, though, the disturbance causes a faint electrical signal. When that electrical signal reaches the sleeve of water filled cells, they let water out, and the pole droops. The stronger the electrical signal, the further it propagates, so more of the plant reacts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah! Thank you for explaining it. So this is probably a dumb question but does that mean that the plant uses hydraulics to open and close?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. Usually when we talk about hydraulics, we mean using water to move force around. Letting go is easy. It takes the plant hours or even days to get back to its normal state, that’s where it’s doing the work. Raising the leaves back up, nobody cares about that part, but that’s what I’d call hydraulic. I’m not an expert though. Dammit Jim, I’m a politician, not a botanical engineer!</p>
<p>There’s something else though, thigmotropism, which is what you see when a vine touches a stick and then wraps itself around it. That’s hydraulics. It’s pushing itself into position. Then there is thigmomorphogenesis, which is when touch changes the genetic expression of the plant. A sapling exposed to gusty winds will develop a thicker trunk and not grow as tall as one grown in a greenhouse. It’s not simply some mechanical reaction to a mechanical stimulus, and it can take weeks or months to have an effect. Touch / something that probably has to do with calcium / weirdness like plant hormones or emitting gas or who knows / different genes get activated / some proteins start getting pumped out, and some slow down. Imagine if touching your baby frequently meant they’d grow up short and stocky!</p></div>		</li>
