			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand upon this:  The US government can either make a profit by minting coins or printing bills, or it can lose money - depending on the value of the metal, minting costs, and distribution costs.  This is called 'seigniorage'.  </p>
<p>In 2019, it cost 1.99 cents to make and distribute each US cent, and 7.53 cents to make and distribute each five cent piece.  So, money losers.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, it cost 3.73 cents to make and distribute each dime, and 9.01 cents to make and distribute each quarter. So, money makers.    </p>
<p>Of course, the US mint makes <strong>billions</strong> of coins each year.  So those plusses and minuses add up.  In 2019, the US mint lost $102.9 million by making 7.3 billion one-cent pieces and 1.2 billion five-cent pieces.  But made a profit of $138.8 million on the dimes, and $285.2 million on the quarters.    </p>
<p>So, you might ask, why not get rid of the one-cent and five-cent pieces, and keep the dimes and quarters?  That would seem to make sense, and other countries have dropped their lowest denomination coins before.  (For example, Canada stopped making one-cent pieces in the past decade).  Why not the US do that and save a little bit of money?  </p>
<p>Well, people have tried.  And tried.  And tried.  And tried.  And tried.  Various groups (including elected officials) have been trying to get rid of the cent for literally decades.  Starting in earnest in the early 1980's when the cost of copper made making cents unprofitable and they had to switch to another metal (they are now 97% zinc now).  </p>
<p>But every attempt has been shot down and failed.  Again and again.  You can do some google searching about it for more details, but the gist of it is:  Pennies remain popular enough that people want them around, and merchants don't want to round up/down their transactions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And, the sole supplier of zinc blanks to the US Mint for making pennies, Jarden Zinc Products, spends millions on lobbyists every time it comes up</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and this is a common problem in politics. The negative seignoirage has a little cost to every single American (which adds up to a lot total), but a big profit for a few individual companies so they have the advantage in any political battle  because they'll be far more committed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Canadian here, so with cash purchases it gets rounded to the nearest nickel, </p>
<p>example your items ring up at 5.04. Paying debit/credit. You get charged 5.03, cash? 5.05
If its 5.02 and your paying electronically its 5.02 with cash its $5 even.  So while we no longer have the physical pennies, our transactions/sales havenâ€™t really changed much and most business over these last few years have played with the pricing so that our provincial and government sales taxes take  purchases to the nearest nickel anyways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Russia in most large chain stores if you pay cash it gets rounded to the lowest rouble (say you need 149.99 for cigs? It's 149 for you now), but if you pay with card, then it's full price for you. In most places prices are in roubles and not kopeykas (cents) anyway.
One dude shared a video on how to save a lot if you purchase every item separately and pay with cash for each. Turns out it's a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Australia. We got rid of anything under 5 cents. Cash transactions are rounded (or ceiled, not sure) to 5 cents, digital ones are without rounding.</p>
<p>TBH anything under a dollar it's a dead weight, so often given to kids, donated, left as tips, etc.</p></div>		</li>
