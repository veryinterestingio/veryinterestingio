<p>just not terribly accurately</p>

<p>Yeah there's tons of CATZOC D charts with lead line soundings from the 1850s, especially around developing countries.</p>
<hr />
<p>My favourite are scans of old charts with squiggly handwriting and soundings in fathoms, which look like they were done by Captain Cook and his mates.</p></div>		</li>

<p>tl;dr CATZOC D charts are the least accurate, with huge inaccuracies in position and depth.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Don't let anyone tell you libraries are useless! I Absolutely love the NLA online collection. I've ordered a few poster-sized prints of old maps from them as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure about the advanced tech itself, but EV Nautilus, one of the vehicles doing a lot of underwater biological, geological, and archaeological surveys of the deep(basically run by the original researcher who's credited with finding the final resting place of the Titanic) has 24/7 livestreams going of their work and surveys on youtube. I like to watch every couple of days, though they're currently in port. Lets you see them collect samples, and check visually places that barely anyone else has ever seen, sometimes places no one has ever seen before, if you're interested in actually watching what people doing this kind of exploration and science are doing in real time... and sometimes interest spider crabs in purple loofas... for science.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact about Nautilus. </p>
<p>It has been in Mexico, just south of Tijuana in a shipyard getting massive overhaul done. Saw them take it out of the water, take our an engine (it was 3 or so weeks just to get it out, really cool watching that) It looks night and day different from when it came in 2018 fall. Looking beautiful now. </p>
<p>My boat was docked next to it for months. Spent Christmas with their crew and getting to see it's transformation was really incredible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In terms of hydrography, I believe most modern charts are done with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multibeam_echosounder" target="_blank">multi-beam surveys</a>. They're much better at identifying seamounts and other hazards to navigation that a single beam would have missed.</p>
<hr />
<p>On a sort of related note, about exploring and mapping more of the ocean. Most countries have hydrographic offices which regularly send out hydro ships to do surveys. For example Australian Charts are updated weekly, IIRC. Naturally, it's a question of govt funding and prioritization. High traffic areas like ports and sealanes will get the most attention.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is a large section of ocean west of Perth that has now been well documented due to Flight 370.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution have multiple Automated Underwater Vehicles and submarines used to procedurally map ocean floor areas of interest. For example they have created lots of high accuracy 3d maps of areas of interest, such as around hydrothermal vents. I'm in vfx, and so don't know exactly what technique they use for this, but, to me, it looks equivelant to LIDAR. For vague topology of the gloves oceans you can explore using Google Earth.</p></div>		</li>
