			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Exactly, the biggest reason we use honeybees to pollinate food crops is because we know how to grow their colonies and move large numbers of them around.</p>
<p>I've seen papers suggesting they're actually pretty poor pollinators of many crops, but their sheer numbers and ease of culture over other types of bees still makes them the go-to for large-scale agriculture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are flowers called carrion flowers, corpse flowers, or stinking flowers that have evolved to smell like rotting flesh to attract flies and beetles to pollinate them.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing to keep in mind, though, is that although honeybees make the news more often because of mass die offs, these same pesticides are causing huge problems for native bees and other pollinators (native pollinators being way more effective at pollinating, in many cases).</p>
<p>So while yes, if every honeybee died, others could pick up the slack, but the real issue is that if the huge die offs we’re seeing keep happening, there won’t BE enough pollinators to pick up that slack.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why I’m way more worried about wild/native bees than honeybees. I assumed OP was referring to honeybees because that’s what most people think of, so I focused on that.</p>
<p>Habitat loss is also a huge concern for native bees. Don’t keep honeybees unless you have at least an acre of flowering plants to feed them! Leaving some bare, unmulched soil in the garden can provide habitat for ground nesting bees.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is certainly not consensus that pesticides are causing CCD. Varroa mites (an invasive species in the US) are another possible explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but those are also affecting some non-honeybees too, so tomato/tomato. Bees are in trouble.</p></div>		</li>
