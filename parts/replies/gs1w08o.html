<p>With each other, well, they were right next to each other so there was no comm lag.</p>
<p>With Earth, well it actually was quite a bit worse than a satphone, talking between the Moon and Earth. The moon is about 11x further (1.2-1.4 lightseconds one way) than geosynchronous sats (about 120-160 lightmilliseconds one way, which for a earth-to-earth transmission means 250-300 lightmilliseconds one direction, tho in practice a ping of 500ms or worse is common), so about 3-6x worse lag/delay in conversations.</p>
<p>However, in edited clips it's harder to tell because they edit out the time delay and edit out times where they talk over each other.</p>
<p>It helped their communication, in the long run, that each direction of communication had separate radio channels, so that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc1SzgGhMKc&amp;t=571s" target="_blank">when one side talked over the other</a> (strongly recommend that whole video), both sides could hear the over-talking -- very much unlike, for example, old and modern aviation frequencies, where talking over each other results in stuff like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenerife_airport_disaster" target="_blank">Tenerife disaster</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you know the radius of the earth, you can drop something and measure how fast it falls, then use Newton’s gravitation to calculate the mass of the earth.</p>
<p>Then if you know how far the earth is from the sun, you can figure out just how strong the sun’s gravity needs to be to keep the earth in orbit.</p>
<p>Then if you know the sun’s radius, you have everything you need to calculate its mass.</p>
<p>Of course it’s not perfect, but it can be surprisingly accurate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basic math equation. Literally every mass in the universe has a gravitational force that pulls other objects to it. The larger that mass is, the stronger the gravitational pull it generates.</p>
<p>All objects with mass have a gravitational pull. Even you do, and the person next to you. You can literally calculate the gravitational pull between you and the person next to you if they give you their actual weight, and you know how far apart you are. It’s such a small number it’s comical, but it exists.</p></div>		</li>
