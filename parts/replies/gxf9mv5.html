<p>Is that a health concern? Regarding plastic bottles in general, I mean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Acetaldehyde is naturally occurring in a lot of things, including coffee, bread, and ripe fruit and is also present in many edible plants. It's also a potent natural carcinogen. The headache you have from a hangover after too much alcohol consumption is from a buildup of acetaldehyde which is an intermediate in digestion of ethanol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plenty of things are carcinogenic at the right dose. What's more important is if it's possible to get to that level by drinking canned beverages. I would guess not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. And acetaldehyde is also produced in your cells due to 1-carbon metabolism. Your cells have enzymes to break them down to prevent damage to DNA. And another set of enzymes to repair DNA if at all damage is fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, plastic is a health concern that is overlooked in many things.</p>
<p>This may sound like some fake Facebook post, but if you just touch a receipt, the BPA stays in your blood for around 1 WHOLE WEEK, and yes it has negative health effects and may cause cancer.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would &quot;taste&quot; the aluminum more. I say that in quotation marks because you can't taste or smell metal. The actual source of the smell is your own body oils reacting with the aluminum oxide layer, from touching the can. Aluminum readily oxidizes faster than steel, so you will &quot;taste&quot; aluminum more quickly than if your lips were interacting with steel. Interesting aside: stainless steel is effectively odorless/tasteless after touching because it heavily resists rusting.</p>
<p>You can test this yourself at home. Take any coins that smell really bad, and give them a good wash with a cloth so you're not touching them. You will notice you can't smell the coin at all. Touch it with your hands and it will stink again.</p></div>		</li>

Mainly from sodas from the UK (I am from mainland Europe). They do taste a bit more metallic than our cans....  so... what is this than</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yet, drinking out of a ceramic mug (as long as it's been glazed, which the majority of ceramic is) is basically like drinking from glass. The glaze on top is basically the same as a glass coating. Do you feel the same when drinking out of a glass? It would be interesting to do a blind test with drinking from glasses and ceramic mugs with similar shapes to see if you can truly tell the difference. My money is on no.</p></div>		</li>
