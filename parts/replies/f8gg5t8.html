			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, that's pretty much how I always explained it to people when they asked how I could fall asleep to metal music, or why I found it cathartic.  I'd say that &quot;it's calming to know that someone else out there is also angry and frustrated, so I don't always have to be.&quot;  Nice to know that I was actually onto something there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel you. I used to listen to RATM to fall asleep. Something comforting about really connecting to music that knocks me out, plus it drowns our random noise that would prevent me from falling asleep. </p>
<p>I also listen to specific bands or albums when I read. Something that I feel hits the mood of the feel of the particular narrative. It adds a great flow to my reading, relaxes me, allows me to concentrate on the story more and it reminds me of the book the next time I hear the song. </p>
<p>Music is incredible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's not already on your list, check out NIN's Ghosts I-IV albums.  Good for reading, and especially good for little projects where the task is more about doing something dexterous with your fingers than brute force.  Obligatory sex jokes aside, what I mean is things like drawing, soldering electronics, writing, building legos, etc.  Tasks where you're likely sitting down and working on something on a desk in front of you, and that take your undivided attention.  They're like the soundtrack to focus for me.</p></div>		</li>
