			<div class="markdown"><p>To illustrate some tires designed for very different jobs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/features/columns/a26089565/drag-racing-tires-explainer/" target="_blank">Drag racing tires</a>: As the thread parent noted, the rears are huge to have a lot of rubber touching the road. They also crinkle up (called &quot;squatting&quot;) at first which gives them more grip on initial acceleration by temporarily increasing the amount of tire touching the ground. Once the car is moving faster, the tires spin so fast that they balloon out (called &quot;standing up&quot;), which actually increases the top speed of the car since the tire's diameter increases and each spin moves the car further along the road. And yeah drag racers have little skinny front tires to minimize friction/drag since the front tires aren't allowed to be hooked up to the engine.</li>
<li><a href="https://rallystar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bloodhound-lsr-1210x642.jpg" target="_blank">This car</a> aims at setting a land speed record. Its tires are skinny to minimize friction since the acceleration comes from the jet engine and doesn't require big/grippy rubber tires to accelerate quickly. The tires also aren't made of rubber at all. At 800 mph, the same effects that cause a drag race tire to &quot;stand up&quot; would cause almost any rubber tire to tear itself apart just by spinning so fast.</li>
<li>F1 cars have big fat tires because they have have very powerful engines and a big grippy patch of rubber lets them push on the tires very strongly before the tires lose grip. F1 tires are smaller than drag racing tires because unlike drag racers, f1 cars turn a lot. A very tall wibbly-wobbly tire like a drag racer wiggles around a lot in turning, which is dangerous... so f1 tires are smaller to balance stability during turning with grip during acceleration. Amusingly, f1 cars are SO limited by tire performance, they once tried to <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/12/well-didnt-work-crazy-plan-bring-6-wheeled-cars-f1/" target="_blank">stick more tires on them</a>. That didn't last very long.</li>
<li>We all know what bicycle tires look like, so I won't link an image. But bicycles are rarely grip-limited by the tire. By far, the most important consideration in distance racing is efficiency, turning calories expended by the rider into forward motion. So the tires are skinny to minimize friction/drag. They also use exotic materials to be very light, and use aerodynamic tricks to reduce air friction.</li>
</ul>
<p>I kind of love this question because it also illustrates how the considerations that go into designing and building a thing change drastically at different scales:</p>
<ul>
<li>The same properties that cause your drag-racing tire to &quot;stand up&quot; and beneficially increase its top speed would cause your land-speed-record car to literally explode as the rubber tears itself apart.</li>
<li>The grip considerations that dominate tire engineering in motorsport are almost totally irrelevant in bicycle racing, where the limited power from the human &quot;engine&quot; requires very little grip but the limited &quot;fuel&quot; stored in the rider's body requires the tires to provide every drop of efficiency that can be found.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;that didn't last very long&quot; comment was a bit unjust too.</p>
<p>They did it cuz more tyres equals more grip, but remember that this was the 70s so pitstops were not the 2 sec affairs you see today. And having to replace two tyres more took away any advantage they had of more grip.</p>
<p>Of all the grand prix it entered it ended up on the podium for (nearly) half of them. 30 gp's, 14 podiums. One of them even a win.</p>
<p>It prompted 3 other big teams(at that time) to try and design their own six wheelers. Only difference was that all three of them tried it with the extra wheels at the back.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.motorsportretro.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Jonathan_Palmer_Williams_FW08_6_wheeler.jpg" target="_blank">this is Williams six wheeler</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02243/1976-March-2-4-0_2243004b.jpg" target="_blank">this is March's design</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.moto123.com/ArtImages/113405/ferrari-t6-inline-reut-trac.jpg" target="_blank">and this is Ferrari's, which is in a way less stranger since it has 4 wheels on one axle</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that your coefficient of friction is only multiplied by your downforce, and not even affected by the surface area. At least in idealized scenarios. Is it simply that increased surface area, instead of increasing your friction by means of surface area, merely ensures that whenever some part of the tire loses grip on the road, the effect is lessened because less downforce is going through that patch, and also you're less likely to lose friction for the entire tire?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have a good answer for this. I'm not a physicist or tire engineer, just a motorsport fan and this is the first I've encountered the idea of friction being independent of contact area.</p>
<p>And someone knowledgeable does agree with you and speculates on wear as the reason why high performance tires are large: <a href="https://www.stevemunden.com/friction.html" target="_blank">https://www.stevemunden.com/friction.html</a> Having read his argument, I think I'm convinced that it's true for long-lasting commodity road tires like the ones on your daily driver.</p>
<p>I do think there's a non-classic effect he's not accounting for in high-performance racing tires, though (though I have no expertise to back it up). Hot racing tires are so soft that they behave in some ways like a fluid. Racing track surfaces are often quite rough. I believe that the rubber actually molds itself into the texture of the road so that in addition to the classical lateral friction forces, the rubber/road form something like an irregular gear mesh. In order to break grip, it's necessary to:</p>
<ul>
<li>physically deform or tear the rubber</li>
<li>or physically deform or tear the road</li>
<li>or separate the rubber/road enough that they skate over each other laterally without getting intermeshed too much</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, I'm imagining something similar to if you stuck a wad of play-doh into the bristles of a hair brush. Once stuck in, there doesn't need to be ANY normal force for the play-doh to be difficult to move laterally, and classical friction models aren't the dominant forces in play. This resistance seems like it would be proportional to the size of the contact patch as well. I believe this kind of mechanism is responsible for a large amount of grip in high-performance racing tires, but is not a factor at all in consumer road tires.</p>
<p>That's a bunch of wild speculation, but if true it would reconcile your accurate view of idealized friction models not accounting for contact patch size with the actual practice of motorsport where contact patch size is regularly discussed. It also comports with temperature being such a critical component in tire performance. In any case, it's a great question. I hope someone more knowledgeable than I sees it and chimes in so we can both learn more.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>This is combined in drag racing, the rear wheels are the ones that transfer the power of the engine to the road surface and 'push' you off. The front wheels are not used for acceleration and braking so they are very thin.</p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>This is true for race cars in general, but not in a dragster:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dragsters don't compete to minimize braking time/distance like other motorsports, they just try to dissipate the massive energy safely by the end of the track. There's no incentive to &quot;invest&quot; in front wheels/brakes that minimize braking distance if doing so slows acceleration.</li>
<li>A lot of the braking energy comes from the drag chute deployed at the end of the run, not tires/brakes at all.</li>
<li>The brake balance is massively rearward compared to race cars in other disciplines because the rear tires are so huge and because you don't need to maximize turn-in forces on the front-wheels. Here's a video for a funny car saying that the rear brakes have 4 calipers compared to the single front caliper: <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2LOLhr3mzdY" target="_blank">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2LOLhr3mzdY</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The end of that video shows what the brakes do if the chute doesn't kick in, and clearly illustrates that the chute is the main braking component. The rears contribute the second most due to their size, and the fronts are the smallest contributor (in spite of the weight-transfer favoring the front-end during braking) because they are so small.</p>
<p>Front-wheels definitely contribute to braking forces in drag racing, but at an ELI5 level it's quite correct to point out that they participate minimally and their design stresses reduction of weight and rolling resistance in ways that massively reduce their contribution to the total braking forces generated by the car.</p></div>		</li>
