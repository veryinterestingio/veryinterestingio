			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the question is more how can you tell the difference between those. He &quot;sells it to buy a yacht&quot;, but then the stock &quot;just happens&quot; to do poorly. But really Tim did magically know it was going to happen (no paper trail anyway)</p>
<p>And from the other answers, it sounds like they will investigate if it smells fishy at all, so any lawyers ever will suggest not risking doing that if there is any chance you have material info??</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Insider trading is usually only investigated on big trades on bad news. In the Martha Stewart case, she sold all her stock the day before it was announced ImClone didn't get FDA approval. That's a huge trade on obviously bad news that's going to affect the stock.</p>
<p>If Tim Cook sells less than 1% of his stock the day before the next iPhone announcement, that's not really a huge issue. Will the stock go up or down, nobody really knows. Everybody has a good idea the next iPhone is coming, will it live up to expectations? That's hard to say either way. </p>
<p>If he dumped 100% of his stock, and he knows iPhone sales are way down, that's obviously an issue. Everything in the middle, that's up to a court to decide. They'd look at the communications between Tim and his broker. If he's buying a yacht, can he can prove it, he can show the transactions to the yacht broker. He'd have a paper trail showing when the yacht payments were coming due. If it's just a text at 11pm says &quot;dump everything by tomorrow!!!!!&quot; then that looks bad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just tacking on, it's not inside information, its material non public information.  Has to matter, like a material contract/acquisition, event etc.<br />
Also pretty sure the 144's aren't public record?  The form 4 they file within 2 days after the trade is easily accessible, but I've never seen the 144's filed in advance.  Maybe I just don't know where to look.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is to stop his brother from selling the stock the day before a 10% drop? Unless either of them admits it or there is a paper trail of him telling his brother, there is no way to determine if the brother traded on insider information or simply woke up one day and decided to liquidate his position, a perfectly legal and reasonable choice. The brother has no employee relationship with the company and is not bound by their employment rules. Tim Cook on the other hand has no legal method to stop his brother from freely purchasing or selling stocks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing can stop him from doing it.  But if they investigate any large transactions made directly before a big market event and find out that someone with a direct connection to an insider was involved, they can subpoena phone records and e-mails and potentially make a case that the trade was based on non-disclosed information.</p></div>		</li>
