<p>if you make a trench deeper, the mantle around it will want to push up on and make it &quot;float&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the actual answer that I was looking for, and perhaps OP, too. I thought if the trench got deeper eventually it'd be too close to molten rock that would just bubble up and make a new ocean floor, but thank you for learning me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the earth is a solid crust, then under that the solid mantle. Underneath that is a liquid outer core, then the solid inner core. So If you look down, there isnt really a sea of molten rock down there, just molten iron WAYYY down there. </p>
<p>How magma happens is either you add water to it in a subduction zone. This is basicaly like salting an icey road. You add another component, it lowers the melting temp, and then melt happens and is pushed up becuase it's less dense than the rock. </p>
<p>The other way melt happens is when the mantle flows up fast enough with enough heat, that the decompression from less rock above causes melting. This is what happens in ocean ridges and hot spot volcanism like hawaii. This is a little bit less intuitive, but its helpful to look at a phase diagram, and then slide over on the pressure axis. You will cross the phase change line. </p>
<p>A perhaps more relatable example is sublimation. If you put water or ice Into a vacuum chamber, even though it's the same temprature, becuase you lowered the chamber you can get it to boil.</p>
<p>Edit, you really couldn't ever dig physically and get the pressure low enough to let the rock melt. If you took a chunk of rock from 200km deep or whatever you please and teleport it to the surface, that would melt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent reply, but as an extreme pedant I must take issue with &quot;you really couldn't ever dig physically and get the pressure low enough to let the rock melt.&quot;</p>
<p>Give me a shovel large and fast enough (Thea comes to mind) and I'll happily ignore the compression/friction heating of impact and claim that I 'dug' just such a 'hole'. ;p</p></div>		</li>
