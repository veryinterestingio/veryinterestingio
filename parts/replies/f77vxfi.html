			<div class="markdown"><p>As the Saudi minister once said &quot;the stone age didn't end due to a lack of stones and the oil age will not end due to a lack of oil&quot;. With EVs becoming more and more popular and outright bans on ICEs being considered in the EU and China, we could see use for personal transport drop off sharply.</p>
<p>Obviously, this will not be the case for plastics, jet fuel shipping etc, but cars make up a considerable percentage of global demand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot more to oil than car fuel. For instance, heavy machinery fuel (ships, planes, cranes etc.) will not be substituted for electric or biofuel anytime soon. Grease for machine lubrication in industry will never be. Oil used to make plastics and other materials can be traded for other sources at times, but at prohibitive costs.</p>
<p>Even in the US, which has as strong a car culture as any, car fuel accounts for less than half of oil uses.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oil is an array of hydocarbons. Hydrocarbons can be synthesis now. We only don't do it because drilling for oil is vastly cheaper.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Never&quot; is extreme. Just as there are renewable and synthetic replacements for petroleum products like diesel fuel and plastics, there could be similar replacements for lubricants. If they're not common now it's likely because they aren't (yet) economically viable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See link below, that's Europe at least. For anyone that has trouble with the link. Pretty much a few of the major EU countries are looking to ban internal combustible engines. Denmark,  Norway, England, Netherlands and France all have plans to get rid of ICE cars in the nearish future 2025-2040 </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Shenzhen all buses are already electric. A number of cabs are already electric too. All scooters are electric already which is a huge difference if you've been to Vietnam or Taiwan where gas scooters are everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I was pretty much in awe how much green there is in Shenzhen actually. It's quite a progressive city and at times makes San Francisco look like a joke.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't need to ban ICE outright. Much softer regulations and economic forces can have the same net result. Nobody banned carbureted engines when electronic fuel-injection was perfected. But a combination of consumers wanting the better more reliable product and emissions regulations pretty much ensured that today there are almost no new cars with carbureted engines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a super response by u/CrystalTrudger.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, when I finished my Chemical Engineering degree I was considering continuing to a Masters.  My research would be looking at how (and why) the number of years' worth of oil available (ie, the amount of Proven or Probable Reserves divided by the annual usage) changed over time.</p>
<p>You'd expect that each year you'd get a 1-year decrease in these values.  But, in reality, there is always new technology to enable more complete extraction (eg fracking), new reserves found (eg, Iran's recent announcement, or new reserves under the melted polar ice caps), and new requirements (eg, increasing population, increasing number of &quot;middle class&quot; people in developing nations, new uses such as plastics - or reduced uses such as changing from gasoline to electric vehicles).</p>
<p>I didn't do the research (because I got a job instead of doing the Masters), but I suspected (and still do) that the number of years' worth of oil would actually increase over time.</p></div>		</li>
