			<div class="markdown"><p>It's very likely that the actual number of possible codes is much less, and at least one of those bars is reserved for error checking.  Point still stands though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>23 bars, with what looks like 6 possible lengths. Even if they mandate at least on bar of maximum and minimum length (so that the relative lengths of the other bars can be translated into discrete values), another couple reserved for error checking, theyâ€™re still well into the trillions of possible combinations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bad math. Two bars of the same length are identical, so swapping them with each other does not create an additional permutation. The number of possibilities is not factorial.</p>
<p>u/FunkyChromeMedina has the right idea. 6\^23 gives you 7.897*10\^17 permutations, so much more than 50 million that if you were to subtract that 50 million from that amount, the quantity I've just written (to four significant digits) would remain unchanged.</p></div>		</li>
