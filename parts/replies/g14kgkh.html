			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol I thought about saying that but explaining it seemed beyond the question. GCS was originally more indicated for trauma patients vs coma patients anyway, although of course itâ€™s use has spread. ðŸ˜€</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had a bash at relating GCS to the question elsewhere... in fairness, a better, briefer answer than mine would be that &quot;coma&quot; has a vague meaning even within medicine, and you can have or lack essentially any combination of reflexes in that state</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm fairly certain it's impossible to sneeze with an ET tube in place (the standard, inflated ET tube, anyway).  It seals in your trachea around a tube that exits your mouth.  This doesn't allow for any flow from the lungs through the nose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your nose can tickle, but you can't exchange oxygen. It's hard to adjust to. If I remember correctly it's nose tickle and eye water but that's it.</p>
<p>You can't control breathing through your mouth, either. Having the yawn reaction is more stressful imo. It really doesn't matter what you do, you can't alter the speed that the oxygen is moving at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>anecdotal: I had a talc pleurodesis and it was pain to laugh of take sudden deep breaths for a few weeks. </p>
<p>I would often do that inhale to sneeze which caused a sharp pain which would sorta cancel my reflex to sneeze. Point being I'm sure that even once the brain commits to a sneeze it can override it. It felt like a victory when I did manage to sneeze. 2/10 would not recommend the procedure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose it's possible to have the reflex, but, if anything, the air would exit the ET tube, rather than traveling through your nose.  So what we would generally consider a sneeze wouldn't happen.  I don't even think you'd be able to generate the fast airflow that is typically produced by a reflexive narrowing of the airway.  While on a ventilator, pressure is regulated to some degree, and that type of quick change may not be possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sneezing specifically that Iâ€™m aware of, but a lack of coughing can cause all sorts of problems with aspiration (I.e. choking on) of digestive fluids, foods, etc. When we put breathing tubes in we actively bypass the patients ability to effectively cough, but there are mechanisms that help prevent aspiration (the tube has a balloon you inflate to block the airway, pressures are avoided from bring too high) associated with breathing tube use.</p></div>		</li>
