			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's called indirect damage since it's your immune system that is causing it and not the pathogen.</p>
<p>With certain viruses such as Hepatitis A, the damage is mostly indirect, to the point that people with weak immune systems such as young children often don't develop symptoms. With most viruses it's a mix of both.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically does it mean that asymptomatic patients either have a strong pathogen able to suppress the immune system or weak pathogens that does not do that much damage to trigger symptoms?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Strong&quot; and &quot;weak&quot; don't make much sense in this context.</p>
<p>Some pathogens can reduce the immune system effectiveness, but generally speaking they can't completely suppress it. This however depends on the virus species, some viruses just don't have any weapon to do so.</p>
<p>As for &quot;weak&quot; pathogens, some are really weak and tend to cause asymptomatic infections, such as many Herpesvirus species. In other cases it's more correct to talk of a weak infection, either because the amount of viruses that first infected you is small or because your immune system reacted more effectively against it.</p>
<p>Let's say we have two healthy adult, an elder and an unlucky dude with severe AIDS that come in contact with a person with a cold.</p>
<p>The first adult simply talked a brief time with the infected person, so few virus copies entered his airways. His immune system is strong and he will likely get an asympomatic infection.</p>
<p>The second adult instead stayed in the same room of the other person for some hours, he came in contact with a lot of virus copies. Despite his strong immune system, he develops symptoms.</p>
<p>The elder talked a brief time but his immune system is weak. He developes symptoms.</p>
<p>The dude with AIDS didn't even talk with the infected person, he just walked by him, but it was enough to get in contact with a minimal amount of virus copies. His immune system however is severely damaged by HIV, so he gets a very bad infection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see, so the number of virus copies that entered ur body could possibly be a deciding factor towards the severity of the damage that could be done to a person, and also the severity could also be determined by the concomitants of pre-existing condition such as aids for this example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. Classical symptoms like runny nose, soar throat, coughing, fever, inflammation etc. are a reaction of your immune system to get foreign thingies out of your system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the symptom. When you get a cold for example, your nose gets runny because the virus is killing the cells that produce mucus, which becomes less sticky.</p>
<p>Later on, your immune system causes the vessels in your nose to swell and let more stuff trough to aid immune cells going out to fight the virus, this causes an overproduction of sticky mucus instead.</p></div>		</li>
