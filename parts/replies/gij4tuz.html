			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm dealing with that right now for the last three months.  Worst pain I've ever had in my life,  and I've had abscessed teeth, broken bones, passed a kidney stone, and had a fingernail cut in half. Currently in physical therapy for it. Chronic pain really is debilitating.</p></div>		</li>
