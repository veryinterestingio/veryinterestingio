There is ample evidence that millions of tons of antibiotics currently used in animal agriculture around the globe has major impacts on human health. There are many reasons we have not been able to control this use and the biggest one is the healthy animals needed for food. This allows the commensal bacteria found in livestock and up in the fresh meat products and may serve as reservoirs for resistant genes that could potentially be transferred to pathogenic organisms causing human disease. While antibiotic use in food animals may represent a risk to human health, the degree and relative impact have not been well characterized. So, there is still ongoing debate.</p></div>		</li>
