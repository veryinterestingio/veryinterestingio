			<div class="markdown"><p>Allen keys are super cheap to include with products that need assembly . It is just cut and bent hex stock. They also should have special material and hardening which some of the bad manufacturers  skimp on. It's been a while since I looked but at volume you can buy 4mm or 1/8&quot; Allen keys for around $0.07 each. That is cheaper than a lot of quality screws would cost you.</p></div>		</li>
