			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. Given what we know of cetacean intelligence, we would expect them to have large brains, although like you say a sperm whale is much more than 4x as large as a human, whichever way you measure it. So in fact, the brain size to body size ratio is actually a bit on the low side for larger whales like this, because they have evolved to be ridiculously large. Probably their smaller evolutionary ancestors had greater brain:body size ratios, ie. their brains didn’t get exponentially bigger as their size did - mammal brains are very costly in terms of energy and there’s only so much brain power you need! Dolphins are way off the chart the other way in terms of the brain:body ratio, plotting pretty much where humans do. </p>
<p>It’s still a reasonable thing to point out brain size in absolute terms though. Regardless of the ratio to body size (which we know isn’t the <em>only</em> factor in intelligence), I just don’t think you get brains that big like in sperm whales without being fairly smart somehow. It’s certainly not a prerequisite for big things to have big brains - many large dinosaurs famously had minuscule brains.</p></div>		</li>
