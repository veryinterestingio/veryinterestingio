<p>They're not named after being burned, if that's what you are referring to.</p>
<p>They're named after <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/sideburns-meaning-origin" target="_blank">General Burnside</a> </p>
<p>They used to be called &quot;side-whiskers&quot; and after general Burnside showed everybody how sexy they were, they were called sideburns as a play on words.</p></div>		</li>
