			<div class="markdown"><p>The two most common forms of heat tracing are electric and steam.</p>
<p>My chemical plant uses a mix of both. Steam is primarily used for unintentionally heating the atmosphere and icing the ground around whatever you intended to keep warm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Steam lances, blankets, and a few other things aside, the steam should typically stay inside the pipes.</p>
<p>In the plant I work in (that just finished 2 weeks of -40 and worse temps we have a mix of electric and steam trading as well. Primarily steam. Electric is mostly used where precise temp control is needed. Mostly situations where things like caustic embrittlement will begin to take place over 110° or so which is too cool for steam.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We use electric and glycol at my plant. Steam can freeze in cold enough environments if there’s a leak causing piping to freeze and rupture. Glycol can also double as a means for cooling as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Also heat tracing of measurement lines... typically 1/2” or smaller (making them very easy to freeze) are connected to control devices. If that line freezes it can take an entire plant offline.</p></div>		</li>
