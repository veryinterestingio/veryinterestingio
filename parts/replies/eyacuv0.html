<p>That white on the outside is all mold. </p>
<p>There's also blue mold like in blue cheese. And green mold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course, mold is what makes some cheeses, including blue cheese, brie and camembert. The issue is whether an additional parasitic mold is harmful, and some are and some aren't. I'm not sure that color of the mold is a reliable method of determining whether it's harmful, though. By the time you see mold, it's sent hyphae much farther into the food. Scraping off the mold removes most of the flavor of the mold, but there's enough left to trigger allergic reactions in sensitive people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. I read that hard cheeses keep the mold on the outside and is fairly safe to eat when the mold is cut off.  Soft cheeses are not as the mold can penetrate quite easily.</p></div>		</li>
