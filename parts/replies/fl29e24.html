			<div class="markdown"><p>Stopping from proper cardio will be only due to your body running out of energy (out of carbs and/or fat). Heart or lungs will never be the limiting factor in a healthy individual.</p>
<p>Even outside of cardio, if you're performing exercise such as sprinting or weightlifting you will stop due to muscle failure way before you'll run your heart or lungs into the ground. Lungs not keeping up is unheard of as far as I know, and heart can theoretically go up to 240bmp if necessary before hitting a wall (absolute max heart rate, basically impossible to reach through exercise without the muscles completely fatiguing first)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your heart can get tired. If you don’t have enough oxygen even your heart will start to want for it and will have to use a less efficient form of energy which is went it will start to get tired. This isn’t harmful right away but can be if kept up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So potentially ridiculous question here, but if we were somehow able to increase the mitochondria in skeletal muscles, would we have ridiculous endurance?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The more mitochondria we have per cell, the longer we can exert ourselves.</p>
<p>Regular endurance training will increase the number of mitochondria present in a cell; this is a connection that has been known for some time now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This isn't measured as a percentage. As you've said, it's counted per cell, not per cent (hundred).</p></div>		</li>
