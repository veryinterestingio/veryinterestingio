<p>The US likely has reservations for 12,13 &amp; 14 due to use by other technology, <del>military and surveillance tech</del>. I suspect they aren't widely used anymore, but as with a lot of things they were widely enough used when WiFi first got standardised that they were an issue for US usage.</p>
<p>Edit: removed claim of military/surveillance, as you can actually see <a href="https://fccid.io/frequency-explorer.php?lower=2412&amp;upper=2484" target="_blank">the full list of things in that spectrum</a> (credit: /u/wertyuip, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/de0veb/eli5_why_is_24ghz_wifi_not_hardlimited_to/f2uhvnr/" target="_blank">here</a>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is the most poorly written and researched article I have ever read.</p>
<p>&quot;The band, with a centre frequency of 2.48GHz, is known as the Industrial Scientific and Medical, or ISM, band and can be picked up worldwide. The most common device that operates on the frequency is the microwave oven, which supposedly works at 2.45GHz.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It’s not known whether the signal received from channel 14 affects microwaves or vice versa.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Channels 12 and 13 are partially restricted by the FCC and are only allowed at low power levels. Their usage is limited to prevent overlap with Channel 14, which is restricted for military use and satellite communications.</p>
<p>I believe that the reasoning is to avoid the possibility of interference with critical systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also because before OFDM (802.11a, 802.11g), the old standards (802.11-1997, 802.11b) had a slightly wider bandwidth. For those standards, the issue with partial overlap was also probably (do not quote me on that) not quite as significant, as they used spread spectrum instead of OFDM.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>802.11a and 802.11b were designed at the same time. 802.11a was a 5 GHz spec which offered higher throughput which made it practical for network backhauls (mainly around the Motorola Canopy product line). In end-user devices, 802.11b equipment was lower cost which made it more practical for distributed wireless. Of course, the 802.11g protocol introduced more reliable modulations schemes and was spec’d for 2.4 and 5 GHz. 802.11n introduces multiple radio chains (the beginning of MIMO technology). 802.11ac and Wave2 have further improved MIMO technology as well as better high density client traffic handling but 802.11ac is only a 5 GHz spec.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost. 802.11n was the first PHY that operated in both frequency bands. 802.11g is pretty much a compatibility layer to support 802.11a-like signals in the 2.4 GHz band, where they co-exist with 802.11b, legacy 802.11 and all the other random 2.4 GHz stuff like Bluetooth, ZigBee, proprietary wireless and microwave ovens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We were doing MIMO on 802.11g! At 300mbps baby! This was way back in 2003 years before 802.11n was ratified. Airgo Networks was our name (started off as wood side networks) anyways we were small, like 160 people in Palo Alto.. but our stuff was so fast we won over huge players (beating out Broadcom, and Intel) to have our chipset in Belkin and Linksys devices. It was a crazy time to be at an actually successful start up, selling tons of real products. I used to go to Fry’s and be proud our stuff was on the shelves! In the early days it was fun to do that, you see wide eyed customers clearly overwhelmed at the selection in front of them as they made their first WiFi purchase ever (like 2003-2004) I’d explain, like the nerd I am, the differences and why they should get our product... anyways we ended up getting bought by Qualcomm in 2006, mainly because they wanted our patents, but they kept most of the engineering staff.. so that was cool. And the retention bonus was nice</p></div>		</li>
