			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this mean if you had something that makes a noise, a mute lion for example, you could trick the brain from thinking the noise came from in front when it was actually behind you? The lion makes the motion of roaring, but being mute no sound comes out. However, another lion behind you roars at the same time. Would you hear the roar as coming from in front of you?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the basis of how all illusions work. Once you’ve figured out how the brain perceived the world, you can present something that appears to be one thing but is actually another. </p>
<p>This is also how videos work. There isn’t actually any connection between the screen and speakers, the audio and video are two different pieces of software that are just set to begin functioning at the same time. Your brain is tricked into seeing the lion on screen roaring, hearing the speaker roaring, and connecting the two. </p>
<p>You can see how hard this would be to pull off by watching any music video with lip syncing. So hard to make it look like they’re singing live.</p></div>		</li>
