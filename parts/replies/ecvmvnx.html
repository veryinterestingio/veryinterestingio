			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this answer. So why don’t we conduct the experiment in a vacuum? Is the issue that you we don’t have a large enough vacuum to fit enough mass where the gravitational force is sufficient to measure with more accuracy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue isn’t really a needing a vaccuum. It’s more so the fact that every mass in the universe (as far as we know) gravitationally attracts every other mass. This includes any measurement equipment you’d be bringing to conduct the experiment. </p>
<p>It’s moreso the need for complete isolation. </p></div>		</li>
