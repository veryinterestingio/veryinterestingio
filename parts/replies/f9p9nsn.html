			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify, this actually has nothing to do with water (it's a weak absorber and doesn't scatter in any special way) and very little to do with absorbance. The same effect can be seen with 200 proof alcohol (pure ethanol), with gasoline, or with acetone. The apparent darkness is due to the difference in <em>how light travels</em> between the air and the liquid, and then again between the liquid and the solid that looks dark. These boundaries <em>between materials that light travels through differently</em> cause substantial scattering to occur. <em>That</em> is the lost light that makes the object appear dark.</p>
<p>Edit: removed a technical term that was causing significant consternation. The explanation is now too vague to be perfectly accurate, but it should still serve.</p></div>		</li>

And in either case, it's surely better than leaving uncorrected a comment that was blatantly (if almost certainly unintentionally) misleading.</del></p>
<p>I was being stubborn. I simplified it further. It still mostly works.</p></div>		</li>
