			<div class="markdown"><p>A phonon is a fundamental mode of vibration of a crystal.</p>
<p>You can think of a crystal as a bunch of masses (the atoms/ions/molecules) attached by springs (ionic bonds/covalent bonds/hydrogen bonds). The whole thing can vibrate, as you might expect. However, because it's a quantum system there are only discrete amplitudes at which it can vibrate. The smallest amplitude is called a phonon. If you go up by one step so it's vibrating at twice the minimum amplitude, we say there are two phonons, etc.</p></div>		</li>
