			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, try this. Take a fan with about 6 fins and color one a clearly different color (ideally the others will be black and one yellow). Focus on the black fins and increase the fan speed until you see the effect. They'll appear to go backwards. Now focus on the yellow fin. Because there's only one, your brain will be able to track it and it will appear to go in the right way.</p></div>		</li>

Focus on the gray fins.</p>

<p>I now understand what antialiasing is doing in my games because i saw that shit all through the 90's especially on ps1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anti aliasing in games is a completely separate effect iirc. It's more of a smart blurring of pixels to makes lines appear smoother, hiding the jagged lines that are produced by square pixels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah... no.</p>
<p>Different kind of aliasing. This thread is about what's called &quot;temporal aliasing&quot;. Videogames are about &quot;spatial aliasing&quot;.</p>
<p>In video games (or computer graphics in general), anti-aliasing refers to any technique used to smoothen sharp edges of differing contrast. When looking at (low resolution) graphics, diagonal lines appear &quot;jagged&quot; because it's a row of pixels in a staircase pattern. This looks bad so anti-aliasing techniques are used to smoothen out that row of pixels making it look more natural.</p>
<p>Anti-aliasing is something that still done in videogames today. In fact, I'm surprised you mention PS1 because I somehow doubt PS1 would support any form of anti-aliasing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly modern game engines do temporal &amp; spatial antialiasing.  There are a number of techniques but it boils down to more advanced techniques that include things like velocity buffers for doing motion blur on objects etc.</p>
<p>The &quot;standard&quot; method these days for AA on the Unreal engine is
temporal AA.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>With the games it's not your vision getting maxed out, there are fine details in a scene that align with the pixels on your screen or interact with the camera in some weird way. You can also have screen tearing where the CPU might not be running fast enough or the graphics card is maxed out so the frames aren't drawn completely before the next frame starts to draw on your screen. It's usually a trade-off for image quality because sometimes gamers want higher frame rates so they can shoot people faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This can happen in real life without a camera as well - you wonâ€™t see it during the daytime or with incandescent light, but a lot of time you may see this at night with fluorescent light or whatever streetlights are as many of those flicker at 60hz, resulting in a stroboscopic effect.</p></div>		</li>
