<p>Shout out to the maths lecturer at Darwin University. Probably the smallest uni in Australia, but almost every single lecturer I had went there on holiday and ended up living there, teaching what they loved.</p>
<p>Thanks Dr Roberts &amp; Dr Nic. Your efforts didn't go to waste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, when dealing with infinite sets you can't really count to determine &quot;how big they are&quot;, because you'd never stop (and in some cases you can't count at all, but let's leave that aside for now). So how do you tell if two infinite sets have the same number of elements? You pair each element of one set with one element of the other set, and vice versa. If you can do this, they have the same &quot;number&quot; of elements. For elements in [0, 1] and [0, 2], this pairing consists of multiplying/dividing by 2. So the two sets have the same number of elements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another way to think about it is with the graph drawn by the function y=2x. If you chose a specific segment of the graph, for example 0&lt;x&lt;1 you could find infinitely many points on that line that would give you x,y coordinates. As the x and y coordinates are always dependant you can't say that there are more possible numbers for y than x.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think you can really explain this to a 5yo as it requires abstract thinking that is above their level.
The top comment tried to <em>explain it to a 5yo</em>, in the sense that they avoided using math terms they couldn't possibly know. However for people who have had math at a level where they are used to functions and graphs I thought it could make it easier to understand if I used something they were familiar with. So in other words: STOP BEING SO FUCKING PEDANTIC!</p></div>		</li>
