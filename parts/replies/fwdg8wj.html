			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! I also think we have a natural instinct that predisposes us to remember sad and bad over the good. Bad and sad feelings might cause anxiety and cause a flight or fight response, which releases dopamine and/or adrenaline surges within your body.  What goes up, must go down, and then you'll have a crash from being deprived of it, and will feel drained. Someone very dear to me suffers from this, and the mind actually forces itself to play into it and causing anxiety so it gets more of that dopamine release or rush. Speak to someone who can help, and see if you can work through it mentally, and/or get meds that can make things balance out for you.</p></div>		</li>
