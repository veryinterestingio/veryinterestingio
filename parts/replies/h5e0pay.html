			<div class="markdown"><p>You have a certain amount of glycogen (basically sugar) stored in your muscles, frequent training increases the amount stored. Glycogen is used until depleted, then only an aerobic (with oxygen) metabolic process can be used until glycogen levels are restored, the liver also stores glycogen. This is why it is important to take breaks between sets in weightlifting or after a hard sprint, these activities require glycogen as fuel as they are primarily anaerobic activities. If you were to try to do another set too quickly, you would have to reduce the weight or fail after a very small number of sets. A good rest period to bring glycogen levels back to normal is about 3 minutes according to the ACE personal trainer manual. </p>
<p>As for running, if you run at a pace that allows you to keep going using aerobic metabolism, you can go for a very long time, such as in a marathon.  Nobody can sprint a marathon. </p>
<p>Edit: the oxidative metabolic process uses fatty acids, I believe, for whatever that's worth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Type 1 muscle fibers are basically muscle fibers that are suited for endurance activity, basically any aerobic activity that you do for a longer duration like running. These fibers have less force production, however they are more fatigue resistant and don’t really experience much hypertrophy meaning they don’t really grow in size. They are known as “slow twitch” fibers.</p>
<p>There are two other skeletal muscle fibers in humans, type 2a and type 2x, both of these kinds are built for anaerobic activity which is basically any exercises in short bursts like weightlifting and sprints. These fibers produce a lot of force and are able to experience quite a bit of hypertrophy, except they are also easily fatigued. The difference between the two is that 2x produces even more force than 2a, however it is fatigued even quicker. These are known as “fast twitch.” Typically when people are weightlifting, these are the fibers they are training.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Will running increase type 2?</p>
<p>Would a marathon runner have any benefits from typical leg weightlifting like squats?</p>
<p>Would a strongman see benefit from marathon running?</p></div>		</li>
