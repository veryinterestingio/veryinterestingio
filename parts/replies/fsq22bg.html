			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, the proto-Japanese word for &quot;mama&quot;/mother might have been &quot;papa&quot; or something similar. If we look at the modern neutral-polite word for mother 母 (haha) and consider that the [h] sound in modern Japanese has probably evolved from a proto-Japanese [p] sound via [ɸ] (This sound is made by blowing through pursed but half-open lips, like when you're blowing on your food to cool it down. We know that at least until the middle ages, the  [ɸ] sound was in use for all syllables starting with an h today thanks to Portuguese documentations of the Japanese language of that time), then the evolution of &quot;haha&quot; would be [haha] &lt; [ɸaɸa] &lt; [papa].</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's odd because the &quot;ka&quot; sound is used in &quot;kaka&quot; (a baby way of saying mother) and okaasan (addressing mother etc). Similarly a child might call their father touchan, or when more grown up otousan, which suggests a &quot;to&quot; root.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to this <a href="http://gogen-allguide.com/o/okaasan.html" target="_blank">Article</a>, &quot;okāsan&quot; might have come from &quot;okatasama&quot;, which is what mothers and wives were called in warrior caste households. For &quot;otōsan&quot; it is thought that it evolved via &quot;chichi&quot; (titi, originally a honorific form of address for men) -&gt; &quot;tete&quot; through vowel change, which then got turned into &quot;toto&quot; -&gt; &quot;otōsan&quot; in childen's speech (Source: <a href="http://gogen-allguide.com/ti/chichi.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://gogen-allguide.com/ti/chichi.html" target="_blank">http://gogen-allguide.com/ti/chichi.html</a></a>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a bit confused as to why the word for mother would evolve from a word for father though.</p>
<p>Also children/babies wouldn't refer to their parents as haha/chichi when first learning to speak as that is just a respectful way of talking about them to a third party, so again I'm unsure why it would be that form of the word mother that would evolve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's saying that the ancient pronunciation of haha was likely papa, which would presumably be before &quot;western&quot; influence gave them papa as a name for a father.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I was trying to say is that the proto-japanese pronunciation of &quot;haha&quot; was most likely [papa] :)</p>
<p>Since the okāsan/otōsan forms that are in use today only came about during the Edo period (<a href="https://etymology-encyclopedia.com/okaasann/" target="_blank"><a href="https://etymology-encyclopedia.com/okaasann/" target="_blank">https://etymology-encyclopedia.com/okaasann/</a></a>), I would say it's sensible to assume that &quot;haha&quot; and &quot;chichi&quot; are the earliest base words for mother/father. If you look at the third section of the first fascicle of the Kojiki, &quot;母母&quot; is used presumably as a representation of &quot;ha-ha&quot; (which might have been pronounced [papa]).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may be the evolution of the language, as older versions may have had slightly different meanings such as &quot;parent&quot; or &quot;guardian&quot; and changed into the modern version through general use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great post, just a slight correction for the Japanese part: The Japanese do have their own word for baseball (野球 yakyuu,  literally meaning field ball) that is basically used exclusively over a loanword version. This is in contrast to say volleyball, which does have a unique Japanese word (排球 haikyuu) but the loanword version is used virtually exclusively (バレーボール bareibooru). </p>
<p>Also the noise for a cat's meow is nyaa rather than niao. Other examples of where Japanese 'sounds' differ include things such as frog's ribbits being 'gero gero' and the 'sound' something glinting makes being 'pika pika'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Frog sounds are pretty weird. I guess it's because they are hard to replicate with the human voice, in German it would be &quot;quak&quot; which is the same as the sound that ducks make unless you really try to sound like a frog.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the correction on the cat sound. It looks like the cow sound of &quot;muu&quot; is a better example of what I was going for.</p>
<p>Also, I'm not sure whether &quot;wan wan&quot; is a better or worse description than &quot;bark bark&quot; for the noise a dog makes, but it's certainly different. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Loanwords are not necessarily “really good”, though, they sometimes come into common usage “just because”. Katana, for example, is derived from the Portuguese “catana”, which was a sort of machete-like long knife. Which does describe a katana passingly well, but Japanese already had a more precise world for it: Tachi. In later periods they came to represent slightly different types of Japanese swords, but originally they described the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooo, I did not know that about &quot;katana&quot;. Thanks.</p>
<p>And I guess there's also another reason loanwords can come into being: because they're from a higher-status language, like English getting a bunch of French words after the Norman conquest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is backwards.  The Portuguese borrowed &quot;catana&quot; from Japanese.  Japan did borrow a few words from the Portuguese, like &quot;pan&quot; (bread).  Here's a list of more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_Japanese_words_of_Portuguese_origin" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary\_of\_Japanese\_words\_of\_Portuguese\_origin" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary\_of\_Japanese\_words\_of\_Portuguese\_origin</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. At first I thought no way you were right, I learned that in Japanese classes, from actual Japanese teachers. But looking into it more closely, that seems to be an actually open linguistics questions, as seen in <a href="https://books.google.com.br/books?id=3qk-p5hKuccC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=katana+from+portuguese+catana&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PxXWlfXQFx&amp;sig=ACfU3U1SbQ85swdfi2-jOxhqTNvCUFvu_A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjvo6isoOfpAhXuE7kGHSF5CgcQ6AEwBXoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=katana%20from%20portuguese%20catana&amp;f=false" target="_blank">this excerpt</a>. So anyways, it might go either way. Catana is not in current usage in modern Brazilian Portuguese, in any case, and I think that’s also the case with European Portuguese.</p></div>		</li>
