			<div class="markdown"><p>To further this explanation, visceral fat presents as &quot;raised with a definite shape&quot; because, like the uterus, it is <em>behind</em> the abdominal muscles, rectus sheath, Peritoneum, etc and those structures give it form.  Subcutaneous fat is <em>in front</em> of those tissues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah technically in a purely physiological sense but comprehensively it couldn't happen, at least not naturally, as your body is going to deposit fat in some proportionality to that area.  </p>
<p>I suppose you could do it with surgery on someone who has very well-developed rectus abdominis and just do very precise liposuction on that area.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: I am now even more confused after some google searches. Apparnetly fat close to the liver can be lost faster but man there is so much material about this topic I'll stay agnostik</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's absolutely true that you can't target fat loss by exercising a specific body part, but everyone has a specific order in which they burn fat. Some people burn the back fat first, others the arm fat first, etc. But you don't burn everything at the same time in the same way that you don't accumulate fat all over your body at the same rate.</p></div>		</li>
