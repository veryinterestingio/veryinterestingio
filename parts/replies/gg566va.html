			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. I can’t believe I had to scroll this far for the correct answer. </p>
<p>Ascites. Fluid accumulates in the peritoneal cavity due to portal hypertension caused by liver failure. That’s also why « beer gut » feels tight like a drum and not flabby like fat. </p>
<p>Visceral fat accumulation is also a real thing and quite possibly an issue for many of these patients too. </p>
<p>But the beer gut specifically is ascites. Fun fact, we confirm this in the field with a “fluid shift test” that is basically starting a wave on one side of the abdomen and watching it ripple to the opposite side</p>
<p>Source: am a paramedic. This is a daily occurrence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fluid shift test doesnt allways work, i had a hard time getting drained after 2 doctors said 'nah doesnt look or feel like you have ascites' im like i know i do, i can feel it shift around when i move.  I made them take them out by telling the doctors a lie, and they finnaly did a ultrasound and drained out 4.5 liters...    </p>
<p>So tip for any liver failure sufferers who can't seem to get a paracentises (sp?) done is goto the ER and tell them you have had a low fever all day and are scared it might be spontaneous bacterial infection and they stick ya with a big needle and let you fill up many bottles with your forbidden belly beer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are definitely instances when the typical fluid shift sign is not present or imperceptible. It is only one aspect of a much more comprehensive patient exam. </p>
<p>It is important to be an advocate for yourself, and healthcare providers are imperfect humans like the rest of us. So I agree with you on the necessity of speaking up when you have a concern that isn’t being addressed properly. You will always be the #1 expert on your body and what it feels like to be inside it. This is even more important when you have a chronic condition and know what has worked or not worked in the past.</p>
<p>However, it is NEVER a good idea to fabricate symptoms as you’ve suggested. That can lead to very serious harm if you’re incorrectly diagnosed and/or treated based on that misinformation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You have to go through 5+ comments all saying the same wrong thing to get to the real answer. Whenever there's a topic I do know something about, I follow this pattern and it seems to hold up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except this answer isn’t correct.  “Beer bellies” are almost always due to excessive visceral fat and not due to ascites. I’ve been reading CTs on fat people for over 20 years now and should know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The “beer belly” is almost always fat.  Ascites in liver disease is an end stage phenomenon and is pretty rare.</p></div>		</li>
