			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do we have so many languages then? Is it because C uses an &quot;old&quot; assembler but &quot;D&quot; uses a newer one  that is a bit more efficient, or faster for some tasks?</p>
<p>And different higher level languages(Esperanto) use different lower languages (C) for the same reason like efficiency gain (for certain tasks)?</p>
<p>Does this mean that there's never going to be a programming language that is the end all be all of programming languages?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every programming language is a trade-off to some degree. This is a heavy oversimplification, but as a rule of thumb as language abstracts away more difficult problems, it removes control of the actual underlying behavior and often comes at a performance hit.</p>
<p>So, for a simplified example, D attempted to supplant C by making the process by which you manage your memory abstracted away. Instead of directly controlling when you put something into memory and then destroying it when you’re done (which is very easy to do wrongly), D has a system that does all that implicitly for you. The trade-off is that now your D program will spend processing cycles managing that memory, and will probably use more of it than if you had optimized it by hand in C. You gave up control over managing your memory to save you the trouble of thinking about it at all.</p>
<p>The “higher level” a programming language is, the more layers of abstraction it has away from the underlying machine. For example, Java runs entirely in its own virtual machine and abstracts away all the specifics of the computer you are running on. While a C program has to be built and tested on every combination of processor architecture and operating system you want to run it on, a Java program will work anywhere the Java Virtual Machine can run without you having to worry about it. The developers of Java have to worry about making the JVM work on all those different platforms, but people writing Java code know that it will “just work”. The trade-off there is the significant overhead of running a full virtual environment for your program, plus you no longer have direct access to the hardware you’re running on. For many uses, the trade-off of portability and ease of writing the program is worth it, but for others, you really want to save on resource usage or have that low-level control of the exact hardware you’re running on.</p>
<p>Those are just a few examples, but there’s dozens of different trade-offs that you consider when picking a language. Programming languages are like tools — they are far better when designed with a specific intended use. You wouldn’t want to try to do all your carpentry with some crazy multitool that could do everything from planing to nailing to sawing, you’d want specific tools for each task. And of course, there’s several different variants of saws that are better at one <em>type</em> of sawing, or even just come down to personal preference. Programming languages are the same way. There will never be one “be all end all” language because anything that remotely attempted to find a middle ground between all those different trade-offs would <em>suck</em> to use.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Also, the reason this isn’t a problem is that programming languages aren’t remotely as difficult to learn as spoken ones. Once you have a reasonable amount of experience programming, learning a new language is a relatively easy process. Getting to the point of being able to use it at all is on the order of hours to days, getting to the point of being competent with it is on the order of weeks to months. Learning the nuances, idioms, gotchas, and tricks still takes longer, but you don’t need to master a language to be useful (and as long as you have someone to review your code that <em>does</em> have that experience, you can learn quicker from them and avoid making egregious mistakes).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to C vs Java, which is the first language combo I can think of also, there are languages specifically designed to working with data bases, with statistics, Matlab is a special use case for graphics representation, Python can be easy to learn and useful in some fields more that others. C# <del>works</del> worked only on Windows machines for a long time. PHP is used mostly for server-side web development. The higher the language level, it's usually slower - Java is slower than C, C is presumably slower than Assembler ( although you can write very efficient code in C if you know what you are doing ).</p>
<p>Turing-complete (which is most languages), meaning that the language can theoretically do any type of computation that any other language can do (we have the basic theoretical proof that a simple mechanism called a Turing machine can do anything a modern computer can do, so we compare each language to this simple mechanism). As long as the language is Turing complete, you can do anything with any language, and sometimes is just a matter of choice of the team leader - how many developers I have that know this language, how easy is it to integrate with my main product, what are the expected salaries for new hires, and how easy it is to find new talent (especially Seniors) in this field and myriad of other considerations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice answer, well written. I think especially the comparison to carpentry is very useful as programming often seems like some hoodoo magik and programmers as sorcerers. (True only at the highest levels of coding, but absolutely not the case in the vast majority of cases.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, those are some of the reasons. They also make new ones cause it might be easier to write code in one language for a specific task compared to an existing language. There's also this: <a href="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png" target="_blank">https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png</a></p>
<p>Higher level languages are usually used to make it quicker for programmers to write a program. Lower level languages allow for more tweaking of how code runs so if you need to make something more efficient you would usually use something lower level.</p>
<p>I'm not sure there will ever be one. New technology keeps on coming out and sometimes you need a new language or several new languages to fully utilize all its features. Like how websites are built from html, css, js, etc. instead of trying to use some lower level language like C to do everything. The amount of effort required by a programmer to build anything like that would be way more than making a new language once that's easier to use and going from there for everyone.</p></div>		</li>
