			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, this is the most reasonable explanation here.  Most people fell for the narrative that socialism itself is the opposite of liberalism. Socialism is linked to the opposition of capital accumulation. For those who analyze economics and politics through a two-dimensional view, in addition to left and right, we have authoritarianism and liberalism as the second axis. So it is fully &quot;possible&quot; to conceive of a liberal socialist state.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In socialism, the MoP are run by the workers. For example, the workers at the local steel mill would democratically decide on the price of their product, who to hire and fire, et cetera.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very specific form of socialism--libertarian socialism or syndicalism, or the ultimate form of communism. It's interesting that most of the comments here are giving this utopian form of socialism as <em>the</em> definition of socialism.</p>
<p>The most common form of socialism <em>in practice</em> has been <strong>State socialism.</strong> The State controls industry and the means of production, and in theory is meant to guard and represent the interests of the workers. This is done through a centralized, planned economy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite the opposite. Marxist-Leninism is a very specific form of socialism and Marx himself criticized “state socialism” as merely creating “an abstract capitalist.”</p>
<p>Have the most prominent examples of socialism been centrally-organized? Yeah, that would only make sense given our conflict with the Soviet bloc. To say it has been the most common is pretty ahistorical though, especially since it ignores the many workers’ councils the Soviet Union was named after.</p></div>		</li>
