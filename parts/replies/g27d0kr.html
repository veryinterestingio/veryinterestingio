			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, that's quite a gamble, it depends on if I'm feeling lucky today... but seriously, we have to break that question into several parts.  First, we have to ask what the probability is that we actually gather the right kind of data - that we actually examine liquid water from one of the icy moons in our Solar System, either by scooping up water vapor from plumes being ejected from the surface, or by landing on the surface and possibly drilling into the interior.  I think the probability of this type of mission launching and completing its work within my lifetime is high -- there are a number of mission concepts for this already, and there is a lot of momentum in both the scientific research and policy communities for this type of mission.</p>
<p>The second half of the question is whether these missions will actually discover conclusive evidence of microbial life.  On this, I think there is almost no way to know at this point -- there are so many unknowns, including the likelihood that life would form, how abundant it would be (i.e. how hard would it be to find), and how similar this microbial life would look to the microbes we know from Earth.  We really have no idea about the answers to any of these questions -- but we are actively working to design the scientific instruments for these missions to be as sensitive as possible to a wide variety of potential signs of microbial life on ice-covered ocean worlds, so that we have the best chance to be successful when we get there. - Avi</p></div>		</li>

<p>I understand the difficulty of putting a number on it. But I’m really curious about even the order of magnitude estimate for finding microbial life given all the detailed knowledge you’ve accumulated. For instance, is your own person, subjective guess more like 0.01%, 0.1%. 1%, or 10%.  I just have no clue how experts in this field think about these probabilities when they are in their most reflective moments.</p></div>		</li>
