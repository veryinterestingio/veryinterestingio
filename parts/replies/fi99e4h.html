<p>This rate depends on a lot of things, but is pretty heavily dependent on the immediate environment of the nucleus (which is why you can use it differentiate different tissue types).</p>

<p>Chemical shift isn't really highly relevant in imaging. MRI basically just measures the proton density per voxel and distinguishes tissues by that metric.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not 100% on all the physics but chemical shift is the basis for many imaging techniques in MRI when differentiating between water (in most organs) and fat. The immediate environment of the hydrogen protons affects their precession enough for selective excitation from RF pulses.
Overall proton density will always affect the signal but only using that is a simplification of what can be achieved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be done in specialized techniques usually called MRSI. And those require even higher fields and have a lower spatial resolution. Standard MRI doesn't do it. You can distinguish high water content and high fat content easily by proton density and different relaxation behaviour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chemical shift is both useful and a problem.  Most  clinical imaging is done trying to avoid chemical shift as a unwanted artifact, while other sequences take advantage of the phenomenon to acquire specific results.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I said in my other post, yeah, I know that there are chemical shift dependent techniques, especially for looking at metabolites. But when you blast out a water suppression sequence, you kill your sensitivity. So it's more of a special use case.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you expose the nuclei to the right kind of radio frequency waves, some of the nuclei at the lower energy level will get excited to the higher energy level, and when they relax back down, you'll get a signal. This is what's being measured during the imaging.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a confusing description I think. The protons in the lower state are brought into a superposition of the two states - which corresponds to an average direction orthogonal to the magnetic field. It is then measured how that state evolves over time (it &quot;rotates&quot; around, staying orthogonal to the magnetic field, emitting radiation in the process). The protons in the higher state emit waves opposite to the signal, so they weaken the overall signal. A stronger magnetic field leads to a stronger difference in occupation of higher and lower state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's more like it. The relaxation doesn't shape the signal itself - that's just the free precession of the bulk magnetization vector. The relaxation shapes the decay of that free induction signal. On the other hand, relaxation is extremely important in MRI, since weighing your measurement differently for spin-spin or spin-lattice relaxation can give you different information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good simplification.  Just going re-say what you said:  Clinical MRI, that you find in the hospital setting, for knees, backs, etc, use hydrogen as the proton of choice  for imaging.  NMRI, while itâ€™s not wrong to call regular MRI that, is typically nomenclature used in research settings or spectroscopy where they use multiple types of protons for imaging.</p></div>		</li>
