			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe slightly off, as a quick Google search says the glottis is the structure consisting of the vocal cords and the gap between them.</p>
<p>Could you mean the epiglottis? The thing that flips between covering trachea and esophagus?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re right. The epiglottis does prevent food from getting to your wind pipe.</p>
<p>However it is not the one reacting to your body when you’re crying. </p>
<p>“A glottis contracts and expands whenever a person breathes depending on the activity whereas an epiglottis might move in the upward direction on breathing and sideways when someone is swallowing food.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My APHY professor had research showing that the epiglottis isn't necessary for keeping food out of the trachea. There have been people that are born without it and go through life fine, others have had to have it removed for various reasons without further complication post epiglottidectomy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your glottis is a hole. The sides of the hole are your vocal cords, they make noise by vibrating against each other, like a really fancy version of that grass blade whistle we all did at summer camp as kids. There are little muscles  in those vocal cords that make them do that. They have to close up when you swallow so you don’t get food and liquid in your lungs.</p>
<p>When you’re crying you get stressed out, and stress makes you want more oxygen (more air), so glottis wants to be open to let more air through. But you’re also making crying noises, which means your vocal cords want to rub together, and you’re also making snot which your body wants you to swallow, which means they want to close up so you can swallow all that snot. So the vocal cord muscles get confused and try to do everything at once, and that causes them to basically cramp like any other muscle.</p>
<p>better? :)</p></div>		</li>
