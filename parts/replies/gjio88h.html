<p>Is this saying that the variances in sign languages helps non-hearing people communicate more easily with their local hearing people, whereas a universal sign language might have unrelatable words?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's saying that hearing impaired people already share a language with the people near them with whom they are likely to communicate with, so the question is essentially identical to asking &quot;why doesn't everybody in the world just give up their native languages and speak one language?&quot; And the answer is the same, the cost is high, and the day to day benefit is not world changing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sign languages are not just signed versions of spoken languages. They are independent languages, with complicated origins and relationships with other signed languages.</p>
<p>In general, sign languages started when deaf people were gathered together, often in special schools aimed at getting them to communicate using speech and lip reading. Instead, they started to communicate with each other in signs. The system of signs rapidly developed the syntax and complexity of spoken languages, but as the students generally had little knowledge of the spoken or written languages of their countries, there was no reason for them to be related.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Interestingly, this doesn't hold true.  Sign languages often have quite different grammar and word order as compared to the spoken version of what is nominally the same language.  So there's not necessarily much of any benefit.</p></div>		</li>
