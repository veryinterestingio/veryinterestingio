<p>Technically it's not, it's mostly liquid and liquid metallic hydrogen. The pressure is too high deep down for it to be gas all the way through.</p>

<p>We don't know that, it's the current theory based on what we know and what our models and limited super high pressure experiments show, but we really don't know what the cores of the gas giants are. They could be diamonds, they could be balls of metallic gases under pressure, they could be iron cores like Earth. We really don't know</p></div>		</li>
