			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on a bit..  As a brief summary, I'd agree the studio system was often  stifling - but I do feel it's worth a note that plenty of great films came out in the 30s and 40s, even innovative ones.  I mean, 1939 is considered one of Hollywood's best years - Gone With the Wind, the Wizard of Oz, Stagecoach, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, etc.   Directors and producers just had to know how to work it.  I mean, Citizen Kane, possibly the most influential and innovative film of the sound era, came out in 1941.</p>
<p>It also wasn't JUST the studio system going for profit that stifled things - the Hayes code, made by the industry in response to controversial content in films and threats of government censorship, severely limited the content and expression of films for years.  The rise of sync sound also caused an abrupt lock down of the camera and film style for a few years, stymying some expression.  And of course, World War II and the shortages right before it had a massive effect on film production.  </p>
<p>Just some extra info for those curious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In film history, the 1950s through the early 1960s are actually considered to be a period of uncreative bloat. The combination of the Hays code, lost talent through blacklistings, and competition from television led to a lot of really safe, middle-of-the-road crap mixed with bloated epics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You callin' Elvis an uncreative bloat?! What about Bonzo? </p>
<p>But in all seriousness, even though there was a slough of crap, the 50s were fraught with just as many iconic flicks as the each decade before.  Bridge on the River Kwai, Rear Window, 12 Angry Men, Rebel Without a Cause, Ben Hur, Seven Samurai, The Day The Earth Stood Still, Ten Commandments, Dial M for Murder, Streetcar Named Desire...  These are just ones off the top of my head.  And really, I find it a lot harder to recall a dozen films from the 30s and 40s. </p>
<p>Oh, and don't forget about Harvey, the imaginary rabbit!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To tag onto this America loves the Western genre specifically for a few reasons. Rugged individualism, self reliance, no central authority, plenty of violence. Strong, silent, type male. </p>
<p>1902 novel &quot;The Virginian&quot; is a great example of the tropes used to glorify the West as &quot;wild&quot;, where we idealize a boring life with American cultural themes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a factor, but I think another important thing to consider why westerns were so popular in early Hollywood was western shows were popular before movies. Buffalo Bill's Wild West shows and others like them were traveling vaudeville performances that romanticized the frontier and western lifestyles. They reenacted Pony Express rides, Custer's last stand, and featured sharpshooters like Annie Oakley. They were used to celebrate the country's westward expansion and taming of the frontier. Like most vaudeville acts, these declined due to the popularity of cinema. You also had central figures of western stories, like Wyatt Earp, selling their stories to Hollywood. I don't know if it's been addressed or researched, but I'm sure nostalgia had an effect on the popularity of the genre too. Most westerns are associated with post Civil War 19th century, typically 1880-90s. Cinema started to boom in the early 20th century, around 1910. Similarly, we're in the 2010s and 80s and 90s nostalgia is a big thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only that, but western stories were widely serialized in periodicals. A huge percentage of the public read newspapers and magazines for decades leading up to the advent of movies. In fact, a lot of what we think of as old west or wild west culture, tropes, language, etc., was invented for those stories. Much was fiction out of whole cloth, or, single small localized ideas, scenarios, and behaviors made to seem widespread. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sci fi blew up but really wasn't seen as serious filmmaking until the 1960s during New Hollywood. Kubrick's <em>2001</em> was one of the first science fiction films to take the genre seriously. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, my point was just that after competition hit the Film Industry the heads at these places were green lighting a lot more Sci-fi, letting it bloom. So 10 years later no surprise it becomes a serious genre.</p></div>		</li>
