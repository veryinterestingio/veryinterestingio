<p>The term &quot;people of color&quot; was coined by POCs so avoid referring to themselves with reference to white people, e.g. &quot;non-whites.&quot;</p>

<p>This has never made a lot of sense to me. &quot;Person of color&quot; still draws the comparison with &quot;Person not of color,&quot; AKA white person. The reference to white people is still there, and is barely under the surface if at all.</p></div>		</li>
