<p>we have very awesome computers to control the power flow nowadays.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cordless drills often have different gearing for high speed / low torque and low speed / high torque. Is this simply due to a lack of a sophisticated power control computer because of size/space limits? (or maybe it's related to power draw limitations of the battery?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Offhand ... cordless drills lack both the &quot;advanced&quot; computer and the high voltage. Higher voltage drills perform better in my experience so that's probably just where that technology is at. I think most modern drills have batteries in the 12-20V range. </p>
<p>Stacking the batteries to make higher voltages is not exactly difficult... but it comes with certain risks of the battery failing (sometimes dramatically). In a car the manufacturer can afford to properly protect and care for a crazy battery ... a 408V nissan leaf battery is a chain of 96 (!!) 4.2V li-ion batteries. For smaller, lower cost batteries it would not be possible to supply an appropriate charger for 96 cells. :) So drills have battery packs with 3-4 li-ion batteries. Better battery tech and that gearing switch will be a thing of the past.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know I'm a little late, but here are some other points. Electric cars have the benefit that they don't need nearly as much drivetrain since the motors can be small enough and versatile enough to be located near the wheels. If you wanted a geared transmission, you would lose a lot of that benefit.
In a cordless drill, it is cheap and practical to have multiple gears. The motor is not as powerful, the drill will have usually already had a space allocated for a gearbox, and it doesn't require the complexities to allow for a gear change while running or under load like a car would.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electric motors may have 100% of torque available right off the bat, but they're only efficient in a fairly narrow RPM band, just like gas engines. Outside of that band, demanding that power generates a ton of heat, which increases resistance, which requires more power to overcome, etc. That means significantly reduced range, which is really the only downside to an electric car and the main reason a lot of people don't want to make the switch</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't want a pure electric car because if refilling. I want a plug in hybrid with like 60 miles range. So when shit hits the fan, like the Texas whiteout, I still have options for transportation and heat not limited to the grid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, so long as you have access to gasoline and the required infrastructure, sure. I guess it depends on how much of the shit hits said fan. Rooftop solar and full electric could arguably be more SHTF viable, depending on severity.</p>
<p>Anecdotally I heard stories of Texans using their electric cars as batteries for their homes during the blackouts which is an interesting application and advantage over ICE</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do agree that having a vehicle that can use either fuel or electricity is a good choice. </p>
<p>The thing to consider is that gas stations were not operating in the areas impacted by power outages. They require power to pump the fuel from the tank under the station into the hose that inserts into your vehicle. </p>
<p>You would still need to stock fuel in advance to avoid issues.</p></div>		</li>
