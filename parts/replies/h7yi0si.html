			<div class="markdown"><p>The receptors aren't particularly unique; the ones in your mouth and anus are just more sensitive than the receptors on your skin. Another sensitive area is the eyes, as anyone who's ever chopped chilies without being careful probably knows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is mainly why pepper spray is effective. It causes tissue around your eyes to become inflamed, and it becomes near impossible to open your eyes and see, in addition to the burning. Also, it causes a LOT of mucous that makes it hard to breathe, especially if you're doing anything physical with elevated respiration, which you'll most likely have anyway as your heart rate increases due to the pain and any panic you may have over not being able to see. Also also, it can totally send people into cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>I was pepper sprayed a couple times (As part of training, not crimes), and while the 22% solution did burn pretty good (the stuff you carry for protection is like 6%), the worst was just not being able to keep my eyes open for more than a fraction of a second, the discomfort around my eyes, and the snot. You don't use water to get it off unless you want to make it worse and spread it, so you basically just deal with it until it goes away. You just get ready for it to flare back up with your sweat or when you finally get in a shower (wear swim trunks). I walked in a circle for over an hour, trying to open my eyes and blowing snot rockets. I tried to smoke while it was still going pretty good, but the cigarette smoke irritated it a lot.</p>
<p>I wouldn't recommend being pepper sprayed or rubbing spicy food in your eyes.</p></div>		</li>
