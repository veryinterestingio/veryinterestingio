			<div class="markdown"><p>Phewww!! Thank you for making me not feel crazy!! I grew up in a very old, old building, and I distinctly remember there being an arch shaped hole behind the kitchen sink. I was scrolling through the comments and saw no one was mentioning they actually exist that way, so I was beginning to think it was a false memory!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense.  If you had to put a skirting board down over an existing pipe, you'd probably cut an arch.  If the pipe was subsequently removed?  There's the doorway.   Steam radiators were very common in the old days, yes? Maybe when they failed or became too expensive to maintain they were pulled out, leaving lots of these holes everywhere?</p></div>		</li>
