			<div class="markdown"><p>I was 17 when I learned that writing doesn't cause everyone immeasurable pain. Broke down crying in the hallway and shouted at my English teacher why I'm the only failure that can't handle the pain of writing a 4 paragraph essay while everyone else can handle it just fine.</p>
<p>Honestly thought that man up was a popular phrase <em>because</em> people are constantly in pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Woah... I knew I had minor astigmatism but never used my glasses in the dark, so I never made the connection between the rays and astigmatism. This suggests that the person who first drew a 5 point star or a star of David, or the sun with beams coming out, may have had astigmatism, then for some reason the shape was accepted even though only some people understood it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone has some sort of distortion. Part of it is that your cornea has seams that run across the pupil, and these spread the light out in random directions. This is why stars look 'star shaped'. The amount of distortion does change depending on the person.</p></div>		</li>
