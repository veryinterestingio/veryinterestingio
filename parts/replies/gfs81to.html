			<div class="markdown"><p>I‚Äôm going to have to disagree, partially. </p>
<p>I have a glass ring and a diamond ring and I can DEFINITELY tell the difference. The glass gem is pretty, but not nearly as stunning as the diamond. </p>
<p>With that being said, I also think other white gems can be nearly as pretty as diamonds (and much cheaper), like white emeralds.</p></div>		</li>
