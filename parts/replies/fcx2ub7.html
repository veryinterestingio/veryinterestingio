<p>You'd probably be correct in generalizing immune recognition of Gram negatives to the membrane; after all, that's what's exposed to the environment. Most innate immune surveillance and vaccine attempts recognize components of the membrane like LPS. </p>
<p>For Gram positives, though, their membranes are well shielded by a thick layer of peptidoglycan and sometimes a thick shell of capsule. Immune components as bulky as antibodies can't navigate the layers and make it down to the membrane; thus, antibodies are generally raised against the external parts, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumococcal_vaccine#Mechanism" target="_blank">pneumococcal vaccine</a>, which is a combination of capsule sugars. Very little immunological recognition/action happens on the actual membrane. The main exception is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_membrane_attack_complex" target="_blank">Membrane Attack Complex</a>, the final step of the complement pathway, which itself is usually driven by immune recognition of surface factors like capsule or peptidoglycan, either by antibodies or sugar-recognition proteins (MBL/ficolin) (the exception being the alternative pathway); however, that's only the final step, after complement binding to the aforementioned exterior features.</p></div>		</li>
