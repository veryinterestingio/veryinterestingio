			<div class="markdown"><p>To go along with this, it is also a bit over-generous to claim that we recall those other arbitrary memories of one-off events &quot;perfectly&quot;. Memory, in general, is very piece-meal and fuzzy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It takes practice to remember where you fill in gaps.  I find if I stick with only the images of an experience, that works.  I'm good at story telling so I fill in gaps easily.  Important memories, I tell just from the 4 or 5 images that I remember and recall them without gap filling. It's hard to not fill in the gaps with nonsense.</p>
<p>If I don't do that, I'll make up all kinds of crazy stuff from 30 years ago that never happened.  Just like the time that Santa Claus came to my house in 1988 and the Easter bunny came and we played Monopoly and my brother won but it was really hot even though it was the middle of winter and I was wearing pink hot pants.  Then the cat started talking and invited me onto his spaceship because it turned out he was a space cat.  We traveled in a loop around Venus and came back home by morning and I was really tired when I went to school.</p>
<p>The real story is that my brother woke me up in the middle of the night and demanded to play Monopoly and I fell asleep while playing with him in his room.  I like the Santa and alien cat story better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good way to see it:</p>
<p>Pull 5 random numbers from 1-1000.</p>
<p>You want to draw the lucky number 13, but you don’t.</p>
<p>Then you ask yourself ”Why was it so easy for me to draw the numbers 2, 145, 17, 866, and 412? Why can’t I ever draw that bloody 13 I want?”</p>
<p>Since you drew them they feel more significant than other random numbers, but they were endowed with this significance <em>after</em> you drew them. </p>
<p>When the significance of the number is applied after drawing it, so long as it’s not 13, the chances of drawing a significant number is 999/1000, whereas if you endow a significance to the number <em>before</em> you draw any, the chance to draw that significant number is 1/1000.</p>
<p>In this case, your ”random memories” are only significant because you remember them.</p>
<p>Since encoding memories is not just random this isn’t the whole answer, but it’s an important part of it.</p></div>		</li>
