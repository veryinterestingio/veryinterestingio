			<div class="markdown"><p>What... that's not how the python problem happened.  It happened from pet owners who were unprepared for how big the snakes were going to be so they would just release them into the wild as its cheaper than paying to have it euthanized and disposed of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Large &quot;rafts&quot; of floating vegetation are very common in the tropics, and often take animals along with them. Early Madagascar had mainly ancient Afrotheria animals like the modern tenrec. Lemurs, carnivores, and rodents came over on such rafts. Ditto monkeys and rodentss in   South America</p></div>		</li>

<p>What are you basing this on? The fact that it has been secluded for millions of years and thus the animals have not developed immunity to the diseases of the mainland, or because you've been playing Plague Inc.?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's from a game.  You design a disease and the goal is to infect the entire world.  Madagascar is <del>near impossible</del> very difficult to get because of how quickly they close their borders or something.  I've never played it, but know about it.</p></div>		</li>
