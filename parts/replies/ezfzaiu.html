<p>Wow, so sight to the ground is not really necessary in full flight and more like convenience?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's different rules for different classifications of pilots.</p>
<p>As a commercial pilot with a suitably equipped aircraft, I can fly solely on instruments alone with no visual capability outside the cockpit window. This is called Instrument Flight Rules or IFR.</p>
<p>Most private pilot pilots fly &quot;Visual Flight Rules&quot; (VFR) were they fly visually to what they see on the ground, aided by their instruments.</p>
<p>If you are not instrument rated with a suitably equipped aircraft, you cannot fly IFR, you must always fly VFR. You can only enter certain classes of airspace under IFR rules as that is a requirement. For example most commercial aircraft operate in something called &quot;Category A&quot; airspace, which requires the aircraft and pilot to be instrument rated.</p>
<p>Edit: Forgot to add &quot;VFR&quot; means sight of the ground at all times. If you are not instrument rated, you may not enter cloud and you may not fly above a cloud base.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least in the United States, the restriction for VFR without reference to the ground is for student pilots only. A private pilot can fly above a broken or overcast layer, called VFR over the top. It might not be a good idea though since getting down through it could be a problem.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Severe pressure changes</p>
<p>Updrafts and downdrafts that are scary powerful and cause shear</p>
<p>Lightning strikes (Actually a lesser danger but a danger)</p>
<p>Surface icing (More of a outlier risk but surface icing can occur when entering all forms of clouds, icing is a complex issue)</p>
