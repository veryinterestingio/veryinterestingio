			<div class="markdown"><p>It is more accurate to say they have a high temperature (the average kinetic energy of each molecule, which is how you measure temperature of a gas, is quite high), but not a high heat content (because, as you say there is low density - there are so few of those energetic molecules moving around).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding was precisely the opposite.  Heat is the energy per molecule while temperature is the cumulative effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In thermodynamics: Temperature is a measure of kinetic energy of a particle (or averaged for a volume of gas). Heat is the transfer of that energy to something else. You can have changes in temperature without &quot;heating&quot;. You can see this yourself if you spray an aerosol can. The pressure in the can drops rapidly when you push the nozzle, and this makes the gas inside suddenly condense and lose energy (temperature).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have those backwards. Heat is total energy, temperature is average.</p>
<p>Pouring more boiling water into a mug increases its total heat energy, but the temperature stays at 100°/212°.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Don’t the top layers technically have high heat, but produce a low temperature due to density?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other way around. </p>
<p>The top layers (upper half of the thermosphere and the exosphere) have a high temperature but do not heat things in accordance with our intuition of what that high temperature means. Temperature is a property of matter, heat is a type of energy transfer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's helpful in an <em>Explain Like I'm Five</em> situation to think of heat that we experience as a volume of temperature. </p>
<p>IE; How close could you hold your hand to something that's 3,000 to 5,000 degrees? Steel melts at about 2,800F, so this sounds like a very &quot;burn me to ashes&quot; situation, right? The Ferrocerrium &quot;flint&quot; of a BIC lighter <a href="https://c4.wallpaperflare.com/wallpaper/17/817/86/lighter-sparks-wallpaper-preview.jpg" target="_blank">shoots sparks off</a> that are 3,000 to 5,000 degrees, but there's very little volume of that temperature that's millimeters from your thumb.</p></div>		</li>
