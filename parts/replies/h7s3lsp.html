			<div class="markdown"><p>Water Activity is basically the whole answer here to OP's specific question.</p>
<p>Cookies and cakes are shelf stable because there is very low water activity. Most people don't think of sugar as a preservative, because sugar itself is something that many microbes like to consume. But if you increase the concentration high enough, the microbes will struggle to survive, much less reproduce/thrive in that hostile environment.</p>
<p>Much of food science is about how to make things like cookies or cake taste soft or moist without actually leaving enough water in it to be unsafe.</p>
<p>More broadly, there are other tricks for preservation. Salt and sugar can reduce water activity. Dehydration obviously reduces water activity. Acid and alcohol can hold off microbes as well, which is why a lot of condiments are OK on the shelf even after opening.</p>
<p>Then there's packaging. Canning and similar processes kill microbes in the container, so the container itself is safe until opened (which is why so many foods say &quot;refrigerate after opening&quot;). But once the seal is broken, microbes can grow, so the food itself needs to be refrigerated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shortening is just a replacement fat for butter or oil (canola, veg, etc).  It does make things softer because it's pure fat.</p>
<p>Canola oil has nearly no water if any as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water with stuff in it wants the stuff to be evenly distributed. But if you put a membrane separating pure water from water with stuff, where water can freely flow but the stuff is all stuck on one side, the water tends to flow through the membrane towards the stuff. In other words, the side with the purer water flows away, towards the less pure water. This force is called osmotic pressure.</p>
<p>Microbes are made out of membranes that let water through, but not sugars. So when you put a microbe in sugary water, the osmotic pressure basically pulls all the water out of the microbes and dries them out, even as they're surrounded by water. (Note this is the same reason why drinking sea water will kill humans.)</p>
<p>Some organisms have mechanisms for overcoming that pressure, but most single celled organisms struggle when the difference is too high.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sugar likes water. You know how when you add sugar to fresh fruit, like sliced apples for a pie filling, the fruit softens and becomes surrounded by a thick syrup? The sugar pulls the water right out of the fruit cells. Same deal with microbes: if there's a lot of sugar and not much water on the outside, then all that moisture inside wants to get out. All that moisture loss makes it harder for life stuff to happen.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Another factor is salt.</p>
<p>Salted butter can be left on the countertop to be soft at room temperature. Many homes keep a stick of salted butter on a plate or butter dish so it is soft and spreadable. Salted butter won't quickly spoil or turn rancid, staying good for two weeks or longer in good conditions.</p>
<p>Unsalted butter must be refrigerated. After a few hours it starts spoiling.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When I buy stick butter I buy unsalted. I once left out a stick cause I decided I wanted some soft butter. It lasted a few days and then molded, but I was left wondering why. Duh! Thank you for this insight into my past mistake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if you are counting basic salt and seasonings as preservatives, then sure. Not saying that fast food won't have additional preservatives, but its not a required factor. If you make a burger at home with the same fat and water content in the meat as a McDonalds burger, but using nice fresh meat and homemade bread, you will achieve the same no rot effect.   </p>
<p>It dries out (and contains a decent enough amount of salt) and doesn't have much risk of rot</p></div>		</li>
