			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question! Reforestation or afforestation is indeed not good enough to restore the ecosystem that was destroyed. To my knowledge and experience walking through primary and secondary forests, only time can allow for an ecosystem to regrow to approximately what it first was. It can take decades or even hundreds of years to restore degraded land to something resembling an old growth or primary forest. Nevertheless, secondary forests are good habitats for plenty of biodiversity, so reforestation is still a good practice when done well. A holistic and detailed approach involving soil health, water quality, and native biodiversity can help restore the ecosystem more quickly. Creating artificial versions of ecosystems is not, in my opinion, a sustainable practice; it only makes sense to provide habitat to displaced animals in times of crisis (such as fires) to keep those animals alive. Of course, the best practice is to keep existing forests intact. - Rosie</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As trees mature in restored areas, these restored forests can reach previous levels of tree diversity, tree height, and canopy cover as existing, undisturbed (so-called <strong>old-growth</strong>) rainforests. In doing so, access to ecosystem services can be restored <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-63236-0_2" target="_blank">1</a>, such as providing habitat space and food sources for native animals.</p>
<p>Forest regeneration projects can use <strong>active</strong> or <strong>passive</strong> restoration methods <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2860" target="_blank">2</a>.  </p>
<p>Active restoration projects are labor intensive approaches that promote the growth of native tree species through tree plantings, soil rehabilitation, and land management <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2860" target="_blank">2</a>. Alternatively, passive restoration involves less labor as it relies largely on the ecosystem’s ability to recover when left undisturbed. Such projects include habitat protections, hunting restrictions, and educational workshops for local communities.</p>
<p>Both forms of reforestation take time, to implement and to reach previous forest health. This is why we tend to stress protection of standing forests as the greatest way to preserve biodiversity, ecosystem services, and climate mitigating ability of tropical forests. Protecting standing forests prevents deforestation and maintains the old growth forests rather than focusing on more time and resource intensive methods of reforestation.</p>
<p>Both strategies are crucial. But preventing deforestation can be much more efficient and cost effective, and prevents the loss of biodiversity, habitats, indigenous land, and livelihoods in the first place. - RP team</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, afforestation attempts are sometimes carried in ecosystems like shrublands or natural pastures, damaging them in the process.  </p>
<p>For restoring a damaged ecosystem, we must understand the ecological processes that naturally occur, to either allow them to happen, or to foster their occurrence. For example, in rainforests, bats are among the key promoters of ecosystem regeneration. As they poop while they flu over cleared areas, they sow different plant species, and certain species that can succeed in that open environment may start the process. If we kill bats, then this processes wont occur. Like Roshan mentioned, we must find holistic and integral approaches when assessing the actions to take, there is no simple answer. - Fanny</p></div>		</li>
