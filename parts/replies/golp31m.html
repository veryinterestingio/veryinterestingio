			<div class="markdown"><p>how are the car motors cooled? some kind of sealed system as well?</p>
<p>or do they use water-cooling?</p>
<p>now i want a tesla with an rgb motor...</p>
<p>edit: not sure why i thought water cooling wasn't a sealed system. thanks for the replies!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Power tool motors are also usually non-brushless. Brushes generate a lot of noise. Also they are manufactured with less precision, so there is a lot more that can rattle around at high speed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>On the contrary, pound for pound, the universal motors that are chosen for power tools are chosen specifically because they give astronomical torque.</p>
<p>But they have brushes scraping the surface and an electric arc that is jumping between the spinning part and the stationary part. To have adequate cooling it's all exposed, so it's not very aerodynamic either.</p>
<p>Motors used in vehicles are either induction motors or brushess DC motors, either way no brushes. Nothing scraping constantly. No arc jumping between stationary and rotating part. On could ask &quot;How loud is a magnet&quot;? Versus &quot;how loud is a file?&quot; And the rotating part tends to be very smooth and sleek.</p>
<p>That said... MOST of the noise is in the gears, yeah.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Pound for pound they may give high torque output, but we're still talking about physically small motors. A high torque to weight ratio with low weight still works out to low torque output. Just maybe not as low as other types of motors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd also point out the packaging part of this. There's an enormous amount of noise dampening surrounding the passenger cabin of all types of cars, and it just wouldn't be possible to do that with a power tool between size and cooling constraints. There's also something to be said about the tolerances you need to hold in a drive train to make it stand up to several hundred kW launches that just wouldn't be economical on a power tool, and the effects of those tolerances on noise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the EV motorcycle world there are 4 different approaches. The cheap/budget people use hub motors, meaning the motor is inside the rear wheel. They are damn near silent but not very powerful and also dangerous at higher speeds because of unsprung weight.</p>
<p>That leaves us with mid drive motors. The oldest player in the game, Zero, makes a direct drive PMAC motor with a belt drive. It's quiet, but not silent.</p>
<p>Harley-Davidson's LiveWire uses helical gears so it has a mid-level hum/whine.</p>
<p>Energica, the performance/racing group, went with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryJQ58yL69I" target="_blank">straight cut gears which, as you'd expect, are louder.</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Here's a universal motor (well, series-wound DC), as I test it out on my 1985 Honda Nightwing built-from-junk conversion:</p>

<p>Big motor noises = Vroom vroom.</p>
<p>The driveshaft fan is also a huge part of the noise. Which, the one on my bike and other vehicles, don't have.</p></div>		</li>
