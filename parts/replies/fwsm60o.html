			<div class="markdown"><p>And that's exactly what happens now with online streaming.  The ads you see on Youtube (or wherever) are targeted based on the user profile they've been able to build up about you.  And by &quot;you&quot; I really mean &quot;your device,&quot; because they track the device by an internal &quot;advertiser ID&quot; with the assumption that only one person uses a given device the majority of the time.  Logic works well enough for phones and computers, gets a little iffy for something like a TV.</p>
<p>I don't know if *broadcast television* has that capability via set-top boxes, but I suppose it's possible.</p>
<p>And yeah, it's pretty complex.  I worked in ad tech for almost a decade and I still don't fully understand all the moving pieces involved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>YouTube is largely based on deterministic signals as they are part of Google's giant device graph, but CTV/ATV and broadcast for the most part are HH level measurement for passive measurement (LPM are person level). </p>
<p>Addressable TV is a thing, just not that efficient so it never caught on steam. The cable network inventory is now largely sold by the NCC/Ampersands of the world in PMP deals, but I think there is some inventory for open web.</p></div>		</li>
