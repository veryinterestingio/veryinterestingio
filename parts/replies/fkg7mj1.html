<p>EDIT: Great Fire did not stop great plague. 1666 was still a year of greats: plague, fire and Newton’s pinnacle of discovery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not strictly true - the plague died down before the Great Fire. I know this because I read Samuel Pepys’s diary online every day - you can even get it via Twitter.
He tracks the death toll every day, and it’s pretty much eliminated and then a couple of months later you get the fire. It’s great when you read it in real time because he’s also recording all the rumours about how and why the fire started - lots of people thought it was the French, and some French guy even confessed to starting it. It’s interesting to compare it to rumours and counter-rumours these days - it was really just as bad back then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a good recent NOVA episode about this. The tl;dr from that episode was that early steppe tribes (who may have been the first to domesticate horses, interestingly they were Przewalski horses) had documented cases of bubonic plague which tracked across the continent with their spread. Still a theory though.</p></div>		</li>
