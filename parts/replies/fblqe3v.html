			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, koko's signing abilitiy is still debated in the scientific community. I belive I read that only the woman who taught koko could understand kokos signing and no one was able to sign to Koko outside her trainer which fails the scientific standard of repeatability. I'm sorry I don't have sources but your source is obviously biased. Koko.org</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was my understanding that Kokoâ€™s researcher never published official results leading to the claims of successful use of sign language being disputed. Could someone else weigh in on this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is really interesting reading! I wonder if it makes them able to communicate more sophistic and precise with each other, and what would happen if a larger group was able to express themselves through sign language. And furthermore if it has any cognitive benefits or the if it only affects their ability to communicate with humans.</p></div>		</li>
