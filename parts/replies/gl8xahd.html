<blockquote>
<p>When it rains, some orangutans make umbrellas out of branches and leaves to cover their heads. It’s quite unlikely that this behavior is genetic. Orangutans likely aren’t born with the knowledge and capability to build umbrellas in their DNA. Rather, they learn to make umbrellas from watching their mothers during their childhood or from watching neighboring orangutans. This means that thousands, maybe millions of years ago, there was one particularly smart orangutan (or at least an ape predecessor to orangutans) who “invented” umbrellas. Other individuals began copying this behavior, and soon the use of umbrellas became prevalent throughout the entire species. Today, every population of orangutans make umbrellas. However, because orangutan populations are not all contiguous with each other, there may be subtle differences in umbrella-making from population to population. These regional differences are cultural differences, because the “meme” of umbrella-making may have undergone subtle changes among differing populations.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's fascinating! Orangutans have so much going on in their heads we don't realise!</p>
<p>Just an aside from reading that excerpt - I studied archaeology and one of the things talked about was the origin of certain things in cultures, like technology or artistic styles. One of the main points the authors reach is that there isn't always a single origin to these things, things like art styles (or umbrellas) could and probably did get invented multiple times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. At least some do. There’s a famous social experiment done on some kind of ape where a “culture” of not grabbing food from the top platform (because you would get hosed) propagated through the group, until the group was only composed of apes that had never actually seen the “punishment” happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, though some species more than others. Complex bird songs that change year-to-year and are transmitted socially are a classic example. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/l7vqg7/til_in_the_1930s_a_flute_player_had_a_pet/" target="_blank">See this story from today's front page for instance.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/science/review-beyond-words-carl-safina.html" target="_blank">Beyond Words: How Animals Think and Feel</a> is a well-sourced book that gets into this topic, by ecologist Carl Safina.</p>
<p>Edit: Animal cultures have been observed and studied in-depth in monkeys, apes, both toothed and baleen whales, elephants, many types of birds, wolves, and I'm sure others I'm unaware of. It's also important to remember that humans are animals too and until very recently we all had quite similar evolutionary pressures; as you can see cultural transmission is not unique to our species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because animals also have learned/instilled behaviors. And there is no reason a learned behavior couldn't impact cross-species interactions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The ability to learn has been seen in fish, mammals, birds, insects etc.  This diversity indicates that learning is very, very old.  The fact that different species can learn from each other also indicates a generalized learning ability.</p>
<p>Learning provides a tremendous evolutionary advantage in allowing flexible behavior plus it eases the genomic burden of a species with this ability.</p></div>		</li>
