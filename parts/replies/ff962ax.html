			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Yes dark matter doesn't interact electromagnetically, however direct collisions with the nucleus of an atom can occur.&quot;</p>
<p>What does this mean? </p>
<p>What is a collision without a way to interact.  My understanding is that they assumed that the dark matter would interact via the weak force.  If the particles do not interact via the weak interaction a collision doesn't make sense to me.  There isn't anything to collide with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My work was exclusively with weakly interacting massive particles, or WIMPs, these can interact via the weak force. There are many different candidate particles and if the true particle doesn't interact via the weak force then collisions would not be possible and capture would not be possible via that mechanism.</p>
<p>My mistake for not adding the stipulation that it depends on the particle interacting via the weak force, when I said &quot;depending on the particle&quot; this was my useless way of saying as much.</p>
<p>Edit: Frankly, the whole nightmare of having to guess candidate particles is why I decided not to pursue DM research. While a lot of the theory is enjoyable, I'm not expecting to see any true detections any time soon.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The Strong and Weak forces both exist at the scale of atomic nuclei, and at that scale the Electromagnetic is irrelevant.</p>
<p>WIMP stands for Weakly Interactive Massive Particle. The &quot;Weakly&quot; part of that refers to the weak nuclear force. So...yes? If Dark Matter is WIMPs then the particles can rarely collide with atoms (and also black holes) resulting in energy transfer.</p>
<p>But otherwise, the particle just sails on through, briefly participating in very low-mass gravity interactions with everything, producing a subtle but huge larger collective gravity field that makes galaxies spin like flung discs instead of large gravity wells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>mmm not quite. i’m not sure what comparison you’re making. also, scattering off of electrons is explored just like this nuclear scattering. it’s just more suited to lighter dark matter candidates than WIMPs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might! </p>
<p>It really depends on what dark matter actually is. My favourite types are things like neutralinoes which are their own anti-particles. This leads to cool concepts like <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_star_(dark_matter\)" target="_blank">dark stars</a> unimaginably huge stars powered by the self annihilation of dark matter at the core.</p></div>		</li>
