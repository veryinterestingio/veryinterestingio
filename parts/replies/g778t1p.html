			<div class="markdown"><p>Very cool, ive been meaning to get a sleep study done since my whole shit is entirely fucked up. Would you recommend the at home tests at all or are the studies done overnight at a clinic more worth it? I prefer to avoid being anywhere near healthcare facilities during COVID right now but if a home test isn't sufficient id rather do it right the first time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have worked in sleep labs utilizing both types and have experienced both types. I can't sleep in a new environment and slept for a total of 110 minutes in the lab, not a good look.</p></div>		</li>

<p>However, although these models are a convenient and economical means for consumers to obtain gross estimates of sleep parameters and time spent in sleep stages, they are of limited specificity and are not a substitute for PSG</p>
<p>Tldr; not bad</p></div>		</li>
