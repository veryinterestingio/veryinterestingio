			<div class="markdown"><p>Also sugar.  Though getting sugar is harder than salt.  The First Nations in North America used maple syrup/sugar as a preservative.  Honey is also used in other places.  But none of those are as common as salt.</p>

<p>You ever read a 700 page book about the history of salt so you can write a ten page essay about salt for a final of your girlfriend’s history class that’s worth 50% of her grade and then you get an A on it so she ends up becoming your wife and then anytime salt is mentioned in a conversation you can dominate it?! </p>
<p>I have, and I would recommend the experience.</p></div>		</li>
