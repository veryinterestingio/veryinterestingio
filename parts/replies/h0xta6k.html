			<div class="markdown"><p>So many people saying &quot;I got this side effect because...&quot;, dude it is just your body reacting in its own way to a vaccine, everyone there is no evidence linking someone's side effects to a vaccine and its effectiveness.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>well at least, when you get some body reactions after any vaccine it shows that the body is at least adopting it, and starts to react to and reproduce it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily, and I’d like to look more into it. </p>
<p>You could just as easily come to the conclusion that getting symptoms points to the body overreacting and engaging immune response before it’s had enough contact with the active components of the vaccine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your individual side effects are not a good indicator if the vaccine is &quot;effective&quot;.</p>
<p>Someone who gets no side effects could get better protection than someone who gets moderate side effects. </p>
<p>Vaccines are absolutely undisputably effective (on a population scale), regardless of the side effects you may or may not get.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting, thank you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vasodilators and the chemokine gradient promote cell recruitment from blood, but also lead to the development of redness and swelling (Fig. 1). Blood-borne neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes adhere to the vessel walls and accumulate at the site of injury via extravasation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the extent to which things like cytokines, vasodilators and interleukins are produced during innate response (and therefore cause the redness + pain) do not necessarily correlate with the adaptive response which happens in the lymphoid tissue, right? So even if the hyperaemia and inflammation leads to more lymphocytes getting the antigen, this doesn't matter long term as enough of them will get to the lymph nodes anyway... ? :)</p>
<p>Follow up question: What determines how well the adaptive response happens in your average population sample? (i.e. not from things like immunosenesence)</p></div>		</li>
