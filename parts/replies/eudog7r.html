Their eyesight is quite good, but they move so quickly their brains canâ€™t process the visual information fast enough to keep going. This causes the beetles to run fast... stop and wait for visual processing to catch up... run fast and repeat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is a bit of an exception. Generally smaller animals tend to receive and process information from their visual cortex at a higher rate than larger animals. Dragonflies, for example, process more visual input, more quickly than humans do. </p>
<p>Tiger beetles might just be the outsider in this process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you were to view a video recording what what your eyes is seeing, you would realize how much of vision is inference.  You actually only have clear focus in a very small range directly wherever your eyes are pointing.  Your field of view is extremely small, and everything off the sides is not in color and blurred.  Not only that, but your eyes are moving pretty erratically and quick.  </p>
<p>It would be like watching a video where only the center of the screen is actually in focus, and the view would suddenly snap at random to look at different things.   It would be extremely disorienting.</p>
<p>As it turns out though, your brain is very good at stitching everything you see into a pretty coherent model of the world.  It keeps track of wherever everything is so, even when not looking directly at something, you still feel like you can &quot;see&quot; it.  You can snap your eyes over to exactly where the object is at any time and recapture the details if the brain needs it.  You probably won't even notice that your view changed unless you are thinking about what your eyes are doing.  The jittery, narrow focused, mostly colorless image your eyes are feeding your brain get stitched into the nice and complete view that you have.</p>
<p>Presumably, a butterfly is doing the same.  In the same way that you don't go blind when you jog and the world remains basically stable, I'm guessing a butterfly feels the same about its vision while flying.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Minor nitpick, but you see in colour off to the sides, just with poorer resolution (even poorer than the already poor resolution provided by rod cells): <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Human_photoreceptor_distribution.svg" target="_blank">this graph</a> shows the quantity of colour sensitive cells never drops to zero over the entire retina.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to the fovea, where there no <em>rod</em> cells, which is why you have to look slightly to the side to see as well as possible in the dark.</p></div>		</li>
