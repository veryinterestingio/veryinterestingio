<p>Is that as impressive as it seems to a layman? They can travel 17 meters for every meter of altitude? That's pretty amazing for something the size of a commercial plane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. At an altitude of ~6 miles, it can glide over 100 miles. I looked this up one day after some flight anxiety. Made me feel <em>miles</em> better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And just to clarify for those in the back of the room:</p>
<p>Use of the word &quot;glide&quot; negates the use of the word &quot;fall&quot;, however. If you're gliding and you have the airplane under control, you're not falling. There's a reason gliders are called such and not called &quot;fallers&quot;. As long as there is enough airspeed over the wing to create lift, you're not falling. Now, in the instance of an engine failure, a pilot would pitch the nose up to attain the airspeed that will allow for the longest amount of glide time and distance which is exactly what you want when looking for a suitable off airport landing site. It's all about conservation of energy. Naturally once the engine quits, thrust is no longer balancing or counteracting the rearward force of drag and creating the upward force of lift, therefore the downward force of weight and gravity begin to become stronger forces than lift, so the airplane begins to descend. As long as the pilot maintains the best glide speed for the airplane, and picks a suitable field for landing, chances of survival are usually pretty good.l and chances of being able to use the airplane after are also pretty good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My use of &quot;falling&quot; may have been hyperbolic, but I did make sure to add the clarifying bit at the end. Point being that being in the sky is much more problematic than being on the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the definition of “glide” can get nebulous when you start approaching the limits of glide ratios. The Space Shuttle had a glide ratio of ~3:1 and a decent rate of 10,000 feet per minute; while it was in control I think we’ll all agree that an 80 ton vehicle with that kind of decent rate is closer to a controlled fall. </p>
<p>(Fun fact: to train for flying the space shuttle, astronauts would practice in a modified Gulfstream jet that would fly with the gear down and the thrust reversers on)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Typically the speed for best range and the speed for best endurance are actually different, and the crew would pick based on their emergency. If they’re in an Airbus and trying to reach the Azores, they’d pick the speed for best range; hypothetically, if they were more concerned with staying aloft for as much time as possible, they’d slow down a bit to minimize sink rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! I fly light aircraft (DA40), and we have the <em>procedures</em> (which are done from memory, and then the <em>checklists</em>, which is checking that everything was done properly. </p>
<p>So for starting the engine, we prime the engine by turning on the pump, opening the throttle and setting the mixture to rich. Both get closed, open the throttle a little, and crank that starter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly this + ensuring continued familiarity with the system. </p>
<p>Theoretically pilots all learn and pass tests, but nothing beats practice and familiarity. When the stakes are this high, being calm and knowing in your bones where every button is can absolutely change the outcome of incidents.</p></div>		</li>
