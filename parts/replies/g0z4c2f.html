			<div class="markdown"><p>Penguins seem to do a lot of excreting. If they aren't regurgitating food or shitting all over their pals they are leaking salt from their nasal passage. Lucky they are so handsome or I'd be inclined to call them disgusting. Who am I to judge though, I do my fair share of excreting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To paraphrase Dr Karl (Australian living legend):  Our kidneys almost don't seem to know we aren't fish anymore -- they work really hard to extract almost all the salt from our blood, and then put nearly all of it straight back in!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not disputing Dr Karl (I wouldn't dare), but isn't it because when the kidneys are trying to flush all the toxic crap out of our blood, it's more efficient to filter it all out including the salt, and then selectively allowing the salt back in? If the kidneys tried to remove just the crap, and leave the salt in the bloodstream, the system just wouldn't work.</p>
<p>As you can tell from my crude vocabulary, I'm struggling to remember my Human Anatomy and Biology class details from uni.</p>
<p>Also, kidneys are amazing in what they do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>wait until you find out how ridiculously overpowered the kidneys of a common housecat are. They can, if necessary, get all the water they need from the meat of the animals they kill, but their kidneys are so bonkers that a housecat can drink seawater. They filter salt so well that they can effectively hydrate drinking from the ocean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is of course the correct answer.  I just want to point out that there are tons of marine animals (including our ancestors if you go back far enough) that have renal systems that filter OUT salt instead of work to keep it like our's does.  The reality is their system is the original, and terrestrial kidneys are backwards.  </p>
<p>And then you have the animals that can swap (like salmon).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if they're marine mammals then their system isn't the original because mammalian systems are terrestrial by default, and if you trace back to their last ancestor that was marine then said ancestor could've had a different system for salt filtration.

<p>When I said if you track our ancestry back enough you'll find animals that have a reversed renal system, did you think I was referring to marine mammals?  You know we evolved from actual fish, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It baffled me the first time I heard you get a lot of water from metabolism. Long distance runners drink a lot less water than you might imagine, because most they need they get from metabolising food while running. A lot of (amateur) long distance runners actually drink too much, resulting in hyponatremia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those with much water in them.</p>
<p>Also, carbohydrates. The hydrates part of carbohydrates is water, well, kinda obvious, isn't it? Carbohydrates are formed when carbon and water is combined and 'create' oxygen. When you metabolise them, you recombine them with oxygen to form water (and carbon dioxide) again.*</p>
<p>Also, I think this is such a small part of our daily water needs that it's negligible. It would surprise me if your diet changes your water needs for more than 5%, maybe 10%.</p>
<p>*This is a huge oversimplification, don't use this answer on your biology test.</p>
<p>Edit: whoops, apparently I'm wrong. Read the comment by /u/usertlj.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I run ultramarathons and I think us needing less water than you think is more of a function of how ridiculously water is pushed on every other athlete.  </p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong I take a water bottle with mr everywhere.  But I’m constantly shocked at how often “Drink more water” is seen as a cure all for every bit of discomfort.  People are practically torturing children in sports by making them drink till they slosh.  Good lord, they’ll drink when they are thirsty! </p>
<p>I just think the rubber really hits the road here when you wanna run for 24 hours - you can’t just be making up lies about the miracle of drinking water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably because it actually does help with a lot of discomfort, sports related or otherwise. Speaking from a medical and sports background, it’s shocking how dehydrated people tend to be, and it’s really easy to get dehydrated quickly. Not saying you’re wrong about ultramarathoners, but drinking more water is generally pushed because you don’t notice you’re thirsty until you’re actually dehydrated already. Drinking a lot up front prevents you from reaching that point, and being overhydrated is less dangerous than underhydrated.</p></div>		</li>
