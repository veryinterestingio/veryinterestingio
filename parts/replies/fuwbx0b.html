			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s no data, but I speculate that you can if you’re immune from a vaccine - maybe not from a recent infection.  Flu vaccines are not usually sterilizing, meaning there’s often some virus replication in spite of the vaccine, meaning there’s room for the innate immune response to become activated. Infections tend to give stronger immunity (a trade off for the vastly increased risk), so there might not be enough breakthrough infection to trigger innate immunity. </p>
<p>Again, I don’t think there’s any data supporting this directly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you expand a bit more on what non specific immunity means? It makes sense that there is such a response based on observation alone. I'd be interested to learn more about what this means.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To give a really basic explanation, non-specific immunity is the primary defense your body has to any pathogen, it is not specific to the exact pathogen. Non-specific immune responses are important for initially keeping viral titer low and driving inflammation which then allows specific immunity to begin working. Non-specific immunity recognizes broader pathogen-associated molecular patterns that occur in a wide array of intruders (e.g. parts of bacterial membranes) and targets it for degradation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks that was a clear enough dumbing down for me to get it.
So as a follow up question, do we have ways to trigger this process in the body before specific immunity kicks in?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. There’s a Northern hemisphere vaccine and a Southern Hemisphere vaccine, mainly because the hemispheres have their flu seasons offset by 6 months. Different countries often use different viruses for their vaccine, but they’re antigenically the same. Read the WHO recommendations.</p></div>		</li>
