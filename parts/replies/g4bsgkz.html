			<div class="markdown"><p>How odd, I have exercise-induced asthma and I've never experienced this! I just get really, really winded and then &quot;oh wait! it's asthma, I need my puffer.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was wondering based on the comments above if anyone else had this happen to them consistently even when they exercised on a regular basis... I have asthma. I ran track in high school. This happened to me at every practice, especially if it was cold outside. I didn’t realize this didn’t happen to everyone until recently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was wondering the same thing. I’ve never been diagnosed with asthma but I’ve suspected I have exercise induced asthma for a while. I get a very strong blood taste in my mouth and some inner ear pain after even light runs and the symptoms are worse when it’s cold out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I guess the question is, does this mean that exercise is harming us? Because even when I ran every day, this still happened to me...</p></div>		</li>
