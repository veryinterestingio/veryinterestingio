			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont use baby wipes but I notice a lot of them say they're flushable. Is this just a lie?</p>
<p>Edit: like one of those things where they cant be sued since you can actually flush them regardless of the outcome to your sewage system?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Well, rather they do break apart more than &quot;non-flushable&quot; ones, but they don't break apart enough to avoid causing a clog.  </p>
<p>So, they're non-flushable, but not as non-flushable as the non-flushable ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically a lie.  Or, a <em>very</em> misleading truth.  Can you flush one?  Yes.  Will it clog up your plumbing?  Also, yes.</p>
<p>In fact, in some places in the world, plain old toilet paper is too much for the plumbing to handle.  Only in the first world are we so spoiled  that we tempt fate by trying to flush <strong>fabric</strong> down the drain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jesus - my 4 year old grand daughter went through a phase of sticky green stiff epoxy shits. She had a blowout in her pants one day, and it was like getting tar off a wall. At some point I realized I'd flushed like 20 baby wipes... into our 85-year old plumbing. Woke up to a stink that night, tub was full of sewage. </p>
<p>My summer project is to replace all that fat, sagging cast iron with PVC (going to remodel a bathroom next to the main stack, there's another bath over it where I can take out a closet wall, so I'll be able to get to everything, bathroom floor joists are shot so we'll be open down to the crawl space). Gonna be one shitty job!</p></div>		</li>
