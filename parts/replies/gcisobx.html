			<div class="markdown"><p>The NBC article gives a slightly different conclusion than Consumer Reports:</p>
<p>CR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After we let intact wipes sit in water overnight, we saw differences. The Charmin and the Equate stayed in one piece, but the Cottonelle and the Scott disintegrated easily.</p>
<p>Bottom line. Treating soiled wipes like disposable diapers and tossing them in a lined wastebasket will definitely keep your drain and sewer pipes clear. But if you’re going to flush them, choose Cottonelle or Scott, which are less likely to cause plumbing problems.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't that say the same thing? CR says cottonelle and scotts broke down over night, NBC says cottonelle and scotts broke down over night. CR just added that cottonelle and scotts were not able to break down rapidly compared to standard toilet paper, even with agitation. I suppose this means cottenelle and scotts wipes are fine as long as you don't flood your pipes with them so they have time to break down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember seeing this same experiment on Adam ruins everything lol. But also if you think about it, how is something that’s already constantly wet going to break down in water? It wouldn’t be able to hold its consistency if being wet turned it into mush</p></div>		</li>
