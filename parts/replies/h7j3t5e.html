			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. But I also have to remember all I used to use it for was texting and the occasional phonecall to a family member.</p>
<p>Nowadays I use it all the time. Reddit, Facebook, google docs, texts, phonecalls, Spotify. They truly are portable computers nowadays. I know blackberries were a thing 20 years ago. But they are nothing compared to what your average smartphone can do nowadays.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This, people say that phones used to last much longer but they were barely used for anything, the most demanding thing you did on them was texting/calling, if you leave your phone alone it'll probably last at least a few days</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, and if you made a long call the battery would be almost all gone. Usually &quot;standby&quot; battery life was something like 6-8 days, but call time was maybe 2 hours tops. Most people now use their smartphones all the damn time, and the screen is what chews up the battery, as well as all those apps running in the background. Sometimes I'm at home on my computer all day and don't use my phone at all, and from 7am-10pm my phone has gone from 100% charge to maybe 85%. I could get 4 days out of it at that rate, and it's still doing a whole lot more than the old Nokias.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is phones 20 years ago were only for calling and texting, and maybe playing some snake or something. Of course they didn't use much battery. Nowadays as long as my phone lasts the whole day I'm happy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They were also smaller and lighter, with user replacable batteries.<br />
It's just that we were taken aback by the &quot;not run out of battery&quot; statment as it seems that phones <strong>DO</strong> run out of battery very quickly these days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When the various assistant services first launched some of the older phones didn't have the dedicated ultra low power chip necessary to listen out for keywords. So the main chip just ran all of the time, and yeah, it really ate into battery life.</p>
<p>Plus of course phones these days tend to have bigger batteries to deal with larger, brighter, higher resolution displays, so they're much more tolerable of constant power draw. </p>
<p>Between the two things it's much less noticeable of a problem than it used to be.</p></div>		</li>
