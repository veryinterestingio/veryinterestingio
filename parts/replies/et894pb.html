			<div class="markdown"><p>Do these things exclusively live in open water? I have been given to understand there is a bottom and the bottom has rocks and stuff. Although I suppose the seafloor is a vastly different biome. It is becoming more obvious great whites hang out nearer the surface than the bottom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The key thing about the bottom, and I don't mean to be snarky here, is that it's down rather than to the side.  Great whites swim mostly horizontally, and pretty much go over most of that stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A great white in most areas of the ocean wont have any want to go to the bottom because the pressure they would feel even a small fraction of the way (in most areas theyd be in naturally) would keep them off the bottom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can't even look down, because they hunt exclusively upward.  My understanding is that the safest place to be is below the shark, because they can't really get to you down there.</p></div>		</li>
