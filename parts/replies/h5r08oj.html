<p>Using purely imagined (or &quot;covert&quot;) speech (that is, attempts to speak that involve no facial movement or vocalization) is definitely a goal of speech neuroprosthetic work, because not all patients who may benefit from a speech neuroprosthesis are able to make any facial or vocal tract movements (Pancho can make some facial movements, but he cannot produce intelligible speech). We still don’t have a good understanding of covert speech. Most of our understanding comes from mapping the speech motor movements to neural activity, so we focused on this approach for our first study.</p>
<p>Your question about muscle engagement is very interesting because, although this is the strategy we used here (Pancho does try to say the target words), it's not clear whether the neural signals arise purely from being able to actually engage some muscles, or because Pancho is attempting to engage those muscles. For example, someone with ALS who is locked-in (for example, not able to move their face or vocal tract muscles at all) may also try to engage their facial muscles. Even though those muscles do not end up being actually engaged, the underlying neural activity that we acquire and use to decode speech could still contain enough information to yield similar levels of accuracy. We are certainly interested in working with participants who have conditions like these to find out! -JRL</p></div>		</li>
