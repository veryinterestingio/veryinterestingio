<p>Have you ever squeezed one under the nose? I even tear up!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The local tissue has its own process of wound healing. And there is a constant exchange of cells and liquids between the blood vessels and the body tissues. When you apply the ice, you slow down that boost from the inflammatory process, but the wound can still heal.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Applying ice helps the pain, because the cold temperature will decrease the blood flow and reduce the process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To add to this, you should apply heat <em>prior</em> to popping it, then ice <em>after</em>. </p>
<p>Warming and loosening it up makes the popping much less painful - the skin relaxes and stretches a bit better so its not like shoving a golf ball through a straw. Then the ice afterwards tightens it back up!</p></div>		</li>
