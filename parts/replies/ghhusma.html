<p>the top layer, will heat up to 1700°C (although it has very low density - almost a vacuum - so it wont burn things passing through it). </p>

<p>To Eli5 this (because some conspiracy theorists gets it wrong, so might as well dispell a myth):</p>
<p>Imagine taking an ice cube out of your freezer, then heating it up using your hands. This will feel very cold for very long.</p>
<p>Now imagine the same amount of water, frozen in the same freezer, but in 5 super thin sheets, and then placing your hands on one of these sheets. Sure, it's cold, but you'll melt through it in seconds.</p>
<p>The amount of &quot;cold&quot; in each (total energy in the water), and the temperature of each, would be the same, but since you only touch very little of it, instead of a lot, the effect is less significant. Overall, your body heat has a bigger impact in the second situation.</p>
<p>In the same way, the top layer of air would be extremely hot if had the same amount of it, as you have down on earth. But you don't. So the amount of your air that rockets/ships/launches may encounter that is 1700 degrees hot, doesn't raise the temperature significantly. (There's still a net loss, which is why we say it's cold.)</p>
<p>You may hear someone, in some context, talking about it being &quot;hot&quot;. That's true, if you're concerned about the average temperature of stuff. There just isn't as much stuff up there, as down here, so the effect is quite different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our <em>intuition</em> of temperature breaks down a bit up there.</p>
<p>Our definition is fine—temperature is average energy, heat is total energy—it's just that, for any substance we interact with on a daily basis, high temperature means high heat and vice versa.</p>
<p>But that doesn't work for things with especially high or low mass, because massively (heh) distributing or concentrating heat significantly affects temperature.</p>
<p>This is also why a 2°C rise in global temperature is such a big deal: on the scale of the entire planet, 2°C represents an <strong>enormous</strong> amount of heat energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But would our skin get burnt when it hits those pockets of 1700° air? Like yeah it would cool down quickly, but it wouldn't take much to cause burns at that temperature? And would it be in patches on the skin or pinpricks?</p></div>		</li>
