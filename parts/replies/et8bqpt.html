			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a rather broad mandate. It would be helpful if you had some areas of focus rather than my choosing what I like or find noteworthy. PM me if you can narrow it down.</p>
<p>When you freeze fish, ice crystals develop in the flesh. Quicker freezing will generate smaller ice crystals, and so provide a higher quality when it's defrosted.</p>
<p>I had planted temperature logging devices in blocks sent to freeze.  A typical pattern in the resulting graphs is a bit like a reversed sieg rune.</p>
<p>The graphs show there is a steady and steep drop in temperature until you reach the freezing point. Then it levels out somewhat. Then the same steep decline is reestablished. Makes sense: when you pass from one state of matter to another, that requires a lot of energy.</p>
<p>I became convinced that the intermediate period is where you can signally influence the quality of your frozen fish. If you can remove heat more rapidly at that critical phase, smaller ice crystals will yield a better product.</p>
<p>My suppliers thought well of this concept, but pointed out that they lacked the means to get this done. Indeed the infrastructure would not allow.</p></div>		</li>
