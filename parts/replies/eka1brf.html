			<div class="markdown"><p>Well people die when there are drivers in the trains too...</p>
<p>If anything I think a computer system with a bunch of sensors and/or cameras could be better than a human at detecting whether anybody’s too close to the train (or under it) before it moves, or seeing somebody on the tracks ahead and hitting the brakes. I’m not sure all existing systems are designed for this, but a system could be created with that capability. </p>
<p>Without those extra doors there’s always a risk of suicide for example, where somebody jumps (or falls accidentally) when the train is near and has no time to stop. So the platform doors seem like a big safety benefit that might be worth installing, but it could be separate from the self-driving train. </p></div>		</li>

<p>At the same time, Toronto's suburb of Scarborough bought the exact same trains, but their unions (and a fear of automation in the public) required them to have a driver. The tech was possible and available in 1986 and for 33 years Scarborough has been paying for drivers...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Mainly due to its underfunded reliance on fare payment.</p>

<p>The skytrain has systems monitoring the tracks, if something falls onto it, trains are halted.</p>
<p>I think they also have humans at a command center able to take over train functionality when necessary.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For exmaple NYC has such old signals and tracks that an automated train system would require an overhaul of the entire MTA line. Hell, some of the MTA's signals are still analog from the 70s and 80s</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Railroad here, you forget that it cost money to run and install a lot of the newer technology's. PTC(positive train control), one of the new 'required' hands off tenchologys has billions of dollars necessary to install it. Many times it's just cheaper to have real people with technology that supports them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is above all cheaper to run the current system until the end of its life cycle. That is why there is so little happening in that regard in Europe. Not many new lines built. Very few in need of a complete overhaul. </p>
<p>In China and the middle east, where currently there is the largest demand for new metro systems to be built, almost all are automated to some degree.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Conductors pick up the jobs once held by the fireman and brakeman. If a train is blocking an intersection and they get the okay (ha ha) from the train-master to &quot;break&quot;, or split the train to open up an intersection, it's the conductor that has to go back there and do it. The conductor also has other jobs, among them is keeping the engineer awake. They also take care of emergency maintenance such as cracked/broken knuckles where the cars connect. And guess who gets to do all of the paperwork, making sure all of the signs on the cars are correct, etc. The job isn't worthless, but may seem to be so from the outside. Yes, they do have spare time on their trips, and a lot of them fill that time with personal instruction from the engineer on how to operate the train, as the transition from conductor to engineer is often considered a promotion. (not all conductors choose this path, but I believe all engineers were once conductors)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has to also be the cost for installing and fixing the current trains tracks stations is huge. Most train companies at least in America are broke. Easier to just contiune to pay the guy 120k a year then spend  like 500 times more then that </p>
<p>Also it's not like cars there's not that many trains running per people riding </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. In Germany we still have a lot of mechanical interlockings. Some over a 100 years old. But if it is a less frequented rural station it is way cheaper to keep two people manning and operating it and get custom repair parts than to upgrade it. On the one.hand we have fully digital interlockings that are operated from far far away with state of the art technology and then you have a guy sitting in a tiny cabin in the middle of nowhere pulling levers. Actually I know of one example where it is actually a frequented intersection between lines that is still mechanical even though there is a train every minute.</p>
<p>The cost of upgrading everything just is so much higher than keeping the current status and doing some minor updates to the old tech so it works with the modern technology around it.</p></div>		</li>
