			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't heard any of those reasons personally, and I dont see how they would be affected (especially birds?). However gases from flue vents from furnaces/boilers can be sucked into the building rather than sent out through the pipes if its under negative pressure, filling the room with carbon monoxide and gases that condense into acid. Also if youre under positive pressure then you control basically all the air coming into the building and therefore can keep the air cleaner and better filtered. It also stops gases from outside the building (whether from a sewer vent or a flue vent, etc) from being pulled in through any cracks or open windows (which shouldn't usually be a problem because by code the vents can't be by windows but redundancy is always good)</p>
<p>All that said, I agree with the other reply that positive pressure isnt what they were experiencing. Some grocery stores put a machine above the front door that creates an air curtain so they dont lose their conditioned air when the door opens, thats more likely what they were referencing.</p></div>		</li>
