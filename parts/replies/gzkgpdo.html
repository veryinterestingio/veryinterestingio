			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm trying to understand what this paper as saying, as it is not my area, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10633-007-9066-9" target="_blank">this paper</a> (2007) seems to suggest its the other way around? Unless I've completely misunderstood? (quite possible)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Critical flicker frequency (CFF) is the lowest frequency for which a flickering light is indistinguishable from a non-flickering light of the same mean luminance. CFF is related to light intensity, <strong>with</strong> <strong>cone</strong> <strong>photoreceptors</strong> <strong>capable</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>achieving</strong> <strong>higher</strong> <strong>CFF</strong> <strong>than</strong> <strong>rods</strong>..</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It means cones can blend faster flicker into a smooth perception at higher frequencies than rods.</p>
<p>Conversely that means rods would perceive flicker at lower freqs than cones. </p>
<p>But they can't test rods and cones at the same time because rods have to be tested at about the brightness of moonlight. The first flash of sunlight (cone vision) would wipe out all the rods and only cones would operate.</p>
<p>BOTTOM LINE peripheral retina is better at picking up flicker. That's saying it has a lower CFF. The rod and cone ratio isn't really relevant because rods and cones can't operate simultaneously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am really confused by this entire thread, as it really seems that you have it swapped. Look, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flicker_fusion_threshold" target="_blank">wiki says</a> that rods have flicker fusion frequency at about 15 Hz, while cones have it at higher frequency, potentially close to 60 Hz. Which means that a cheap LED light that flickers at some 20 Hz or so will be <em>above</em> flicker fusion threshold for rods (it will be perceived as stable light by rods), but below flicker fusion threshold for cones (it will be perceived as a flicker).</p>
<p>Which means that a difference in flicker fusion cannot explain this phenomenon; the logic should be backwards!</p>
<p>So either flicker fusion frequency is actually reversed at lower luminance (which seems plausible, although I couldn't find a reference easily), or it's mostly not about flicker fusion frequency, but about some sort of input-output characteristic that makes the light seem to be more modulated when it hits rods, compared to cones. Or maybe actually lower wavelengths in this particular LED are more deeply modulated than longer wavelengths, in which case cone vision (dominated by green and red cones) will perceive a more stable intensity than rod vision (that has peak sensitivity in the blue part of the spectrum).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that's backwards. It's a confusing topic. Part of the issue is that a lot of papers reporting CFFs are using small stimuli (and photopic lighting), for which the fovea actually is more sensitive. As BRUNDRETT 1974 nicely puts it:</p>
<p>&quot;The sensitivity of the retinal varies with size andposition of the target. For small fields (-1° diameter) the fovea. is most sensitive but for large fields
the most sensitive region is peripheral. Hylkelma23 found the highest CFF with a 10° field to be 34° away
from the fovea.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've got that swapped. Saying cones have a higher CFF by definition and per the quote is saying that they distinguish flicker at a higher rate and therefore would be less likely to blend it out. Being better at picking up flicker would mean having a higher CFF, not lower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sentence in bold says rods can detect light flickering at a lower frequency than cones. Ie the lower the flicker frequency that the photoreceptor can detect, the more sensitive it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, at least per that paper if the cones can detect a wider/higher range of frequencies then they should be better able to detect a low refresh rate/flicker frequency of an LED.</p></div>		</li>
