			<div class="markdown"><p>Specific factors can definitely affect metamorphosis! Metamorphosis in anurans is driven by thyroid hormones. A change in these hormones sets off a cascade of effects. The tail is resorbed, limbs develop, and a bunch of other changes happen. For example, the digestive system differentiates into a stomach and intestines, and gills are covered in a gill sac and lungs form. Tadpoles have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_line" target="_blank">lateral line system</a> that undergoes apoptosis (cell death). </p>
<p>While the loss of a tail and growth of limbs as the most visible changes, a lot is going on that's pretty dramatic and complex. With that in mind, we have to think about what could trigger these changes in hormones, and what could affect those changes. There are a number of species who will accelerate metamorphosis based on their ponds drying out, such as Western Spadefoot Toads (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/176694?seq=1" target="_blank">source</a>). Resource availability can affect metamorphosis as well, and some will metamorphose faster at higher tadpole densities or with lower food levels (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28308472/" target="_blank">source</a>).</p>
<p>Another thing to consider besides these natural phenomena is man-made impacts, like pollution. Rapid growth and change that occurs with metamorphosis means rapid cell growth, and that's when weird defects can happen. In North America, there has been an increase in frogs with extra limbs. The cause was unclear for a long time, but a flatworm was found to be a cause. They cause cysts to form on the frogs, leading to missing or extra limbs. However, at low densities, the flatworm doesn't cause much of an issue. Now it's thought that pollution from fertilizers may increase the number of flatworms (<a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/09/070925130649.htm" target="_blank">source</a>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a matter of waiting for factors...although it seems there can be certain factors that expedite metamorphosis. From a typical amphibian egg mass, you can sample it and divide those samples into different treatments with biotic and abiotic factors and see a variety of responses, even in the same treatment. Even further, some amphibians will delay metamorphosis a year or longer. Some salamanders will even retain juvenile characteristics like gills as long as their water source never dries. On the same note, you can find recently metamorphosed toads in a drying puddle at a fraction of the size of the same toads metamorphosing from a pond that never dries. But details about the energy uptake by the tadpoles and the dynamics of dissolved oxygen/temperature of a drying puddle along with the stress hormones from tadpoles crowding around depleting resources are a little too much for me to wrap my head around on the weekend.</p></div>		</li>
