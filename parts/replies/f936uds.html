			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, attorneys know about &quot;power of attorney.&quot; They probably haven't given the origin of these terms much thought. Etymology is usually interesting but not much reason to be smug; you'd get laughed at if you wanted to be called &quot;doctor&quot; because of your <em>juris doctor</em> degree.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Etymology probably does more harm than good, on a daily basis. </p>
<p>Aside from minor general interest, or a serious area of study for a very small number of people, it's mostly used in either reductionist arguments (hating immigrants isn't xenophobia, xenophobia comes from the Greek for &quot;fear of outsiders,&quot; but <em>technically</em>.....) or in trying to look smug for knowing something others don't. It's rare that someone uses it in a way that doesn't make them look like a clown. </p>
<p>That doesn't apply to linguists, nor does it mean you can't do some research to make a really subtle pun buried inside an otherwise boring comment on etymology, but for the rest of it, just leave it alone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These are interesting examples of different usages of the word &quot;at,&quot; but none of them feel really analogous.</p>
<p>&quot;At ease&quot; and &quot;at anchor&quot; describe a state of being of the person or ship: the person is relaxed and the ship is tethered. What is &quot;at law&quot; saying about the state of the attorney? Perhaps that the &quot;law&quot; has validated their practice of being an attorney?</p></div>		</li>
