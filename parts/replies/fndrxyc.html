			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically speaking, the <a href="https://www.nailcarehq.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Nail-Anatomy-NailCareHQ.com_.001.jpg" target="_blank">eponychium</a> is what people call the &quot;cuticle&quot; and is actually living skin. The cuticle is dead skin that is attached to your nail plate.</p>
<p>Apply and massage cuticle oil all around the base/sides of your nail after getting your hands and nails wet. Look for cuticle oils with jojoba oil in them. Lotion and cuticle cream are also alternate options as they absorb faster and don't leave your fingers as oily. You can also use oils and lotions/creams together.</p>
<p>You can also gently push back the skin that is at the base of your nails with the pads of your fingertips though this isn't necessary.</p>
<p>If you have lots of cuticle (the dead skin kind), you can use a cuticle remover to gently remove the dead skin. Only do this once a week and gently scrape at the dead skin with the <a href="https://shop.r10s.jp/deconail-seisakujo/cabinet/renewal/gel-3.jpg" target="_blank">flat end of an orange stick</a>. Wash your hands immediately after as you don't want to keep the cuticle remover on your skin any longer since it will eat away at any skin (it cannot distinguish between living and dead skin).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the last thing you want to do is “keep your cuticles in check” as they are part of your nail matrix (what makes the nail plate) and chronically trimming, pushing back, or any other repeated  manipulation will cause abnormalities of your nail plate...  Furthermore, altering the cuticle weakens the seal between your nail and nail bed/folds and therefore increases your risk of infection...</p>
<p>Basically moisturize your nails/cuticles just like your skin, trim any hang nails that arise, but otherwise just let your cuticles be happy little cuticles in their own world...</p>

<p>Aye! So that's why I have ridged nails.</p>
<p>I fight my cuticles every single day. I have two cuticle trimmers that I use every day to trim away the dead and often-pokey dead skin around my fingernails. I put globs of Aveeno on my hands every night, but I reckon that's not enough.</p>
<p>I don't know how I'm going to get over the hump of simply needing moisture to keep my cuticles healthy.</p>
<p>One more tip that supposedly helps is to cut our nails straight across instead of with aa pronounced curvature. Supposedly, when the nails grow back at the edges along the sides of our fingers, they cause a buildup of dead skin that we'll view as needing to be trimmed.</p>
<p>Whenever I get a manicure, the tech always trims my cuticles, though she never goes as deeply as I do. I reckon I'll have to ask her to stop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not the same &quot;cuticle&quot;. You don't ever want to push on the actual living skin at the edge of your nail, where it's attached to your body. That's what the above stuff is referring to. The stuff that's <a href="https://www.myblisskiss.com/cuticle/" target="_blank">actually on your nails</a>, though, the stuff you can shove around without feeling, that's what you ought to push down and trim off. If your skin next to the nail becomes inflamed and painful, you've gone too far with it.  You get rid of the dead layer, and don't touch the actual nail fold tissues or your skin. Those bits are alive. </p>
<p>Hangnails come from the dead tissues being shoved up the sides of your nails.</p>
<p>The main point of doing it with fake nails is to get a &quot;seamless&quot; look, and also because if you put a nail over the dead skin without removing it first, then when your nail continues growing, it can warp the nail and get infected underneath--because the fake nail doesn't allow for the growth that it's blocking.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nope.  Big fat nope. “The stuff that’s actually on your nails” is in fact your cuticle.  You should not push it down or trim it off as by doing so you are violating the seal between your nail plate, folds, and bed which puts you at risk for infection...</p>

<p>Kinda hard when you have to purell ever other minute.  I don't know how medical staff do it with out constantly have hang nails and the such.  I worked I.T. at a school and probably hit the hand sanitizer 10 times a day and had horrible hang nails.</p></div>		</li>
