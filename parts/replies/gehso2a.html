It’s ironic that I can’t ‘check the credit’ of a corporation before entering into a contract with them as a vendor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rent is paid up front but you can occupy beyond your paid through date due to tenants rights and all that.  You can squat for a while before being evicted.  LL's would like to decrease the possibility of that happening so rely partly on credit check.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most places have eviction laws that mean that, even though you are technically prepaying, if you miss a payment it still takes significant time and effort for the landlord to have you removed. Which means the landlord IS extending you credit, even if it isn't in the form of a loan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree with that assessment.  When you lease a car you're making payments to effective &quot;rent&quot; a car for a set period of time.  However, you have &quot;control&quot; over the asset, which is worth more than the sum of your &quot;rent&quot;, so they are certainly extending you credit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same logic though. Say your rent is $1000/month. You pay $12,000 a year to have possession of a $200,000 asset. That is the credit they are extending.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>They <strong>aren't</strong> though. Credit is extended from financial institutions. When you lease a car, you are &quot;renting&quot; it from the owner, in most cases the dealership. They own and maintain the car, you pay a lease to use it. There is no loan and no involvement from any form of bank or credit union.</p>
<p>When you take out a loan to buy a car, it is a totally different process. You want a car that costs more than you have. The bank pays the dealership the full sale value of the car, then you make payments to the bank. The transaction in this case is between you and the bank, hence credit is involved.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You must not be in the USA....  Or you know nothing about how auto leases work.</p>
<p>The dealership doesn't own the car.  There is definitely a bank or finance company involved.</p>
<p>For example, let's say you want to lease a Honda Civic.  You go down the street to JoeBlow Honda.  You negotiate and sign paperwork.  American Honda Finance Corporation (AHFC) is most likely going to be the finance company (since they're the captive finance company for Honda) and your lease agreement is actually between you and AHFC -- not the dealer.  AHFC cuts JoeBlow Honda a check for the FULL negotiated purchase price of the vehicle.  You then make your rent payments to AHFC.  At the end of the lease, you can return the car <em>TO AHFC</em> or decide to buy it for the previously-agreed residual value.</p>
<p>The car doesn't even go back to a dealer.  AHFC owns the car.  Most captive financing companies have internal auctions where dealers can bid on lease returns and obtain them as used inventory.  And some manufacturers (not all) may let you use a dealer lot as the drop-off location for your lease return...  But even when you do that, the dealer you drop off at doesn't own the car -- if they don't buy it at the internal auction then a truck will come buy and pick it up to transport elsewhere.</p>
<p>And you don't even have to use the captive finance company to lease.  For example, US Bank also offers leases!</p>
<p>You also mentioned maintenance, and incorrectly stated that the dealership is responsible for it.  This is wrong in most (probably all) situations.  There is no requirement that maintenance be included in a lease.  There are some manufacturers who do include maintenance as a sales offer (Volvo, for example, gives you the first 4 annual maintenances at no-charge if you purchase or lease).  In those situations, the manufacturer is the one footing the bill.  They reimburse the dealer for the work done.  It has nothing to do with a lease -- and certainly isn't a requirement for a lease.</p>
<p>You have a lot to learn about leasing!  And it's okay not to know these things...  But please consider not misleading people when you don't know the answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Leases aren't really &quot;renting&quot; in the same way that an apartment is. With a vehicle you have an asset that will largely vary in value based on treatment and driving, and with money factors and the option to buy out at the end are essentially buying a portion of the vehicles life rather than renting it. Leasing a car would be a lot more like buying a timeshare with the bank being the other owner than it would be like leasing a place.</p></div>		</li>
