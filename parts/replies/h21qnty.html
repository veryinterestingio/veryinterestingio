I lost a decent amount of strength taking almost a year off from the gym because of covid, but after only a month, I'm almost back to where I was. I can (and will) keep pushing upwards from there, but was just curious why the old gains that had previously taken years of hard work and consistency came back in a month when the first time to get there had taken a lot longer.</p></div>		</li>
