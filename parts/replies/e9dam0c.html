			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what happened to Mazda, for example. The company teamed up with a local automobile manufacturer to produce Mazda models in China. Mazda exited the Chinese market in 2006, but the Chinese automobile company continues to produce the same car models and parts designed by Mazda <a href="http://blog.logomyway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/mazda-haima.jpg" target="_blank">under the name Haima.</a></p>
<p>In short, the collaborative effort with a local company (with 50% stake) forces the foreign company to transfer technology to the local company, which at that point the local company has the incentive to break off ties and take over the Chinese market with the received technology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happens a ton even when there aren't deals made. China just doesn't really protect copyrights etc. Look at Landwind, the Land Rover knockoff. They basically just steal the designs from land rover, make shitty copies, and the government does nothing about it. It's actually insane when you go to China and the majority of cars are a weird knockoff, at least in my experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds suspicious to me. Chinese rules state you much partner with a domestic partner and cant own more than 50% of the company. I highly doubt a coffee company got an exception to that rule</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cite the rule. Or look at Starbucks’ financial reports.</p>
<p>Certain sensitive industries like telecoms or cultural products, yes. Coffee, no.</p></div>		</li>
