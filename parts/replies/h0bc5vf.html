			<div class="markdown"><p>Question: I am 58 years old and feel like I <em>need</em> a nap every day. 20 minutes, some days a little more if I worked out hard that morning lifting weights. After the naps, I feel elated and exuberant. </p>
<p>I go to bed around 9:30 every night, 7 days a week, get up around 5:15-ish. I typically wake up around 2:00 for 45 minutes most nights and then fall back asleep.</p>
<p>I feel like this is just my &quot;normal&quot; but wonder about this need for naps. Is it normal to need naps every day?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert, but my understanding is that it is normal to get tired during the day. Some people fight through it in a fog or power through sugar, caffeine, or both. I find a quick nap much more effective. Also, 20 mins seems to be the optimal nap time to be energized instead groggy afterward because it prevents going into too deep of a sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting topic actually! It is now recognized that having regular circadian rhythms can significantly improve patients with insomnia comorbid anxiety and depression (along with many of our daily behavior, biochemistry, and physiology). </p>
<p>Chronobiology is now more widely recognized as real science and much more biological/medical networkings were found with it!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question. </p>
<p>I don't feel depressed, but I never rule it out either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi there, I just want to state that I am by no means a doctor who can give medical health advice, but instead a researcher/scientist in Chronobiology and Pharmacology.</p>
<p>In general, from my knowledge of the current studies, we are not entirely sure if napping is beneficial to elderly (typically refers to 60+). It is seen in some papers that it may help memory consolidation especially in young adults. However, I believe it is too early to say much more without further research. To answer your feeling the need to nap however, it is very normal. With age, the frquency of napping increases, it is commonly observed. It is completey normal and healthy in general.</p>
<p>As we age, our clock also ages. We become less sensitive to the zeitgebers and have reduced recovery rates of all sorts. A common figure we notice is that with age, we tend to sleep earlier but have shorter overall sleep. Another thing to note is that with age, a reduction of deep sleep cycles and increased light sleep cycles are typically observed. This is usually accompanied by more frequent awakenings during their sleep. This is normal also!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, environmental stimuli and your own thoughts can mask your tiredness and keep you awake for longer (are we stronger than the molecules controlling us? Idk xD). Another thing is that young adults tend to sleep later than normal and usually end up sleeping in more frequently (if relevant).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi!
Simply put, our internal body temperature is also in sync with the circadian clock. Where the core temperature is always fluctuating within range, lowest usually being observed at around 3am. Change in temperature can cause phase shifting (changes in your clock) just like light, but to a lesser degree. Warmth is good when waking up and cooler temperatures are better for night time. Generally, temperature helps enhance the entrainment effect of light.</p>
<p>P.S. when I mentioned &quot;warm temperature&quot; at the start, I was supposed to be referring to the comfort feeling we feel at that 3-4pm time. Sorry!</p></div>		</li>
