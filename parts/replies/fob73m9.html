			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but as a former shoe salesman, my honest advice would be to go in, get your foot sized properly and try on different pairs.  You could also go and see a podiatrist (foot doctor) if you are having a really bad time with pain.  What they would do is fit you into a custom insole which you would typically wear in all your shoes. (Anecdotally, my father has a custom pair and he said it was like night and day afterwards)</p>
<p>The reason I'm not giving specific examples of shoes is because of how you may have any of the following: wide feet/extra wide feet/ high arches etc...  What would be comfortable for me, may not be comfortable for you.  </p>
<p>Personally, I can't wear anything that is has a narrow sole, and I have to try on multiple pairs every single time I'm in the store to find the right fit.</p>
<p>Hope this helped!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have the issue of Extra wide with a high arch. They're very much on the expensive side, but Allen Edmunds make a solid quality shoe that has sizes that match me. The aesthetic is as good as can be when you don't really conform to the standard long and narrow shoe shape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreeing with the former shoe salesman on the podiatrist if you're having a lot of pain frequently.</p>
<p>Also think about things such as, do you tend to roll your ankles? To the inside, or toward the outside?</p>
<p>I tend to wear running shoes all the time, but use different ones for different activities. All of them have a sole with a little extra on the outboard heel that prevents me rolling my ankles outward. My normal shoes for just wearing during the day have good arch support and are much more cushy. The ones I wear for going out for a walk (on asphalt) or mowing the yard are less cushy, but absorb more shock.</p>
<p>It has taken me a few years of plenty of plantar fasciitis pain and rolled ankles to find just the right shoes for my activities. But now I can walk 3-10 miles a day without having to roll frozen water bottles with my feet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The shoes that helped the most were ultra boosts. I worked 40 hours on concrete floors and we're consistently told to walk and look busy and are never allowed to rest for very long. Even with additional insoles, my legs and knees would hurt by the end of the day.</p>
<p>I roll my feet inward. Does that mean anything? I have wide toe area but small ankle area so it is weird trying to find shoes that fit perfectly. I think the ones that are like socks fit the best. With other kinds of shoes, I will have a lot of room, or my toes are being squished.</p>
<p>The pain is more on my legs and knees than my feet..</p></div>		</li>
