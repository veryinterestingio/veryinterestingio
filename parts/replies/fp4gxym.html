			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally, I find the more &quot;fun&quot; solution to be more headache-inducing, even if there is no way for us to get info any faster. Much easier to envision a single common universe with delayed observations, even if no one can measure that universe's state instantaneously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>None of it is headache inducing or particularly difficult  to understand though. You pick a frame of reference and operate within that.</p>
<p>Between that frame and this frame you know that what you're observing occurred some time in the past, sometimes a great deal of time in the past. However, if you're going deep enough with your maths, that's all already accounted for. If you need to also take into account a frame of reference that lies between your first two frames, then you're already operating in a new frame of reference which is the right way to think about it.</p>
<p>That's really the key thing about general relativity: you can sometimes ignore it and get almost the right answer, or you can ignore it and get the right answer for different frames of reference, but the moment you want those frames to interact you have to take into account the speed of light.</p>
<p>To put it another way, even if someone prefers to think about celestial bodies in a Newtonian sense, they wouldn't apply Newtonian math to it and expect to get the exact right result over a frame that covers a vast distance. The answer would just be expected to be wrong.</p>
<p>And the neat thing about Newtonian physics is because it was developed using a local frame of reference and not completely in abstract, to some degree it is actually correct and does take into account the speed of light - it's just that that concept is unwittingly represented by coefficients derived from measurement since we can't observe a body <em>without</em> the effects of C.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meh, I disagree. Saying &quot;technically it happened 2000 years ago&quot; implies some sort of universal reference frame. Sure, that object and us are probably is a very similar reference frame in practice, but it still doesn't sit right with me. We also don't know how far away some things are, so it can be hard to quantify something like when it happened, when really it doesn't always matter much.</p>
<p>I think it often makes more sense to just assume what you see happening is happening now for us. So that star just exploded, that galaxy is currently merging with that one, and if you look at the CMB, recombination is happening right now at the edge of what we can see</p></div>		</li>

<p>Of course we do?! It's a simple matter of trigonometry and incredibly precise measurements made by an array of sexy satellites. You must give scientific credit when it is due. The measured distances, coupled with relativity, can let us know the true distance between us and any distant object, whether it travels at relative speeds or not.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not at all. It is a decidedly relativistic statement, relating the observer's present to an event's time of occurence in the observer's reference frame. No universal reference frame is implied. The one thing you need to remember is the fact that there is an implicit reference frame (for example, Earth time, which is boring and well-behaved since we're not close to a truly massive body).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>astrophysics Professor here....that's a very odd thing for him to say.  I don't think there's anything confusing about it at all!  And you should never have to ignore anything.  Just become at peace with it through study.</p></div>		</li>
