			<div class="markdown"><p>The brain injuries are a big one to call out. Being shelled causes concussions, even if you never take a &quot;hit&quot;. Being close to hundreds of nearby artillery strikes definitely caused some of the soldiers in WW1 to have very serious concussions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC this was pretty definitively proven incorrect, in fact the word &quot;shellshock&quot; comes from this theory - the constant micro-shocks of artillery bombardments would cause permanent neurological damage. But it doesn't really happen (of course if you have shells blow up really close to you repeatedly you'd probably get fucked over), so that's why it was slowly changed into first combat stress and then PTSD, as it became understood that the cause was pretty squarely psychological.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just that, we were taught in school that many of those old videos you see of men shaking and spasming uncontrollably were also faked. </p>
<p>Medical studies then were a lot less scrutinized and there was a lot to gain in a new field. Shellshock/PTSD is real, but a lot of the footage is either faked or people with symptoms of unrelated problems being used as a curiosity. </p>
<p>That said, war today is entirely different. You can't compare the physical stress of being in a trench thats shelled 24/7 for weeks with how our soldiers experience combat now. I don't say that to make light of what modern troops experience, but it's just not even remotely the same in terms of the volume of it or the lack of mental preparation and support.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think you’re minimizing our troops’ experiences today by saying WW1 was way worse. War is definitely more manageable now. We’ve devised tactics to cope with modern war whereas in WW1, tactics from the Napoleonic wars were used for the majority before the generals could learn enough to change. Rotating troops, Is another thing that didn’t happen at the beginning of WW1. Battles before this lasted a day or two at the longest so it was never needed. Now you have battles lasting for months, with constant shelling, and eating, sleeping, and living in muddy trenches where if you raise your head to far you’re dead. This doesn’t even take into account the fact many of your friends or at least close acquaintances die near you. The stress of WW1 is insane to think about and wouldn’t be tolerated today. There’s was a culture romantic about war and that spirit allowed them to tolerate a lot more shit for much longer. Modern armies would revolt if they were put in those situations today and would be better for it. </p></div>		</li>
