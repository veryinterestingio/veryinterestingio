			<div class="markdown"><p>Another quantum optician here:<br />
The Hong-Ou-Mandel effect is very hard to explain from the picture of thinking of photons as particles unto themselves. Indeed, a lot of the weirdness that seems to come from quantum physics happens when we try to think of photons or other quantum objects this way. It's difficult, but what I try to do is let the math speak for itself, and then decide what photons are like from that.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, a photon is not a single independent object, but is actually a particular quantum state of something else (namely the electromagnetic field). </p>
<p>The Hong-Ou-Mandel effect comes from asking what happens when two identical photons encounter different entry ports of 50/50 beamsplitter at the same time. The initial state of the field is a two-photon state that is a product of one photon in one input mode, and one photon in the other input mode. The output state of the field in general would be a superposition of all four two-photon states over the output modes (e.g., both leave one port, both leave the other port, or one goes one way and the second goes the other), but destructive interference  makes the amplitude for each output photon going its own way zero. It really is just an interference effect, but it feels exceptionally weird if you try to visualize the experiment as particles of light going through it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That sentence has rearranged my amateur understanding of quantum physics (which is at a low level). Is this a special property of only photons? Or does that statement apply to any other &quot;particles&quot;? It sounds like you're saying photons are essentially a &quot;manifestation&quot; (for lack of a better word) of an electromagnetic field (and is that statement saying the electromagnetic field of the photon is local? all-pervasive? solely in the area of the photon?)</p>
<p>Just trying to wrap my head around what that statement is saying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the HOM effect you have two photons that hit a half-reflective mirror in such a ways that the reflected path of one photon lines up with the transmitted path of the other photon, and vice versa. Now the key point is that the photons have to be indistinguishable. That means you can't tell the difference (even in principle!) between both photons being reflected, and the opposite case (both photons being transmitted). What that means is actually that talking about photon 1 and 2 after the half-mirror doesn't even make sense (you can't put labels on them).</p>
<p>Anyway, it turns out that one of these two possibilities will have a different phase than the other. Just like two identical waves can cancel each other if you overlay them the right way, these two possible outcomes also cancel each other and you <em>never</em> find that both photons are transmitted or reflected. This is an interference effect, but it's different from classical interference and is referred to as second order interference.</p>
<p>This phase shift that causes the effect has to do with the fact that photons are bosons - if you did the experiment with electrons it would behave the opposite way, they would never &quot;bunch&quot; together, and that can be thought of as a manifestation of the Pauli exclusion principle. You can actually mimic this with photons as well, by preparing them in an entangled &quot;singlet&quot; state that has some fermionic properties.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, to be precise they <em>do</em> interact - a tiny bit, nothing detectable at ordinary energies. But quantum field theory means they do interact through higher order terms like vacuum polarisation (e.g. one photon creating a virtual electron-positron pair which, being charged, affects the other), and they do interact gravitationally, as light distorts spacetime and is affected by it, same as matter.</p>
<p>But it's of course effects so infinitesimal they don't matter outside of the most extreme situations imaginable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I hear that they think a recent (in Ï„) supernova was set off due to pair production.<br />
It got so hot that pair production started, which meant an increasing amount of energy went from photons (which exert pressure on the star) to rest mass of the particles. As the star collapsed, the core got hotter, which drove this effect further, so there was a runaway imposion.</p></div>		</li>
