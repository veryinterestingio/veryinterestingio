<p>Because of the recession, your company bans flights for client travel. So the money you would have spent on the plane ticket doesn't get spent there. Combined with everyone else, the airline doesn't get as much revenue with which to buy a new plane. So the plane manufacturer orders fewer parts with which to construct the plane. So the airplane parts manufacturer has to lay off workers that don't have parts to build. So that laid off worker can't take her family out to dinner at the nice restaurant. So the nice restaurant doesn't order as many vegetables because there are fewer customers. So the local farmer sees their sales decrease and can't buy a new tractor. So the tractor manufacturer...</p>
<p>Very few of these links lead straight one to another (one plane ticket lost does not equal one giant plane not ordered) but in aggregate when all the links start coming together, it just cycles throughout over and over again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good point. It's &quot;losing money&quot; in an economic sense but not necessarily an accounting sense.</p>
<p>Like when a company spends say $10k an hour on labor and all other costs to run and generates $20k an hour revenue doing so. If the whole factory stops you'll hear some manager complaining that they're losing $20k an hour but in reality they're losing the $10k in actual costs, the other $10k was just profit that could have been made but wasn't.</p>
<p>Or let's say I bought $100k in stocks and they've gone down in value to $50k. Some would point to this as having lost $50k but I only lose that $50k if I sell at that price. If I hang onto it and they go back up to $200k Then I never lost $50k.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you look at the crash different way:</p>
<p>A gallon of gas has the same physical worth to me today as it did 5 months ago. I put it in my car and I can go 30 miles. But after the crash I can buy two gallons for the same price as one gallon because the price went down. </p>
<p>The physical value didn't change though, so my dollar must have more buying power now. Essentially, there are fewer dollars floating around but each dollar is now worth more. Same with stock- a couple of months ago my dollar bought less ownership in a company than it does today (ie stock prices went down so my dollar has more buying power). </p>
<p>Or am I totally wrong in looking at it that way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The buying power of a dollar is a different thing. It does change, but it's not what's happening here. Your groceries are the same price now as they were 5 months ago, but your gas is cheaper. If your buying power of your dollars increased, then both would be cheaper.</p>

<p>Yes it did. The value of the gas has little to do with it's functionality. Value is subjective, not absolute. This is the key thing to understand about economics. Value is dictated by supply and demand and right now there is a massive over-supply of oil, thus the value is dropping like a rock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Value is more the flow than a thing. The drop in prices is a reflection that the economy is slower and it will be harder for you to get ahold of a new dollar . Because of that people want a dollar more to be able to do stuff so they offer you more goods for your dollar. Thus dropping the prices. </p>
<p>Yay my 100 dollar stack is worth more, I am an economic genius and will be super rich from this recession if I just don't spend my money, people want each dollar more. Well issue is here that you will not get any new dollars either so those are the last you have. And do you feel you can retire on those 100 bucks? No so somehow you need to find a way of making money but it is harder now, since no one wants to buy and that means you can't buy next year's worth of gasoline either, despite being cheaper. And that is why a recession is bad and bad that prices drop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Others have discussed the definition of value, but I would argue that even just the value-to-you of gasoline has gone down (at least for the general person).  5 months ago if someone gifted you a 20 gallon tank of gasoline, you could take a road trip, or drive to work for free for a week.  Now, it probably sits in your garage for a month because a road trip is crazy and you are working from home.  Sure, chemistry is unchanged, but just about everyone's valuation of gas has decreased, likely including yours.</p></div>		</li>
