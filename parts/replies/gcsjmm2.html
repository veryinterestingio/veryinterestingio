			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually it's the same, like with Shingrix for shingles. Both doses are the exact same product. So many people have stopped me and said &quot;Now this is the second one, right?&quot; so you're not alone to question it. Pneumonia vaccines are different. PCV-13 (Prevnar) is what most adults get first at 65, given no underlying health conditions that warrant getting PPSV-23 (Pneumovax) first. A year after getting PCV-13 you would get PPSV-23, which is a different dose that as the name implies has 23 types of pneumonia vs 13. TL;DR: It depends on the vaccine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would just point out that ppsv23 isn't really a &quot;booster&quot; for pcv13 as they're targeting different strains.  ACIP guidelines were also recently updated and pcv13 is no longer universally recommended at age 65 and is now in the much more nebulous &quot;shared decision making&quot; level of recommendation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some vaccines are only good if taken before exposure and others can help and are taken as therapy (called post-exposure prophylactic) </p>
<p>People like to lump all vaccines together, but it‚Äôs an oversimplification. For lack of a better metaphor all motor vehicles are not the same. They don‚Äôt function the same, etc, but they get you where you‚Äôre going.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a better metaphor is just to say that not all vehicles are the same, but they all get you where you're going, and some are similar. Vehicles with an engine might be like live vaccines, while a bike is more like vaccines with dead cells, a skateboard just proteins, and a horse drawn carriage uses a different, but closely related disease, like how the original smallpox vaccine worked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a actually a fascinating question.  For most vaccines, the booster is the same as the original.  This is true for hepatitis A &amp; B, the new shingles vaccine (Shingrix), and HPV (Gardasil and others) for example.  For the tetanus/diphtheria/pertussis series, however, we get an <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/dtap-tdap-td/public/index.html" target="_blank">alphabet soup</a> of various formulations with the boosters (Td, Tdap) being lower doses of the diphtheria &amp; pertussis portions than the original series (DT, DTaP).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I‚Äôm not familiar with the data for the two leading COVID vaccines honestly. (Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs been even been disclosed since I haven‚Äôt been following closely) </p>
<p>Any recommendations (booster/no booster, timing of booster if applicable etc) will have to be based on what the data from the clinical trial suggests or post-market data that we see once deployed. It is important to note we have limited data at this point due to the rush so we may find a booster for some formulations is needed. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There‚Äôs a threshold and it doesn‚Äôt always work the way you‚Äôd think. More doses the better, right? Not necessarily. With the Anthrax vaccine, which has several boosters, one booster dose was dropped because in the clinical trial (with several groups with different booster schedules) it was seen that those without one of them (can‚Äôt remember which one) actually had a bigger immune spike at the next booster time point than those with all the boosters. It was probably a interval issue, but still, it was shown to be unnecessary. Wild, hu? The immune system is so interesting!</p>
<p>So at any rate, you could continue to get boosters; it would prime your immune system, but it might not be helpful if you already have sufficient immune response. And as with any drug is the drug risk/benefit calculation to consider. </p>
<p>Waining titers and breakthrough illness among fully vaccinated individuals: some people‚Äôs immune system doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúremember‚Äù as long as the general population. A booster (or another dose of vaccine in general) may be administered to prime the immune system providing a protective level, if that is recommended based on your health, risk factors, etc. Herd immunity can provide additional protections...I won‚Äôt go into all that here since I could type a novel. lol</p>
<p>I rambled about a lot here. I hope it was helpful and addressed your questions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Polio immunity lasts a life time and other viruses don't. Don't hold your breath. How long memory T and B (lymophocyte) cells live (maintaining hemeostasis) is a question that experts are actively trying to answer.</p>
<p><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/26754" target="_blank">https://elifesciences.org/articles/26754</a></p>
<p>The gist of the research article is this:</p>
<p>&quot;Despite this rapid replacement of memory T cells by new naive T cells, around 50% of the pool of memory T cells that had formed before the mice were eight weeks old was never replaced by new naive T cells. Thus, although a substantial fraction of the memory T-cell pool is replaced at high rates throughout life, an equally large proportion is kept from an early age. The question still remains whether these ‚Äòoriginal‚Äô T cells simply have a long lifespan or are maintained through cell division.&quot;</p>
<p>The mRNA drugs is interesting because they typically last a long time depending on what kind of cells they're delivered into. It is possible to get cleared out in days, it could be possible it stays with you because of certain cell longevity, or it could be this exploratory memory pool hypothesis. What we do know is the current mRNA vaccines increase efficacy at the 3 month mark and the trials will continue for 12 months to observe the longer term effect. We're just seeing the short term result. It could be six months later patients need another vaccine shot to retrain T and B cells to regrow in numbers. Hopeful but it would be irresponsible to answer with authority given a lack of hard data to interpret.</p>
<p>You can see in Figure 1 viral debris is modeled after 28 days.

<p>And in Figure 1.
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-020-00436-4" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-020-00436-4</a></p>
<p>That's why vaccination at least 2 weeks apart to keep the immune system in peak response.</p>
<p>The other problem not many are talking about is the overstimulation of the immune system causing ARDS and cytokine storms. These are topics for people interested but would put it really roughly around ~20% of the fatalities from serious cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what the other reply said, which was a lot and a very good comment, some vaccines do work like that! The TDaP vaccine is supposed to be administered every 10 years. Most people outside of healthcare and early childcare don't get boosters unless they get a wound that requires it, but the recommendation is every 10 years.</p></div>		</li>
