			<div class="markdown"><p>A bit off topic, but why is the population wealthy? Natural resources? The only ones I'm aware of are fish and sheep. Do they have minerals?</p>
<p>Okay, I was curious enough to Google it, sorry for answering my own question. Looks like the main industries are tourism, fish, and aluminum (smelting).</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's super-relevant to this conversation, actually. Iceland has a good deep-water port and a <em>shitload</em> of absolutely dirt-cheap hydro-electric power. People in this thread are talking about Iceland's renewable grid and about geothermal power as though that's most of Iceland's grid, but it's actually like 70% hydro-power, and it's incredibly cheap hydro-power at that. Iceland is super mountainous and super rainy, and what that means is you can build comparatively narrow, cheap dams that don't impound a very big reservoir behind them. You can build a narrow dam (which is cheap) because you're just damming a comparatively narrow mountain valley, and you can have a small reservoir because it's gonna rain again pretty soon. Iceland uses that cheap power to smelt aluminum, which is a super power-hungry process. Because one of the major costs of aluminum smelting is that electricity to heat the ore, and because they're in easy shipping reach of both the Americas and Europe, Iceland is a really cost-effective place to do aluminum smelting.</p>
<p>Or, looked at another way, aluminum smelting is a way for Iceland to be a power exporter without having to run crazy long cables to Canada or Scotland. Quebec exports power to the rest of Canada and New England with cables, while Iceland does it in processed aluminum.</p>
<p>So consider that not only does Iceland have a 100% renewables grid, but they're not doing that by scrimping and saving and using as little power as possible; rather, they're 100% renewable and they export a shitload of that power too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iceland has very &quot;traditional&quot; power plants for the most part, their turbines are just driven by water, or geothermal-heated steam, making them renewable. It's not the &quot;kind&quot; of renewable that has been at the center of public zeitgeist for the past decade.</p>
<p>You could say Iceland was renewable &quot;before renewable was cool&quot;, but in Iceland's case it was just a straightforward economic choice. So is every other case in the world using traditional hydroelectricity for power.</p></div>		</li>
