			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually they do search for similar patents.  Patent searching has been a job and an industry for over a 100 years. Today it is done with text and image searches on computers but in the past it was done via paper.  A copy of every patent was on paper file in the patent office in what they called shoe boxes.  Patent examiners are specalized in their field and most know a lot of he patents on file in their area of expertise from.mory.  Reason I know is I worked on creating their automated systems for patent searching and application processing years and years ago. </p>
<p>And the reason there are patents for multiple light bulbs is you can get a patent for an improvement to the original invention.  So edison has the lightbulb but another inventor also got a patent for a lightbulb but their lightbulb used a different filament or contained a gas different from the original and it was different enough that they issued a patent.  And sometimes patent examiners miss a previous patent when looking for them and a new patent gets issued any way.</p></div>		</li>
