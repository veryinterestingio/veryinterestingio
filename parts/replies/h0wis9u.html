			<div class="markdown"><p>Could it be why standing still or just walking around lightly (like in a museum) feels so much more tiring than walking around all day (to me)?</p>
<p>When visiting a city for instance, I can walk around all day just fine, tens of miles/kilometers. I can hike forever up and down. But I visit a museum and I just want to sit by the end of it. I have a longer upper torso compared to my legs than average so making a lot of adjustments to stabilize may be harder than average for me, and using muscles I use less often.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah it's the stopping and going that causes it, or when you're in a queue or a crowd and you constantly feel like you're stepping on your own toes because you can't take your full stride length and your brain doesn't know if you're going or stopping so it lifts onto the toes and takes tiny steps. The hard floors also don't help because it tires out your calves quicker and places pressure on the bony surfaces of the foot when you can't flex your foot comfortably</p>
<p>When walking or running you don't have to balance as much because you lean your torso forward and adjust your step position - so if you felt yourself leaning to the left you would automatically land your left foot further left which is barely an adjustment when you were planning to land it anyway. And the increased speed/momentum bends your shoe and foot in a more natural way</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just posted a reply to the top comment about this, and I agree with you whole-heartedly.</p>
<p>I have a hunch back due to misshapen vertebrae in my upper back. When I'm hunching, my back and neck muscles become fatigued much faster.  I think I realized this more after I got Lyme disease and the muscle fatigue that comes with that. I just simply could not keep my head upright anymore. It was scary. </p>
<p>I've started to pay attention to my posture much more after that.  When I'm in a more upright position, I can balance my head over my shoulders and there is much less strain on those muscles.  </p>
<p>I've been treated for the Lyme, but I still get some of the symptoms like muscle fatigue and general fatigue. I don't know if it's some kind of permanent damage, if I've been reinfected, or if I didn't get rid of the disease with the meds the doctor gave me.</p></div>		</li>
