<p>I think it tastes better because when you are cooking you are taste testing and smelling it.   Dulls the flavor when you eat it.</p>

<p>This is 100% it. By the time I sit down to eat I have been breathing in the food for an hour or more. Smell being a huge part of taste it doesn't have the same impact of going from starving to all of a sudden having some food to eat.</p></div>		</li>
