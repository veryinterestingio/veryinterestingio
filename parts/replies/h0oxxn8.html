			<div class="markdown"><p>They do that at a geosynchronous orbit, similiar to geostationary but inclined which makes the figure 8.  You need 3 or 4 to keep continuous coverage over Japan.  </p>
<p>Molnayia orbits, used by Russia and Canada are even more interesting 12-hour orbits with that go from fairly close to leo out past geo so that they move very slowly comparied to the ground for 1/3 of the orbit.  You need 3-6 for continuous coverage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting problem is whether you can use four satellites for continuous coverage of the entire planet — that is, for every point on the surface of the earth, there is at least one of the four satellites that is higher than the horizon.</p>
<p>Obviously, three satellites in equatorial orbit cover every point but the north and south poles, and at any point in time three satellites is not enough (because they define a plane, so at least one of the two points on the line normal to that plane through the center of the earth won't see any of them). Six is obviously enough, because you can put three in a equatorial orbits, offset by 120 degrees, and three in similar polar  orbits.</p>
<p>So is five enough? Is four? I don't know the answer. It reminds me of the four color theorem, because it's easy to see that six colors can color any map, and three can't, but four and five are tricky. Also it's a bit mind-bending to try to imagine how the tetrahedral convex hull evolves over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you take a picture of the sun at the same time each day over the course of a year, you get the same shapes.  They're called analemmas when we're talking about the sun.  </p>
<p>At the equator, it's the figure 8, and then as you go North or South from there, you get the more and more distorted shapes until you get the weird &quot;drip&quot; shape near the arctic and antarctic circle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it depends on the type of Lagrange point and the distance to the large masses, as well as other nearby bodies. If I recall, it's a little like the top of a hill vs the bottom of a valley. Some are types of L points are stable (valley) and some are unstable (hill top). It's been a while since I studied them, but it's worth a little googling, lots of good information out there. From a quick search I found that some L points are hundreds of thousands of miles across.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are 5 Lagrange points, 2 of which are stable, and 3 of which are unstable. L1, L2, and L3 are unstable, and are located inline with the two major bodies. L1 is between the major bodies, L2 is on the far side of the smaller of the two, and L3 is on the far side of the larger, occupying the same orbital path as the smaller body. L4 and L5 are stable, located precisely 60° ahead and behind the smaller body in the same orbital path (they form an equilateral triangle between the two major bodies centers of mass and the L-point).</p>
<p>No known natural bodies orbit the L1, L2, or L3 points of any system, however all planets in our solar system (besides Mercury and Venus) have asteroids occupying both their L4 and L5 points. Most famously, Jupiter has families of asteroids called the Trojans at L5 and Greeks at L4. Generically, all L-point occupying asteroids are called Trojans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting question. Apparently 500,000 miles across according to google.  I take that with a grain of salt, that's twice the Earth-Moon distance. I assume that there is a much smaller sweet spot that would tend to contain stuff and minimize station keeping fuel expenditures but I have no idea how big that sweet spot might be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you take the example of jupiter, check the Lagrange point L4 and L5 named &quot;Trojans&quot; and &quot;Greeks&quot; that contains many asteroid on this point and it's very verh large. Lagrange point L1, L2, L3 are pretty unstable and need a big precision to put on these point à sattelite and keep it on the point without correcting orbite</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are only a few of these points per system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are always 5 Lagrange points between every 2 orbital bodies, so there are 5 between Earth and the Moon, and 5 between Earth and the Sun, but only points 4 and 5 have stable gravity wells.</p>
<p>The larger the bodies the bigger the wells so the biggest in our solar system are the L4 and L5 Jupiter/Sun points, home to hundreds of thousands of &quot;trojan&quot; objects (asteroids).</p>
