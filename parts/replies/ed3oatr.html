			<div class="markdown"><p>You've left me hanging on the &quot;entire&quot; in the third sentence. Please help.</p>
<p>Also, seems like alot of these faster wireless techs all struggle with range and strength through walls since they're using higher frequency wavelengths for the speed. Is this accurate? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Well to answer the last part, no, true 5G won't come too soon. 5G can't be simply installed on a tower. It doesn't have the range to blanket an entire.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What that means is 5G signals travel much shorter distances than the current 4G antennas can. If they just upgraded the hardware at existing cell sites only, then there will be dead zones throughout. In order to properly build out a 5G network using the mmWaves they are planning, they need a lot more cell sites. This means more fiber in the ground, more small cells, more rooftop antennas. Itâ€™s a huge undertaking. </p></div>		</li>
