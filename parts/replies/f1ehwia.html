That said, I think the media over-reports unwanted and unexpected pregnancies, as having trouble to conceive does not present as a big of a story. Similar to how crime rates are lower but people may feel less safe due to the amount of crimes on news.  </p>
<p>I'm not saying unwanted and unexpected (especially teen) pregnancies aren't a problem, but just a thought.  </p>
<p>Either way, hope it works out okay for you!</p></div>		</li>
