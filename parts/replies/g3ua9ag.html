			<div class="markdown"><p>This was the graph for the case of two objects moving at the same speed away from each other.
The key idea is that no object moves faster than c away from a stationary observer.
This does still allow for you to measure two objects to be moving at faster that c relative to each other, but they wonâ€™t see it that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm gonna add <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Relativity_of_Simultaneity_Animation.gif" target="_blank">this picture</a>. The green grid shows the coordinate system a moving observer would use to measure events. One of the really important features is that <em>straight lines stay straight lines</em>. So to answer OPs question you could draw the worldlines corresponding to the two moving objects, overlay the transformed grid corresponding to one of them and measure the skew of the other line relative to that grid. That is what the formula of /u/Rannasha  does, at the end of the day, just more compact.</p>
<p>How does a general moving and accelerating observer experience the world? There's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lorentz_transform_of_world_line.gif" target="_blank">this animation</a> showing quite neatly how accelerating transforms an observers view of spacetime. This would be the <em>comoving</em> view, as in each instant, we see the coordinate system of the moving observer. Keep in mind that the dots are not particles here, but events: the horizontal axis corresponding to position, the vertical one to time. Future is up.</p></div>		</li>
