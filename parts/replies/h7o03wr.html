			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont play Madden, but if its anything like FIFA or NBA then its not a real simulation. They typically just compare the teams strengths and generate some stats and scores that make sense. The numbers increasing as time progresses just gives an illusion that the sim is happening in realtime</p>
<p>For a game like Football Manager though, they really simulate the game as it happens. Each player and the team gets simulated according to their stats and characteristics. You can actually rewind thru an entire simulated game and watch it second by second</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it were actually fully simulating a game in all details, it could show you a lot more than just increments by score. It’s much more efficient to just run the numbers for a given outcome than it is to calculate a whole bunch of fine detail that will never be shown.</p>
<p>They are doing one of two things. Either they are running a bare bones simulation of the game that just calculates how the score is likely to change over time until the end, and then showing you that. Or, personally I think more likely, they are calculating the most likely end result and then retroactively generating a “story” that gets them to that outcome.</p>
<p>Either way, the full simulation is probably completed almost instantly and the progression it is showing you is purely for effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it's really up to the game on how it simulates.  The simulation could be flipping a coin, or it could be playing the whole game.  It's all about how the developers thought the consumer would prefer and how much work they were willing to put into it.  It could even look up in a giant chart, this team against this team ends with these stats...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, in NBA 2k, you can join a simulated game in progress, which means they're doing the 3rd option and actually playing a game at 4x speed.</p></div>		</li>
