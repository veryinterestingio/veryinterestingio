			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really helpful to the question asked. I still don't know if giraffes choke on food/water more than other animals.</p>
<p>And the question about water was obviously related to them getting water in lungs and having to cough like people do. If they can't cough how do they get water out of the lungs </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Choking is when the airway is blocked. If something goes into your lungs, it’s called aspiration, this can happen when you are choking, but it is not in itself choking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While the giraffe may not be able to cough it out, internal temperature would be high enough for the water to evaporate eventually, similar to how water evaporates from a cup left out in the sun. If the amount of water respirated does not cause asphyxiation, it would simply be uncomfortable for a few hours. Personally, I don't have the knowledge to explain how this might affect long term lung physiology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny, I don’t have my giraffe anatomy books on me either. I never knew there was such a thing although in hindsight of course there must be. </p>
<p>I just found your opening statement amusing. Merry Christmas!</p></div>		</li>
