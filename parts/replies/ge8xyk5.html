			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s an indicator of trauma that has healed. If you ever had a deep-ish cut on your skin, you know that the skin doesn’t heal exactly as it was. It becomes bumpy and is less elastic. That’s scar tissue. The same thing can happen to tendons either acutely, for example in a strain, or more usually because of some chronic injury. Wrong biomechanics, weak muscles, bad posture etc cause some sort of friction that will lead to inflammation and the formation of scar tissue on the tendon or ligament.   </p>
<p>Tendons and ligaments exist inside seaths called fascia that kind of direct their movement and slightly lubricate them. Those are like membranes of collagen that are more like bands in various important places where the moving tendon needs to be directed somehow.   </p>
<p>When scar tissue is formed it kind of presses the fascia and snaps when going in and out of it. In extreme cases the scar tissue can become so bad that the joint gets stuck (usually it happens to fingers and we call it trigger finger or stenosing tenosynovitis) and needs treatment to fix it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a pretty severe ankle injury that I regularly go to physical therapy for. My therapist and I celebrate every crack and pop because it means we are breaking down the scar tissue that is keeping my ankle from being as mobile as it once was!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of things in the joint can make it crack or pop.  I had a bucket handle tear in my rt lateral knee meniscus.  The loose piece of meniscus would sometimes get caught in the joint.  Not enough to lock it but my knee would crack when I got out of bed or after sitting for a while.  Once they removed the lose piece cracking went away.  Usually you don't want to remove small tears in meniscus unless there is: instability, pain or locking in the joint that doesn't resolve with PT.  Once they remove pieces of meniscus, the cartilage gets extra wear &amp; tear.  Once cartridge is gone and you're bone on bone you get crepitus and pain.  Next step knee replacement.</p></div>		</li>
