			<div class="markdown"><p>Liquid hand soap also uses potassium hydroxide, actually. Bar soap uses sodium hydroxide. Shaving soap typically uses a 60/40 blend of the 2. You're right that potassium hydroxide gives more lather though.</p>
<p>Theres no real practical difference between body wash and hand wash though. Or at least I haven't come across specific recipes for either. You might use different fragrances, or maybe someone could market a hand soap as being gentler because of the specific oil blend they used, but generally there's no real difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest thing with potassium hydroxide is that it keeps the whole thing liquid. Sodium hydroxide hardens up. </p>
<p>You can make a pure castile body wash with just olive oil and potassium hydroxide, or you could make a bar castile soap with olive oil and sodium hydroxide. </p>
<p>&quot;Gentler&quot; usually means a higher superfat percentage. The fats that are leftover after the saponification process. If you go for a perfect saponification with no remaining fats, it will be much harsher. By putting in <em>just</em> more oils than can be fully saponified, you're left with a smoother feeling.</p></div>		</li>
