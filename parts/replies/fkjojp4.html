			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually this depends. On the repo market the fed buys a bond and gives banks cash. The bank agrees to rebuy the bond (usually) the next day. This is done so the bank has the proper amount of cash in reserves to meet the requirement.</p>
<p>During quantities easing (QE), the Fed can buy these bonds to give banks cash without any repurchase agreement. The Fed then can sell those back or let them reach their maturity and just takes the money. Both of these are forms of quantitative tightening (QT).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this is conventional terminology, but it makes it SO much more difficult to understand.</p>
<p>Essentially the Fed loans $1.5T to the banks. Period.</p>
<p>The use of the word “BUYING” BONDS (IOUs) to mean LENDING money is why finance gets unnecessarily hard to understand. </p>
<p>Again I know it’s convention but DAYUM, keep it simple people!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's not a loan. It's literally called a repurchase agreement, a repo. A Loan can have varying degrees of collateralization, whereas a repo is always a 1-1 face value, with a possible haircut for the quality of the underlying bond. </p>
<p>In other words, if all banks defaulted on the repo, the FED wouldn't be worse off.</p></div>		</li>
