			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Yes it is.</p>
<p>At the time we lived there, either there were less employment protections or my parent didn't think/want to fight them on it, so when one of my parents became a single parent, out of a job and out of the house.</p>
<p>Obviously with housing market the way it is in the UK if the landowner isn't a backward dick working somewhere with tied housing could seem pretty good, but on the whole it always seemed like the employer/landowner ends up with more power over your life than they should have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having your housing depend on your employment is insane: how are you going to say no to an employer who can evict and fire you in one action?</p>
<p>It's almost as insane as having your health coverage tired to your employment: giving your employer control over not just your livelihood, but your actual life and health.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's still a relic of this in existence in UK property law called leaseholds. It mainly occurs in flats where multiple tenants share the same plot of land but you have to pay a groud rent each year.</p>
<p>It's usually a nominal fee but some people recently got burned by ground rents that were doubling every year. Last I heard the government was trying to tie up and end leaseholds...</p>
<p>edit:</p>
<p>I should say that the majority of people own property under freeholds, and own the land and building themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even in the US it's not uncommon.</p>
<p>Mobile home parks, for example. You may own the structure, but you still have to rent the lot it's placed on, usually to a for-profit company, who can jack up the rents whenever they want.</p>
<p>Also see John Oliver's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCC8fPQOaxU" target="_blank">episode on them from a couple years back.</a></p></div>		</li>
