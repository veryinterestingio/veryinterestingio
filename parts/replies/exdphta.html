			<div class="markdown"><p>Super nerdy comment here.  The crystals in younger cheeses often calcium lactate, but the crystals forming on highly aged cheeses is actually Tyrosine, an amino acid.</p>
<p>Source: I actually have a degree in cheese.  I wish I was joking.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Thanks for asking about my cheese degree!  It's more of a certification than a degree, but look up the ACS CCP (American Cheese Society Certified Cheese Professional) test and see if it's for you.  I studied for over a year while working in a cheese shop.  It's a very difficult test (I think the pass rate is something like 65%) and requires knowledge of cheese and general agricultural science, production, history, laws, geography and animal breeds.  Often test questions can't be answered without knowing all of these things at once.  Each year the ACS hosts a big cheese expo and gives the test at this expo.  I work in the restaurant industry and I use my certification pretty frequently, usually just as conversation or to settle any of the numerous nightly bar bets about cheese.</p>
<p>EDIT 2:  Just put up an AMA at your requests.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah man, I think it's been long enough, we could all use a Unidan 2.0 situation. I wanna start seeing cheese fact guy pop up in all the default subs with interesting and whimsical cheese facts. After a while, he'll ascend to near-pop-star levels of reddit fame, then we'll meet him on Ellen, Jimmy Fallon, and Eric Andre (in that order).  He'll be a bit reserved, yet witty, and with the fire of passion in his eyes when he starts rattling off cheese trivia for an adoring fanbase.</p>
<p>Months will pass, the cheese fact guy memes will make their rounds, and he'll become a permanent fixture in every frontpage thread and we'll all love him for it. But then... One day... A thread gains traction on /r/quityourbullshit. A mod from /r/terraria claims cheese guy was banned for curating multiple accounts he uses to upvote himself and reply to himself. But no! No, we cry! It can't be true! But it is. The mod posts screenshots of DMs, another mod from /r/f7u12  comes forward and admits to bribery via lavish cheese gift basket.</p>
<p>For about 18 hours, Reddit is in shambles. Why, cheese guy? You didn't need to manufacture love; giving a shit about you was the easiest upvote we could bestow in any thread. Some laugh, some cry, some rage, but most people just upvote the torrent of relevant memes.  After which 98% of us move on with our fucking lives and continue to use this site as an outlet for jokes, light discussion, and faux outrage. A few weirdos continue their pointless crusade against cheese guy while the rest of us struggle to remember what the drama even was before shrugging and scrolling to the next meme. </p>
<p>Before disappearing forever, cheese guy posts a shameful and short 2 sentence apology that is buried and forgotten under the deluge of pandas clumsily falling out of trees.</p>
<p>But in the end, we don't care. We miss our champion of cheese. We just want to exhale through our noses slightly as he fumbles his way through a Joe Rogan interview, as an obvious lackadaisical redditor. We just want to open a dumb thread about a cat getting tangled in some yarn and upvote a vaguely comical comment about certain extra-sharp cheeses triggering Scottish Folds to sneeze repeatedly.  We just want some random guy to take us by the hand and lead us all on a slightly different Reddit adventure today, but they won't. Lest they become the next Unidan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I grew up in Wisconsin and moved to New England in my late 20’s. Cabot cheese is a single candle sputtering it’s last dying breath compared to the roaring inferno of a wildfire scorching vast swaths of the earth that is the Wisconsin fromanger’s offerings. It is edible, but </p>
<p>I spend nearly $300 a year when I go to Wisconsin on vacation picking up cheeses from cheesemongers around the state and directly from a specific fromanger. Everyday in WI is started with a trip to a market for a fresh batch of curds and raw Milk. The last day while driving out of the state I stop at “The Brat Stop” for 2 wursts, a beer, and purchase the everyday Wisconsin cheeses for the family to taste. Everything from 18 year old Chedder to chocolate cheese (yes you read that correctly, chocolate cheese).</p></div>		</li>
