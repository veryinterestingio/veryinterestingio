			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard a small part is also bee keepers are used to the bees and more familiar with the stings than others would be, making them less nervous and &quot;twitchy&quot; and as such less likely to be stung. </p>
<p>Sounds like you handle / have handled bees, think there's any truth to that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely. I don't know the science (pheramons, perception, etc) but the bees absolutely pickup on your mood and intent (anthropomorphizing much?) and react to it. Like a dog almost.</p>
<p>I've gone into the hives on a hot day when I was pissed off and got stung and so did my partner haha.</p>
<p>Gone in when I was relaxed and just wanting to watch them, they didn't give me a second glance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking of pheromones, (I suppose) I think I trained a  wasp nest outside my grandma's house. A paper wasp decided to build a nest on a light fixture about head height. Only 1 wasp on it and I started fucking with it, got a broom hand and was going to knock it off, but the wasp climbed onto the end of the broom handle and looked like it was checking it out, wings flared like it was showing don't fuck with me, but still checking this new thing out that had invaded it's home &quot;zone&quot; I guess. After I pulled it away from the hive a about a foot, it flew back and continued on it's job of whatever the fuck wasps do. Ok you curious little stinging bastard... you win this one.  </p>
<p>Kept this up for a week, rubbing my had over the broom end before hoisting it up there, hoping it would learn my scent (mind you I'm like 12 at this point). 1 wasp becomes 2, then 4 then 7, eventually they didn't care that the broom handle came close. The wings didn't flare or look angry staring at it, so I pulled the handle away and I SLOWLY put a finger close to it. 3 or 4 Wasps jumped onto my hand, but didn't seem angry, they were just checking out my hand like the did the broom. Same thing, pulled my hand away, and they flew back to their hive. Never got stung once and I did this till the hive got raided by ants a month and a half later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m allergic to bees and my allergist when I was a kid gave me different breathing exercises as “homework” to learn to relax anytime I saw a bee vs being scared and running or swatting them away. To this day I’ve only been stung once since finding out about that allergy! And that was because a coworker who was terrified pushed me into a bush where it flew (just a knee jerk reaction, not attempting murder).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair point. It’s also worth noting that most people associate a wasp sting with a bee sting. They do not have the same force or pain, as a wasp stinger is large and designed for reuse, so it hurts a hell of a lot. A bee stinger is single use and smaller, making an individual sting hurt less than a flu shot unless they get you somewhere sensitive. As a result it makes it easier as a beekeeper to stay calm and focus on the hive work you’re doing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bee stingers are multiuse for other insects. Our elastic skin makes bee stingers stuck and when the bee pulls out the stinger and some internal organs remain which is why the bee later dies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same can be said for lab mice/rats, I would get bitten a lot at the start but when you have less anticipation, your movements are smoother/gentler and don’t freak them out as much when you’re jabbing their bellies full of some drug.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eventually I believe it would. I had an I structure from a bee course who actually liked to get stung on his hands because they were arthritic and he felt like the venom helped.</p>
<p>Ss for my comparatively novel experience (3 years 3 stings (only)) no haha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely, having done beekeeping work when I was younger, you desensitize a lot after a few weeks. I'd find myself looking forward to the accompanying endorphin release, even.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As former pest control I can say that the suits are preventative but not sting proof. I only dealt with wasps, as the company I worked for wouldn’t kill bees. We’d call a local keeper to bee calls. But wasps would sting me all the time through the suit. It’s just far less than if you weren’t wearing one. Plus when you’re knelt down, the legs could ride up and allow a gap between your boots and they can easily sting you that way too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like they need to design a better bee suit honestly. It can't be <em>that</em> hard to design a fabric that is tough enough that a stinger can't penetrate or thick enough that even if it's tight the stinger doesn't reach the skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bee suits are loose so the bees can't reach your skin to sting through them, but sometimes when the fabric is up against your skin, they can get you. And every once in a while they find their way INSIDE THE SUIT. Yep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a suit from Amazon, so could be that.</p>
<p>However, their little stingers are sharp and decently long. If you have a spot on the suit that might be tight (mine was the side of my ribs) they can penetrate it when it's pulled tight.</p></div>		</li>
