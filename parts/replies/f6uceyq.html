			<div class="markdown"><p>OH I KNOW ABOUT THIS! Strain gauges are super fucking cool!</p>
<p>Okay, so a strain gauge is the business end of a load cell. The way they work is, like previously mentioned, they pass electricity through a set of resistors and measure the change in voltage. Those &quot;resistors&quot; are actually just really tiny copper wires glued to the surface of the part in a grid-like pattern. As the part flexes microscopically, those copper wires are either stretched or compressed by a <strong>very</strong> tiny amount. When you stretch a wire, the cross-sectional area is reduced and when the cross-section of a wire is reduced, it's electrical resistance goes up which changes the voltage across the strain gauge. The electrical side is a bit more complicated but that's essentially how a strain gauge works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, not really. Thermocouples work by measuring the voltage difference between two dissimilar metals, which varies by temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>we had a lab based scale that had quite a few decimal places. we had to 'recalibrate' it often using set weights of known values. is this strain gauge that unreliable at lower weight values?</p>
<p>we were just told to do this, I don't know if it was really necessary</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that they're unreliable. Strain gauges <em>do</em> require periodic calibration, particularly if the strain gauge isn't designed to compensate for changes in temperature. However, if you needed accuracy to several decimal places, it's more than likely you were instructed to calibrate it often to ensure there's no zero drift.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of it is also leverage: to weigh a smaller weight with the same load cell, you place it at the end of a longer lever arm. Very sensitive scales use compound levers to increase the sensitivity even further.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are usually 4 resistors that are attached in a pattern to help measure tinier changes. If only one resistors changes by a small amount its harder to sense, but if that one small change messes up a balance of 4, it's easier to detect.</p>
<p>If I remember right, they're called wheatstone bridges</p></div>		</li>
