			<div class="markdown"><p>The Wii sensor bar is only a series of LEDs that act as a point of reference for the controller. Contrary to what its name implies, it doesn't do any sensing or data communication.</p>
<p>So given that, I think it's more accurate to say that Duck Hunt turns the screen into a temporary sensor bar by flickering to a white square on a black background when the trigger is pulled.</p>
<p>In both cases, the controller contains the actual sensors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Infrared LEDs in particular, which means in a pinch you can put a lit candle on top of your tv in place of a sensor bar and your wii will work well enough to at least navigate the menus. I've done it before, its pretty neat, tricking tech with fire feels like some kind of caveman hacker bs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The gun only has one sensor -- a light level sensor.  That's it.  A sensor bar is typically an array of sensors.</p>
<p>And whereas something like the Wii's sensor bar is used to determine positional information, the Zapper gun can't.  All it knows is if it detects a quick change from dark to light.  Back to white is a hit, anything else is a miss.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You did a good job of explaining. But one minor error. The blanking intervals occur between each field. Not just each frame. Likewise there is a blanking interval between each horizontal scan line. These blanking intervals are to blank the retraces of the CRT display. The display is scanned left to right and top to bottom with a sawtooth wave. While the retrace is fast, like ~10us in horizontal and a few hundred vertical, that retrace would be visible if the CRT beam was left on. They would be visible to the viewer and have annoying effects on the scene. So they must be blanked out. The blanking signal is embedded in the video signal as a &quot;Blacker than Black&quot; signal level. Completely cutting off the CRT beam during retrace.</p>
<p>One of the early computer video generator chips, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_6845" target="_blank">MC6845</a>, had counters for both vertical and horizontal timing. this allowed the computer to know exactly where on the screen the CRT was scanning at any given moment. These counters were used precisely for the type of use in games and light pens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I might piggy back a question that has puzzled me for some years now. In my youth I found a “bug” in the game, or possibly just my TV, but if you aimed more or less dead center of the screen it would score a hit regardless of where the ducks were. Any ideas on what caused this phenomenon?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Our whole neighborhood knew about &quot;the sweet spot&quot; and the game became irrelevant. </p>
<p>Piggy-back on a piggy-back: if I held up a blank sheet of paper, or maybe shined a flashlight into the gun, could I score hits that way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>maybe the sweet spot was where you had light reflecting off your TV, so when the screen went black with one dot, you had a second dot on accident, which you could always point at</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No idea.  I'm familiar with the <em>theory</em> of how these systems work, but have never worked on a concrete implementation.  I <em>suspect</em> it could have been a fault with your Zapper gun's photo sensor, but it's impossible to say.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Open a window or just turn on a bright overhead light. If you shoot where the reflection shows up when the TV is off it registers as a hit (assuming the light is bright enough and the screen reflects it well)...</p></div>		</li>
