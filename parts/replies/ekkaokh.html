			<div class="markdown"><p>This the best answer I've seen here.  In a &quot;healthy/normal&quot; person urine output from the kidneys is deceased through more than one mechanism.</p>
<p>The urge to &quot;go&quot; is normally suppressed by the nervous system during sleep.   I can't &quot;go&quot; until I'm fully awake. This proved to be a problem after surgery until the effects of anesthesia wore off hours later.  Common occurrence.--  I have a cousin that had to go to the ER after being sent home from outpatient surgery. --</p>
<p>You need to fully &quot;wake up&quot; to get your bladder to &quot;work&quot; /go.</p>
<p>Your 2nd to last paragraph details reasons people to wake during the night with the urge to &quot;go&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure, to be honest. Depending on the individual case, BP could be elevated enough that the RAAS never fully turns off while asleep, which would probably result in a less urine volume produced even than if it were cycling all through the night.</p>
<p>If the high BP were severe enough, then the RAAS May never turn on in the first place (or May be suppressed by medications â€” the vast majority of blood pressure meds work by preventing it from working at some step in the system) in which case, urine volume should be closer to what is produced during waking hours.</p>
<p>Lastly, if your BP is high enough that your body starts compensating the OTHER way (secreting BNP which is one of very few endogenous substances which cause you to actively get rid of water through the urine) then your volume could go up SIGNIFICANTLY.</p></div>		</li>
