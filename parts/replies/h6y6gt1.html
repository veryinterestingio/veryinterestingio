			<div class="markdown"><p>You're confusing Virgin Galactic (the pace tourism company) and Virgin Orbit (the smallsat launch company). Virgin Galactic has no interest in launching payloads to orbit, and Virgin Orbit seems quite content with their smallsat launcher.</p>
<p>Blue's New Shepard is only designed to send people on suborbital flights. Yes, New Glenn isn't doing good by any means, but you're being overwhelmingly dismissive of Blue and Virgin's progress and intended goals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I talk about virgin collectively because they are effectively two divisions of the same entity and almost certainly share a lot of production and R&amp;D between them. I also see virgin's business plan a lot more clearly than blue origins. They have a couple of niches and are doing okay in both. They are just nowhere near human orbital capability. </p>
<p>Even with new shepherd their schedule has been very underwhelming. Their lander was to expensive, they have very little production capacity, new Glenn is still theoretical, kuiper isnt even launching on their own vehicles. Maybe they will turn things around now the Jeff has resigned from Amazon, but in against pretty much all the competition they are pretty underwhelming in my eyes.</p></div>		</li>
