			<div class="markdown"><p>More often than not it stems from poverty. Itâ€™s a lot cheaper to feed a family of four with cheap high carb foods then it is to buy healthy  expensive foods. I have a 250 dollar monthly budget to feed 3 people, and a lot of that goes to cheap carb heavy foods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget working long hours doing grueling work with little to no PTO.  You get home and you have no energy to cook a decent meal or exercise. If we're being real, meals made from scratch with fresh food tends to be quite a bit cheaper unless you buy from Whole foods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't think about this, thank you. That makes a lot of sense. On a small scale I've noticed that my weekly shops when I'm trying to be healthier always end up more expensive. It's a sad thing to think about for those economically struggling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No judgement on what you're doing or how well you're doing it, good stranger- I don't know anything about you other than what you've written. I'm posting this in case you didn't know about these resources.</p>
<p>There are many great resources for eating cheap and healthy, many of them right here on Reddit:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/</a></p>
<p>The sidebar has a lot of ideas and guides from previous questions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MealPrepSunday/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/MealPrepSunday/</a></p>
<p>Meal planning and prep is an essential part of eating well without going crazy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/</a></p>
<p>That's a good place to start getting used to budgeting, sticking to it, identifying costs and reducing them, and so on.</p>
<p>Essentially it's three concepts that reinforce each other: budgeting, meal planning, and timing food purchases.</p>
<p>But if those dollars are Canuck-bucks and you live somewhere like Toronto, good luck...</p></div>		</li>
