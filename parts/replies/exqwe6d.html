<p>Our wildfires are mostly man made, though not intentional.

It's just that the serious dry conditions here mean that even a very small fire can quickly grow to massive sizes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on where you live. In my area, east bay SF, the winds have gotten weaker. A couple decades ago we had winds that actually lifted our tile roof. Luckily not blowing any off. But you could hear the tiles lifting and falling in the wind. The same wind blew over a heavy display case I had on the side of the house.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And for the contiguous USA, there has been a 75% increase is severe fires between 1984 and 2015, 55% of this change is attributed to anthropogenic climate change causing increased aridity and a longer fire season.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the 1970s, human-caused increases in temperature and
vapor pressure deficit have enhanced fuel aridity across western
continental US forests, accounting for approximately over half of
the observed increases in fuel aridity during this period. These
anthropogenic increases in fuel aridity approximately doubled
the western US forest fire area beyond that expected from natural climate variability alone during 1984–2015.</p>
