			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually it happens more often than you would think. The first stool passed is called meconium, it's black and it's tarry and it kind of protects the intestines during gestation. Late term babies may pass the meconium in the uterus, The concern when this happens is meconium aspiration, or the baby breathing in the meconium stain fluid. The meconium is sterile so we're not worried about infection, but we are worried about that closing up the baby's lungs. This is One of the reasons why we mark the color of the meconium when the baby is born.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Babies do sometimes poop in the womb. It becomes more likely the later into pregnancy you go. The problem is that amniotic fluid communicates with the fetusâ€™s lungs. When the baby first inflates his/her lungs, that fluid can be absorbed or expelled easily. Anybody who had changed a neonatal diaper will know that meconium (early baby poop) could be used to replace road tar. If that stuff gets into the lungs along with the amniotic fluid, there is a much higher risk of respiratory failure. At my hospital a post-date mom or meconium tinged amniotic fluid means the NICU team needs to be there ready to intubate. It rarely comes to that, but we also rarely have pregnancies go past 40 weeks for the reasons already discussed.</p></div>		</li>
