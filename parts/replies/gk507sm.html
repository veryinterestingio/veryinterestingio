			<div class="markdown"><p>A train - solid steel wheels on steel track - is about the best you can get as far as minimizing rolling resistance for a practical vehicle. So if you wanted to reduce the rolling resistance of a car, you'd have to make it more like the train.</p>
<p>The trouble is, solid steel wheels are nice on a steel track. They would be awful on any other surface. The ride would be terrible even on perfect asphalt, much less normal roads with lots of dirt, pavement cracks and minor potholes, etc. It would probably have severe enough vibration to break things at any decent speed. And there would be virtually no traction for turning or stopping quickly. Things only get worse if you add in rain, snow, ice, mud, etc.</p>
<p>Any more moderate attempt to reduce rolling resistance would have the same flaws in a more moderate way. You could make the tires harder, but at the price of worse traction and ride. Interestingly, race car tires often go the other way - softer tires for more traction at the expense of higher rolling resistance and faster wear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How is the last bit interesting? Rolling resistance is grip and whats keeping you on the road, which.. is kind of what you need in <em>all</em> forms of racing.  </p>
<p>Using the term &quot;rolling resistance&quot; makes it sound like a bad thing, but no rolling resistance essentially means youre sliding, which is something nobody should want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The loss isn't due to energy transfer or vibration. It's due to friction generated by the tire flexing under the car's weight (which results in heat, it's why tires get hot as you drive). Higher pressure, or stiffer tires, reduces that flex and lowers rolling resistance.</p>
<p>There are low rolling resistance tires. Goodyear FuelMax, Bridgestone Ecopia, etc. Usually see them on hybrids.</p>
<p>Problem is that grip and rolling resistance are related. The lower your resistance, the lower your grip, and at some point there's not enough to be safe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a bike guy, I'll also had that lighter more flexible sidewalls can also reduce rolling losses. Obviously there are trade offs in terms of durability. There is a current trend towards moving to larger lighter tires ran at a lower pressure which solve many of the problems have been mentioned (comfort, grip, etc...) This approach is said to work well. The obvious trade-off is the durability of the sidewall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And this is why it takes a 500HP supercar to drive 200mph, but it takes a <strong>1500HP</strong> supercar to drive 300mph.</p>
<p>(Not actual stats/math, just generalizing).</p>
<p>I always found it fascinating how the engineering behind cars became absolutely insane as they tried to improve top speed, even by small amounts.  The Veyron, for example, has <strong>TEN</strong> radiators to keep everything at the proper temp.  And that engineering is already approaching 2 decades old.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a decent approximation, but the complete answer (as always) is a slightly more complicated one.</p>
<p>At low speeds, the exponent of velocity in drag equation approximates one. That is, as the speed increases from zero to some low number, the drag initially increases in a linear manner. This continues through the <em>laminar flow</em> regime.</p>
<p>However, depending on the viscosity of the fluid, and the shape and size of the object, at some point the flow starts to become <em>turbulent</em>, and after that point the drag equation's exponent pretty sharply jumps to two. After that point, it's a good approximation to say that drag increases with the square of velocity. This continues to be a decent approximation until you start hitting compressibility effects at high Mach numbers (flow velocity reaches speed of sound), at which point drag increases dramatically due to shockwave formation. At subsonic, supersonic, and hypersonic regimes, different models are required.</p>
<p>So if you wanted to model drag with a single equation, rather than changing the equation for different regimes of velocity, the exponent of the equation would need to contain some kind of a function that jumps from approximately 1 to approximately 2 in a swift but continuous manner, around the velocity where that specific size/shape/fluid switches from laminar to turbulent flow. Then when speed approaches the critical Mach number for that specific shape, the drag shoots up, then comes back down a bit at supersonic regime, and hypersonic regime I can't say anything specific about because it's highly dependent on the shape of the object.</p>
<p>But, fluid dynamics is an impressively complicated portion of physics and a good approximation is usually &quot;good enough&quot; for vast amount of applications. And, since the drag coefficient is calculated with an empirically determined drag coefficient figure, the equation <strong><em>F_drag</em></strong> = -k *<strong>v**</strong>²<em>  usually gives respectably good results for a specific velocity regime. In this simplified example, </em>k* represents a constant that contains all the variables for fluid characteristics like viscosity and density, object's cross-section area, and the object's shape coefficient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Drag =/= power needed to overcome the drag.</p>
<p>In the case of drag generated by air pressure<br />
Drag is proportional to the square of speed.<br />
The power needed is proportional to the <strong>cube of speed</strong></p>
<p>We know that</p>
<p>P = W/∆t = (F · ∆s)/∆t = F · v</p>
<p>Where F is the air pressure drag in our case, and we already know that</p>
<p>F ∝ v^(2)</p>
<p>therefore</p>
<p>P ∝ v^(3)  </p>
