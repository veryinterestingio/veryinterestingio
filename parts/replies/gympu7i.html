<p>astronomers in France and England resolved that they would collect the necessary data during the 1761 transit. Although not all observers were successful </p>

<p>There's a TIL about an astronomer who went to india to watch the transit, missed it, stayed for a second one, missed that, then went home.  And found he'd been declared dead and his wife remarried.</p>
<p>Was that the same incident as the Halley measurements?</p></div>		</li>

<p>That would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillaume_Le_Gentil" target="_blank">Guillaume Le Gentil</a>, and yeah, it's the same measurements.</p>
<p>In 1761, he was <em>just</em> too late arriving in India; because the British had taken over the port of Pondicherry, they were forced to remain at sea and the motion was too much for his sensitive apparatus to get any readings. Having already travelled for about fifteen months to get from France to India, he decided to stay, despite the fact that the next transit of Venus was eight years away. (The <em>next</em> one was more than a century after that, so it really was his only chance to see it.) He built a dope-ass observatory, and when the day finally came... it was cloudy, and he saw nothing.</p>
<p>Bad show all round, really.</p></div>		</li>
