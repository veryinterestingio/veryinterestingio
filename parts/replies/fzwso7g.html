			<div class="markdown"><p>there's a bunch of old games which didn't have speed limiters and just ran at whatever speed it could eke from the hardware.</p>
<p>Makes emulating them loads of fun, since modern stuff will give you about a hundredth of a second before the five thousand cycles where you didn't put input in mean you've crashed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main different is update timers, not speed limits. Modern game engines tell the developer how much time has passed since last frame and the developer can then adjust the player motion. So when your game now runs at 5000 fps instead of 50, the player only moved 1/100th of the distance.</p>
<p>The inverse can actually cause issues, as at lower framerate the player movement per frame gets soo large the physics start to break down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is why space engineers even has a world you can start on of 2 ships that you can easily collide. Red ship meets blue ship at max speed at odd angle to make the game freeze and maybe crash. Idk i haven't played it in years but I do recall the ship crashes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The limit is still there, however there are mods to increase it. As far as I know, stuff mostly works even when you up the limit. Not sure if that hold in multiplayer.</p></div>		</li>
