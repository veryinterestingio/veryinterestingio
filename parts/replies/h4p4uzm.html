			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have access to a commercial grade fryer you can see this effect for yourself and often will by accident.   If you drop a small but reasonable amount of ice or water into the fryer it will sink, then boil.   Then the oil in the fryer curns and spits.  Most people who don't understand what's going on think the fryer went crazy or is broken.  If you've seen it you can imagine how much worse it would be if the oil was on fire or if you used too much water.</p>
<p>I do NOT recommend doing this as an actual experiment.  But it is something that happens from time to time when cooks throw in food that's got a signficant amount of frost on it, or spill a drink that they are not supposed to have in the kitchen for this among other reasons.</p>
<p>I also strongly recommend you not have water anywhere near any kind of open flame home fryer for this exact reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome answer! I knew that the water boiled and splashes the oil but I didn't realize the full effect (oil less dense than water + hydrophobic).</p></div>		</li>
