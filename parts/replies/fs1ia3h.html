			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably for a a basic understanding of actual dinosaur numbers. I suppose at this level we would need to ask what the OP meant by dinosaurs if we were interested in simply numbers. There are of course strict definitions but in the common lexicon people probably consider things like Plesiosaurs and Pterosaurs dinosaurs as well, despite them being something different. But omitting them, herbivores would probably make up something like 90% of all actual dinosaur numbers. Still though, 10% is significant. Those figures are just theoretical of course.</p>
<p>Still, it feels like it’d be a pretty futile effort. We have no way to guess the plant biomass from that era that I am aware of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're thinking of large apex carnivores. For every lion, there are dozens of hyenas. There are plenty of rat-sized carnivores in the biomass.
For dinosaurs, there may have been several dog-sized carnivores. Real velociraptors were the size of turkeys, so there could have been a lot of them.
It's possible that fossilization favors larger bones, so the fossil record might underrepresent smaller dinosaurs, and maybe there were a ton of smaller dinosaurs we don't know about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True but just from the efficiency of predation the assumption holds regardless of size of the carnivore - if it takes 10lbs of meat to support 1lb of predator then there will (approximately) be 10x as much herbivore in the system as carnivore (ignoring the effect of carnivores who only prey on other carnivores etc) whether that carnivore comes in the form of 1,000 turkey-raptors or 1 t-rex</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many of the smaller predatory dinosaurs were probably eating insects, amphibians, fish, small reptiles and mammals, so there's plenty of scope for their numbers being higher than could be supported by merely preying on herbivorous dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Things like shrews, hedgehogs, small cats, most lizards etc etc are predatory to a greater or lesser degree, and they are highly abundant, though with little biomass individually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe focusing on herbivores is generally just a simpler avenue because it can scale up with plant biomass and their deaths tend to support smaller insects and the like that smaller predators would feed on. So their place in the food chain is like a pillar of support to get an idea for the total energy that could be in a given ecosystem since their energy would supply much of the energy to even the smaller predators.  </p>
<p>It’s also a lot more difficult to try and determine small predator numbers since they are often omnivorous. It’s just the best we can do when trying to ballpark a figure.</p></div>		</li>
