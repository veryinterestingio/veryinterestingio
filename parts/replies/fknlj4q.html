			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer. A lot of people have an esophagus that is pushed against the posterior side of their heart. Some people actually get palpitations while eating cold food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the good part of it is that while it is not pleasant, it likely wonâ€™t ever be a health risk. The reason is that it is the left atrium of the heart, and the palpitations, while annoying, are not generally dangerous. They just may cause you to curse out Ben and/ or Jerry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't consciously have awareness of those sensations affecting the colon mucosa is all that I wanted to add. It's ELI5 and I thought it would be a fun tidbit to throw in. You definitely do not feel the clamp tearing a polyp away, or the snare cauterizing one off. Nor do you feel that spicy meal in the sense that it's uncomfortably spicy in the traditional sense as it works its way through your bowels, even if your body may be irritated by it and cause other symptoms.</p>
<p>Thanks for the addition in any case, though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have definitely felt the spicy coming out my back end, and anything sandy, even on the inner part of my anus and I think people confuse the 3 parts of the colon with rectum and anus. You would feel it on the inner and outer part of the anus, but the anus does not get polyps, only stretched, along with rectum; rectum can have polyps though. Just to clarify.</p></div>		</li>
