			<div class="markdown"><p>are there different levels of saltiness (salinity?), that is.... we have a lake that is not salty and we have ocean that is salty...</p>
<p>would the mediteranian sea be less salty than say the pacific ocean?  </p>
<p>also what's up with the dead sea?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. TIL. This is interesting. But the follow up questions are: why is the mediterranean sea saltier? Why are the oceans near the poles less so?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ptonably not the right answer but salinity can vary locally in the ocean, the dead sea used to be a part of multiplearger bodies of water, how ever the dead sea is stupid low (below sea level) so salty water from numerous sources flowed there and dropped its salt before evaporating. Ans since its already a small (copared to the areas historic volume) body of water the salt content eill be higher. </p>
<p>But im probably wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and water that is somewhat salty but not as salty as the ocean is called brackish. This can be found in or near the mouths of rivers feeding into the ocean, or in lakes with little or no drainage that haven't accumulated enough salt to become saline. The Baltic and Black Seas are brackish due to the large amount of fresh water flowing into them, and limited in flow from more saline oceans.</p>
<p>Water much saltier than seawater is called brine. The most saline lakes like the Dead Sea have this.</p></div>		</li>
