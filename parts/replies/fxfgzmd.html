			<div class="markdown"><p>More baking soda will likely make them flatter and make them brown more.   </p>
<p>You could add baking powder. But as another comment said, chilling the dough down is a big thing - some recipes call for an overnight stint in the fridge.  </p>
<p>Personally, I freeze cookie dough. You roll it into balls or pucks and freeze on a cookie sheet, then shove them in a freezer bag. Then you can cook them straight from frozen - they just need to spend a bit more time in the oven... and for an added bonus, they're less likely to flatten out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course. That's why I underlined the need for &quot;extra&quot; raising agents. Cakes made with egg whites as the only rising agent are extremely rare and fragile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Baking powder is powdered baking soda and a powdered acid, usually cream of tartar. You can add water to baking powder and it'll fizz. It's the same thing as adding baking soda and vinegar together. The fizzing causes CO2 bubbles to form in whatever you're baking. Kind of like yeast.</p>
<p>Cream of tartar is a powdered acid that is a natural byproduct of wine making. You can add it to egg whites to get them to stiffen better when you whip them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a rule of thumb, or some calculation to estimate the yolk to whites ratio to achieve certain consistencies?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on mostly the water proportion  and temperature of the egg white. If the egg is fresh it has more water. If it's old, some water evaporates through the shell and the properties change.  That's why most bakers use fresh egg, because they get a consistent protein to water ratio.</p>
<p>Every recipe uses a certain ratio of wet mass to dry mass, and a certain ratio of yolk to whites.</p>
<p>Most recipes use something like &quot;5 whites, 3 yolks&quot;  , but this is wrong. If you want higher precision go for using separate scales for yolk and whites. <strong>Weigh them in grams</strong> (mass) and <strong>not volume</strong> (liter/cups/etc) when combining stuff for greater consistency. Even this is imperfect , because the protein-to-water ratio will change with evaporation, but you will be much more consistent with the actual end-result.  So recipes should read <strong>150g fresh egg whites</strong>, <strong>57 g fresh yolk</strong></p>
<p>Then there's the question of the actual composition of the egg based on the animal it comes from. A quail egg is different from a hen egg and different from a duck or ostrich egg.  It's just a matter of experimentation after a point.</p>
<p>Then you go for the actual food that was used on the hen or ducks. The rabbit hole is endless. The top bakers generally go for this amount of detail, getting eggs only from certain farms, which feed chicks with a certain feed etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! </p>
<p>I follow lots of recipes, but don't feel like I really understand what I'm doing when it comes to certain ingredients like egg white/yolk content. I don't plan on becoming a real chef, but it would be nice to create or tweak certain recipes by better understanding details like this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So, bottom line: want fluff or solid, use whites . Want homogenous mixture, use yolk, want both at the same rate ? you can't without external help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>??? That's exactly why we seperate eggs, mash the yolks together with the rest of the stuff until all is finished, then beat the egg up to the max, then carefully fold the bubbles into the other stuff and then bake it.</p>
<p>It's entirely possible.</p></div>		</li>
