			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to be rude but your post sounds like confirmation bias. It reads like because the home study didn't tell you what you wanted to hear, that made it &quot;worthless&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what you’re looking for. </p>
<p>For 99% of cases, if you’re doing an at home sleep test, you’re trying to see whether or not you have obstructive/possibly neurological sleep apnea. </p>
<p>Those results are sent to a polysomnographer (someone who is trained to read the data of a sleep study), and a report is sent out with your statistics. From that, the clinician can make a reasonably accurate guess as to what was going on.</p>
<p>For me, it turned out I did not have obstructive sleep apnea, but neurological sleep apnea (ie something in my brain was telling my body to stop breathing a few times an hour). </p>
<p>But we tried the cpap anyway, and it helped.</p>
<p>The at home test is faster, cheaper, and less cumbersome, but obviously at a cost of potentially missing something, because you don’t literally have electrodes glued to your head.</p>
<p>But for 99% of us, it’s fine.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly true. If you can’t sleep deeply you won’t have apneas. This Is what prevented me getting a diagnosis when I should’ve had one over 10 years before I finally started treatment. Some of the sleep clinics are a complete joke</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a sleep study done some years ago because I was constantly waking up all night, felt like shit all day, and I have some relatives with sleep apnea so I figured maybe I have it too.  I ended up having the best night of sleep in a very long time.  When I went for the results the doc was just &quot;why are we doing this study?  You slept like a baby, literally.  Adults aren't supposed to have alpha sleep, and yet you do.  And you sleep really really deep.&quot;</p>
<p>In the end, I decided I just needed to change some things about my sleeping environment, like turning the temp down a bit, and getting new downstairs neighbors.</p></div>		</li>
