<p>Yes, the blades are designed to push the air in a specific direction, making this 'beam' of wind. Were you to run the fan in reverse, the air pushed from the back would likely be dispersed because the blades are not designed to work backward.</p>
<p>No, you cannot design a fan to suck air in a beam because of how fluids (air is a fluid too) work. The way a fan works is it pushes the air forward, creating a low-pressure zone that the air all around the fan tries to fill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it wouldn't. It's because the air in the back isn't being moved as directly as the front. </p>
<p>The fan moves the close air through the blades which reduces the pressure. This causes air to move into the lower pressure zone causing another lower pressure zone. The air moves into the lower pressure areas from all around which causes the more dispersed movement.</p>
<p>The air in front of the fan has been pushed in a specific direction so is not as dispersed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with fans not sucking air at all.  Fans push air out the front, which makes it go in one general direction, but the air coming in the back isn't sucked in, it's pushed in by the surrounding atmosphere, which means it comes from all directions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that what sucking means? Moving air and let the surrounding fluid pressure fill the gap?</p></div>		</li>
