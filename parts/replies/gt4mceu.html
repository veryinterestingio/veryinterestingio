			<div class="markdown"><p>I had bad issues where I'd get nervous going for a general check up or driving to the city and I'd get the runs really bad; lately tho I've been being more calm and doing calming exercises before doing either and it's improved significantly. I still go before heading out because I shit A LOT  and I don't want to have to go while in the car but it's more solid now. Sorry for all the info, this has helped me understand tho</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They only work somewhat. I think it depends on how badly intolerant you are. I can't eat a slice of pizza with it... I still will get diarrhea. But if it's a small amount of cheese in something it could work</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm lactose intolerant, risk &amp; reward but..I have 0 issues with some cheeses. </p>
<p>Like, aged &amp; hard cheeses are usually fine bc the lactose is broken down more over time (hence the aged thing) </p>
<p>Just look up low lactose cheeses and stay away from the soft ones! </p>
<p>Although I suppose this really depends on the severity of your intolerance, so take this all with a grain of salt.</p></div>		</li>
