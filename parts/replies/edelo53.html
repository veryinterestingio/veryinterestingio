			<div class="markdown"><p>Medicine can be poisonous to our body if there is too much of it or if it stays in us for too long. One reason this isn't a problem for us is that our body 'metabolises' or inactivates the medicine so it doesn't become poisonous. Our body does this using molecules called enzymes. </p>
<p>There are molecules found in Grapefruit juice which kill the enzymes inside us so they can't inactivate the medicine. So the medicine can be dangerous again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Grapefruit contains chemicals that affect some drugs. The chemical (bergamottin) which is in grapefruit is one of those chemicals. Depending on the drug, bergamottin can make the drug more powerful or lessen the drug's power. Simple solution. Ask your prescriber if you should stay away from grapefruit while taking certain drugs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have known of the dangers forever but I couldn’t tell you how. I’ve certainly never been told by anybody in a medical profession in my 48 years. The knowledge persist like a rumour to the point many would think of it as an old wive’s tale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, lots of info here. I'd add what others are calling P450 or CYP450 is more accurately abbreviated as what you're using here &quot;CYP3A4&quot; according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4</a></p>
<p>Your fun fact is reminiscent of this guy: <a href="https://bristlesbabbles.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/dvd_snapshot_06-21_2015-01-02_13-53-22.jpg" target="_blank">https://bristlesbabbles.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/dvd_snapshot_06-21_2015-01-02_13-53-22.jpg</a> :)</p>
<p>The one thing I'm left wondering is, which substances are effectively &quot;disabled&quot; and which are &quot;sustained&quot; in the blood. You say it is basically 50/50 among popular drugs but I wonder how things are scientifically/officially classified in their reaction to CYP3A4.</p></div>		</li>
