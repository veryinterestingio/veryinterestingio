			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, so potentially unhelpful.  Lots of comparative genomics on hardiness (eg <a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsec/article/96/5/fiaa057/5821278" target="_blank"><a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsec/article/96/5/fiaa057/5821278" target="_blank">https://academic.oup.com/femsec/article/96/5/fiaa057/5821278</a></a>), but not a <em>whole</em> lot else.  I'm sure MBGD would have something, but I don't have the wherewithal to attack that problem right now.</p>
<p>I agree, this would be an interesting study.  Also curious if bog-based bugs (or related methanogens) would show similar traits.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello! So I personally am not engaged in this aspect, but my <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=0RlP5DQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">co-author</a> and project <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TTPn29MAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">collaborator</a> are. They are both really at the forefront of their fields, and Arwyn just published a new manuscript on genomics.</p></div>		</li>
