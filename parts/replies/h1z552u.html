			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify: CJD and variant CJD are similar, but different things.</p>
<p>Regular CJD is a prion disease, but it's thought to be idiopathic, that is, it &quot;just happens&quot; to people, probably for a combination of genetic and environmental reasons. It is inherent to humans, no relation to cows. It can also be transmitted by things like dura mater grafts or neurosurgery tools from a person with CJD to one without it, but that's pretty excessively rare both because of how rare CJD itself is at baseline (about 1 in a million/year), and all the precautionary measures we have learned to take. Still, in the US, this is the one we typically deal with if we're dealing with prions at all. You can imagine that in a city of 4 million, there'll be something like 4 cases/year, and probably not all of those will be successfully diagnosed prior to death. Maybe 350 cases/year across the whole US.</p>
<p>Variant CJD is the one that is caused by infectious transmission of mad cow prions. There have only been something like 4 cases of this in the US ever, and all of them originated from people who contracted it overseas. In the entire world, there have only been something like 250 cases of variant CJD, the overwhelming majority of them in Britain. The human cases peaked in the early 2000's, and are now extremely rare (like maybe 1 every other year, in the entire world). There is some speculation that there may be a second wave of variant CJD coming at some point, as some people are more genetically vulnerable to it than others. The severely vulnerable people have already gotten it, but maybe the moderately vulnerable are just still in their incubation period. We don't really know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The US has identified 6 bovine cases in the US and 20 in Canada (only 6 of which occurred after feed changes were mandated in '97).</p>
<p>CJD occurs at a rate of about 1-1.5 per 1 million people (a bit more lately) or about 500 cases a year in the US.</p>
<p>All data from published CDC figures.</p>
<p>For some context, lightning hits about 1 person for every 1 million in the US so you are very slightly more likely to have CJD than be struck by lightning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Where I live if a sheep has scrapie (a prion disease) all of the sheep in the region are culled and their bodies burnt. It is then forbidden to keep sheep in the area for a decade.</p>
<p>This costs the farmers millions of dollars but its better than losing every sheep on the island.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Prions are extremely resistant to heat and a lot of commonly used desinfectants. Other prion like proteins like alpha synuclein from Parkinsons disease alsoseem to be very heat resistant. You have to use high temperatures with high pressure or very alkaline solutions to get rid of that stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This presents an issue for states where chronic wasting disease is an issue. CWD is a cervid disease caused by misfolded prions. A lot of cwd positive deer get hit by cars and trucks due to the disease causing loss of cognitive function. But circling back to your point, some states/localities are having issues disposing of roadkill that may be cwd positive because they lack the incinerators that can reach high enough temps to kill the prions. You also don’t want to transport a potential cwd positive deer too far and inadvertently aid the spread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Prions are my biggest fear in life.. I hunt a lot of deer and they are always tested for CWD and I have never eaten beef from the period and area where prions were big, but I still fear it. Prions are misfolded proteins that in some way or another interact with other prion proteins and cause them to misfold, which causes a cascading affect. They are not alive and there is no classical defenses our body has to fight them like we do for viruses, toxins, or microorganisms. In fact, some studies show the bodies reaction to misfolded prions in the brain may actually make it worse and cause nerve damage to ourselves. Prions are not even close to being destroyed in standard laboratory/medical autoclaves which run around 121c for \~30min. Prions may take nearly 500c for hours before becoming denatured enough to no longer be infectious. No amount of cooking will save you and once the disease is caught it is universally fatal and a horrible way to die.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>You may be confusing burning temperatures (500C) with autoclave temperatures.  Pressurized steam is much more effective than non-pressurized dry heat at inactivating pathogens (even prions), even at lower temperatures. </p>
<p>You're correct that standard autoclaving is not sufficient for prions, but there's some decent evidence out there that running an autoclave at 134C for 18 minutes on a porous load/prevacuum cycle (as opposed to the standard &quot;gravity displacement&quot; cycle) does an acceptable job of inactivating most prions (&gt;99.99% inactivated). Even more so if you run it for longer, or immerse the tools in concentrated sodium hydroxide or bleach for an hour prior to autoclaving, though those chemicals unfortunately are caustic and can damage stainless steel tools. Most neurosurgeons also place their used tools in a water or disinfectant bath, because it's been demonstrated that dried on prions are more resistant.</p>

<p>How would the body's reaction make it worse? I assume the spread rate would remain unchanged, so would it just be increased cell damage?</p></div>		</li>
