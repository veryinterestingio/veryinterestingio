			<div class="markdown"><p>Coronaviruses certainly are well known for viruses, but as you say there have been decades of unmotivated research into not only human ones, but also animal ones (that have significant economic impact on livestock species).</p>
<p>Said research has had a poor track record of producing workable vaccines. The hope is that said unmotivated research does not reflect some intrinsic intractability in vaccine design. The fear is that it does.</p>
<p>Hopefully the newfound motivation, and novel techniques will end up making the difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thats interesting, because I think the phase 2 trials have had overwhelming success in achieving antibodies and t-cells.  we do phase 3 trials for a reason of course, but hopefully it affirms what Phase 2 showed us and confirms that its safe.</p>
<p>what has been the hurdle for the animal vaccines?</p>
<p>The only thing we dont know about the vaccines is how long the immunity lasts.  Hopefully that hasnt been the weakness (though even if it was, that may just mean we need to vaccinate frequently until the strain dies out)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Production of antibodies and t-cells doesn't necessarily translate to immunity from the disease. This is the fear with the phase 3 trials - that people will still be susceptible to the virus after taking the vaccine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The big hurdle is just low efficacy despite producing immune response. A common problem with all vaccine development.</p>
<p>We really take vaccines for-granted. Because of their remarkable capability when they work. We tend to forget about all the failure along the way.</p></div>		</li>
