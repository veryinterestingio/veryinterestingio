			<div class="markdown"><p>No, blood is traveling fastest in the aorta.  As the it branches to smaller and smaller arteries it slows down a lot.  This is because the total cross sectional area increases.  It should be at its slowest when moving through the individual capilaries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ultrasound doesn't give an accurate measure of blood velocity though. I have a PhD in modelling blood flow so can say this with some authority and what's measured by ultrasound is limited by a number of factors, not least the field of view and the resolution of the scanner. </p>
<p>To answer OP, in a healthy body the maximum velocities are in the heart and outside of that in the ascending aorta and at peek systole (or actually just after) you can get ~500 cm/s at the center of the tricuspid valve. Due to vessel compliance, your flow becomes more less pulsatile so this is where you'll see the peek velocities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacking this topic to ask something I've always wanted to know. Is your pulse the result of your blood creating a wave/surge in your bloodstream after the heart pumps it out, or is it that the whole bloodstream swells each time the heart pumps and creates pressure? Or is it entirely something else? This question moreso came after wondering how long after the heart stops that you would feel a pulse in a deceased person. If it was a wave, you might get a couple pulses, but if the whole bloodstream swells in unison then pulse would stop the moment the heart did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you kinda have it. Blood vessels have a mix of elastin and collagen, and are very strechy. The ascending aorta for example is sometimes called the 5th chamber of the heart because of its compliance. When the heart pumps, the pressure energy is stored by this compliance. This creates almost steady flow at the capillary level. </p>
<p>People who smoke, drink excessively or who are old tend to have stiffer blood vessels, and this causes the pressure energy to not be absorbed, leading to hypertension, essentially much higher pulse pressure. Your heart has to work much harder.</p>
<p>Edit: should add, there is a whole area of research on what's called pulse wave velocity that has a strong correlation to stiff vessels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming this is all talking about arteries?  How does it change on the return trip in veins given the existence of valves and use of muscle movements to facilitate blood and fluid flows back out of tissues?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. Basically after the capillary level all the pressure is gone so veins can be much thinner.</p></div>		</li>
