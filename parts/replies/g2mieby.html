<p>a lot of the green technologies are location-dependent</p>

<p>There's some truth to that.  But looking at the US, perhaps not as much as you'd think.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/gis/assets/images/wtk-100m-2017-01.jpg" target="_blank">check out</a> the map for wind.  The darker the blue, the better the wind resource.  Looking at the coasts, you can see a lot of dark blue right offshore.  And in the center part of the country (Montana -&gt; Texas) there's huge swaths of dark blue.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wjct/files/styles/x_large/public/201502/national_photovoltaic_2012-01.jpg" target="_blank">here's the solar map</a>.  The whole southwest is drenched in the stuff.</p>
<p>Then look at <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/styles/borealis_photo_gallery_large_respondxl/public/NPD_Map_20131205_0.jpg?itok=OzAE9IOP" target="_blank">hydro</a>.  It's sprinkled all across the country.</p>
<p>If you were to lay these 3 charts on top of each other, it would account for a lot of the US.  For the areas that are a bit weak, you build powerlines to transfer electricity.</p>
<p>Location does matter.  But in a lot of places it's not an insurmountable problems.  It's raining soup, all we need to do is start building buckets to catch it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It misses the cost factor. Here on Long Island, NY our electric prices are super expensive. Solar can provide half the power that it would in the south and still be more cost effective because our electricity is more than twice the price. Coupled with our decent rebates rooftop solar is really booming here.</p>
<p>Wind has a big problem with zoning, here it's essentially impossible to install wind even though we have great wind resources. Nobody wants it near their home. So we are stuck with offshore solar, and per your map, we have some of the best offshore wind in the country. We are installing it now.</p>
<p>Which gets to the other side of the problem. Big projects take lots of time. The reason the coal plants don't shut down overnight and get replaced by wind immediately is really because it takes a decade to make a large wind farm. Wind is now cheaper, so they can start building, it's going to be another decade before it's really a large source for everyone, and the fossil fuel places will shut down after a couple of non-profitable years</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oh?  I know we've been struggling to get offshore wind underway, but my understanding is that solar/wind projects can go from start to finish in about 18 months.</p>
<p>Maybe my information is anecdotal or out of date, so if you've got a better or more general source, please share.</p>
<p>Googling just now turned up <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/supersized-solar-farms-are-sprouting-around-world-maybe-space-too-ncna901666" target="_blank">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Governments have wised up,” says Attia. “They just want the cheapest, fastest way to add new electricity supplies. For nuclear, procurement can take a decade. For gas, it’s up to four years. If you’re talking solar and things go smoothly, you can build a reasonably large project in 18 months.”</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You also have to deal with all the &quot;not in my backyard&quot; which leads to delays and increased expense from lawsuits. There are people who say windmills create low frequency noise that may be dangerous to humans (not saying I agree, but there are literally windmills that have been shut down due to lawsuits over it). And don't get me started on power lines. No one wants to have new lines put up around their property, and you better hope you don't have to go through any things like national parks or forests. Even solar farms run into trouble because certain people argue that they are in inefficient use of land, or they just don't like looking at them.</p>
<p>So even if you have the perfect spot for something, there may not be the ability to actually get it done.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's always been the case.  No one wants a coal plant or a nuke in their backyard either.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately the &quot;perfect spot&quot; for wind may not be well located with where the power is needed.  In fact, sometimes it's out in the middle of absolutely nowhere.  West Texas has oodles of wind power, but (last I heard) they can't built any more out there.  Not because they've used up all the good sites.  They've just maxed out their ability to transport it.</p>
<p>I did read something amusing about power lines the other day.  Someone was proposing stringing them through pipelines that either don't get completed or get shut down as oil use declines.  There are some practical considerations that argue against it, but they do already own the right of way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing that people don't realize about solar is that there isn't an enormous difference between good and poor solar sites and most times the two are just on the opposites side of a mountain.  Sure, Olympia is only about half as good as Yuma but that's literally the difference between the very best and the very worst in the contiguous US.  Meanwhile, if you are Puget Sound Energy, why build a solar field in Thurston County when the same field 100 miles away in Yakima County would deliver 30% more power with less maintenance?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Solar is even a good choice for so-called &quot;brown sites.&quot;</p>
<p>Sites that are too toxic for other uses (say: building a middle school) can work just fine for solar/wind farms.  And you can often pick the land up cheap.  Former coal plants are a good choice since they often already have transmission lines.</p>
<p>Given how fast the cost of panels have <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Global-solar-panel-cost-trend-1976-2016-Source-Mints-P-Solar-PV-profits-last_fig2_325984522" target="_blank">dropped</a> (from ~$68.61 in 1976 to $0.40 in 2019), cutting some of the other costs has become proportionally more important.</p></div>		</li>
