			<div class="markdown"><p>If you ever watch the YouTube channel Let's Game it Out (which you should cuz it's hilarious), the dude very frequently finds glitches and exploits by pushing the game engine to extremes until something breaks. It's interesting to see him play a game and go &quot;hmmmm, this object moves me very slightly when I use it, I wonder if I just...&quot; and then 5 minutes later he's falling out of the map and has to reload or crashes the game client lol. He's definitely got a knack for knowing what little quirks to look for</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the Play, Watch, Listen podcast they were actually talking a lot about gaming QA in their latest podcast and it was brought up how valuable certain people are who have a knack in knowing how to consistently break games. Helps find significant amount of bugs and issues in designs more so than brute forcing at times because they understand some levels of game design/programming. </p>
<p>Also to anybody who likes games in general, listen to Play, Watch, Listen it’s absolutely wonderful and really great insight into the gaming industry from multiple perspectives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a DAU, dumbest assumable user. What is perfectly logical to a developer is not necessarily for a user. Especially not one who has no experience with the product. If I can't find a button or understand the terminology, others won't either.</p>
<p>Also, stability testing. For a while I got sicc'd at a small company's new releases. &quot;Install that and make it run&quot; on different computers. I have no clue why but I break everything (not games, mostly utility software) in unexpected ways. I crash download servers just by looking at them funny.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A notable portion of my closest friends are people that either actively work as videogame QA or has worked as such in the past (including my self - was QA for a couple of years, working as a level/content designer now).</p>
<p>It's really common for us to discuss random bugs in some new games that we just started playing on our free times for fun. When playing something in coop, it's a common occurrence to just stop progressing in a game to see if we can break the physics engine or whatever. Even when just playing alone and enjoying some single player game, I sometimes realize that I've spent ages just trying to break some part of the game for no real reason at all. :D</p>
<p>Having some programming experience really helps as it gives more insight to how the game might actually work, and helps making an educated guess on what's causing a certain bug. If you can figure out what kind of a programming failure causes a bug, it's a lot easier to reproduce the same or similar bug in different context - leading to possible bug exploits in some completely different area of the game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's game it out and spiff are great examples but work in different ways. Josh pushes the game's physical limits  to see what happens whereas spiff plays with the game mechanics to see what exploits can be found. Both make for amazing entertainment and I have been brought to tears laughing. Haven't heard of Ymfah, what do they do?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's often brute force but not random, just brute force done by people who think of the game as a set of instructions, rather than a game. A normal person might see a bug, but a savvier person might get an insight in how the game is programmed and where that programming is most vulnerable.</p>
<p>For example, a normal person sees 100 gold pieces leave their Skyrim wallet and get added to the merchant's gold total, and instinctively, they think those 100 gold pieces are the same entities. But in game terms, those gold pieces are two different operations, one to add, one to substract. Someone looking for an exploit sees that as an opportunity, what if the two operations could be separated. That's how most item dupes work.</p>
<p>The craziest to me are the really hardcore Ocarina of Time exploits where people have gotten really deep in how weirdly programmed that game is, and how the code can be manipulated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. Stale Reference Manipulation in Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask is just one of the wildest things. Players essentially found a way (completely by accident) to use character inputs to perform a direct injection into memory. The possible applications are just wild.</p></div>		</li>

I follow a couple runners on twitch now and they'll just spend hours looking for ways to exploit a bug in a new area. They also know drop chances for items. That community is crazy focused.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We played that game for weeks and honest to fucking god skipped like 35 boards and blamo in a fight with the witch. </p>
<p>Blew my fucking mind. </p>

<p>Was it was a lot more common in the 70's/80's than the 90's in the English language treating video games as an extension of board games? Or maybe it was a country/language thing, somewhere other than in North America or in English?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I found a way to skip a mandatory boss (or maybe mini-boss, depending on how you look at it) fight in Metroid Prime: Hunters. Unfortunately it was slower than just fighting the boss.</p>
<p>It was so long ago that I have forgotten exactly how I found it, but I think it mostly involved piecing together tricks that other people had already found. The one thing I remember that I definitely contributed myself was the rocket jump. As far as I'm aware, I was the first person to try rocket jumping in Metroid Prime: Hunters. I always loved the idea of rocket jumping and wanted to see if it would work. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFenUPFktTA" target="_blank">Here's my shitty recording.</a></p></div>		</li>
