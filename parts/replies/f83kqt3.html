			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not really a calculation. It is &quot;if we use some tools that work well here in a situation that is completely different, and if there are no new particles up to some ridiculously high energy, and if our theories somehow unify to something else at that energy that is then valid for all energies - <em>then</em> we expect a very large value (but still can't be sure it has to be large).&quot; In other words: Would be fascinating if that approach leads to the same order of magnitude, but it isn't that bad that it does not. Most likely we don't ask the right question yet for that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I was thinking about this a while back, and it occurred that the <em>effect</em> of an accelerating expansion is a net energy <em>loss</em> to somewhere - into the void or something.</p>
<p>The thought experiment I was playing with was two mirrors spaced very far apart (maybe a few million light years).  In a non-expansionary universe, you could emit some light from the first mirror, have it bounce from the second and come back with the same energy, bounce back, and back and forth.  The total energy in the system remains the same.</p>
<p>In an expansionary universe, each time the light travels from one to the other, it redshifts due to the expansion between the mirrors, gradually losing energy in the process.</p>
<p>In a normal situation where you spend some energy to accelerate something away from something else, that gets conserved in the potential energy of the two bodies being far apart.  It manifests as the gravitational force over time slowly decelerating and pulling back the first object, recovering the potential energy in velocity.</p>
<p>But in an &quot;constant acceleration&quot; scenario, that conservation doesn't seem like it exists.  The &quot;recover the energy&quot; scenario can never happen.  That's net energy <em>loss</em> in from our universe, isn't it?</p>
<p>Going back to that bouncing light example.. that redshifted light has lost energy.  Where did it go?  It wasn't conserved - it disappeared into the expansion.</p>
<p>That's so weird to think about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always wonder this when I see this claim. Why does it require energy to explain?</p>
<p>Energy is required to move mass, but space isn’t mass and it isn’t necessarily moving.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's my point. The inflation may have never slowed but continues to expand at an ever faster rate. By that I mean, the big bang is still going, hasn't even reached the end of its initial expansion. Is there reason to believe that the rate of inflation was constant as some previous period of time?</p></div>		</li>

<p>It could not. Expansion means the distances between far away galaxies increase. Bound systems don't expand. </p>

<p>Oooh and the 'drag' caused in the spacetime of where the larger matter once was is what we call gravity.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be noted that both dark energy and inflation result in a vacuum energy density which is why both produce an approximately de Sitter spacetime which is how inflation helps explain the homogeneity of the universe.</p>
<p>Also lots of things cause &quot;cosmological constant&quot; style terms. It's not that one is a field, and the other is a constant, but that many kinds of fields can produce a vacuum energy density which we can model as a cosmological constant. The QCD vacuum condensate is such an example.</p>
<p>Edit: I would be remiss to acknowledge that it is a mystery how and if QFT condensates contribute gravitationally.</p></div>		</li>
