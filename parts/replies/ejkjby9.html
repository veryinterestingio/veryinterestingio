			<div class="markdown"><p>They can, but it's not really helpful.</p>
<p>They can only track money if the transfer involves a country where they can get access to the records.  They can only see the account numbers for the side of the transfer that is protected.</p>
<p>So you might know an account owned by a suspected mobster transferred money to an account in the Cayman Islands, and you might know that money in the same amount transferred from a different account in the Cayman Islands into the account of a known Venezuelan drug lord.</p>
<p>But you can't prove that it's the same money, or indeed that there's any connection between those two transfers. (and I'd like to think that criminals in that class are smart enough to not actually send the same amount in a single transaction like that, but would instead choose to keep a positive balance in the various protected accounts so that there aren't matching numbers on either side of the equation)</p></div>		</li>
