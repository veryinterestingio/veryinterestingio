<p>It's really the maximum age that needs to be set. I really don't see how a person that is over 70 years old be representative of the people.</p>
<p>I feel a maximum age should be set.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you personally, but it’s the old folks who are currently making the rules. I saw something not long ago (will try to find source) that said if we instituted a max age of 65, over half of congress would have to be gone.</p>
<p>Edit: “The average age of Members of the House at the beginning of the 115th Congress was 57.8 years; of Senators, 61.8 years, among the oldest in U.S. history.” Source <a href="https://www.senate.gov/CRSpubs/b8f6293e-c235-40fd-b895-6474d0f8e809.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.senate.gov/CRSpubs/b8f6293e-c235-40fd-b895-6474d0f8e809.pdf</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I'm mostly talking about the presidency, not Senate or the House.</p>
<p>I feel that most politicians will push the economy to the furthest possible, ignoring the environment or climate change.</p>
<p>It's understandable, if I was that old too, I wouldn't care much about the environment, I would be dead soon anyway.</p>
<p>Some older people wouldn't think like that and might prioritize future generations, but that is only a very small minority, hence why I think a maximum age should be set.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like you are misinterpreting the sense of the word 'representation' in the context of political representation.  A political representative does mot have to be a reflection of the people to whom they are elected to serve; rather, they just have to represent their interests.  It's representation in the same sense that a lawyer represents a client, rather than symbolic representation or mirroring.</p>
<p>Personally I don't care if the President is 150 years old as long as he or she seems capable of performing their duties intelligently, with integrity, and has a platform that aligns with my values and judgement.  Take Bernie Sanders, for instance... he's what... 764 years old or something?  Yet his views align more with many ultra-progressive young people than those of some of his younger peers.  Bernie and AOC have very similar views despite a huge difference in age.  My views are more moderate, so I would look for more moderate candidates whether young or old.  In this election, obviously Biden is fairly moderate, so I'll be voting for an old guy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The constitutional reason would be &quot;Then don't vote for them.&quot; Unlike a minimum age, which is supposed to impose a minimum amount of life experience as a qualification, there's no such thing as &quot;too much experience&quot; in this context. You're free to note vote for them if you feel they don't represent you, but being &quot;representative of the people&quot; isn't a requirement.</p></div>		</li>

<p>While I agree with this point, this also applies to the minimum age argument</p></div>		</li>
