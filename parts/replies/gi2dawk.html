			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. The new strain is sequenced, so all you do is change the RNA. In fact I'd expect newer versions of the vaccine to include <em>both</em> the Wuhan and South African versions of spike protein mRNA. Or it might not even be necessary if the spikes are very similar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is amazing. I think the fact that we have in 2020  deployed mRNA technology is mindblowing and possibly the greatest achievement for medicine over the last decade due to the options this opens up for us. Making your body create proteins on call and deploying that to major populations is a huge feat with wide implications.</p>
<p>I expect a nobel prize for this one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree - it is amazing. The technogy has been around for many years, but only very recently deployed in human gene therapy. Though there's been some exciting work in this area in congenital diseases - literally repairing mutated genes in cells. I think it's going to be massive - huge potential in cancer too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you really want to have your mind blown, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines took <em>two days</em> each to develop. All of the rest of the time was for testing. </p>
<p>Also, since the mRNA vaccines target a single specific protein, new variants of the virus could potentially only change how effective the vaccine is and not whether it works or not, unless the mutation is in that one specific protein.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you'd still need at least a few months of trials. But for minor changes whose proteomics are well understood - you could probably be reasonably confident with comparative invitro work and then some short efficacy trials. I'd expect some trials to determine dosage would definitely be needed.
But if absolutely necessary - an amended vaccine could be rolled out very quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You may be able to use the previous results to justify the &quot;human safety&quot; part of the trials, and there has been talk of skipping the &quot;efficacy&quot; part of the trials in pandemics like this.</p>
<p>If the vaccine has been shown to be safe, knowing whether it's 20% or 95% effective against a new variant is less important at the start than getting it into millions of arms first and then finding out.</p>
<p>(For example, if we had done this with Moderna/BioNTech, we might be tens of millions of vaccines ahead by now.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, this is the right answer. If the spike protien coded mrna changed, they would have to prove that the resulting antibodies would be safe and effective again. The ABILITY to make the vaccine was never the hard part, it's the proof that giving it to healthy people will result in a public health benefit that is the long and hard part. Let alone manufacture and distribution as we can tell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, yes and no.  The shift to mRNA based vaccine production did require a lot of tooling up.  In the case of the Pfizer, the limiting reagent went from microliter amounts to liter amounts per an engineer I know.  That was not a small task in and of itself.  Now that that production ability is in place, pick your 8 markers, and in theory you can be in safety trials within 90 days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While that's true, it implies that the regulations are the main sources of delay, when it's profit-motivated resource management in response to regulations that's responsible for the bulk of the delay.</p>
<p>Regulations basically boil down to &quot;you need to do these 15-20 things to prove that what you've made is both safe and effective.&quot; While the specific details are debatable, in general the requirements are a reasonable trade and don't pose a big time burden.</p>
<p>However, if you wish to make a profit, you do those 15-20 things one at a time, so that if any fail you can keep your losses minimized. The novel coronavirus vaccines complied with all the regulations, but the time pressure of a pandemic meant that people working on them were willing to take the <em>financial</em> risk to do those steps in parallel instead of one at a time.</p>
<p>The difference between developing a vaccine in months vs. years, given the same &quot;level of difficulty&quot; (for lack of a better term) isn't the regulation, it's the decision to mitigate the <em>financial</em> risk of doing all the testing at once.</p></div>		</li>
