			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know if natural recovery from depression without the use of medication can cause this process to begin reversing as well? I had severe depression for 4 years, and I definitely have felt these effects. It's been 1 year since I have recovered from said depression. If the process does reverse, it's definitely slow enough that it's hard to notice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spontaneous recovery from depressive episodes is common, but research on it is not so extensive (not many recovered depressed patients would be recruited for clinical trials, and as far as I know spontaneous recovery has not been modelled in animals). As form and function in the brain are tightly linked, we would assume that there is some natural recovery of the physical changes which cause the pathology. However, people who have recovered from depressive episodes are at greater risk of further episodes, so there may be residual changes which contribute to this risk.</p></div>		</li>
