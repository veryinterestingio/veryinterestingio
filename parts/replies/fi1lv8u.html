			<div class="markdown"><p>> Most of the easy oil deposits have been found. New ones will get increasingly difficult and expensive to find. Once a field is found, the first oil comes out easily. After a while, the remaining bits get increasingly difficult and expensive to recover </p>
<p>This was true when we were talking about mostly conventional oil.</p>
<p>With the access and technology we now have to produce unconventional oils (i.e. tight oil/shale oil), it is completely unclear how much oil is ultimately produceable. Thatâ€™s not even counting coal liquefaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>50 year is just a guess, it could be 100 or 200 but its the same thing really, Its not that oil will run out in 50 years, its that the big, easy to get piles of it will be gone.  Then we have to go to shale rock oil, which is more expensive to mine, then probably some other forms.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>We can make oil in a lab. So we will never &quot;run out&quot; of it.  The question is when will the value of its use be less than how much we have to spend to get/make it, especially on a large scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also note that the large oil producers have a lot of impact in how/when we reach this &quot;peak oil&quot; scenario.</p>
<p>A long time, the estimation was that somewhere in the second half of the 21st century, the oil prices would peak and companies invested a lot in claiming reserves (in the form of unused or yet-unprofitable oil fields) to profit from the higher prices later.</p>
<p>But recent climate activism, the huge shift to electric mobility, etc have shifted that vision. Now the consensus is that we might already be past &quot;peak oil&quot;, and going forward demand will steadily drop, and instead of &quot;running out&quot;,  we'll instead get to a point where nobody even wants the leftover oil.</p>
<p>Evidently, you see all big oil producers fighting to produce and sell as much oil as they can, now that there's still a market for it. They invested shitloads of money in infrastructure and territory, and now they are afraid that it&quot;ll all be worthless in a few decades.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The shale oil revolution.  It has completely changed the way we think about oil fields.  The US is now self-sufficient in petroleum and is out-producing Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>We also produce so much natural gas that we burn it away as a waste product. You can clearly see the oilfields in Texas in &quot;the planet at night&quot; photos. No, those aren't cities out there. We wanted to sell it to Europe, but they prefer to buy from Russia using the Nordstream 2 pipeline.</p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="https://youtu.be/jT6HFCAFDgU?t=1314" target="_blank">Here's a quick rundown with some graphs and photos</a>.  About 5 minutes, but worth watching from the beginning if you have the time.  Really helps you to understand what's going on right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's basically a byproduct of oil extraction and refining but still needs refined itself before use. If a gas plant goes down it's cheaper to send it to flare to get burned off than cut extraction of crude or refining it into much more valuable gasoline and diesel. Also storing that quantity of unprocessed natural gas isn't feasible. The lines are large and running at like 2,000+ psi, a tank would get filled almost instantly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Crude oil is really a mix of all sorts of different things and changes from field to field.  In this case the well will produce almost all oil and a little bit of gas.  The issue with gas is storage (tanks) or transport (pipeline) are very expensive.  This means that economically the cost of dealing with the gas is more than the value of the oil that you do want.  So do the simple thing and just ditch the gas by burning it.</p>
<p>This is a great example.of where stronger regulations whilst affecting profits, can have significant environmental benefit.  Case in point: no routine flaring in Norway - you deal with the gas or the project doesn't happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The shale boom is also an example of how resources that were previously not economically recoverable can become economical given higher prices and new technology. This is part of why a lot of peak predictions for resources end up being completely wrong. </p>
<p>When the supply becomes restricted, the prices increase which encourages more exploration and investment into new technology. In the case of shale oil, new techniques made it profitable even at lower prices.</p>
<p>A similar effect occurred with gold mines in the US. There aren't many mines left that chase after veins or nuggets. Most gold mines now are processing huge amounts of material that contains very little gold. It's something like less than an ounce per ton of ore at some mines. This became economical due to higher prices, better technology, and large scale.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hence the virtue in pricing carbon.</p>
<p>Suddenly it becomes very expensive to burn carbon. </p>
<p>And the market  will figure out alternatives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with shale is that it's largely debt driven. Without QE and artificially low interest, it wouldn't be viable. It simply can't go on forever, it's just too expensive and far too low return.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just not true. Perhaps it was true years ago, but things have changed. The price of shale oil has hit the floor, and we can outcompete OPEC, and soon the Saudis.  <a href="https://youtu.be/jT6HFCAFDgU?t=1314" target="_blank">Here's a quick rundown with some graphs.</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Law of diminishing returns? The more you take the more it costs to take the next amount. Eventually the cost of taking it out of the ground supercedes the cost you can sell it for. We are already seeing this with many horizontal wells. We could continue to frak and pump in water to pull out smaller and smaller amounts, but the cost of it has far out paced the market value.</p></div>		</li>
