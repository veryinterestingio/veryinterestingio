			<div class="markdown"><p>Sapphire is aluminum oxide, it is &quot;transparent aluminum&quot; in the same sense that rust (iron oxide) is brown steel.  It has completely different properties.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_oxynitride" target="_blank">Aluminum oxynitride</a>  is the real material that people call &quot;transparent aluminum&quot;, but it is actually more similar to sapphire.  It is extremely hard, but brittle.  It is used as bulletproof glass, as it is difficult to manufacture large sapphire crystals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Silicone heater hose is pretty popular for custom cooling routing in aftermarket applications (engine swaps, etc). </p>
<p>And they have a clear option available, as well as many colours. </p>
<p>It's really nice to work with as is relatively flexible and pretty durable. </p>
<p>Only problem is that it's expensive as hell.</p></div>		</li>
