			<div class="markdown"><p>Standard powdered sugar (what I have at home, and any example I was able to find online in a quick search) is standard granulated sugar, but powdered. So mainly sucrose. I'd have to assume that the greatly increased surface area (the near instant dissolution of powdered sugar vs the quite slow dissolution of granulated) is the primary cause of the cold feeling, though I don't know enough about the additive bits (anti-caking starches and such) to comment on those.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Friendly reminder that your body treats sucrose the same as fructose - without the fiber, it goes to your liver, gets stored as fat directly, and promotes insulin resistance in your cells (not a good thing in most cases). Even alcohol is absorbed more by your body than non-glucose sugars; in order to actually get the energy from them, you have be active enough to break down the fat in order to get carbon and glucose for your body to exhale and use respectively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently the particular name for the non-melting powdered sugar is &quot;snow powder&quot; or &quot;snow sugar&quot;. That is mainly made of dextrose rather than sucrose, the former of which doesn't melt as easily. This is the sugar that is commonly sprinkled on e.g. doughnuts fresh out of the oven. If you try that with sucrose, the end result is going to taste good, but much of the sucrose is going to melt and not keep the appearance of white powder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I knew powdered sugar tasted different than granulated (and hate the flavor). People would always insist it was the same as sugar so I was certain something about the powered state changed the flavor. Glad to know the truth now. Get that powdered dextrose off my french toast!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Normal powdered sugar is not dextrose. It's the same as standard granulated sugar (mainly sucrose) just ground more fine. I agree it tastes different, but (guessing) I'd assume that's just due to the smaller particles affecting things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the context of this thread, I assume we're talking of snow sugar, or the powdered sugar that is sprinkled on e.g. pastries that are fresh out of the oven. Dextrose doesn't melt as readily, which is why it's used decoratively with warm foods.</p>
<p>You can also sprinkle it on e.g. cream and it will retain its form for at least a while longer than sucrose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the factor that just about any box of powdered sugar you pick up from a grocery store is going to have corn starch in it. Could it be the corn starch that your tongue is sensitive to?</p>
<p>Source: I know someone with a severe corn allergy, they grind their own sugar into powder for baking. But if you don't believe me just check ingredients list on any box of powdered sugar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good idea. I'll have to try grinding it sometime and see if it tastes better. Thanks. It may after all be a texture thing.</p></div>		</li>
