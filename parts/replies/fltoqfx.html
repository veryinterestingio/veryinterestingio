			<div class="markdown"><p>Parts of this are incorrect. NTSC 480p has an aspect ratio of 4:3, with a resolution of 640×480. 720p (1280×720) and 1080p (1920×1080) have a different aspect ratio,16:9, therefore they are not just grown proportionally. This new aspect ratio was chosen, because it was the geometric mean between 4:3 and movie ratios 2:35. This means you could show both without having huge bars for one or the other, you would just have small ones for each.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small nitpick, 2.39:1 aspect ratio for film, 2:35 would just be a very long bar. Interesting explanation, though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are mistaken. Digitial video in NTSC is 720x480 non-square pixels. The math doesn't work out to 4:3 aspect ratio until you compensate for the pixel aspect ratio.</p>
<p>When digital formats came along for editing, they interpreted the analog 525 lines (with about 480 visible) as either 720x480 or 720x486 depending on the digital format. For end consumers the DVD format settled on 720 x 480. All non-square pixels.</p>
<p>In video editing for broadcast, we used to have to compensate manually for the non-square pixels when creating graphics and prepping them to appear on TV screens.</p>
<p>EDIT: 4:3, not 16:9.</p></div>		</li>
