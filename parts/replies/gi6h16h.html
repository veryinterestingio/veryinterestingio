			<div class="markdown"><p>Because our nails are very useful tools, they protect the fingers but they also allow precision actions (especially seperating small things, peeling fruit, etc). </p>
<p>Nails get a lot of damage throughout your life, so it's good they get continually replaced. I wish teeth would do the same.</p>
<p>In many animals the nails / claws keep growing, but through usuage they also shrink. This is what keeps them sharp and roughly the same size. (the rate of growth is usually balanced by the rate of usage / damage).</p>
<p>Some animals also replace or continuesly grow their teeth. (hamsters, bunnies, beavers, sharks)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To tack on to the last bit, all rodents have incisors that continually grow. That's why bunnies and beavers and all the other rodents love to chew on things- it keeps their ever growing teeth in check.</p>
<p>I had a pet rat die when one of his teeth grew threw his brain. He was being spoon fed for long before that, couldnt open his mouth at the very end.</p>
<p>Sharks tho, I'm pretty sure they grow whole ass new teeth instead of having teeth that grow forever like rodents. Not 100% tho, maybe a shark expert could chime kn</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a note - bunnies/rabbits aren't rodents. It's a common misconception; you're very right about their evergrowing incisors (their molars also do grow, but to a much smaller extent)..</p>
<p>This is because rabbits have four incisors in the upper jaw (including two non-functional teeth), while rodents only have two. Both rabbits &amp; rodents have two lower incisors. Rabbits actually have a total of 28 teeth (most of which can't be seen from outside the mouth without anesthesia or at the very least, an otoscope). </p>
<p>Rodents are nocturnal/ rabbits are crepescular. </p>
<p>Many, but not all rodents are spontaneous ovulators (like humans). Rabbits are &quot;induced ovulators&quot; which means that sex brings on hormone surges that cause ovulation- making them incredibly effective at getting pregnant over and over and over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, sharks replace whole teeth regularly (I think it's similar to how we replace teeth when young) while rodent teeth continue to grow like our nails. </p>
<p>I'd be happy with either of these options. Of course if it would be like rodents we would either have some tool for filing our teeth or we'd need to regularly chew some hard materials</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work with rats in a lab and they didn't always chew enough to keep their constantly growing teeth filed down. We did weekly health checks and would clip their teeth if they started getting too long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The entire point is that your teeth regenerate so you won't need treatment. How often do kids (that still have their infant teeth) need painful treatment? </p>
<p>If there's one thing I'd modify once gene editing becomes more normal it would be to have regenerating teeth.</p></div>		</li>
