			<div class="markdown"><p>I read somewhere that this is basically a test your body gives to see if you are awake. If you don't respond to the itches your body assumes you are asleep and starts shutting down or whatever. Supposedly if you focus on the itches to keep yourself awake but stay motionless without scratching them you can induce lucid dreaming.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm terrified of bedbugs and itch all the time. I'm constantly combing through my stuff looking for any signs of them. I'm always afraid that I'm missing them.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it's not the same mechanism. The  &quot;auto-gain control&quot; is direct and temporary, and the mechanism you're describing is about the plasticity of the brain, and is about permanent changes.</p></div>		</li>
