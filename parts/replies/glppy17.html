			<div class="markdown"><p>Angiogenesis is quite slow though, so for a graft to &quot;take&quot; it usually relies on the fusion between existing blood vessels on both sides, a process called anastomosis. Microsurgery techniques are used to reconnect small vessels for things like face transplant if I'm not mistaken, and of course major vessels are sutured for organ transplant. Smaller vessels will anastomose spontaneously, and small grafts (e.g. skin) will rely on anastomosis alone. Hope some people with more knowledge than me about the mechanisms and clinical practice can expand on this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anastamoses is not a requirement for smaller skin grafts, they survive the first 24-36hrs via'plasmatic imbibition'.
The fibrin mesh mechanism described in other comments follows so I wont repeat.
But I will add that because of the way skin circulatory anatomy is, in veterinary medicine we usually attempt skin 'flaps' instead of free grafts. This is where you elevate skin from one area, rotate it to some degree and place it over the donor tissue bed. In this process you maintain some of the important vascular connections and reduce chance of necrosis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although I’m sure it is slow on the timescales you are talking about, but when I make my annual switch from “lets run all the time cuz the weight room is too hot” to “lets lift all the time cuz it’s too cold to run,” the veins split and fuse and grow and disappear seemingly overnight. They even seem to switch which one is supposed to be the main feed back home. I’m ridiculously vascularized, though, there’s gotta be thirty feet visible on the top of my dominant hand alone! The main branch out of my forearm is a little thicker than CATV coax. I don’t know how my heart keeps up.</p></div>		</li>
