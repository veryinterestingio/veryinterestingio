			<div class="markdown"><p>Polish is the same (not surprisingly, I guess), and when you're a native speaker you don't really think about it, but the results can be really weird.</p>
<p>For example, when used as a person's name, &quot;Mercedes&quot; will obviously be considered feminine, but when used to describe a car, it becomes a masculine noun.</p>
<p>Edit: For extra craziness, this <em>of course</em> doesn't hold for <em>all</em> car names. A Toyota would be feminine, a BMW neuter. (on the other hand, a slangy name for a BMW, &quot;beemka&quot; (be-em-ka), is feminine...) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Welp, surprisingly enough, that's also the rules in Hebrew. Which is not only not a Slavic Language, but also not an Indo-European one. Most of the time, if a word ends with an &quot;-a&quot; sound, it'll be feminine (and end with ה, which is basically a script-transition induced silent H). If it won't, it'll be masculine. Nothing for netuer because it's not a thing here.</p>
<p>For example, &quot;אִינסְטַגרַם&quot; (Instagram) would be masculine, while &quot;אַלפָּקָה&quot; (Alpaca) would be feminine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So many languages ( ◠‿◠ )！</p>
<p>The same rule is followed in Spanish. It really only applies to nouns that end in 'a'. Nouns like doctora, hija and niña are feminine but can be changed to their masculine forms if the 'a' were an 'o'. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of -ce are feminine singular eg &quot;restaurace&quot; or feminine plural eg &quot;Vršovice&quot;.</p>
<p>I must say I laugh when something that's already plural in English, like &quot;chips&quot;, gets to add a &quot;y&quot; to make it &quot;chipsy&quot; so it's plural in Czech.</p></div>		</li>
