<p><strong>A:</strong> In term of quantum encryption, the quantum internet will probably be adapted to companies and the consumers who need strong privacy, like journalists. For the majority, it might not be necessary immediately, just like many people still use short passwords. Beyond encryption, the use of quantum internet for connecting quantum computers could become accessible to consumers via cloud platforms, similar to what IBM or Amazon currently offer. Eventually, as the technology matures, we can hope that quantum computers are everywhere and connected by the quantum internet. (Gary)</p></div>		</li>
