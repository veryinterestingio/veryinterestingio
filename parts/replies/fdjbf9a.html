<p>I understand why people are susceptible to abuse, but I don't understand how people learn the types of abuse they implement. Is it just that abusive people are wired that way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm definitely not an expert, but I'm someone who went pretty far down this rabbit hole on Quora after some shit happened in my life. In the instance of intelligent cluster b types (inclusive of what we commonly call psychopaths), they apparently don't feel the same set of emotions as other people. They don't necessarily need to learn these types of manipulative behaviors from any playbook, but without normal compassion they learn to manipulate people to get what they want. This doesn't cover all the different messed up people you're asking about, but maybe it gives some insight into your question.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Unfortunately some peoples 'crazy' is a lot worse than others.</p></div>		</li>
