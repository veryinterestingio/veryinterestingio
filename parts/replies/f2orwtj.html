			<div class="markdown"><p>At a conference last year I heard a neuroscientist refer to humans as &quot;the plastic bag that holds the microbiome&quot;.  The microbiome may have orders of magnitude more genes than humans, and many of them unique to individuals.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the other hand we're gravitating towards the gut microbiome theory because we have no other solid explanation and our understanding is super limited. </p>
<p>So we're going through this stage of 'we don't really understand it so it must be true'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's quite as hand-wavy as all that, and certainly should not be dismissed out of hand.</p>
<p>The fact remains that our limited research so far has discovered at the very least some strong correlations, and we have only recently developed the tools to allow us to look into this area.  </p>
<p>Dismissing a new area of research without evidence is as foolhardy as believing it wholesale without evidence.  Possibly even more dangerous, as such negativity discourages actual research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And, not to be rude about this but still, there's presently funding to be had in that domain and that definitely drives at least some of these studies.</p>
<p>I suspect that we'll settle down the road on the gut biome being important but not <em>as</em> important as it is presently touted. Or not. We are persistently insane about everything related to food as a species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is possible but certainly not proven in any way.</p>
<p>It is more likely (to me) that there has been a large increase in diagnosis as depression has become less stigmatized, and better understood by the public and health care professionals.</p>
<p>This may be similar to the “alarming” rise in autism diagnosis.</p></div>		</li>
