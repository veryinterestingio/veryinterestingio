<p>Our bodies’ immune response works in a similar way. If there’s a shit ton of something coming in, your body learns to deal with it. But if there’s a tiny amount, it’s never really sure if its response is working so it keeps cranking up the response just in case the response so far wasn’t enough.</p>

<p>Except it's the other way around. The way the immune system &quot;deals&quot; with a consistently high amount of something perceived as a threat, is aggressive immunity and lots of it. Do you have a source for this?</p></div>		</li>
