			<div class="markdown"><p>Rabies incubation depends highly on site of inoculation and the distance the virus has to travel from a peripheral nerve to the CNS.</p>
<p><em>Bitten on big toe - long time (weeks to months)
</em>Spit from infected animal in the eye - short time (days to weeks)</p>
<p>NB - some cases of rabies have followed organ transplant, and the incubation time was <em>2+ years</em>, probably because some innervation of the organ (a kidney, in the case I'm thinking of) was required to pass the infection up to the CNS.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thank you for the bespoke nightmare, by the way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked at a vet clinic that would also prepare wild animals for rabies testing, which involves beheading the animal (already dead)</p>
<p>It was a crazy busy day with normal domestic pet patients, and we also had a raccoon that was suspected to have rabies that needed its head chopped off</p>
<p>So between patients myself and a vet popped into the back for the procedure. In her rush she forgot to put eye protection on and I was also stressed and didn’t notice she hadn’t. </p>
<p>She cracked through the spine and fluid shot directly into her eye. I believe she was previously vaccinated but she definitely got a booster that day just to be safe. The raccoon came back negative for rabies, thankfully. </p>
<p>Never forget your PPE when beheading rabies suspects!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another vaccine you can get post exposure is hepatitis B, similar to rabies HBV has a long incubation time and no cure.</p>
<p>For OPs question though, these vaccines are still preventing illness and not treating them once you get sick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The company I work for makes a rabies immune globulin (an IgG product collected from hyper-immunized plasma donors). Would that not be considered a treatment for rabies?</p>
<p>Edit to say: I realize the IG is given to patients exposed to rabies (or, potentially exposed?) to prevent rabies from developing - I also realize once a patient is showing symptoms of rabies it’s too late. But is an immune globulin not considered “treatment” - or is it considered, like, a prophylactic drug maybe? </p>
<p>(Genuine question - I know a lot about plasma, but don’t work much on the rabies-related programs so I’m not as educated about that. )</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Referring back to the CDC website,  post-exposure treatment is a dose of human rabies immune globulin and the rabies vaccine, with three or four follow-up vaccine shots over the next two weeks. It's basically &quot;Here's the instructions to make antibodies (the vaccine), and here's a shot of the antibodies to get the ball rolling (The HRIG).&quot;</p>
<p>The HRIG by itself could <em>maybe</em> be used as a treatment provided you gave a number of doses, but HRIG is... well, bloody expensive. Thousands of dollars for a single dose kind of expensive. In a civilised country that bill might not land on the patient's head, but vaccine+HRIG treatment is just as effective and about a tenth of the cost, so it's a clear choice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I run our convalescent Plasma Program! It works essentially exactly the same as the programs I mentioned above (hyper-immunization with tetanus, rabies, HBs...). We also made convalescent plasma products during the Ebola crisis (we still do). Very exciting that you’re involved on the clinical side! </p>
<p>Obviously I have no idea specifics of the trial’s data, but I’d bet a lot it’s effective in some statistically significant way. We (like, the industry as a whole) have decades and decades of experience using convalescent plasma or hyper-immunization protocols and creating an effective IVIG treatment!</p></div>		</li>
