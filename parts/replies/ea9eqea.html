<p>If your space is stretched out, the electrons that make up your body and everything else will travel a further distance to meet other particles and so on. <strong>You won't notice this because you're made of this stretched space and your thoughts and perceptions are based on those same interactions of particles</strong>.</p>

<p>Thank you!  For me, the most important bit!  All these years I hadnâ€™t even thought of that concept, and all the bending of time / light / gravity stuff did my head in. Suddenly now things make (a little more) sense!</p></div>		</li>
