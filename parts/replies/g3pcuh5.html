			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything /u/electric_ionland said is perfectly right. But let me add a bit more here. For background, I'm at JPL and I did my graduate degree in bioastronautics, so I spent a spot of time studying life support design.</p>
<ol>
<li>The human body: The body enjoys being &quot;normoxic&quot;, which is a partial pressure of oxygen at about 3.0PSI. (21% of 14.4 PSI). So as long as you have 3PSI of O2, the human body is happy.</li>
<li>Structural design: Engineers want to reduce the pressure (well, the pressure gradient between inside and outside) as much as possible to reduce requirements on strength and thus, reduce mass.</li>
<li>Flammability: The burning rate of material in a high-oxygen environment is a function of O2 percentage, not partial pressure. There's a large knee in the curve at about 36% where the burn rate markedly increases. As such, NASA has set the limit for oxygen concentration at 30%, with notable exceptions.</li>
</ol>
<p>These three requirements in mind, lead to different solutions:</p>
<p>- Apollo operated at \~5PSI at 100% O2. They solved the flammability risk by minimizing ignition sources and removing flammable material. On the launch pad they started with 19PSI (to check seals) at a N2/O2 environment. Then, during ascent, depressurized the system to 5PSI and back-filled with pure O2.</p>
<p>- Shuttle EVA suit: This operated at 4.3PSI at 100% O2. Higher pressures make it harder to bend limbs as the astronaut has to compress the atmosphere in the suit to move.</p>
<p>- Shuttle: Operated nominally at 14.4PSI 21%O2/79%N2. This was to maintain an Earth-like atmosphere for research. However, when preparing for EVAs, they would reduce the pressure to 10PSI and increase the O2 concentration to 30% for 24h before the EVA. This was to help the astronauts get N2 out of their bloodstream to prevent the bends (think scuba diving). Astronauts going on EVA would then huff pure O2 for \~2hr prior to the EVA to flush N2 out of their blood.</p>
<p>- ISS: Operates at 14.4PSI, 21%O2/79%N2. Not sure how they prevent the bends for EVAs, but probably something similar.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thank you, the other comments really triggered some questions inside my head but this answered all of them. Would you happen to know if they carry more than one space suit and have a &quot;backup diver&quot; standing by in case the person outside gets stuck or suffers loss of consciousness?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(Not an astronaut, but I read a heck of a lot of NASA stuff).</p>
<p>Manned space flights generally don't have more than one space suit per person; for one thing, the suits are custom-sized for the individual astronaut, so they won't fit just anyone that happens to need one.</p>
<p>Space suits are also very expensive, <em>and</em> they're extra mass that has to be carried into space, which means that more fuel has to be expended, which makes a flight significantly more expensive -- and it also means that something that's already scheduled to go 'up' probably has to be removed so that there's still enough fuel to get everything off the ground.</p>
<p>Astronauts usually work in teams of two or more, so that if one encounters difficulty during a spacewalk there's someone to help him back to the airlock.  There's really not enough time to have someone 'on standby' inside, because it takes quite a while to get into the suit (everything on a suit has to be checked and verified before anyone goes outside) -- by which time the emergency has probably passed the 'point of no return'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The NOAA oxygen limits for single exposure say at at 1 bar PO2 you have 300 minutes. As for CNS anything below a PO2 of 1.4 bar for active and 1.6 bar for resting is considered safe.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Diving &quot;times&quot; are tricky...</p>
<p>The evil stuff is the nitrogen (?) in the air which will acculumate in your blood over time. If you release the preassure fast (e.g. surface), air bubbles can form and kill you easy. Thats why those chambers exist... to push those tiny bubbles back into your blood. The longer and deeper you stay the more gas you collect... the longer you need to surface (Can take up to hours for extreme dives or even longer if you work on the ocean floor)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you can't survive there indefinitely. The partial pressure of oxygen at that altitude is too low to survive on. </p>
<p>Up much higher, and it wouldn't even help to have 100% oxygen, as the total air pressure is too low for respiration to occur. Pilots of high flying aircraft wear oxygen masks that supply oxygen under pressure so they will be able to breathe in the event of decompression.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are other problems in pure 100% oxygen atmosphere and some other milder issues of low pressure atmosphere in general, even with proper oxidation.</p>
<p>100% oxygen, even at appropriately low pressure to have sea level like oxygen partial pressure in lungs causes life threatening inflammation after multiple months continuous exposure. Reportedly 80% O2 20% N2 mix solves this one</p>
<p>Also low pressure causes faster drying (water is progressively more volatile as pressure drops) which may be a source of discomfort at low enough pressures. Eye drops and skin treatment should solve this one.</p></div>		</li>
