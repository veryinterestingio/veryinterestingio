			<div class="markdown"><p>Symmetry. All processes we know produce and destroy matter and antimatter in equal amounts - with deviations so small that they don't explain the asymmetry we see today. At the time matter and antimatter formed some process must have formed more matter than antimatter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be observed in CP-violating processes as they prefer to decay to matter over antimatter. However, CP violation is incredibly rare in the current standard model and doesn't happen in a large enough quantity to produce anything close to the asymmetry that is currently observed in our universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't strike me as particularly unusual. What if the big bang produced 99.9% more matter than the universe has today in almost equal parts matter and antimatter, nearly all of the matter annihilated with each other, but there was an extremely small discrepancy between matter and antimatter, and the slightly more abundant matter is what the universe is made of today?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because when we create anti-matter in particle colliders it also creates an equal amount of matter. </p>
<p>But that's at the energies we can access which are nowhere near the big bang. That's part of why we want higher and bigger colliders, to see how things change as we get closer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what's called CPT symmetry, charge, parity (handedness), and time symmetry. </p>
<p>If you only reverse a single one of them then the universe would function differently. For example reversing charge by swapping matter with antimatter then suddenly electric charge is now carried by positive charged positrons and the direction of current would be reversed everywhere. DC motors would spin in reverse. </p>
<p>If you create a mirror image of the entire universe and reverse time, then all the differences you get by reversing charge are canceled out and you get the normal universe back.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They wouldn't, because you exchange all charges, that also includes the charges causing the magnetic fields.</p>
<p>Electromagnetism is invariant under C, P and T individually. Only the weak interaction is not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For what I understand, antimatter just has its charges swapped so an electron would still behave like an electron just carrying a positive charge instead of a negative one.</p>
<p>Antimatter would presumedly just behave the same as matter if only it was around other antimatter, but given the fact we can never make enough to try some actual antimatter-antimatter interactions, the atom just decays. Even just going from being able to make elements to full molecules would be an achievement right now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So the solution to this problem is left as an exercise to the reader.</p>

<p>As Rannasha said, we don't know.   It's probably less because we haven't quite figured it out, and more because we don't understand fundamental about the universe.  This implies that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_creation" target="_blank">Photo Pair-Production</a> (creating matter from energy) was probably not <strong>the</strong> mechanism for the creation of matter in the early universe.   There was either an additional process to create the asymmetry between matter and antimatter, or a completely unknown mechanism for the creation of matter.</p></div>		</li>
