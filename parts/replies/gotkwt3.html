<p>Totally. Nowadays it's crazy how early a kid can be born and survive. All three of our kids were in the NICU when born. Early, but not too early (4 weeks and 6 weeks). We saw success stories of kids born much much earlier and survived, along with pictures of them at older ages looking just fine.</p>
<p>Science is awesome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah nowadays 24 weeks is really the lower limit of survivability for neonates. Some survive earlier than that but the chances aren't spectacular. One of the ways we've really improved is in managing subsequent pregnancies to prepare for and prevent preterm birth in mothers who have had one already.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the advances were because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Bouvier_Kennedy" target="_blank">Patrick Kennedy</a>. He was born to the President and First Lady in August, 1963. The baby was <strong>5 1⁄2 weeks early</strong> and weighed <strong>4 lbs., 10 1⁄2 oz</strong>.  In 2021, a baby born at 34 1⁄2 weeks gestation and weighing almost five lbs. is almost certainly going to live and grow up to be perfectly healthy. </p>
<p>Patrick passed away at two days old. That spurred on the entire field of neonatology to the medical-miracles possible today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a small correction, it’s a battle between mom’s ability to run, not to walk, and baby’s skull. </p>
<p>If it was just walking, hips could be much wider. But it’s running that survives evolution, not merely walking. </p>
<p>So the brain/head has to fit through the pelvis of a woman who can run upright. That’s a narrow and very tight margin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That actually makes a lot more sense. Since anthropologists have looked at persistence hunting as a survival strategy for early humans, being able to run would be absolutely vital to getting enough calories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What did you mean by &quot;C-sections haven't been around nearly long enough to remove those selective pressures&quot;? Wouldn't C-sections mean that more babies would be born from difficult births, and that  parents of difficult births would successfully pass on genetic factors which may have had an effect on the birthing difficulty, onto their offspring? Or am I not understanding or misinterpreting something? Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>C sections are already starting to slightly change the genetics of head size to pelvic size. </p>
<p>&quot;...we predict that the regular use of Caesarean sections throughout the last decades has led to an evolutionary increase of fetopelvic disproportion rates by 10 to 20%.&quot;</p>
<p>from this paper  <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/113/51/14680" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/113/51/14680" target="_blank">https://www.pnas.org/content/113/51/14680</a></a> </p>
<p>I'm sure there are other things besides fetal and pelvic size that are also being slowly changed due to modern obstetrics.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not related to development, but the average human body temperature has dropped over the past few hundred years, likely thanks to better healthcare and antibiotics. High temperatures are better for fighting disease but need more energy to maintain. Since people are getting less ill there is a subtle shift in selection to bodies that use less energy.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-human-body-temperatures-cooling-down/#:~:text=Stanford%20University%20researchers%20looked%20at,women%20have%20fallen%20as%20well." target="_blank">Article on the phenomenon</a></p>
<p>In it they also discuss other possible reasons, but healthcare was most reported in the past.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention sexual selection for mating couples. We are past the times where women with larger hips were more desired because of their ease of giving birth thanks to cesarean sections. There's a joke in the movie Kingpin that highlights this when the amish guy comments on the woman's narrow hips saying she could only give birth to 3 or 4 children.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue is the incredibly long life cycle of humans, we have only had a few generations for those changes to be present in the gene pool. It has already had some effect but not likely it's full effect. We likely won't see that for many, many generations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From an evolution stand point, C sections are very new. It takes time for the genetic traits that are being selected for to start showing up in a population in a significant number. It could be several generations before we saw any changes, especially as humans reproduce slowly. Add in that a couple who had a difficult pregnancy/birth might only have one or two kids and that plays a role in how genes are passed on as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Serious question, I understand how it can take generations for genetic traits that are being selected for to show up in a population in a significant number; However, wouldn't the removal of a selective pressure show up much more quickly than the addition of one? i.e. if you remove a selective pressure, all the people who would have previously died are now living and passing on their genes, which would be nearly immediate. Whereas adding a selective pressure, such as selecting for a mutation that prioritizes speed in a population where that was previously irrelevant, would take generations to show up, right?</p></div>		</li>
