			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a kicker, and this has most likely been mentioned. But on kickoff, the kicker doesn't have to kick the ball over the opposing teams defensive line, so they have more room to &quot;drive&quot; the ball, whereas during a field goal kick, the kicker has to elevate the ball over the outstretched arms of the defensive line. </p>
<p>This is why you'll see highschool kids hitting 70 yard field goal attempts on youtube during practice where in a game they would never come close to that distance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well... to he honest most football teams arent going to try a 60-70 yarder anyways. Not that the kicker cant hit it, but if you miss then you give up precious field position. Its safer to play the punt than put pressure on your defense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something else that's different is that on kickoff there isn't a line of guys jumping at the ball, so you can give it that low-angle &quot;take off&quot; that gives it more distance. </p>
<p>As that gif showed you can get distance from the fg hold, but that kick would've been very easily blocked because it was so low.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My assumption was that they have to kick the ball up at a higher trajectory on field goals, because you have the other team try to block it.  </p>
<p>This is not a concern on a kickoffs (although I imagine they will kick as high as possible to get more hang time, and give the kickoff team more time to get down field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking this too.  Also, kickers have to be much more accurate on FG attempts than on kickoffs.  I'm sure that plays a factor on power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Id argue that.  Unless you are shooting for a touchback, usually because the returner and their ST crew will destroy yours, they spend a lot of time trying to put the ball on the 1 yrd line.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The average kickoff has more hangtime/higher trajectory than a field goal. Camera angles on TV make it look a lot different though. Kickoffs you generally see it from the side and it's a much wider view. Field goals are almost always seen from a straight on view, so the height of the kick ends up being emphasized. </p>
<p>As far as field goal trajectory is concerned, getting it over the line isn't an issue 99% of the time. When I would do drills for it, I'd set up 4 yards away from the goalposts and hit balls over easily. A blown blocking assignment or a badly hit ball are the only reasons you should see a blocked kick. The ball gets up in the air quick, but it gets up quicker when kicked off a tee. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also Kickoffs are measured from kicking spot to where the ball is fielded whereas field goals are measured from the spot to the goal posts (end of endzone) which the cross bar is 10ft off the ground. I don't know how the math works but obviously to clear 10ft the kick has to be traveling farther than its measured at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similarly, I was under the impression that the reason kickoff-length field goals couldn't be made was because the kicker would have to start further away from the holder, and the extra time between the snap and the kick would increase the odds of a blocked kick. Is there any truth to this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Getting it over the line may not be a super common issue for normal FGs, but I have noticed that a much higher %age of attempts there are 45+ yards tend to be blocked than 20 yard attempts. The height issue has to be a part of why a guy can kick it through the goalposts on 9/10 kickoffs but can't come close to doing the same from a similar distance on a FG attempt. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's the tee. They're back far enough on a fg that it's a non issue unless it's a very long fg.</p>
<p>Edit: okay, downvote me. I was a kicker. That's what the 7 yards are for.</p></div>		</li>
