			<div class="markdown"><p>Liquid oxygen is actually quite heavy and airplanes is not able to carry as much weight as trains and boats. Not only is the oxygen quite heavy but it requires thick tanks and cooling equipment in order to transport it which is also quite heavy. And of course if something were to go wrong and the liquid oxygen were to spill out there are few ways of preventing the airplane from <strong>exploding.</strong>.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of scenarios where the liquid oxygen does not cause an explosion, sometimes mearly a fire but usually just damages to components from the cold. There are actually a history of oxygen fires on airplanes but no explosions as such.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Because most people do not transport LOX on aircraft. Because it can go boom. </p>
<p>Compressed O2 and oxygen generators are potentially dangerous and can support combustion in low oxygen environments, LOX can make aluminum burn. LOX in contact with organic compounds is generally considered an explosive.</p></div>		</li>
