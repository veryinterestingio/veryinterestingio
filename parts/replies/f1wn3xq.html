			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer I will not attempt to improve.</p>
<p>I would like to point out, though, the minor = sad thing is a rule of thumb, not a law.</p>
<p>A go-to example of a minor key song that sounds happy, for example, is Good King Wenceslas.</p>
<p>EDIT: Per below, most arrangements of Wenceslas are actually in major, so I don't want this to sit up here all incorrect! General observation still stands, tho ;-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can make a song with a minor melody sound &quot;happy&quot; by having major chords in the harmonization, especially by ending the phrase on a major chord.  Movie music does this a lot for music that is meant to sound &quot;heroic&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think the &quot;chim chiminy chim chim cheroo&quot; chimney sweep song from Mary Poppins is pretty happy, and it's in a minor key.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is mainly right but as you said greatly simplified. To extend on that: It's not just minor and the flat fifth, it's a whole bunch of scales, modes, intervals, rhythms, chord progressions as well as just pure timbres that composers use to evoke an &quot;evil&quot; association. One of the main things the craft of composing is about is being aware of all those sounds and knowing when and how to use them. </p>
<p>As you said, some of those work for evolutionary reasons, i.e. feeling unnerved by deep bassy sounds similar to those you'd experience in extreme situations like an earthquake or a heavy thunderstorm. Others are shaped by cultural conditioning. Like associating a certain sound with eastern music because it uses scales and instruments that originate from those continents. Or 80's synth music which is shaped by the technological advances of the time. Then there's also odd stuff like Christmas or Halloween music which is also defined by certain scales and timbres for some reason. It's the same with villain music. On one hand we all grew up with a whole bunch of already existing media, so we're taught to understand and properly associate all those musical tropes subconsciously. On the other hand, those who first established those tropes probably had similar associations in mind already - it's not like literally anything would've worked - so it's probably not just a purely cultural thing. As far as I know that's something musical scholars still debate about, though, so it's hard to give a proper answer on why some music evokes those responses. As always, the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle.</p></div>		</li>
