The pitchers are actually sterile before they are open, and are only colonized by bacteria and other organisms after they've been exposed to the environment; however, in the long run, the lack of this food web could compromise their ability to a) capture prey (though one could certainly artificially seed the plants with sterilized prey), and b) to digest the prey.</p>
