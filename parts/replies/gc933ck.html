			<div class="markdown"><p>The world of functional RNA, sometimes called ribozymes, is so fascinating. Researchers have proven it is possible to make a strand of RNA that replicates itself, and assuming there were conditions at one point that facilitated the creation of RNA stands, it's not hard to believe this happened naturally. Then we can look at our own cells for remnants of a time when RNA was the predominant  functional molecule. Some mRNA splicing is self-mediated, using special sequences in the introns that excise themselves. All living cells have ribosomes, which are largely made up of RNA, including their active sites.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting read. I had never heard the term &quot;RNA world&quot; but had always assumed this to be the case given the relationship between RNA and DNA. Of course, in conducting science, we never simply accept intuition, but I feel like the idea of there having been a precursor to the current DNA system for storing genetic information that was based on RNA is pretty intuitive.</p></div>		</li>
