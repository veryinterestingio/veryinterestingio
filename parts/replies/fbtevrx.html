<p>He's saying that a debris field from a moon breaking apart steadily went through re-entry. To say it had rings would imply the field remained in stable orbit for a long duration. His point is, it <em>didn't</em>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Maybe? The mountain ring is all we see now.</p>
<p>We don't know anything about it for sure. Maybe it broke up enough to be rings, and was stable enough to be considered as such. We don't really know even if there was a moon for sure, it just fits as an explanation. </p>
<p>The only reason I even found out about it was I was looking up the possibility of moons with moons, and that was one of the possibilities.</p></div>		</li>
