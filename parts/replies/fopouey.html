			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe. The author is referring to the fact that when we plug in certain things, the plug itself that goes into the socket is quite large and covers up the other socket holes where other things could be plugged in. So sometimes I have an electrical socket that has two spots but I can only use one because the size of my speaker plug is so intrusive into the space of the other socket. Does that make sense or was that more confusing lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason why UK sockets don't have OP's problem is that the plugs are already <strong><em>massive</em></strong>. UK plugs are <a href="https://expatlingo.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_5153.jpg" target="_blank">twice as wide and three times as long</a> as US ones (2 and 2 if we're talking the 3-pronged US ones) and the plugs are thus spaced accordingly. For a UK plug to to &quot;bleed&quot; into other sockets the plug must be truly, ridiculously gargantuan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably because the holes of the US sockets are quite close to each other if I remember correctly compared to their UK counterparts (and presumably also the Irish ones). So in the UK you can have a massive plug that will just cover the holes and it won't block the plugs next to it.</p></div>		</li>
