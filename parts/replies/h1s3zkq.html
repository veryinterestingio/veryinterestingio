			<div class="markdown"><p>There are separate issues. The main issue in the winter was lack of freeze protection on the natural gas lines (which promptly got blamed on the wind turbines because &quot;green energy bad&quot;). In the summer you either have a generation problem or a distribution problem. Assuming that generation isn't the issue then the problem is the distribution. The power lines were built to handle a certain load, but Texas has had a lot of population growth so the grid is under more load. Now the power lines could have been upgraded, but that costs money, so the system fails again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh that’s sad. I know there are fields of solar panels that move with the sun rise and sun set to maximize the direct light. </p>
<p>There are also many windmills. It seems like there are new ones all time time. </p>
<p>So I am not sure what’s going on</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue with wind turbines wasn’t “green energy bad” it was that the ratio of the cost of working turbines and power they produce when compared to the cost of working natural gas and the power they produce is way worse. It wasn’t them saying “windmills are bad” it was them saying “windmills cost more and produce less”</p>
<p>But yeah, winter issue was because there were issues with production, summer issue is because of distribution, especially since there’s been a huge influx of people this past year</p></div>		</li>
