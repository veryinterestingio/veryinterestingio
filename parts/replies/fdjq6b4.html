<p>But to contribute positively to the conversation,  many TV shows/cartoons are really pushing STEM to young kids. For example my son is learning about magnetism, buoyancy, rotational speed, tensile strength,  and more on a Nickelodeon cartoon. You may be surprised what a 5 year old knows</p>
<p>PS - in case any 5 year ols are reading and confused STEM stands for Science Technology Engineering Math</p></div>		</li>
