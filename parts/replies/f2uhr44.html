			<div class="markdown"><p>Cancer cells also protect themselves from the immune-mediated response of attacking non-apoptotic cells with reactive oxygen species. </p>
<p>Basically the immune system can spot cells that won’t self-destruct or aren’t doing it, so white blood cells are dispatched to bleach them. Cancer cells (being the sneaky little shits that they are) are able to disguise themselves from the immune system so they’re not spotted. There’s a lot of current research into beefing up the immune response to cancer. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love this explanation. </p>
<p>So how is it they hide, and how is it we can see them but the immune system can't?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's more appropriate to say that a very small number of cells that become cancerous do so in a manner that leaves them invisible to the immune system too.  It's these very rare camoflauged-cancer cells that turn into life-threatening health situations.</p>
<p>Cancerous cells are actually quite common in a healthy adult, it's just that they aren't camo-cancerous and so the immune system can see them and clean them out before they turn into a problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is just one of the ways of getting cancer cells. There can be cells that are just fine with their self destruct in place, but they've found ways to evade the immune system. Or they're just growing by multiplying so much that the body can't handle it. Or a cancerous cell releasing stuff on apoptosis which when taken up by other cells disables their self destruct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, many people forget that our DNA is fundamentally coded by four nucleotides. ADENINE and GUANINE (A and G) are PURINES. CYTOSINE and THYMINE (C and T) are PYRIMIDINES.</p>
<p>A always bonds with T, and C always bonds with G.</p>
<p>When DNA is copied, it is unzipped by the enzyme HELICASE and another enzyme (DNA POLYMERASE) zips along and reads one strand of the double-stranded helix and synrhesizes the corresponding &quot;correct&quot; complementary strand. So if it reads A-A-T-G-C-A it will make the corresponding T-T-A-C-G-T. If one of these single letters is changed then the wrong complementary pairing will be synthesisuzed and will forever be passed down incorrectly to all cells whose DNA descends from that one cells. Luckily, most genes are coded by codons (groups of three nucleotides, many of which will still code the same thing even if one of the base pairs is altered) . Furthermore the vast majority of these nucleotides and codons code for junk and inconsequential DNA whose anticidons don't encode for mRNA at all or if they do it often is mRNA for unimportant proteins.</p>
<p>So a lot of mistakes have to be made that don't affect important coding regions of DNA, and the don't result in immediate apoptosis/self destruction of the cell, and are not propagated far and spread to other cells, tissues, organs, etc.</p>
<p>The body is surprisingly well adapted to minimize the negative effects of things like this.</p>
<p>PS it's been YEARS since my genetics classes so please add on to or correct anything I have said that is in error. Thanks</p></div>		</li>
