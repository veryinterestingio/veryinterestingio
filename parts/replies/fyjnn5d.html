			<div class="markdown"><p>Bleached pigments Ã re a real problem for 1990's pinball collectors. Back then the artwork was silk-screened. Finding original samples of games like Party Zone, The Getaway, Dr Who, Safecracker, etc that aren't faded makes them more valuable. But in most cases these games' yellows, reds, and pinks have faded badly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, pigment chemistry/physics is a fair bit beyond my expertise and I cant really answer that.</p>
<p>What I can say is that those are just 2 random examples I grabbed. There are multiple reds for example, each with a different &quot;pigment number&quot; and it's own spectral properties etc.</p>
<p>Pigments could differ in their entire chemistry, have slight alterations or even just by the coating/rosin applied to the particles. There definitely are certain &quot;pigment groups&quot; which are all variations on a specific underlying structure for example but I couldn't tell you if there's any specific chemical groups that are present in most etc.</p>
<p>Quite a lot of pigments I've looked at contain a metal atom/ion but I don't think that's a requirement, for example manganese/calcium are in a lot of common red pigments I.e. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithol_Rubine_BK" target="_blank">Red 57:1</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Light is absorbed by chromophores by causing electrons in the molecule to be exited. Oganic chromophores (like the two examples) absorb light though an excitation of a pi electron (double bonds basiclly) to its pi* anti-bonding state. In order for these molecules to absorb visible light, the pi system must be conjugated (lots of pi electrons connected to each other).</p>
<p>So, to answer your question, for Organic chromophores  (i.e. not metal based) conjugated pi systems like phenyl rings (or polyphenyl) or conjugated alkenes are needed to absorb visible light. Metal dyes absorb light by exciting the d electrons, so they don't contain these functional groups but rather electron donating or withdrawing groups bonded to the metal center to tune the energy gap between ground and exited states. </p>
<p>I'm not an expert in dyes, but my guess would be the amine and sulfonic groups in those examples are added to make the dye soluble in water, rather than more expensive organic solvents.</p></div>		</li>
