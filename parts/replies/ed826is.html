			<div class="markdown"><p>The big fuss is that when people say &quot;radiation&quot; they are conflating anything that emits/radiates energy (i.e. anything but the cold vacuum of space) with &quot;ionizing radiation&quot;  - x-rays and gamma rays. The normal stuff like light, infrared, UV, radio is so common and harmless, we don't think of it as radiation, except when speaking scientifically. </p>
<p>The reason ionizing radiation is dangerous is that high concentrations of ionizing radiation are so powerful they penetrate all but the most dense matter (ex. lead). Ionizing radiation has so much energy, when it's traveling through matter, it smashes through it, breaking apart molecular bonds. When these molecular bonds are in your DNA, your DNA can get messed up and that cell in you body won't function properly any more. A few cells here and there, your body can handle, the cells self-destruct or are otherwise cleaned up. But if too many get messed up DNA, they get out of control, these cells run amok. We call that cancer.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small clarification here: The threshold for ionizing radiation is typically placed in the middle of the UV spectrum. This is why UV is often broken up into UVA, UVB, and UVC categories, with increasing levels of skin cancer risk. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And to further show that EM radiation isn't scary, we have a special name for EM radiation in the 430-770 terahertz (THz) range: visible light. Visible light is just EM radiation that our eyes have evolved to convert into signals our brain understands. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>most people have no concept of how profound this statement above is. Essentially the universe s mostly a cold, dark and empty space, with isolated pockets of matter and energy sprinkled around, and on at least one of these isolated spots of energy/matter, life forms have evolved some specialized cells that convert a tiny part of the EM spectrum into what we know as vision. What we know as vision, light etc is essentially just a construct (like consciousness itself) in a dark universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've got an excellent answer there but if you need more reassurance then you might like to know that the effects of these frequencies of radiation (and mobile phones in general) on the body are being actively studied. I'm taking part in an international study called <a href="http://www.ukcosmos.org/" target="_blank">Cosmos</a> which is tracking the health of thousands of people to try to determine if there is any long term effects that are not immediately obvious. When the study was started the assumption was that there would be no effects to radiation of this power level and frequency range but it had never been studied in detail for extended periods of time and there was a media frenzy about mobile phones causing health damage (which makes funding easy to get).</p>
<p>I forget how long the study has been going now but it's many years. There was an interim report a couple of years ago and, as expected, no ill effects were found. IIRC the study is scheduled to run for 40 years so I'll be an old man by the time it ends.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There was an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwyDCHf5iCY" target="_blank">interesting video</a> that I stumbled across that talked about the fact that we are still studying the effects of mobile phones close to our bodies...thought I would put it up here...</p>
<p>I found it kind of scary that the standards for the things that are sitting in our pockets...is still being worked on.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Big Farma back at it. </p>
<p>Real question though if I increased the voltage going to my router by a factor of 10 (1W vs 0.1W) assuming I cooled the router effectively, would that result in better wifi coverage in my house? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most answers focus on a more hypothetical case; practically, the components of your router such as DC-DC converters and capacitors are likely not rated for that use and will be destroyed. The mostly likely result is turning your router into a brick, which will decrease your WiFi coverage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it would make it worse. It's the equivalent of using a megaphone to try to have a conversation. Everyone else is now deaf and you can't hear over yourself. (This is just an analogy, the real problems are way to technical to explain via cell keyboard)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, for a few reasons.  One is that you'd have to increase the transmit power of your phone or laptop.  While antenna gains as symmetrical, amplifier gains are not.  Optionally, you could put a preamplifer on the router that boosts the power of signals being received by the router so that the router can hear the other devices better.  Another poster brought up that you could theoretically reach a power output value that actually makes the received signal too strong for your phone to correctly receive and process.  This is theoretically true, but a 10x power increase in this case probably wouldn't be enough to actually cause this problem, especially if you're at a distance that previously was spotty with coverage.  We don't implement changes likes these mostly to prevent needless interference, and to conserve energy on mobile devices.</p>
<p>That said, land mobile radios, like those used by police, fire, town public works departments, etc do use this method.  To allow people in vehicles or on foot to communicate over large distances, a repeater is setup with a strong amplifier, receiver pre amp, and antenna, typically on a tower/hill/mountain etc.  A handheld unit might transmit at 5 watts, but the repeater can hear that due to it's pre-amp, antenna, and height advantage.  It then rebroadcasts the signal on a slightly different frequency with significantly more power (ex 150 watts) from a much better antenna in a better location than the handheld radio.  The result is you can now get a bunch of lower power units to talk to a base station or each other over distances larger than they could cover alone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eyyyy!  Sounds like another Ham.  Thanks for this as I was about to post something similar to your response.</p>
<p>Forgot to mention that increasing the voltages to the router would probably blow it's internal power regulators first, or best case, it's solid state fuses.</p></div>		</li>
