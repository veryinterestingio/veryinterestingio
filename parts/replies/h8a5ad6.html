			<div class="markdown"><p>The Jefferson wines (which ended up being fake) are an example of this. But people do not normally buy undrinkable wines to collect.
They might buy them in the hopes that they are drinkable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, similar to how old video games can sell for a whole lot as long as they are rare, in top condition and include the manuals and such. Whether or not the game itself is actually fun and/or worth playing is usually irrelevant since the aim isn't to play them. Granted, sometimes it's popular titles like Mario 64 but often it'll be like that copy of World Class Track Meet that sold for $40k</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wine isn’t aged for as long as whisky in barrels (three years would be extreme), and plenty of wine isn’t aged at all but is dropped right into bottles once fermentation is complete.</p>
<p>Many High end wines are intended to age in the bottle though, and their flavour profile does change materially over the years. Chemical reactions occur while it’s in the bottle that impact how it tastes. Wine not intended to be aged often tastes a bit flat after too much time in the bottle, but wine intended to be aged can taste quite different (and have a different mouthfeel).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That drastically depends on the whisky you're talking about. In the case of American Bourbon, you're largely correct.</p>
<p>As for scotch, they intentionally age in pre-used barrels, so the oak taste won't be too strong, and they can preserve a large amount of the barley malt taste. Glenmorangie for instance claims to only use barrels in their second, third or fourth use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aging also results in evaporation and loss so older whiskeys tend to be hotter with more wood complexity. Add a couple drops of purified water to your whiskeys to bring out more flavor and reduce the whiskey burn that can overwhelm the flavor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read that they recently discovered part of the change in flavor profile is because some molecules will clump together or clump around another molecule. </p>
<p>You might have 100 molecules of some particular flavenoid all stuck up together so only the few molecules around the outside can interact with your taste buds and give flavor, just not as strong as if they were all separated. Or completely hiding some flavenoids in a bundle of other molecules. </p>
<p>Brownian motion will eventually bust these clumps apart, perhaps even causing other types of clumps to form, and that changes the flavor profile. All the same molecules are there, but the way they interact with your taste buds is different. And that's why there is no <em>chemical</em> difference between aged and unaged wine or spirits, but a refined pallete really can tell the difference.</p></div>		</li>
