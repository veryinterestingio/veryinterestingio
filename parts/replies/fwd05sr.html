			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Some people feel happy all the time, some feel sad all the time and some feel happy AND sad sometimes. It's normal to have sad times, but yeah, if it's HARD to try to be as happy as possible, better to seek help. Not that you NEED to be extra ultra happy all the time but being happy sometimes shouldn't be a prob</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our society sets us up to think that if you're not happy all the time, there's something wrong with you. This simply isn't true. Humans should have a wide range of emotions that come and go, all the time, like the weather. It's extremely difficult to sustain feeling happy all the time and, in fact, when we try to chase this feeling, it paradoxically sets us up for disappointment and depression. Use all your emotions as messages about what's going on in your life, not as who you are personally. You are not your emotions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have bipolar disorder, so I literally have to double-check all of my emotions. If I feel particularly happy and upbeat, I have to have the wherewithall to look internally and go &quot;This is off. You're feeling way too good.&quot; The same way, if I was depressed and wanted to die, I'd have to double-check that too.</p>
<p>I think lots of people feel happy without second-guessing it, but when you're sad, you second-guess it to hell and back. &quot;Why do I feel like this? What's wrong with me? Why can't I just feel differently?&quot; Nobody does that when they're happy except me, heh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exact same with me. The days where I feel so so low wanting to die, I know it is just chemical at this point in my life but did not understand that before. </p>
<p>I really detested the idea of having to take medication every day for so long so I did not because I felt like I wouldn’t really be my “authentic” self. </p>
<p>My moods were really bad the past year, mostly depression more than manic and I finally went on lamictal and it has made such a difference. My psychiatrist told me just don’t think about it and give it a real shot before you decide to not take meds, just get up take your pills and move on. It made me sad to realize that I had chosen to suffer for so long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although I naturally have hard times and all that, I am happy like 97% of the time. And I don't mean content. I mean happy. Like, if I'm in the elevator by myself (or anywhere else I don't need to &quot;seem normal&quot;) I literally shake like a five-year-old that just inherited Willy Wonkas factory. </p>
<p>Although I would never trade it for depression, it sure gets tiring in the long run!</p>
<p>I guess one needs to figure out what one wants to do in one's life, then figure out exactly who one is, then decide what one need to do to make one's wish come through.</p></div>		</li>
