			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why I HATE it when someone says they won't get the vaccine because last time they got the flu shot they got the flu.  No you didn't.  Well, you might have gotten a different strain than what you got vaccinated for, but the actual vaccine didn't give you the flu!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They may have also just actually been unlucky and contracted influenza during the latency period (usually a couple of weeks) between when they got the vaccine and when it actually became effective. </p>
<p>In any case, I agree - still not a reason to not get the flu shot!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a retail CPhT. I don't even humor people who conspire against the flu shot. You want? No is a perfectly fine answer. Oh, it gave you the flu a day or 2 later? You were already sick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people confuse the flu with the common cold. I'm thinking the concentration of people sitting in chairs at the pharmacy waiting for the flu shot is enough to transmit the cold virus between people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happened to my daughter. I told her she needed the flu shot to prevent her from getting sick. She got sick two days after the shot and was mad at me because she felt like she got the shot for nothing. Hard to explain to a little kid about different strains of viruses and latency periods and how the vaccine is still helpful...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The flu shot is not 100% effective. However, an ineffective flu shot (meaning you got the shot, but still got the flu) can still drastically reduce the duration of the illness and severity. Additionally, RSV has flu like symptoms, but isn't even in the same viral family, so your flu vaccine won't help at all. </p>
<p>So, if someone says they got sick, despite having the flu shot, the two follow up questions - were you tested for it, and how long did it last?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is something I've had to explain to educated people too many times. Had a year when the majority of my other nurses on my floor ended up getting the flu and had people saying the flu shot was ineffective. I was like yeah we all got sick but we all had mild cases that was gone no more than a week. The flu shot worked. It didn't prevent infection but it sure as hell made it way less worse. I think the biggest thing is people have no idea how the flu actually feels. I had legit full blown flu as a child in the early 90s and I will never forget it because it was the first time in my life I thought I felt like I was actively dying. In and out of consciousness. It hit me on a school trip and I wanted to go to the bathroom because my nose was running and I was coughing so much. I got lost and ended up passing out on the floor. I barely remember being found and I was lying on what looked like a floor made from old barn wood. I was sick for around 2 weeks. Lying on the couch for days on end fever spiking and waking up drenched in sweat and trying to keep some semblance of hydration. I vomited multiple times from the amount of mucus and and coughing I was doing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In October 2018 I got a flu shot. I was 31 and healthy. In January 2019 I got influenza A. I was tested - yes, it was influenza A. I was bedridden for 9 days and at times sincerely doubted whether I was doing the right thing by avoiding the ER. </p>
<p>I tend to believe the flu vaccine <em>is</em> effective, even if you get the flu because you get less sick. In my opinion, I may have ended up in the hospital or worse if I hadn’t gotten my flu shot. I still got it in 2019 and will this year as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing a lot of people don't think about is that maybe the flu shot you got this year wasn't effective, or you would have never gotten the flu regardless, but maybe the strain you got this year is pretty close to a strain that evolutions 10-15-20 years down the line, and over the course of your life you've built up a pretty robust immunity to influenza.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s because people think the symptoms == the flu. So when they get fever, headaches, fatigue, etc. they say they have to flu, even if they’re not transmissible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Last year I got the flu shot (first in at least 10 years) and the day after, literally 24 hours from the shot, I had chills, body aches, fatigue, had to go home from work because I was so miserable. Next day I was fine. So the flu shot CAN give you symptoms, but it doesn't make you actually &quot;sick with the flu.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also has a lot to do with scale. Most vaccines have an adjuvant to trigger inflammation the same way an active virus would, which enhances the immune response, but in the vaccine the response is generally localized to the injection site, and in a virus that’s actively reproducing, the inflammation is more systemic because more cells are affected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got the flu shot last Thursday, and on Friday morning I had a low (+2 degree F) fever the entire day.. I woke up super groggy and tired, which was very unlike me. I was dragging ass all day and just felt exhausted, like I just needed more sleep. I ABSOLUTELY knew this was an immune response to the vaccination, and took it as easy as possible at work, drank lots of water and took an ibuprofen. The fever went away, but I was feverish for almost 24 hours. The next day I felt just fine. I definitely got a real vaccine ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have asthma, and get a flu shot every year, because I refuse to get the flu, and then a lovely helping of pneumonia if I can help it, I would like to not do a round of hospital, thanks.</p>
<p>Every year, within 24 hours, I get fatigue, mild fever, and I’m slightly achy. It’s my body going, “ohhhh, cool, let’s make antibodies.” After that? No more mild fever, fatigue, and achiness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fellow asthmatic, same thing. I commented early that I did get the flu one year, albeit a different strain from the one in the shot, and you know what? Still getting the flu shot this year. While it sucked, I wouldn't doubt the shot contributed to lessoning the symptoms. The last time I was near or at pneumonia stage was when I had a cold that kept getting worse and not better over weeks. Went to urgent care and they took one listen to my lungs and just gave me Z pack and a spare albuterol without even testing, cause of my lung history. The full blown flu felt like a speed run to that stage over mere hours versus weeks. Fortunately, I was able to take time off and sleep for several delirious days and avoid lung complications.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a similar response after my first flu shot. I talked to my pharmacist about it and he recommended acetaminophen. I try to plan my flu shot for a weekend in September where I can potentially just lay in bed and binge Netflix for a day and not have anything at all that I have to do. Now I start taking the recommended dose of Tylenol immediately after my flu shot and continue taking it for about 24-36 hours after and I have a much milder immune response. I still hangout and watch Netflix and give myself a little &quot;me time&quot; so I look forward to getting my flu shot. I also wonder that because I've been getting it for 7 years now my body is more used to the process and I just don't feel nearly as crummy as I did that very first time.</p></div>		</li>
