			<div class="markdown"><p>Well all it takes is a group of people either too pissed off or are willing to run the risks deciding that they want to unite . Theres some technical steps to it, but mostly thats how it starts.</p>
<p>Companies do everything in their power to stop it. There are just alot of laws protecting people from retribution. Theres also alot of ways bigger companys can skirt these rules. The most famous of them is Walmart. They will go as far as shutting an entire store down if there is even a whiff of unionization. If a single store unionizes, it can spread like wildfire through the a company of that size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's a fair point. What I was trying to communicate was that the workers don't have the opportunity to try and negotiate their own terms if they think that they can do better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, I think it comes down to the mindset of the person. I would rather negotiate a 3% annual raise for every employee in the company, than a 4% raise for myself.</p></div>		</li>
