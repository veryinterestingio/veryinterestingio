			<div class="markdown"><p>Somebody else sort of mentioned it, but didn't address your question directly. The diameter of a lightning bolt can, indeed, be extremely small. IIRC, standard air breaks down at about 3000V/mm. So, if you have a high voltage, but it's not as far away as from a cloud to ground, you end up with static shocks. It's the same thing, just really tiny. Shuffle your socks on a shag carpet and touch a doorknob and you get extremely small-diameter lightning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a vacuum you can get transmission of electricity by free electrons being emitted from metal surfaces, either due to the high temperature or the strong electric field. This is how a vacuum tube (which cathode ray tubes are an example of) functions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Garden-variety vacuum tubes aren't &quot;commonly known as cathode ray tubes.&quot; The term may technically be correct, but most people as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> use the term only when referring to a television display or other electrophosphorescent tube.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just CRTs. Thermionic valves/tubes and X-ray tubes work by emitting electrons that travel across a vacuum by high voltage potential difference.</p>
<p>In a tube, you control how many by applying a repelling voltage to a grid - kinda a screendoor in the way. Modulate the voltage on the grid, and the current through the tube changes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, mostly. Electricity can move though a vacuum under some conditions, like in a traditional CRT display which shoots electrons though the vacuum, but it cannot arc the way youâ€™re thinking of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a wonderful explanation, and somewhat amazingly there is a fairly practical way to confirm what the diameter of lightning is like, sometimes it forms tubes in the ground where it struck, I saw one of these labeled as a Lightning Fossil when I was just a kid, and considered it so cool that I still remember it after all this time.</p>
