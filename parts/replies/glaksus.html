			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok - did you know that the blue part of a candle flame isn't blue because it's so hot, it's actually due to a chemical reaction that glows blue?</p>
<p>The main yellowish part of a flame is super heated particles of crumpled up carbon ('soot') that shines the same way that the sun or a hot poker does. Every object actually produces light, depending on its temperature. It's just a hotter version of how humans glow in infrared. Even hotter things shine in blue/ultraviolet, which is why some stars have a blue look.</p>
<p>But that's not why candles have blue - they don't get hot enough for that. It's actually due to 'chemoluminescence', where as the hot soot particles react with oxygen to burn off they release blue light at some steps. At first glance the blue may seem to only be at the top of the flame, but if you look closer you can see there's actually a thin shell of it all around the edges where the oxygen is and the chemical burning is happening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh, and! If you want to capture some soot you can stick something cold in a flame. Like if you run a spoon over it, some of the soot will get stuck and cool enough that it can't burn. It kind of looks like the spoon is somehow getting singed but really you're just collecting smoke.</p>
<p>This is why passing a lighter over snow will leave black marks, and some poor confused folks on social media think that the snow is made of plastic. It does look weird if you don't know what's going on!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would, but it never gets the chance - as soon as it curls and pokes out of the side of the flame, it starts to burn itself down.</p></div>		</li>
