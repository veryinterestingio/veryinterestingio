			<div class="markdown"><p>An exception to this is voice dubbing into other languages. When dubbing anime to English, for example, the voice actors and the translators have to try to match their script to the existing mouth movements as much as possible so as not to give a &quot;bad kung fu movie&quot; feel to it. They call that &quot;matching the flaps&quot;. It's a fairly difficult skill from my understanding, and being able to do it well is a critical skill for folks who what to get into that part of voice acting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the main reason I can't enjoy dubbed anime. The contortions of language needed to make the mouth flaps line up just make all the dialog sound too awkward and cheesy. It's easier for me to read the translation and listen to the voice for the emotional content.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an odd thing to say though.  By reading subtitles rather than watching the mouth movements, your attention is being taken away from the animation and you're just trying to follow what's going on.</p>
<p>Anime tends to have less variation in mouth shapes.  It's often just a person's mouth opening and closing in a very basic way.  There's little variation of how a character's mouth is drawn between a vowel and a consonant sound, let alone different consonants like 'nnnn' or 'mmm' or 'ffff'.</p>
<p>That's done for a few reasons.  It's cheaper, faster to animate, and it also makes it easier to be dubbed in a different language. Even if the dubbing isn't done perfectly, as long as the voice acting is done well you wouldn't notice much of a difference.  It's even true for many high-budget animated movies like most things Ghibli's done.</p>
<p>Compare that to a Disney animated movie like Aladdin or The Little Mermaid.  They match the actual sound created by the voice actor to the animation they're drawing, so even if you were deaf and were just reading lips, you might be able to tell what they're saying. (the human characters at least)</p>
<p>That makes it very difficult to dub into a different language without it appearing really unnatural.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect. We animate to the sound files. They do not talk over our animation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So on the pre-recorded scenes do the animaters know the exact moment the mouth <em>should</em> start moving by listening to the audio as they animate? If so do they listen to the audio <strong>a lot</strong> while animating a scene?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes. You have your sound file and usually animate the mouth shape on every 2nd frame. You scrub through your time line and match mouth shapes to audio sound on that frame. It's quite a slow process. It's not too bad on dialogue. It's brain mushing on any sort of song (I'm looking at your pre school kids TV)</p></div>		</li>
