			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember seeing it all the time when out biking around dusk. Still light enough out that I can see my tires in natural light, and they appear to move the correct way, but when im riding under a streetlight (the old yellow sodium vapor ones) Id notice my wheels look like they're going backwards.</p></div>		</li>
