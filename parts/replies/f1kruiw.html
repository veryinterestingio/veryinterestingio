			<div class="markdown"><p>I tried another redditors technique to stop the ringing, and it worked for me. Try covering both ears with you palms, fingers pointing towards the soft part of your skull. Tap you skull with your fingers while your palms cover your ears. Good luck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I saw that recently too, possibly the same post you saw. And it works, it does greatly reduce the tinnitus but doesn't get rid of it completely or for more than a few minutes.
My tinnitus is caused by drug interactions and hearing loss.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An easier method that works for me is to just make a quiet, high pitched sound with my voice. The ringing goes away immediately.</p>
<p>The only complication is that I'm a bass, so it's hard to pitch high enough all the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My doctor pronounces it the 'other' way as well, but my old docs in my home country pronounce it with the &quot;eye&quot;. It's kind of like &quot;me grain&quot; vs &quot;my grain&quot; for migraine.</p></div>		</li>
