<p>About the edge of the galaxy, I had assumed that there would be no clear indication of that - we can't event tell where <em>exactly</em> the Solar system ends as far as I understand - but I did expect there to not be total darkness looking into outer space. More like a dimmed version of the starry sky we have on Earth.</p>
<p>Also, when looking back towards the Milky Way, am I correct to think that it would be pretty similar to what we see on Earth today, maybe a bit more concentrated in a certain part of the sky? I'm thinking that we're not very far from the edge of the galaxy either (relatively speaking).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're about half way out, depending on how you count it - like 30,000 light years from the centre. You do see the Milky Way as a full 180Â° band around the sky (you don't see it all at once because the ground is in the way, but you do get to see much of it throughout a year, or even through a night as the Earth rotates), but it is a bit thinner as you look &quot;out&quot; vs &quot;in&quot;. But towards the centre there's a lot of dust so it's not super bright, and the contrast isn't as extreme as you might expect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looking again at models of where we are exactly, I realize that I really underestimated how far out the galaxy extends beyond us. I find it kind of difficult working in that scale.</p>
<p>Even with the dust, just looking toward the center on a clear night at a higher altitude makes it stand out pretty clearly, when compared to the other areas of the visible sky.</p>
<p>Thanks for clearing that up!</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's crazy, I never really thought about that! So if you walk closer to a lightbulb, it doesn't really get brighter per unit angular diameter, but just takes up more space in your field of view, giving the illusion of getting brighter? Does that mean that as the Andromeda galaxy approaches, it won't get brighter in the sky, just larger?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The <em>total power</em> you get does increase as you get closer, but the <em>power per square degree of sky</em> doesn't change. So yeah, Andromeda won't really get brighter in terms of surface brightness (maybe a little bit because there'll be less dust in the way) but we will be getting more total light from it, because it'll take up more of the sky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thanks for your post.</p>
<p>the fact we only see stars within 2k ly but we are 30k ly from both the centre and the edge of the milky way really put things in perspective. we really don't see much with the naked eye.</p>
<p>is this true of the best viewing conditions or just with the effects of light pollution?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is indeed true even in ideal viewing conditions. Most of the stars are just too far away to be bright enough to be visible with the naked eye.</p></div>		</li>
