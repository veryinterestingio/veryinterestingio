			<div class="markdown"><p>Without going into specific details, I'd point out that the targeting laser not only is a specific wavelength (frequency, or &quot;color&quot;), it's also modulated (pulsed, kind of like Morse Code) with a specific code that is individualized for each missile, so multiple missiles in one theater won't get mixed up and target the same contacts. It also prevents an enemy combatant from overriding the targeting laser by pointing a laser with the same wavelength at a different (and possibly friendly to the drone) contact.</p>
<p>Edit: BUT WHAT ABOUT THE MIRRORS!?! What have I started?</p>
<p>OK, so in lieu of typing this out many times or cutting and pasting it, here's that answer:</p>
<p>Mirrors can be effective, for a moment. The Hellfire missile is guided by the laser that's actively pointed (&quot;painted&quot;) on a target. The operator either has direct visual contact or visible and infrared camera view on the target throughout the flight of the missile. Should a target put up a mirror, the operator can simply move the laser a couple feet to avoid the mirror, which they will definitely see. The missile also has fire-and-forget capability, where the missile can be instructed to aim toward the Last Known Good coordinate and not rely on the laser at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Laser countermeasure systems actually work by figuring out the modularation and then beaming it back at the missile. Direct infrared countermeasure systems work on the same way only it's an infrared laser.</p>
<p>The problem was that the processing power to do this was hard now it's easy so inside of the F-22 for example is a radar that can literally understand the modulation of radio waves being beamed into it figure that out and beam it back. beam shaping and waveform manipulation allows full control over the EM spectrum. not to get too in the details but the radar on the F-22 is actually technically a electromagnetic weapon, it can burn out other radars, spoof signals and paint ghosts radar signatures. They really don't want to take about it but if you look you can find more stuff.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>When first used, being able to bomb a city from the air was a new high tech weapon.   Instead of having to have artillery close enough to hit the city you could just use aircraft.  Precision weapons are superior because they are less wasteful in that you need less of them and they expose your own troops less to take out a target.   In WWII you would need a squadron of planes to take out a factory, today it would be one.  </p>
<p>The Atomic bomb did less damage than fire bombing cities but changed things because it was now one plane for one city vs hundreds of planes and hours to days of bombing vs 1 bomb for the same effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Detecting the drone is hard. however a lot of new Armoured vehicles are bringing in &quot;hard-kill&quot; Active defense systems that use RADAR and other sensors to at least detect incoming projectiles. Examples of these systems would be Trophy, Arena, or the old Russian Drozd systems.</p>
<p>Russia claims its New system on the T-14 MBTs can intercept projectiles at Mach 5, and might be able to improve that so speed it not a problem. Guided missiles are fast, but not as fast as something like a Modern Sabot round which can go bout 1,500-1,800 Metres per second. Hellfires go about 400-500mps.  </p>
<p>A lot of people think you need to shoot down the drone, but that's not the case. Purpose built sensors and hard-kill systems can detect and kill the missiles. giving the armoured vehicle time to escape, or retaliate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It’s more desirable to take out the platform launching (or directing) ordnance at you, but not at the expense of ignoring the closing, fast-mover.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not likely to be IR, its generally visible light as that will reflect off the surface and scatter.</p>
<p>And the laser guided arms race has already happened so people thought about jammers and preventing jammers.  These days the laser target designator the drone has is going to be using a laser that is sending out pulses in a specific pattern that the missile is looking for.  If you were to illuminate the area with that same exact pattern you might trip it up but it'll still land pretty close, but you're unlikely to find the pattern in the time you have so your best bet would be blanketing the area in the same color but the receiver is going to be super sensitive so it'll still pick out its coded laser.</p>
<p>You could also just try blinding the warhead by shining bright lasers at it, but since you have no more than 24 seconds to get your jamming in you're probably not going to succeed, and close drone strikes could be down to 5 seconds or less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Incorrect.</p>
<p>Nearly all military designators are 1064 nm wavelength. Which is IR. Mainly because they propagate well through the atmosphere, and are not visible to the naked eye but extremely visible under NVGs ...which we're usually the only ones using</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The following is not classified, and references Joint Pub 3-09.1:</p>
<p>The laser designator is some form of IR, using a pulse repetition frequency. A numerical prf code is agreed upon and thus, death from above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Half right: Not only are the targeting lasers pulsed, they're modulated to a specific, unique code for a single missile, so there's no interference with multiple targets and missiles on a battlefield, and it's much harder to spoof or jam.</p>
<p>When a targeting laser (sometimes ground-vehicle mounted or handheld and on the shoulder of a ground troop) is linked to a drone, it sends its modulation code to the missile launching vehicle so the missile knows what pattern of pulses to look for.</p>
<p>But they absolutely are IR, and that's not even classified. They center around 1064nm. IR scatters and reflects just like visible light does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats not beam riding. </p>
<p>Beam riding is where the receiving sensor is on the back of the munition, and the munition can gauge whether or not its inside the beam (which remains pointed at the target). </p>
<p>When the receiver is on the front of the munition, such as in the case of the LJDAM, and the Hellfire, the munition is guiding on the reflected signal from the target rather than the emission from the designator. This is called Semi-Active Laser Homing, and is quite distinct from Beam Riding.</p></div>		</li>
