			<div class="markdown"><p>Contamination does not necessarily mean 'goodbye'... amount and type matters.  </p>
<p>How much ingested and of what type.  Heavy metals can take a long time to process through body, or accumulate in certain tissue such as radioactive iodine in the thyroid (hence why you give people exposed to contamination iodine pills in order to saturate the thyroid with safe iodine). </p>
<p>If the contamination on someone can give a lethal exposure to someone with incidental contact, you're going to have massive areas between where exposure happened and where contact happened with catastrophic contamination...</p>
<p>Removing clothing and a quick shower down should be sufficient to get rid of most contamination.</p>
<p>I have not seen the show, so cant opine on what was depicted there.  But obviously the Hollywood fear-mongering around radiation is usually relatively divorced from reality.</p>
<p>Curious about your source of info on fetus versus mother radiation susceptibility.  Not saying you're wrong, but that seems like a rather complex situation that would have a massive number of variables.  Eg, fetus not breathing air so would not have lungs directly exposed to contamination like the mother would. <em>edit: fetus would almost certainly be more susceptible to a same dose to tissue, but the means of exposure would be very different and I'd expect a fetus to get a much lower dose than certain tissues of the mother (lungs/intestines)</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hes completly right with the featus the the relative biosensitivity to radiation is different for every organ, i was in a radiobio lab for a few weeks and i learned a lot about what it does to featuses, the developemtal damage is catastrophic, the earlier in the pregnancy the greater the damage obviously, interestingly the different stages of development heavily impact the type of deformity etc that occurs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a like dose amount, would assume so.  So I guess that comment is likely correct, but that doesn't remotely characterize the situation presented here.  For surface contamination, you'd need to model out how that contamination translates to a dose to specific tissues.  Mother is doing the swallowing and the breathing, not the fetus.  I'd assume the mother is getting far higher overall dose at the lungs and intestines, etc, not via the blood stream (other than perhaps the thyroid).</p>
<p>Yes, different tissues do have different radiosensitivity, most notably due to rate of cell division, oxygen level and metabolic rate. But the overall description by the other guy is lacking a bit. S/He is conflating long-term and short-term impact radiation damage, and I doubt you can get short-term radiation sickness from surface contamination... and if you could, everyone in the larger area would eventually die from cancer in any event.  For long-term impact of radiation you're talking about cancer, not cell death.  For that rapidly dividing tissues are more susceptible less b/c the DNA is more likely to be damaged, but rather that dividing cells are more likely to end up propagating many damaged cells more prone to going cancerous...</p></div>		</li>

<p>It’s actually a bit of both. There’s a bit of fear-mongering, but a lot of the attitude in the show is designed to reflect the (flawed) understanding of radiation sickness, etc of the time period. The series’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_(miniseries\)#Historical_accuracy" target="_blank">Wikipedia entry</a> has some good discussion on the show’s accuracy and some artistic license</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>HIV is now considered as a serious but manageable disease in a lot of countries (where there is access to affordable treatment, at least). In the 1980s, HIV was <em>the</em> boogeyman. The public was terrified and almost certain that it could be transmitted via skin-to-skin and fomites. Princess Diana shaking hands with a HIV+ patient was a huge, huge deal at the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, thanks.  Does sound like another case of artist license pushing misunderstanding about radiation risks.  I get why they do it, just annoying when that misinformed fear drives resistance to nuclear power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actual nuclear scientists &amp; people who were there have said the series gets most of the science wrong, to the point of being fearmongering. Example: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelshellenberger/2019/06/11/top-ucla-doctor-denounces-depiction-of-radiation-in-hbos-chernobyl-as-wrong-and-dangerous/" target="_blank">https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelshellenberger/2019/06/11/top-ucla-doctor-denounces-depiction-of-radiation-in-hbos-chernobyl-as-wrong-and-dangerous/</a></p>
<p>It also gets the late-80s Soviet system almost completely wrong: <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/what-hbos-chernobyl-got-right-and-what-it-got-terribly-wrong" target="_blank">https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/what-hbos-chernobyl-got-right-and-what-it-got-terribly-wrong</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've heard and read from real scientists it's basically anti-nuclear fear mongering. Even historical events are made up; like at one point they say everyone in town who watched it from a bridge became sick and died, when in fact almost no one in that town got sick. I only watched the first episode, it's definitely entertaining but it's wildly inaccurate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was very interested when first read about it, but from what i read it did a reasonable job of telling what happened but a shit job of two things -- correct science around radiation exposure &amp; accurate depiction of soviet-decision making in crisis (more about accepted bureaucratic incompetence than people being threatened to be shot).</p>
<p>If anything akin to what OP described is portrayed in the show, then it got the science completely wrong.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah just no.</p>
<p>If you were to eat metallic uranium enriched to 5% (like it gets used as fuel in nuclear reactors) you would die of heavy metal poisoning long before you die of radiation poisoning.</p>
<p>Furthermore you ingest radioactive carbon and potassium every single day. And guess what. You are still alive.</p></div>		</li>
