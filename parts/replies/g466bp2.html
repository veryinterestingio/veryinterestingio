			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand the heads are not any more a significant source of methanol than any other part of the distillate because Methanol is not a significant part of a mash anyway, I make beer and cider with the same process and drink all of it, I'm not taking the heads or tails off of anything when I do that.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct.</p>
<p>The Heads and Tails <em>do,</em> however, contain high concentrations of other contaminants that'll do a number on your insides. Acetone, acetaldehyde, etc. Heads and Tails are discarded for more than just taste reasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Homebrewer with an understanding of distillation here.  When brewing beer we can't functionally pitch a portion of the alcohol, so we typically focus a lot on temp control and healthy yeasts to minimize off flavors and methanol production.  Distillers usually ferment their wort hotter and faster, resulting in more of the incorrect (non-ethanol) alcohols, but it's not a problem for them because it naturally gets separated in the start of the distillation process as the still heats up (methanol boils at 148F, ethanol at 173).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heads definitely contain higher levels of methanol especially when making something like vodka where a high degree of separation occurs. If you think about it, beer can have as much as 200 ppm methanol and is around 10-12 proof while vodka must be no more than 10 ppm methanol and has to be 80 proof or higher (i.e. much more concentrated). The separation of that methanol (148.5° F boiling point) and ethanol (173.1° F boiling point) absolutely occurs at the beginning (coldest part) of the distillation.</p></div>		</li>
