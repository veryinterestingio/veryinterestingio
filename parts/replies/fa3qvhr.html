<p>Aren't five year olds like watching cartoons and playing bubble bobble? I dont know. It's been a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean ELI5 itself is a hyperbole and isn't meant to be understood literally, but I believe there's an informal concensus that things should be explained in layman's terms with no prior understanding of underlying concepts.</p>
<p>That being said; five year olds are often incredibly cognitive and actually manage to grasp rather complex concepts.</p>
<p>I work seasonally as a ski instructor and I've taught 7 year olds about centrifugal and centripetal forces in order for them to understand their skiing better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wasn't even thinking of that. Industry standards tend to be strict. In the DIY sections you can get horrendous materials to turn into &quot;beauty products&quot;. Some of the &quot;natural&quot; abrasive materials look like gravel, and have about the same effect. </p>
<p>Soap bar, pH10 because it wasn't stored for long enough, with crushed almond shell added as a &quot;natural&quot; exfoliating spa treatment. No matter what skin type, that stuff's a nightmare. But it's home-made, from lovely-sounding ingredients, what could possibly go wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How are you supposed to crush almond shells at home? </p>
<p>I understand reduce/re-use/ recycle and being thrifty so I can appreciate good DYI to a point but I find that point getting smaller. A lot of the internet DIY advice is stupid, dangerous, and immensely time consuming. My favorites include heating glass peanut jars in the microwave to melt that last bit of peanut butter...congratulations you have a hot jar with no handle.  Another favorite is to disinfect sponges in the microwave, which heats a moist sponge to steaming, burning levels and can cause a dry sponge to combust.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I bought my bath scrub ages ago, it's a frilly mesh glued into a sphere and since lost it's shape, I was thinking of replacing it as the abrasion is wearing off too. But that's when I realise my exfoliating got better. I already knew I scrub way too hard but as a result my skin has been way less sensitive.<br />
I have decided not to replace it. It's been months. Yay me.</p></div>		</li>
