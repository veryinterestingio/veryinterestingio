			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn’t quite work. The pH scale scale as you have used is for water solutions and based on the hydrogen activities in water (not concentrations).</p>
<p>To do what you have done, and try and compare hydrogen activities in different media, requires a universal pH scale. A group achieved this back in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201000252" target="_blank">2011</a>. They assign gaseous protons as relative 0 chemical potential and calculated the various activities from there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s different because it takes into account the relative chemical potentials (via activities) of a proton in a range of different chemical environments. </p>
<p>The standard pH scale can only be used where the hydronium ion is the dominant acidic species as it’s based on its equilibrium with water. And so is useless for very strong acids (e.g. conc H2SO4 where H3SO4+ is the acidic species) or for other media (e.g. gas phases or other solvents).</p>
<p>So you’d only need to ‘convert’ to the universal if you want to compare the acidity of acids in different phases, or to get an idea of gas phase acidities for example.</p></div>		</li>

<p>pH is the minis log (base 10) of the concentration of hydrogen ions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the definition for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH#p[H]" target="_blank">p[H]</a>. There's nearly no distinction between pH and p[H] for aqueous solutions, but it may not be what the OP had in mind. The pH can be used to quantify the chemical potential of the proton in any environment, which is a broader definition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you’ve maybe over-constrained your thinking to real systems. If every atom in the universe became hydrogen per OPs suggestion then no chemical potential would exist and the concept of activity would disappear. The argument can then <em>only</em> be boiled down to simple tautologies. </p>
<p>Without ion activity or chemical potential as a concept p[H] and pH are not different in the system and therefore 1 kg of matter made 100% from atoms with a molecular weight of 1 g/mol by definition has a concentration of 1000 M and that tautology provides a self defining limit. </p>
<p>When you consider real systems it almost becomes an ignostic argument of defining what you mean by ‘pH’ before debating it and I’m not sure you’d ever get a universal answer!</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not sure why you keep writing this. A concentration of 1000 M corresponds to 1000 moles per liter. You know that a liter of matter doesn't generally correspond to 1 kg, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't, that's it's Hammet acidity function, which is a different thing, measuring its ability to force protons onto stuff. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidity_function" target="_blank">here</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so pH is limited means of measuring acids and alkalines, and the hammet acidity function is for measuring super acids or very highly concentrated acids? something to do with glass electrodes idk lol. so basically super acids don't have a pH?</p></div>		</li>
