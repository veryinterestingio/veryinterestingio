			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s scary how little science actually knows about the brain, beyond theories. Most stuff you read about “discoveries” in various threads on here are just theories that, as you say, can neither be proven or disproven. We don’t know how anti depressants actually work, for example, we only have a theory. The brain is so unbelievably complex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re completely right. Sorry to be that guy, but I just want to point out that the word “theory” in science means something different from the word “theory” as we usually mean it. Theories are built out of facts and experimentally confirmed predictions. Examples of theories include classical mechanics, atomic theory, quantum theory, the theory of relativity, the theory of evolution, gene theory, cell theory, germ theory, etc. Theories are strong. </p>
<p>I think you might mean “hypothesis”. The brain is so complex that we do not yet have a theory of how it works. All we have is a collection of hypotheses. :) </p>
<p>But to answer OP, you might want to read about the idea of an <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engram_(neuropsychology)" target="_blank">engram</a>. Memories are stored in many different ways, but one way is that they are stored in patterns of connections between brain cells. Other people have indirectly mentioned this idea by talking about the hippocampus, which is one part of the brain that plays an important role in directing the formation of engrams (patterns of neuronal connections).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The kicker is that all of our knowledge is 'just theories'. When you know something, it means that you have a model that predicts your observations. We'll never know anything that's not a theory because knowledge is always going to be abstractions in our minds.  </p>
<p>That being said I agree that we currently don't have a great set of fundamental ideas to explain how the brain does things, beyond that neurons are somehow representing information through chemical/electrical activity and connectivity patterns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have several theories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your memories are not like computer files they are more like a series of &quot;clues&quot;: your five senses and emotions factor into memories</li>
<li>A theory about sleep and dreams is that (among other things) it's memory consolidation.  Your brain organizes memories while you sleep - one correlation is that people who learn new things in a classroom or formal training report lots of dreams when they sleep.</li>
<li>Some memories fade or become disjointed because they are not used.  That person from your teen years that interacted with -a lot - is now &quot;the dude with the shirt&quot; because the memories weren't used, or weren't used that much.</li>
<li>You can recover some of that, so when the &quot;the dude with the shirt&quot; send you a FB request, your brain will try to get as much as it can - but will fill in the blanks with new information.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key takeaway is that memory isn't like a DVD or a photograph - it's a living thing that can be replenished or &quot;die&quot; based on how it's used.</p></div>		</li>
