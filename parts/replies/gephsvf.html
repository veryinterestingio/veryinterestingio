			<div class="markdown"><p>so why can't some form of refraction/manipulation of the light help? i remember shining a light through that transparent pyramid in physics that would separate the colors. why can't there just be that and a solar panel for where each of the different colors hit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The actual answer is that instead of that, we make multi-junction solar cells. Imagine two layers of solar cell material with different sized electrical junctions. If you layer the cell with the larger junction on top, that layer takes care of your high energy photons, and let’s the lower energy photons pass through. The 2nd layer with the smaller junction then can collect some of the lower energy photons. In principle, you can create many of these layers and cover more of the spectrum. The issue is that these types of cells show diminishing returns; they’re costly to manufacture. On top of that, there are greater complexities at the interface/surface of these cells too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding of your idea is that we place a digestive prims or grating to pre separate the light and then direct the ideal wavelength onto the ideal solar panel. Practically, a prism or grating has angular separation. Over small distances, angular separation is not laterally separate. You can overcome this in 2 ways, make the distances large, and make the input lateral wondow small (pass the light through a slit before the prism). Both of these add complexity and remove usable light (slit is obvious, but large distance requires one window being spread out into a bigger area, when you could just use many windows.)  I don't know if anyone is working on this kind of stuff, but it doesn't strike me as promising.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So this type of solar cell does exist, but think of it in more practical terms. If you shine a flash light through a prism, how much surface area does the refracted rainbow take up compared to the incoming light. The answer is much more. So to your point we can make this, but in reality it takes up more surface area because the array of cells for specific colors of light is much greater than the area where the light if refracted. </p>
<p>In reality it's better to just use less efficient cells that cover more area. We always talk about solar cell efficiency because you can get more power by one of two ways. 1) Increase the energy source. 2) Collect more of the energy source you are given. There is no way that we can make the sun shine brighter, therefore the only way to get more power is increase efficiency. </p>
<p>The one exception to this would be a design where we focus the sun's light over a large area into a single spot like a giant magnifying glass. In this case it would make sense to use this type of cell and there is some work in this. In practice there are a lot of engineering issues that make this difficult to execute.</p></div>		</li>
