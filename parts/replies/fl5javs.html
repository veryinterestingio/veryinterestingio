			<div class="markdown"><p>From the current top comment, it seems more pipeline in a programming sense. As a program first needs to run A followed by B then lastly C. If everything needs to be done sequentially, then making each calculation faster would help. </p>
<p>This is higher level than what I really talked about and more related to how core count has been increasing instead of clock speed. Since each core can work on tasks in parallel that is another way of increasing computation speed. </p>
<p>I don't see anything about L3 though, and that's a whole other topic. Sometimes programs can be sped up by having memory that can be quickly accessed. L3 is a cache that can accessed faster than RAM and hard drives. So that's a whole other optimization we can make instead of just increasing clock speed.</p></div>		</li>
