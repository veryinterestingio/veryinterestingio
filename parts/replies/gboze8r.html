<p>I'm scared to ask, but what about sounds that hurt other parts of the body? For example, people who speak with sharp sibilant &quot;s&quot; sounds drive me crazy, because it hurts to hear. Why is this, and is it possible to get over this? I actually avoid my mother because of this.</p></div>		</li>
