			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also similar to how <del>noice</del> noise cancelling headphones work. They will usually have some microphone to listen to the noise around you, and then output sound waves that cancel out the noise.</p>
<p>Edit: As some have pointed out, I forgot to add that this is regarding active noise cancelling.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's like using a jet pack to cross the street when you can just walk.</p>
<p>Live music is normally recorded from the soundboard (mixer).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly, as digital audio codecs are used. While the MCU in the phone knows exactly what it asked the hardware codec to make, it also knows it will not match what is actually produced by the speaker, since the latter will render the sound slightly differently based on age,temperature, manufacturing. Audio codecs are also pretty destructive, since we want to transmit voices using the least possible data (wireless bandwidth is a rare and expensive resource).</p>
<p>Usually the same hardware codec chip is used for input and output, so there is the option to try to cancel the echo, but it usually does not completely suppress it. </p>
<p>Dropped audio usually happens when the signal strengh is at its limit, which tend to happen when people swarm the phone. Fancy cell phones are pretty, but there is a price for not having an external antenna... </p>
<p>(i engineer digital radios systems, which face similar issues as cellphone systems, with even less bandwidth available)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So there's not any kind of calculated subtraction?  If not then how is there not insane echo where your phone speaker picks up the other person's voice?  I realize that sometimes there is. But usually it seems like there's not.</p>
<p>Seems like you woukd just so this in the analog phase of signal path maybe so codecs aren't in the loop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes there is, but there is nearly no analog processing anymore, just some little filters to make the signal cleaner before it reaches the codec chip. </p>
<p>Most of the job is done once digitized, by the codec in hardware, and by software filters after that. The codec is basically a simplified DSP that is specialized in processing voices in and out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not ELI5 by any means, but search the web for the &quot;cocktail party problem&quot;. You'll find algorithms that are able to use multiple audio sources (like the speaker output and microphones) at the same time, and they're able to separate them from each other almost completely.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It actually goes a little farther than this. Current &quot;phone quality&quot; audio is meant to match the hardware limitations of original landline telephone networks. The final leg of these networks is the connection from the local switchboard to your home telephone through a pair of wires that can span up to 2km of distance. The parasitic inductance and capacitance of these wires severely degrade the audio signal.</p>
<p>So while yes, this degraded audio signal contains less information and is easier to compress, an audio engineer designing a digital network today would probably never have decided to compress it quite so far.</p>
<p>Also worth noting that audio compression in phone calls is specifically designed for human voice. The phone is basically reconstructing what you said by combining tones similarly to how your vocal cords actually work. This allows better compression than an arbitrary waveform (like MP3), but it also makes things like hold music sound like complete garbage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No so sure about that now, the RTC seems to be abandoned now. Cell phone operators typically do not have to reproduce DTMFs for example. This is a major problem for some legacy uses. </p>
<p>I do agree codecs are pretty specific to voice. We use a constant rate codec that uses 300bytes per second for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except it doesn't always work! The signal recorded by the microphone is different than the signal output by the speaker, modified by the room acoustics (reflections, delays, and absorption from walls, ceilings, etc.) Echo cancellation algorithms struggle when the room acoustics change more quickly than they can adapt. Move your laptop around on a zoom call, and you'll see how quickly other people ask you to mute when you are not talking, to stop an unintentional distorted echo.</p></div>		</li>
