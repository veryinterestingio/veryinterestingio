			<div class="markdown"><p>I was taught that in music theory, most songs start and end on the same base note, or Do in Solfege for example. As the song continues, the notes is going to change from Do, usually higher than the base note. If we don't hear the song end on the base note, it'll usually lead to us wanting to resolve that sound.</p>
<p>For example, on Solfege- Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti Do.
Ti usually wants to land on Do. If you keep hearing Ti without it landing on Do, chances are you'd be unsettled from not having the sound resolved.</p>
<p>You can test this theory on an online piano. If you look up where middle C is, you can play the note behind middle C (in this case, B) and hear it want to resolve. Or not, but I'd say for most you would.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it completely.  So, I was binging Friends (don't judge) and kept hitting Skip Intro right on the lyric &quot;so no one told you life was gonna be this way......&quot; with the &quot;wayyyy&quot; being Re, and I think it's the VII chord - pretty unresolved.  And that damn song has been stuck in my head for days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not too familiar with chords off the top of my head but upon further googling, I found that a vii chord is a diminished chord, which has a tendency to feel like it wants to resolve. So that would make sense.</p>
<p>As for Re, iirc Are wants to resolve on Mi so if you ever hear that you'd probably be fine :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OMFG!! This must be intentional cuz the same exact thing happens to us! We will just randomly start humming the song and be like wtf why. And now it makes perfect sense</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite possibly. But for me, if something doesn't end in a satisfying manner, I tend to have it stuck in my head until it gets resolved. Like cliffhangers in a sense, but in music. Of course it could also just be catchy tunes.</p></div>		</li>
