			<div class="markdown"><p>Well over a year. Spiders are basically immortal in some respects, and super fragile in other respects. They don't sleep, they can go without fresh air for months, and can go without food or water for a long time. But if you drop a tarantula a few inches they can shatter. They are weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got a male grammastola rosea as he was nearing the end of his life, for my first (and so far only) tarantula. He was the same, never ate, but he did always drain his little water bowl super quickly? I’d always find him hanging out in there lol. He didn’t eat at all in the time I had him, but he lasted almost a year til he died. I knew it was coming, but man you really get attached to pets!</p></div>		</li>
