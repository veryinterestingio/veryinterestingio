<p>The issue here was caused in a big part from pollution from Canadian coal plants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not sure about how much coal Canada has historically produced. Relative to the large reserves located in the eastern US, it was probably a lot less. I think you are referring to nickel plants which Canada still has many of and were certainly a significant source of acidifying pollution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah yes, Sudbury and the big nickel mine, because of its pollution the Sudbury area was home to one of the worlds largest and most successful reforestation projects.I remember as a kid driving up north and there were no trees, just rock, it has changed significantly because of the acid rain problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When we drove into Rouyn-Noranda for a geology field trip, the old field geologist pointed out the tree line - the point up to where pollution had killed everything. Growth up there is so slow comparatively that all there is past that line towards the smelter is large bushes and grasses. But, it's growing back slowly, which is super cool. :)</p>
<p>The kill line made the geology really, really easy to see. Very interesting to study. Still glad to see it bouncing back though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That might be correct.  I mostly remember that the source was blowing down from there.  I could be wrong about what was producing the pollution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not coal production, it was coal fired power plants. Ontario had a huge number, including the largest in North America (Nanticoke). However, as of 2014 all of them have been shut in, decommissioned, or in the case of a select number, converted to biomass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ontario used to have a modest amount of coal, but a lot of it actually came from Pennsylvania and Ohio (and even some within Western NY) which had a lot of coal plants. The EPA clean air act amendments in 1990 started regulating emissions affecting acid rain and ozone and had a huge impact on forcing those plants to take steps to reduce the damage they were doing to the â€˜dacks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Specifically in the Adirondacks, while the effects of acid rain have been slowly improving, the effects on the associated species has not. I believe I read that native trout occupy only 2% of their original habitat. While restocking is helping place fish back into lakes, the stocked trout are not native. The acidity in many lakes was offset by natural limestone deposits in bedrock, but after decades of exposure to high acid levels, there is reduced limestone surface in contact with waterways and therefore a reduced ability to buffer any future increases in acid rain levels.</p>
<p>To me these are both great reasons to ensure that we have continued regulations limiting emissions. My source for the above is the ADK magazine which regularly publishes articles on the region.</p></div>		</li>
