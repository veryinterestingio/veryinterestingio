			<div class="markdown"><p>A common hack was to use a bit of overexposed and developed film. A layer or two look pretty much completely black, but pass IR very well. If I understand correctly this is actually by design- so the film doesn't heat up from IR during projection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but mostly no.  Many cameras have IR filters so now you're blocking everything.  Some don't or it's weak enough you can still see IR as in the &quot;see if your remote works&quot; trick so then you are not really making an IR camera, just filtering out more visible stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've got an old digital camera that either doesn't have an IR filter built in or has a very weak one, and I can use it for IR photography by layering a bunch of gel filters of different colours together, since they're designed to absorb certain colours of visible light while allowing IR through to prevent overheating from being placed in front of high wattage spotlights.  The same trick doesn't work with any other digital cameras I have because they all have strong IR filters built into them.  Opening a camera up to remove the filter is a bit risky and I've read that it can alter the focus and cause blurring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you really wanted to make an IR camera you’d have better luck removing the IR filter it most likely has, then using a filter that’s as transparent as possible to IR while opaque to visible.</p></div>		</li>
