			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this answer because it highlights that the church was really the only authority that could have made something like this stick during the middle ages, because they were spread into every &quot;jurisdiction&quot; and had a large amount of influence in all of them. Any such decree made by a secular ruler would have ended at their border, but the Pope could just say &quot;No, this is how it is, Today is Friday, October 15th&quot; and every church would follow along.</p>
<p>It didn't hurt that in most of the Western world at that time, the clergy (and people they trained) were the only ones literate enough to maintain or even need an accurate calendar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That, and the church was largely responsible for the keeping of time. Before the spread of mechanical clocks through the villages of Europe in the 14th-16th century, time was kept by the local priest or brothers from the nearby monastery ringing the hours of the day (matins, vespers, et cetera) from the local belltower. Sundials, huge hourglasses, and water-clocks eventually gave way to mechanical public clocks, first in the big cities where accurate timekeeping was essential for the timely conduct of daily business, then later in the smaller towns and villages as a way for particularly successful members of the rising mercantile class to flaunt their wealth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The church also had a vested interest in getting the calendar right because they needed to correctly observe the different feast days. Some were based on a day, some on the day of the week, others on the phase of the moon. As a result, the Pope ran a very sophisticated observatory and kept astronomers on staff. Their primary job was to keep the calendar in sync.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really true, by 1582 it wasn't really the &quot;middle ages&quot; anymore and <em>plenty</em> of people other than the clergy were literate and had the need for an accurate calendar.</p>
<p>There was also this big thing going on called the Protestant Reformation where significant chunks of Europe wanted nothing to do with the Catholic church. For example, Britain didn't adopt the calendar until 1752 (for a bit of fun try opening up the terminal on a Unix-like system and type <code>cal 9 1752</code>).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Best example:. Russia, who didn't switch until 1918.  Also relevant:. Orthodox churches still use the Julian calendar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, Orthodox churches differ in their use of the Julian calendar. While all orthodox churches use the lunar part of the Julian calendar to calculate moveable feasts (like Easter), for the solar part of the calendar, some churches accepted the change made in 1923 and some didn’t. This is why some Orthodox churches (like Russia, Serbia, Montenegro and North Macedonia) celebrate Christmas on 6 January (Gregorian) while others (like Greece, Cyprus and Romania) celebrate it on 25 December.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it didn't. Thursday, October 4th 1582 was followed by Friday, October 15th 1582. Note that this means that the Gregorian and Julian calendars had different days of the week for the same date. October 15th 1582 in the Julian Calendar was a Monday (corresponding to October 25th in the Gregorian Calendar).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/06/16/my-first-billg-review/" target="_blank">There's actually a really cool story of why this is from Joel Spolsky:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1900 wasn’t a leap year.</p>
<p>“It’s a bug in Excel!” I exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Well, not really,” said Ed. “We had to do it that way because we need to be able to import Lotus 123 worksheets.”</p>
<p>“So, it’s a bug in Lotus 123?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but probably an intentional one. Lotus had to fit in 640K. That’s not a lot of memory. If you ignore 1900, you can figure out if a given year is a leap year just by looking to see if the rightmost two bits are zero. That’s really fast and easy. The Lotus guys probably figured it didn’t matter to be wrong for those two months way in the past. It looks like the Basic guys wanted to be anal about those two months, so they moved the epoch one day back.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a lot more, including some interesting stuff in there about his meeting with a younger and angrier Bill Gates.</p></div>		</li>
