			<div class="markdown"><p>I was looking for an explanation like this. Slowing down an engine with force isn't actually bad for it. Maybe unless you're slamming the gas and the brakes at the same time in a manual... which I guess is actually just how you do a burnout.</p>
<p>Either way, we do it all the time when we slow down without downshifting. But, ideally, your foot is off the gas when you brake, so it's trying to slow itself down to idle anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yup, and  remember even forcing the engine to spin backward won't hurt it. the only thing that will really damage it is improper lubricaiton, revving it too high or when the valves meet the piston.</p></div>		</li>
