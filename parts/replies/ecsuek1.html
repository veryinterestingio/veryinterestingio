			<div class="markdown"><p>This. While others have correctly stated that soaps, oils, and hair conditioner can be used, it's important to understand that those things will combine with fine hair particles and gum up your razor, so they are best used either only in a pinch or with a straight razor that easily wipes clean. Straight razors will give you the best shave of your life and are <em>by far</em> the most economical way of shaving, but there is a learning curve to both the shaving and sharpening/honing techniques that many in today's society don't have the patience to learn or keep doing after they learn. I used one for years and at the end probably could have done the whole process blindfolded, but stenosis in my neck made it increasingly more difficult than before so I eventually moved to a safety razor. While not quite as close a shave as the straight razor, it's close enough and much better than any of the multi-blade monstrosities I've tried like the Mach 3 and the 4-5 bladed boat oars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>+1 for straight edge but I must say a safety / double edge razor is also fine. For me doing the heavy lifting with a Braun shaver complimented with a double edge razor gives me the best results by far. The Braun is really good for my rather sensitive skin but it doesn't give a clean smooth shave as I'd like. So combining the two reduces razor burn and cuts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One would think so, but in actuality you'll have far better control with the straight razor. I cut myself around the Adam's Apple far more with a safety razor than I ever did with the straight razor. In a decade of using the straight razor multiple times per week, I nicked myself maybe a dozen times and never more serious than I do nearly every time using a safety razor. I would still use a straight razor if I could, but due to stenosis in my neck, I have a hell of a time raising both arms to shoulder level and you really do need both hands with a straight razor, one to hold the razor and the other to pull your skin taught.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just shave in the shower n dont use gel; I get the same effect as shaving cream from the warm water. Have been almost since I've started shaving. Only issue is I might miss a few spots, but I just clean those up when I look in the mirror. </p></div>		</li>
