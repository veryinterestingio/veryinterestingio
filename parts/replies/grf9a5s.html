			<div class="markdown"><p>This feels so understated for me. Skittles used to be one of my favorite go to sweets. But then with no announcement or anything APPLE? Why?</p>
<p>I love apples the fruit, but apples the fake candy flavor? Ugh, below average, a solid 4/10. not terrible, edible but id never go out of my way to choose it.</p>
<p>Before any combination of the flavors picked at random would compliment each other. Lemon and lime? Yum, strawberry and lime yum, lime and purple? Yum. Lime and orange? Yumm
You could pick 2 3 4 at random and it tasted good and balanced. Though lemon and lime were my favorites of course.</p>
<p>I sometimes used to happily try and eat around the lemon and limes and save them till the end and saver them.</p>
<p>Skittles were the shit.</p>
<p>Now they're just like every other generic boring sweet that just exists.</p>
<p>Apparently lime and lemon were too similar and they added for variety? But idk.</p>
<p>They've been absolutely ruined for me, I haven't bought a packet of them in what feels like more than 10 years.</p>
<p>God. Has it been 10 years, now there's been kids that have grown up without the knowledge of a superior version of skittles that never existed for them.</p>
<p>I just wish they did a classic skittle bag, I'd be so much happier with them!</p>
<p>Sorry for the rant, I've been annoyed about this for years but never had an outlet hahahah</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you don't &quot;taste&quot; it, but the menthol will still active your receptors, making your body think that it's cold. And I think it helps when you are sick because when the body think it's cold, it will contract the blood vessels in your nose, lessening the swelling that blocks your nasal airways.</p></div>		</li>
