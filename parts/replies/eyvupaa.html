			<div class="markdown"><p>Greater number of turns creates a stronger magnetic field, which increases torque. But more turns also increases impedance, which means the polarity of the electromagnet is slower to flip, which limits the max RPM. So turns per armature represents a trade-off between max RPM and max torque. If you want more torque add more turns, if you want more RPM put less turns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cheers for the addition, one thing to add to this: one problem you can hit with regards to adding more turns though would be how full the winding is, if you cant add more turns without dropping the wire gauge then you would amplify the impedance/resistance increase further dropping the max power of the motor, in this case it's probably better to use a geared motor to vary the torque/RPM.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The type of iron (or steel) used in the armature also affects how fast the magnetic polarity can flip too. In this case the higher the resistance of the armature iron (or steel) the better, but it must still be able to gain and lose its magnetism very quickly</p></div>		</li>

<p>Never got this far into electro engineering. Stopped at robotics, where gear ratios are enough. I always thought that hydraulics maybe were similar in nature, but this explanation really explains a lot w.r.t how the internals of a motor work.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Exactly. Electric motors for RC car models are often rated in 'Turns'. More turns is equal to a lower gear. Rock crawlers and tanks will use 55T motors, while drifters and racers will use 12T or 15T. </p>
<p>Brushless motors are wound slightly differently but the same principle applies, a 5.5T motor will have less torque but more speed than a 13.5T motor.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd wager it would be more like the valve-timing and camshaft characteristics, because of it's comparable &quot;inner&quot; influence, before the output would get to gears.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like you left something out with regards to how the number of turns affects performance. You explained how thinner wire is worse, but you didn't explain the ways in which it's better, which would seem to exist, since most motors have very thin wire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was trying to go for a fairly concise explanation as comment was pretty chunky. Here goes:</p>
<p>Thinner wire pros: </p>
<ul>
<li>Easier to wind to an extent as more flexible than thicker gauge wire. </li>
<li>Possible to wind more compactly allowing more turns than larger gauge wire (i.e 0.05m wire may fit say 300turns on a stator but 0.025mm wire may fit 650 turns) This is known as fill factor.</li>
<li>Higher flux density due to more turns increases torque, this is because the magetic fields of each turn overlap each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower RPM due to increased resistance/impedance.</li>
<li>Higher thermal losses due to increased resistance/impedance.</li>
<li>Higher voltage required to drive motor at required power due to  increased resistance/impedance, this leads to a lower efficiency of the motor. Generally the warmer a conductor the higher the resistance, so the thermal losses in the winding can lead to a reduction in efficiency as the motor warms up, this is affected by more than just wire gauge though and can be alleviated somewhat by using air to cool the stator. </li>
</ul>
<p>Overall as others have said it is a trade off between what voltage you want to drive the motor at, torque output required, RPM required and efficiency of the motor required.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Higher voltage doesn't lead to higher losses because the current gets lower for the same power output. The term (current x windings) is constant when considering configurations giving the same torque.</p></div>		</li>

<p>IIRC they are wired in parallel. E.g.: It's easier to wire a motor with ten 0,2mm² wires than one 2mm² wire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting point, but wouldn't it be just as easy to wire each armature with thicker wire? I was still searching for why you'd want to use thin wire, as it didn't seem to have any advantages. OP since corrected his post.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, no, thinner wire is not 'worse' it achieves a different result. Eyeball the chart at the top of this page, which represents four motors we wind with differing numbers and diameter of wire. One isn't worse - or - better than the other, but different because we're seeking to achieve a different goal with each.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit 3: because brain fart, lower turns is less torque, higher turns is more torque, not what i initially put, also changed IRM and ERM description at top as fluffed that aswell, need coffee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't really true, either.  All things being equal, yes, it's true because torque is proportional to turns.  But torque is also proportional to current and when you reduce the number of turns you also generally put in bigger wire wire which allows you to have more current without overheating.  Torque stays roughly the same.  </p>
<p>A general rule of thumb is that torque is proportional to motor volume for a given type of motor under similar conditions.</p></div>		</li>
