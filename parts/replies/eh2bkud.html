			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, many people use the terms interchangably but Dynamite is what Albert Nobel invented(the peace prize guy) and is Nitroglycerin and stabilizers and is 25% stronger than TNT.  TNT is Trinitrotoluene, no added stabilizers or anything, its fairly hard to detonate which made it good for bombs and artillery shells but its so hard to detonate it wasn't known to be explosive for 30 years after it was first made as a yellow die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern weapons use a chemical similar to the old RDX (the first &quot;plastic explosive&quot; used in weapons.) C-4 is 91% RDX mixed with stabalizers.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDX#Toxicity" target="_blank">RDX</a> is known to be seriously harmful to life when introduced to the water supply. It lingers for years and currently many places in the US have dangerous levels of RDX derivatives in the soil/water. (From weapons testing and demolition of mountains for highways/damns.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The substance has low to moderate toxicity with a possible human carcinogen classification.[67][68][69] Further research is ongoing, however, and this classification may be revised by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).[70][71] Remediating RDX-contaminated water supplies has proven to be successful.[72] It is known to be a kidney toxin in humans and highly toxic to earthworms and plants, and thus army testing ranges where RDX was used heavily may need to undergo environmental remediation.[73] Concerns have been raised by research published in late 2017 indicating that the issue has been not been addressed correctly by U.S. officials.[74]</p>
