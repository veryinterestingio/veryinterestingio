			<div class="markdown"><p>I think causation is reversed. We want the calculators to display in base ten. So then to do so, they either have to convert their fully binary results to base ten or just do all the math in base ten. Different calculators make this choice differently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can only have 1 and 0. From 0 you go to 1. You can’t go to 2 do you have to go to the next place value. That is 10. From there you go to 11. Oh no your ones place can’t go to 2 nor can your “twos” place. So you get 100</p>
<p>The thing most people are never really taught or at least don’t retain is that place values are just powers of 10. 12345 is 1*10^4 + 2*10^3 + 3*10^2 + 4*10^1 + 5*10^0</p>
<p>It’s the same for 1010(binary). 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0. 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 10. Which is 1010 in binary</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basicly: if you try to count with your fingers it would go like this:</p>
<p>each finger represents a number that always doubles. So first start with 1 then 2 then 4 then 8 etc. with your tenth finger representing 512.</p>
<p>if you stretch out your first finger you have one, now if you want to count to 2 you stretch out your second finger and retract the first since your second finger represents the number 2. if you count to three you extend the first and second finger.</p>
<p>So counting basicly works like that:</p>
<p>When you stretch out a finger that number becomes &quot;active&quot; at which point you can just count the numbers together that the finger represent. so if you stretch out out your first (1) second (2) and fourth (8) finger that would equal to 11.</p>
<p>So if you use binary you can count from 0 to 1023. Theres probably easier explanations out there with the same premise (at least I hope so). I just suck at explaining.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to expand, this is how you add integers, which is the building block for other operations (subtraction, multiplication, etc) and for other types of numbers (floats, which are &quot;basically&quot; decimals)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, what I said <em>does</em> still apply to binary decimals as well, but the problem is telling the computer where the decimal point is. For that you need a bit more complicated a format, floats. As for a &quot;basically&quot; version of floats, they're a binary version of scientific notation.</p></div>		</li>
