			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes there is, although forms of ice are denoted using Roman numerals “Ice-IX”. The real life ice-9 forms in a relatively small band. At minimum you need -100C and 200 MPa, roughly 2000x atmospheric pressure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the energy demand would be a pretty high. You have to maintain a very high level of pressure, and it’s probably not terribly practical to use. It’d be super neat to do, and we might learn something, but there might be no practical use, at this time.</p>
<p>Edit: But, I don’t know for sure.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Good question! Actually, the official definition of a “salt” is a compound formed of a positively charged cation bonded with a negatively charged anion, connected via an <em>ionic</em> bond (ie existing separately but held together by weak electromagnetic forces).</p>
<p>But in its typical molecular formation, water consists of a single oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms 104.5° apart, with the hydrogen particles sharing their electrons with the oxygen particle, forming a covalent bond - so we can’t actually consider it to be a salt. </p></div>		</li>

<p>But by all definitions - perimittivity, permeability, band gap, etc - hydrogen is definitely not a metal, nor even a metallic gas until you get to extremely high pressures. </p>
<p>Suggesting that it is one because it eventually becomes metallic at high pressures is not a good definition, as a very large number of non-metallic elements become metallic at extreme pressures.</p></div>		</li>
