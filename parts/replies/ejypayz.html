			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably. Consult an actual expert (doctor, dietician, nutritionist) to know for sure, and also be aware that we often disregard factual evidence in favour of things we want to hear. This very often leads to making bad decisions, like taking Jenny McCarthy (a titty model who sells snake oil) as an expert in developmental disorders over people who have spent their careers studying this shit (doctors and scientists, a.k.a. actual experts). </p></div>		</li>
