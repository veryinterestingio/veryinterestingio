<p>If they have a lifespan, it is much longer than the current age of the universe. In fact the universe won't get cold enough for them to start shrinking for a very long time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hawking predicted that Black Holes emit some radiation (now named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation" target="_blank">Hawking Radiation</a>) due to quantum effects near the event horizon. Over a very long time this could cause a black hole to lose all its mass and disappear. However, for a supermassive black hole, the evaporation time is incomprehensibly long.</p>
<p>For example, Wolfram's calculator suggests that for a Black Hole the size of M87's (6.5bn solar masses), evaporation would take about 1.85×10^107 seconds, which is around 5 duotrigintillion years (which is 5 billion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion years).</p>
<p>As a comparison, a black hole with the mass of 1 million kg (which couldn't form under any normal process we know about) would evaporate in 90 seconds.</p></div>		</li>

<p>1 million kg, going from an absolutely tiny speck to a million kg of particles in 90 seconds would be a rather big boom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No-one knows for sure if Hawking Radiation is real. The math seems to predicts it, but we have an very incomplete understanding of how general relativity and quantum theory interact at the event horizon of a black hole. It's possible it will disappear as a result of revised equations as our understanding increases, or it may stay around, and become a widely accepted theory.</p>
<p>Several experiments are trying to look for it in the universe and the laboratory, but no conclusive results yet.</p>
<p>Black holes being involved in the big bang and universe formation is a popular trope in sci-fi but for the moment, it really is just sci-fi. It is true that both events involved singularities, and so some similar mathematical descriptions are used. However two major differences are one, that time runs in opposite directions when you run the equations for big bang and black hole formation, and two the big bang may involve an open or a closed universe (the universe may be infinite), whereas a black hole singularity is always a closed universe with a finite amount of stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think we have any widely accepted theoretical models concerning the potential state, degenerate or otherwise, of matter that has become part of a singularity. It's best not to think of it as matter at all any more. More of a property of spacetime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that there is a disparity between age and distance, and that it is actually younger due to the expansion of the universe <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_of_the_universe" target="_blank">(go down to the heading “Measuring distances in expanding space”)</a>. I would like to expand your question for anyone more knowledgable than me and ask: do we know the actual age of the image?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, an interesting article. I must say, even after quite a bit of thinking, the last paragraph there doesn't quite make sense to me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and, in fact, the light emitted towards the Earth was actually moving away from the Earth when it was first emitted, in the sense that the metric distance to the Earth increased with cosmological time for the first few billion years of its travel time, and also indicating that the expansion of space between the Earth and the quasar at the early time was faster than the speed of light. None of this surprising behavior originates from a special property of metric expansion, but simply from local principles of special relativity integrated over a curved surface.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How could the distance between the light and the Earth <em>ever</em> have been growing?  Surely, if &quot;expansion of space between the Earth and the quasar was faster than the speed of light&quot;, then light would never catch up, as the rate of expansion is accelerating? In fact, isn't &quot;space expanding faster than light can travel through it&quot; the &quot;endgame&quot; scenario for cosmic expansion, far in the future?</p>
<p>Also, your question has been asked in the AMA thread, and there it's been answered in a way contrary to the linked article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: So this is 55 million light years away from Earth. Thus the photo is 55 million light years old, right? Does this mean there’s the chance that this black hole might not even exist anymore?</p>
<p>A: Yes! We see M87 as it was 55 million years ago. Black holes and galaxies often live for billions of years, so its likely still kickin'.</p>
