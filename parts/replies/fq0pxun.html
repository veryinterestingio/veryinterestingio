			<div class="markdown"><p>Looking at that infographic, I can't help but think how interesting it would be getting caught in a shockwave explosion if I could be guaranteed I would suffer zero harm.</p>
<p>The sensation of an invisible force lifting you off the ground and thrusting you backwards 20 feet sounds fun if it wasn't so deadly lol</p>
<p>Kind of like going down a slide or spinning fast on a merry-go-round. The thrill of danger, without the damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad told me of the time where he was responding to a call at an RV park for a fire, and when he and his team arrived on the scene, there was an oxygen tank that was nearby one of the inflamed RVs and it reached the point where it just exploded. My dad told me he was about 15 yards away when the tank exploded. The shockwave from the blast sent him back like 5 feet behind him as he was facing the explosion, and his other squad mates were all on the laying on the floor as well. He told me that the doctors said he has brain damage and he often gets horrific nightmares about it, even today after over a decade ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TBI's are not joke and I feel for you and your father, I work on ground medical coverage for airborne  operations sometimes and it's never a fun time seeing one knowing they will likely be different for the rest of their life. Your brain is important, do everything you can to protect it.</p></div>		</li>
