			<div class="markdown"><p>Tunneling just explains how you can go from one state to another without the energy required for the intermediate state though (essentially the uncertainty principle let's you break energy conservation if you break it for a short enough time) However, unlike while tunneling, the energy difference between the initial and final states of the Higgs local and global minima isn't temporary, the lost potential energy has to go somewhere as you can't break energy conservation over long time scales. I just can't remember in what form the energy is released.</p></div>		</li>
