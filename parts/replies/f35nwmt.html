<p>Ibuprofen, Motrin, and Advil are all the same. They don’t hurt your liver.</p>
<p>Tylenol, Acetaminophen, APAP, and Paracetamol are all the same. If you take a small amount, they don’t hurt your liver because you use cysteine (an amino acid) to convert it into something non-toxic and get rid of it. If you run out of cysteine because you took too much Tylenol and used it all, your body converts it into something toxic and gets rid of it. While the toxic stuff is still around, it hurts your liver.</p>
<p>So, don’t take more medication than is recommended and your liver will be fine.</p></div>		</li>
