<p>The tectonic plates are found in the earths crust. </p>

<p>The tectonic plates are more than just crust, they are the lithosphere — which comprises a significant amount of mantle down to about 100 km depth, where the mantle becomes more pliable and convection currents exist. Lithospheric mantle behaves more rigidly and so it is coupled and moves with the crust above which together make up the tectonic plates. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The currents move the tectonic plates in the crust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The basal traction force imparted on the base of the lithosphere is the least important force in driving tectonic plates. The forces of slab-pull and ridge-push are the dominant forces (particularly slab-pull) and do the plates essentially ‘drive themselves’ thanks to gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought formation of new lithosphere at spreading centers is mostly a passive process: extension thins lithosphere, relieving pressure, mantle melts and ascends to fill the thinned area. It’s actually exerting a force?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spreading is mostly passive, but there is a force from ridge push which is mostly bouyancy driven, i.e. the material at the ridge is warmer and lighter than the adjacent material and thus exerts a small amount of force on the adjacent lower material.</p></div>		</li>
