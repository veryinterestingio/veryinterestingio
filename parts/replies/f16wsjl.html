			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe I don't know much about &quot;locally Euclidian manifold&quot;, but it seems like your earth analogy explains it perfectly. </p>
<p>I can lay a ruler on the ground, and it looks like it lies flat on the ground. It's not that it <em>is</em> flat, it's that the difference is so small due to the size of the earth and the relatively small size. So maybe locally, there <em>is</em> a difference, but the difference is so small it's unobservable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or more like &quot;it is actually locally flat at the point where I'm measuring because the earth is not perfectly and uniformly curved, but the area I'm measuring is so small compared to the overall size as to practically be considered a point&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really true. All* shapes appear flat when they're really big compared to the area being investigated. This includes perfect spheres. The Earth being an imperfect sphere has nothing to do with it appearing flat in everyday situations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know, curvature=0 is &quot;magic&quot; just as x+0 or x*0.</p>
<p>For instance, triangle sum is 180 in euclidian no matter the size. All other geometries are more complex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know, Euclidean Geometry was created using &quot;local&quot; observations, where local is on the earth. We have no way of assuming that is should translate to anything larger scale. The fact that it doesn't translate to say, the surface of the earth, is one such example.</p>
<p>That it does apply in space is impressive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably very difficult to imagine spacetime being anything <em>but</em> a manifold because objects (precisely, topological spaces) that are not manifolds are either very strange or they just don't seem like the type of things that can model spacetime.</p>
<p>For instance, a figure-8 is not a manifold because at the point where the loops cross over the space fails to be locally Euclidean. The union of two disjoint balls is not a manifold because the space fails to be connected. The graph of the function y = sin(1/x) for x &gt; 0 is not a manifold because the portion of the graph near x = 0 is &quot;too long&quot;.</p>
<p>All of the objects you are familiar with are, indeed, manifolds: spheres, planes, saddles, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is actually a game out there, Hyperrogue, which is set in various non-Euclidean spaces. Check out these renderings:</p>

<p>Nothing in these images is actually bending or curving as the camera flies through the...architecture? All light rays are following geodesics (straight lines) and the apparent bending is simply how perspective would work in universes with other geometries. For example, in that first video, all of those grey columnar shapes are actually the exact same size, any shift in proportion is a different form of perspective at work, like a more complicated version of how objects in this universe seem smaller as they recede into the distance.</p>
<p>If you want to understand further how these geometries work, there's a (fairly technical) explanation here:  <a href="http://zenorogue.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"><a href="http://zenorogue.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://zenorogue.blogspot.com/</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was about to correct you and say they are locally Euclidean since I was expecting some tori or something else not globally but still locally Euclidean. Most of these kinds of games just play out on various manifolds. I didn't actually expect there to be a 3D game actually set in hyperbolic space. I mean...what.</p>
<p>Very cool, especially PSL(2,R). As a recent graduate still interested in geometry, it's cool seeing my &quot;intuition&quot; coming from solving problems fail to actually apply to moving around a world I am supposed to understand geometry in.</p></div>		</li>
