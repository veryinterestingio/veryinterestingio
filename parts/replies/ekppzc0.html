			<div class="markdown"><p>There would be some significant advantages to doing that, although the hurdles would be enormous, and a lot more difficult than those presented by establishing bases on the moon. </p>
<p>We will probably be some significant number of decades off from building our own sub moons, perhaps as much as a century. Its not even a dead certainty that we will be properly on the moon by then, given the current glacial pace of progress.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could build an artificial moonmoon larger than that. The size limit for a natural moonmoon is the point where tidal forces would tear it apart, since rocks don't deform very well. If we built a moonmoon out of materials that could withstand the tidal forces it could be larger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but when you're building something 10km across, any inheirant material strength is insignificant compared to tidal forces. Maybe you could get it a little bit bigger but it's never going to be 50 km across.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our own moon would be unlikely to support a submoon unless it were in a very specific orbit, as most orbital inclinations are unstable due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_concentration_\(astronomy\)#Effect_of_lunar_mascons_on_satellite_orbits" target="_blank">mascons</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed.</p>
<p>Its just that those four are the four which have the best chance, putting the whole thing into perspective a bit. If our moon is so unlikely to have a sub moon in a stable orbit, its going to be a pretty rare occurrence in this solar system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why just these four? Is it a matter of mass, or does it have more to do with the other bodies in the system? Surprised Ganymede isn’t on there (is it less massive than Callisto?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The wikipedia article linked above mentions the closest thing to a sub-moon known to have existed: artificial satellites we placed in orbit around Earth's moon. They tend to have unstable orbits due to the mascons.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To put it in perspective, our own moon could have such a submoon, and we might never know of it, depending on exactly how it orbits.</p>

<p>What's the largest diameter of an object in our Earth-Moon system that we could have still missed by now?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I honestly have not got a clue. </p>
<p>What I can tell you is that the Moon is not our only dance partner. </p>
<p>There is a small, asteroid like object about three hundred meters across, that will be in our little system with us for eons to come, there are two globs of dust, in fact wider than the Moon each, which are also present in our Earth-Moon system. So its a more complicated dynamic than just the Earth and the Moon tangoing through the solar system.</p></div>		</li>
