			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the great question. There are many misconceptions out there among the public regarding trees and forests. Here are just a couple of them that come to mind. The first would be that trees are responsible for all the air we breathe. Although trees do provide a lot of oxygen for us to breathe through photosynthesis, the oceans (phytoplankton) provide the majority of the oxygen. Another misconception would be that it is good to plant a tree in any location. One example of this is that there are many grasslands that should not be disturbed. – Brian Campbell</p></div>		</li>
