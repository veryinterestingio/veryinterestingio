			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone with a lazy eye, and diplopia to the level that even when my eyes are straight I can't see a single image; </p>
<p>You don't see 2D, and estimating distance is often quite easy due to points of reference and experience. However, when the background doesn't have any defining features (maybe completely black/white, like a wall), it becomes difficult estimating depth. I always pour my glass by holding the bottle against the edge so I know I am correct. Very often, when facing a wall, I will simply pour next to my glass like an idiot.</p>
<p>It's also very annoying when you see 2 images. If they are far apart (due to having one eye point the wrong direction), your brain filters one image out, but when they are close, it becomes almost impossible to filter the second image and it becomes extremely annoying.</p>
<p>Thought I'd shine some light on this as someone who experiences this daily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're definitely describing seeing in 2D. If you don't have normal stereopsis (3D), then you just don't know what true 3D looks like.  When you say &quot;points of reference and experience&quot;, that's called &quot;monocular cues to depth&quot;, but it's not 3D vision. You very well may have intermittent fusion and stereopsis though if it's a borderline issue. If the eyes are always misaligned, I'd expect you to nearly always suppress (&quot;filter&quot; one of the images, as you say&quot;).  I would recommend you look into having a binocular vision exam.  You may benefit from prism compensation in glasses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is possible to train yourself to control your eyes independently by focusing on the sensations in your facial muscles while moving your eyes. This also works with other muscles as well. There are a huge number of muscles in your face, so it is easier to &quot;find&quot; a muscle to control, but it also works with hands fairly well due to the large number of muscles there are to control there as well. See the &quot;finger tutting&quot; style of dance for examples of extreme finger control!</p></div>		</li>

<p>He does have EDS (hypermobolity) though. So yes, people can move their eyes independently and he likely learnt how to do it but found it easy to do with his hypermobolity...</p></div>		</li>
