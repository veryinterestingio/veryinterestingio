			<div class="markdown"><p>Dopamine is really important for the reward pathway by linking memories and pleasure, but it's not the only important transmitter.</p>
<p>Peptide chains (chains of amino acids but not proteins) are responsible for endorphins and they last a long time. Some drugs mimic dopamine but they also cause a release of these peptides (or mimic them) and give you that long-lasting high.</p>
<p>GABA is also common for lots of drugs. Marijuana inhibits GABA, which indirectly increases dopamine and is one possible reason marijuana is less likely to be physically addictive. Alcohol increases GABA, which prevents lots of neurons from working properly and causes that reckless disregard for consequences that comes with being drunk.</p></div>		</li>
