They put whale oil in it and then lined one side of it with moss which acts as the wick. They give off quite a bit of heat. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once saw somebody demonstrate something similar by placing a paper cup filled with water in a campfire. The fire burned only the part of the cup that was above the waterline -- but left the rest of the cup unburned -- it was a bit scorched -- but didn't burn. Its been a while since I saw this but I think eventually the water started to boil and then the cup burned as some of the water boiled off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did this with friends while camping once.  They thought I was some kind of magician (we cooked crawdads in them).</p>
<p>The reason here though is simple.  Water boils at 212F.  No matter how hot the fire is, the water will never get above 212F (pressure can change that...this assumes sea level).  A hotter heat source will only make it boil away faster.</p>
<p>Paper burns at 451F.  So, the water simply never lets the paper get to the temp it needs to ignite.  Voila...boil water in a paper cup nestled in the hot coals of a fire.  Note:  As the water boils away the top of the cup will burn away so either keep water in them or lose the cup eventually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Too anyone who's curious, you can boil water in a plastic water bottle too in a survival situation.You have to suspend it over the fire and you can't just leave it boiling for long. You can even reuse the bottle a couple times.</p>
<p>I wouldn't do it unless dire situations because of chemicals leeching into the water possibly. But die now of dehydration vs potential cancer in x years.... choice is clear. </p>
<p>You can also boil water in a leaf.</p></div>		</li>
