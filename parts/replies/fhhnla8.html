<p>This is very hard to do though which is why we don’t have any approved or even ready to license LFTR designs.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a different type of challenge. Mostly materials science and chemistry related to ensure proper reprocessing and to design something that can be effective at it while also not corroding like crazy. A LFTR reactor could be built at a demonstration level today. The issue is designing it for continuous 100 year operation at cost and ensuring the materials and systems are effective. </p>
<p>Fusion on the other hand suffers from being very large and expensive such that we can’t even get all the research done. Like if I throw a ton of money and bodies at LFTR we could get there. But fusion needs new development in physics to get the scale down so it’s even workable while also trying to get net energy out. These developments are happening, slowly.</p></div>		</li>
