			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming that there are &quot;tracks&quot; that record the color and duration of the pixels on the screen, is that kind of how it works?</p>
<p>If so, how many &quot;tracks&quot; or streams of information are there being recorded? There must be a line of magnets for each track? How much information is put onto the tape, and at what rate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Analogue video doesn't use pixels.  If you think about it the way modern digital video works you'll probably just confuse yourself. This is a bit of a generalization, but black and white analogue video is essentially just one continuous stream of brightness with special instructions telling the monitor when to skip to the next line, or to come back to the top of the screen for the next frame.  In many signal standards, this is basically just a voltage that goes up and down freely (or, the same information FM-encoded into a carrier).  So, there is a known, finite number of horizontal lines, but the number of  columns, (pixels within each row) is always going to be approximate.  So, there is only one &quot;track&quot;.  Even though the video signal on the tape is divided into parallel stripes, it's really one continuous signal that simply continues from one stripe onto the next.</p>
<p>The total bandwidth available to encode video signals on a VHS tape is about 3MHz.  How much actual data this ends up being is dependent on how that data is encoded.  It's tough to give a figure in a unit familiar to internet users, like kb/s, as for the reasons I said earlier, it's often counter intuitive to try to compare digital and analogue video.  Because analogue video doesn't have cleanly divided pixels, it also can't be cleanly divided into bytes, so measuring the information in digital terms is always going to be an approximation, and oftentimes a very bad one.</p>
<p>Color analog video is a bit more confusing, because in order to maintain compatibility with black and white TVs and also to save bandwidth (the human eye sees brightness at a much higher detail than color), the color signal is separated from the brightness information (black and white video), and then encoded back in at a much lower rate.  The way this is done is quite complex, but if you really want to spend a few hours learning about obsolete technology, look up &quot;Color Under Heterodyne Encoding&quot;, which is the specific method used by VHS.  Analogue TV uses an even more complicated encoding method, which I highly suggest you spare yourself learning about.  If you really want to go down that rabbit hole, though, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX649lnKAU0" target="_blank">Technology Connections' Video</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Expanding on this: 3MHz is a decent amount of bandwidth to have available, enough for a limit of 3Mbit connection at an SNR of 1 (noise = signal). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon%E2%80%93Hartley_theorem" target="_blank">The Shannon-Hartley theorem covers this, if you're inclined to understand the math</a>. </p>
<p>Theoretically with an an infinite signal strength, and no noise, you could achieve infinite data rate, (infinite-QAM with an infinite SNR) but it's physically impossible, especially in the context of a vhs tape that's prone to melting. With small enough magnets on the plastic, and an impossibly good reader, you could have it run most digital schemes out there, but it's not a very good medium for that. </p>
<p>With, for example, <a href="https://gotrango.com/products/orion-series/" target="_blank">expensive COTS equipment</a> 1.5 gigabit speeds can be reached using 1024-QAM in a 60MHz bandwidth, translating to 75Mbit/s at VHS's ~3MHz one, but that's not realistic with analog or the physical limits of a VHS tape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That human beings ever figured this shit out is astonishing to me</p>
<p>im still blown away by the concept of recorded audio, in general. That one wiggly boye coming from a stereo can be any combination of sounds, including full orchestras, and then you can put random audio of arin hanson screaming over it, and we're still able to turn one wiggly boye into the exact waves required to tell our ears to hear an orchestra with game grumps yelling over it is fucking astonishing and I don't understand it and it may as well be magic</p></div>		</li>
