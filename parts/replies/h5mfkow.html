			<div class="markdown"><p>good explanation man. Also I'd like to add that when defining escape velocity, we usually add the idea that the object must reach &quot;infinity&quot; distance away from earth ( this is basically because of the fact that not just every planet; but literally EVERY object in the universe is meant to pull everything else.) </p>
<p>So the only way to theoretically be completely free of earth's gravitational field, you'd need to reach infinity( which is obv impossible thus you can never be truly free of gravity on paper). In reality ofc at one point the gravity wil be so negligible you dont need to give a damn</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooooooh. I think you just helped me understand something I've struggled with for a long time. So, is &quot;escape velocity&quot; really just that point at which your apogee goes to infinity?</p>
<p>I've always struggled a bit with the idea of escaping orbit, as you can never completely escape gravitational influence, so it seems you would always eventually fall back towards the planet if you ignore the gravitational pull other astronomical objects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thatâ€™s a good way to define it. I prefer to explain it in terms of energy, though. Gravity creates some potential energy field around it. To overcome this potential energy (and therefore escape the pull of the earth in this case), you need as much kinetic energy as potential energy, or more. This minimum kinetic energy is 1/2 <em> m </em>v^2, where v is the escape velocity.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s like a throwing up a ball. The ball stops when KE = PE, and begins to fall back down. The important thing is that the potential energy is a function of the distance from the earth, and in the case of planets, is finite and not infinite no matter how far you go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any non-closed orbit has an &quot;infinite&quot; apogee. A ship that is exactly at escape velocity will remain at escape velocity for its entire trajectory (it changes based on your distance from the gravity source) assuming no other forces or gravity sources affecting it. It will approach a velocity of 0 at infinite distance.</p>
<p>An object going faster than escape velocity will approach some positive velocity at infinite distance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This comment isnâ€™t very clear, but yes you would need to be moving initially at about 11 km/s in order to escape Earthâ€™s gravity with no outside means of propulsion. Obviously spacecraft do not reach 11 km/s at any point during takeoff, but thatâ€™s because they are able to continually generate acceleration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've got a more or less related question.</p>
<p>If gravity is a force that is literally everywhere and has a constant impact on everything, how is the universe expanding? Why do planets and galaxies not collapse into one big pile of stuff but drift around so far away without ever getting closer to each other?</p>
<p>Like for example we are moving elliptic around the sun, what force is driving us further away from the sun again, instead of having us spiral around and eventually into it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When we're closer, we're moving faster, so that lets us get further away again. When we're further, we're moving slower, causing us to get pulled back in again. The cycle repeats indefinitely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a couple of neat answers to your question. </p>
<p>> what force is driving us further away from the sun again, instead of having us spiral around and eventually into it?</p>
<p>We've got momentum driving us forward, perpendicular to the direction the sun is pulling us. There is no friction in space, so this can continue forever, sort of. If you spin a yoyo in the air above your head, the string pulls it towards the center, and the centrifugal force pulls it away, but they balance out so the yoyo stays the same distance away. </p>
<p>> Why do planets and galaxies not collapse into one big pile of stuff but drift around so far away without ever getting closer to each other?</p>
<p>They've got momentum. They're really far apart and they're moving beyond 'escape velocity' of each other. </p>
<p>> how is the universe expanding?</p>
<p>This is the wild one. For every \~3,600,000 light years between two objects (1 million parsecs), every second they are \~80km further apart. Space is stretching, getting bigger, and things with no relative velocity to each other suddenly have *more* space between them. They aren't moving. There's just more space. Like imagine two parked cars on a highway, and every second there's just... more highway between them. </p>
<p>Why? That's a very good question that someone will get a Nobel prize if they can sufficiently explain.</p></div>		</li>
