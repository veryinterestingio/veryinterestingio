			<div class="markdown"><p>not really up, but yeah thats the idea. Your eyes don't go back into your sockets or anything, they just rotate a little bit up. Its really noticeable if someone is unconscious and you pull up their eyelids, or if someone is laid out with their eyes a little bit open, like a boxer who is having trouble getting up from a blow to the head. As far as I know (which isn't much tbh) it's not 100% clear why this happens, but most people think its because if your eye is up when your eyelids are closed, its a little more protected and its a little easier for it to stay moist and clean</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are 2 benefits from the eyes rolling up when blinking (called the bells reflex btw). These likely proved evolutionarily advantageous.</p>
<p>1) as you said, protects/covers the cornea better when closed</p>
<p>2) if something makes you blink, by rotating upwards as the lid comes down, it ensures your cornea is covered quicker than waiting for the lid to come all the way down</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The protection would make sense, like in case you get stabbed in the eye while unconscious, it wouldn't hit an important part</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. </p>
<p>There’s six muscles. One pulls your eyeball towards your nose, one pulls towards your ear, one sortof diagonally up and inward, one up and outward and so on. </p>
<p>The main thing is if they’re all relaxed your eye rolls up, and it takes effort to make them do anything else. </p>
<p>That’s as far as I remember anyway. I went through med school with some seriously smart people and I’m not one of them but I’ll see if I can ask one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a pretty firm record of not liking cringey stuff like Harley Quinn, and other  ‘too much’ displays.</p>
<p>That said.</p>
<p>Though I hate Ahegao (just looked it up), on paper, mmm, I find it embarrassingly sexy when a women makes such a face.</p>
<p>I’ve yet to encounter it in the real world.</p>
<p>But, if/when I do, I will fucking love it, I will resent my love for its effect, and I will hope nobody ever finds out about it.</p>
<p>Damn sexy face... crossing some bare wires in my brain.</p>
<p>Knowing that is even more realistic... god damn it.</p>
