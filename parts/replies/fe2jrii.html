			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I get it.</p>
<p>So then do you theoretically get a better estimate if the rock is composed of multiple measurable minerals?</p>
<p>Would a greater temperature difference affect the decay rate, therefore affecting the measurement? For example if a meteor broke apart and pieces hit the equator and Antarctica, sat for a geologically significant period of time, and then were measured, would they still appear to be the same age?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do often date rocks with multiple techniques, but (1) only if there are multiple minerals available (which will depend on the mineralogy of the rock, etc) and (2) the importance of the date (depending on the technique, each date represents a decent amount of time and money, so if the date is super important, we might expend the effort to try to date it with multiple techniques). Generally though, most methods have a variety of ways of testing the veracity of the results so unless there is reason to question a particular date, we might not go through the hassle of dating something by an additional technique.</p>
<p>With respect to the decay rate, the decay rate is a constant, regardless of temperature. The accumulation of a child isotope is temperature dependent. Once a mineral has cooled below its closure temperature for a given system, the temperature history doesn't matter (as long as it doesn't exceed that closure temperature again). With the exception of a few somewhat niche systems, the temperature at the surface even in the most extreme environments will be well below the closure temperature, so location is not particularly important.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What makes dating expensive? I was under the impression that you needed to measure 2 or more radioactive emission rates and that was it. Is that assumption wrong? If it's right, then is it the detectors that are super expensive and rare, or do you maybe need to mobilize an instrument for very long periods just to get one reading?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to say the same thing, but with Carbon Dating.</p>
<p>Life accumulates carbon, mostly in the form of carbohydrates. Some of that carbon is Carbon-14, which naturally decays to Nitrogen-14; but not very fast. As such, as anything lives, it takes in carbon from the air in fairly constant ratios (Carbon-14 gets created in the high atmosphere when sunlight hits Nitrogen-14).</p>
<p>However, as soon as something dies, the carbon gets trapped in. As such, there is a &quot;starting&quot; ratio - it's the same for everything that is living, as well as recently dead things - of C14 to total carbon. As time passes, C14 turns to N14, that ratio changes.</p>
<p>Overall, there is a more or less fixed amount of Carbon-14 on Earth: it's decaying about as fast as it's being produced (that changed recently, because nuclear bombs). Because of this, life at all times in history (except the last 80 years) has had the same amount of C-14 while they are alive.  </p>
<p>Edit: Two things I have been corrected on:  </p>
<p>1) the C14 to total carbon isn't always the same: it changes over time, but slowly and predictably.</p>
<p>2) Recent C14 to total carbon ratio has also changed because of fossil fuel use: fossil fuels have basically no C14.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The ratio has also changed due to the huge amount of fossil carbon 12 released into the atmosphere from fossil fuels. The ratio is constantly changing, so one of the big parts of carbon dating is building the calibration curves. </p>
<p>An interesting thing about the lead dating is that one of the scientists who figured the system ran into a huge problem with contamination from environmental lead. After huge amounts of work, it became obvious that it was due to the Tetraethyl Lead in gasoline at the time becoming pervasive in the environment. He later became a crusader against leaded gasoline.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This part is not quite true. Libby, the pioneer of radiocarbon dating, had this assumption. The result was decades of incorrect dates that was proven by comparing these dates with dendrochronological dates (tree ring dating). Before approximately 1000 BC, dates from radiocarbon are regularly too young. For instance, a sample dated to 4100 BC would actually have a date of 5000 BC, an error of 900 years.</p>
<p>The ratio of C14 to N14 varies over time, largely as a result in fluctuations in the earth's magnetic field. We can calibrate the C14 date curve and correct for this variation by correlating it with dendrochronology dates. Dendrochronology is fairly strait forward and simply counts and matches tree rings, resulting in a more accurate and precise absolute date. As of my last check, we have calibration curves for radiocarbon somewhere around 10-11,000 BC, with the oldest dendro dates coming from California bristlecone pines in NA and oak in Europe (with oak only back to ~8000 BC).</p>
<p>edit. We can also calibrate more recent variation in the curve using dendro dates. However, very young samples (&lt;50 years or so) face problems in dating not from variation in the radiocarbon in the atmosphere, but rather from the too short amount of time for the isotopic decay to result in significantly measurable change in the ratios.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been calibrated beyond the dendrochronology range by other proxies, e.g. U-Th ages of corals, etc. This (older) <a href="https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/3832/3257" target="_blank">paper</a> discusses some of these (I'm sure there are more up to date refs, but I don't use C-14 much so don't have those at my fingertips).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Somewhat strangely, fossil fuels aren't as much of an issue as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb_pulse" target="_blank">atmospheric nuclear tests</a>.</p>
<p>But while that has mucked up regular C-14 dating for anything from 1945 to ~2030, it has at the same time let us date individual cells created during that span (for cells that aren't regularly replaced, it lets us chart the growth of individual layers over time), which has given us insights in everything from brain cell growth to the age of Greenland sharks. So that's at least something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Zircon is a pretty common accessory mineral and has a lot of desirable properties for a geo- or thermochronometer that other comments have mentioned, but similar examples could be made with different minerals and different radiogenic systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer below explains this but basically zircon is a tough mineral and doesn't get altered or metamorphosed that easily (high melting temp), plus, is a good host for U. A good resistant mineral that with good confidence will come from the primary crystallization of the rock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's super-durable (chemically and mechanically), has a high closure temperature (&gt;900C), contains a relatively high concentration of uranium, is a relatively common mineral (in trace amounts) in a variety of rocks, and uranium isotope decay rates are some of the better-known ones thanks to the nuclear industry.</p>
<p>Combine all that with a history since the 1950s or so (it's one of the earlier methods) and you've got one of the most popular methods, though K-Ar is a close competitor.</p></div>		</li>
