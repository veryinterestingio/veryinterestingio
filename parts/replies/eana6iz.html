			<div class="markdown"><p>I grew up in Michigan before global warming really kicked in I guess - snowed all winter. Living in Texas, I'm stupid-nostalgic for snow, esp. the way that deadened sound feels when you walk at night when it's really coming down. The best feeling in my memory. When I was a teen before we had our own cars, we'd bundle up and go for &quot;420 nature walks&quot; in the snow - just magical. </p>
<p>But yeah, it's amazing how a subtle change in reflectivity is processed by our brains. Like when you walk into your empty new home before the furniture gets moved in and absorbs all the reflected sounds, if you were blindfolded you'd totally know you were in an empty room. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Around or before 2000 you could pretty much predict on your own without an almanac when the snow would be here and when it would be leaving. Summers were hot but not blistering all the way through.. there was actually a fall to prepare for winter.. I always say I don't want to be where we have the four seasons but just like you I would probably miss it..</p></div>		</li>
