			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just serotonin. There are different types of anti depressants for a reason. SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) are common, but SNRIs (Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) are common too, or tricyclic (serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine) or MAOI (monoamine oxidase inhibitors). Increasing the uptake of serotonin is very common, but definitely not the only mechanism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just that you need Serotonin, but you need to be able to use it too. If it gets taken out of circulation (re-uptake) then perhaps you can't use it. So there are drugs that don't give you more serotonin, but rather they stop it being taken out of circulation (note to 5yo's parents: reuptake inhibitor).  This can ease sadness too.</p></div>		</li>
