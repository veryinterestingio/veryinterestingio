			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no official, accepted definition of a planet (the one the IAU decided in 2006 which eliminated Pluto from the definition explicitly does not apply outside the Solar System). A 2003 position statement from the IAU is their only guidance issued on extrasolar planets, which agrees with what you're saying, but it isn't a strict definition. A body not massive enough to sustain fusion that doesn't orbit a star would be called a sub-brown dwarf in these terms.
(From <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition_of_planet" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>).    Edit: I'm not disagreeing with their guidance being followed, but it isn't so clear cut as you're saying here - the definition is nebulous (sorry).</p></div>		</li>
