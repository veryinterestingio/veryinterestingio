So every night I would take Kratom feel warm and cosy until I went to bed and then I'd be on fire whilst my GF was under the blanket shivering.</p>
<p>When I was withdrawing from it I was fucking roasting or cold with little In between which was also awful. I'm not like 72 days clean from Kratom but I still suffer with being too hot at night about half the time I sleep.</p></div>		</li>
