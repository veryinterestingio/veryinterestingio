			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of it is also a lack of quality sleep. One of the best hangover cures is to take a nap. Your body gets horrible rest when you sleep after drinking even though you may fall asleep as soon as your head hits the pillow. People may <em>think</em> they‚Äôre resting sufficiently, but usually the symptoms of a hangover are associated with being really tired. Hydration is also a huge factor though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't quite true, it's more urban myth that has inflated the role of dehydration in hangovers.</p>
<p>Dehydration plays a role in how you feel in the morning and the way it makes you feel overlaps with some of the symptoms of hangover caused by alcohol. </p>
<p>However it is not the main cause. This is the reason hangovers will still occur with appropriate hydration and why they don't go away by rehydrating (like the symptoms of pure dehydration would do).</p>
<p>Your body isn't using the water to flush anything out. You feel the need to pee because alcohol has an indirect diuretic effect (it makes you pee more). </p>
<p>It's generally considered that the effects of dehydration often occur concurrently but should be considered separately from the alcohol hangover.</p>
<p>Edit: I did want to clarify that you should still definitely drink water while out drinking because even though dehydration doesn't play a big of a role as people think, being hydrated will still make you feel better in the morning!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not entirely just dehydratation , alcohol fu ks ups ion balance in blood plasma , and there needs to be a lot of stuff to be replaced. Strong meat and vegetable soup ( from actual ingredients, not dried food) helps like a miracle, and pharmacies sell tablets that dissolve in water that help a ton ( iirc magnesium is main ingredient)</p></div>		</li>
