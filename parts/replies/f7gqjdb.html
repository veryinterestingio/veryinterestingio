			<div class="markdown"><p>I found something like that when I was trying to see if the Bredon Beer from <em>The Name of the Wind</em> was based on a real thing. A character remarks after someone buys it: &quot;I don't like having to chew my beer.&quot; And the reason he was buying it in the first place was as food for another character.</p>
<p>Neat!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a historian, not a biologist, and can't speak to microbiology beyond basic reading. I can tell you that there is no textual or archaeological evidence to support the common myth that ancient people drank alcohol all the time because it was safer than water. People drank water as a matter of course everywhere and many civilizations, like the Romans, put an absolutely titanic amount of work into providing abundant, clean drinking water to their citizens. People drank booze because people like booze.</p>
<p>The question of &quot;Didn't people get sick from bad water?&quot; is simply answered: yep, they did. Far more often than we do today in developed countries. That was just part of life. I have lived in a poor country with bad sanitation/hygiene standards, and while people there don't die a lot from it, they sure do have stomachaches/diarrhea at a rate that someone from a developed country would consider unacceptable. A lot of that is from dirtier food and water.</p>
<p>Living in the past sucked a lot. You wouldn't want to go back in time permanently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Homebrewer here. I'm not arguing on whether or not ancient peoples drank more booze as a defense mechanism - I believe you on that.</p>
<p>From a biology perspective, the reason fermented products would be safer has to do with yeast and oxygen. Wort(pre beer) is an extremely nutrient and oxygen rich environment. During the fermentation process, yeast will eat basically all of the sugars and oxygen available, and excrete alcohol and Co2. Yeast is highly competitive and will strangle basically any other microbe in that sort of environment. If something other than a desirable yeast culture takes hold instead, it is extremely apparent in the resulting beer, and you dump it. At the end, what you have is an environment full of yeast and Co2, and basically devoid of nutrients and oxygen. </p>
<p>So it's not a question of alcohol sterilizing the beer. The fact that it's (drinkable) beer is sufficient evidence that the yeast has successfully out competed everything else in the wort. It's not safe because it's beer, it's beer because it's safe.</p>
<p>As the process is basically the same, this would also apply to wine and mead as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the documentary beer saved the world isn’t true? I believe the documentary. One of the main guys teaches at UCDavis I believe or did.</p>
<p>Also, I always heard that the beer, Indian Pale Ale (IPA), got its name from long voyages were people would use extra hops to help preserve and keep their source of drinking water clean. Because normal water would go bad on the voyage but the beer kept.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick point.  Just because taking a 12% abv wine and diluting it to 3% with contaminated water won't kill the bacteria doesn't mean the same bacteria could live in beer brewed at 3%.  It's not a hospitable environment, even if 3% abv wouldn't instantly kill them, so beer fermented over a couple of weeks could be totally safe in cases where wine diluted to the same level isn't.</p></div>		</li>
