			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™m no expert but I donâ€™t believe it would because the water is held in a particular shape by the ice tray rather than being able to spread out like it would when thrown in to the air. The steam may just partially defrost whatever is above it in the freezer which would be less than ideal :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. It only freezes quickly from high temperatures when the droplets are tiny, so that the surface area to volume ratio is tiny.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that has to do with convection.
Hot water up ðŸ”ƒcold water down that cycle is much quicker due to the temperature difference of the hot water and cold air/surface (freezer). The rapid convection results in a more even cooling. Plus, as an added bonus you get clearer ice cubes. But that may have more to do with gases ðŸ¤”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except it doesn't freeze unless you have a very high distance to throw it from. It steams a lot and makes a pretty visual but it is very much liquid water hitting the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This also depends on the amount and the temperature. </p>
<p>If it's <em>extremely</em> cold - think -50 C - and you're throwing like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPfswZfZaec" target="_blank">coffee cup-sized amount of boiling or near-boiling water</a>, it will all turn to vapor, which then freezes. I've done it. At most, you get a few droplets hitting the ground. </p>
<p>But if it's -20C and you're <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/make-instant-snow-from-boiling-water-606062" target="_blank">flinging bowls of water</a>, yeah...pretty visual, lots of water hitting the ground.</p></div>		</li>
