			<div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: properly aligned, but not too tight, crystalline structure allows the steel to spring back to its assigned shape after bending.</p>
<p>Steel has a crystalline structure within it. When you heat a piece of steel up to a working temperature (1800°F or higher usually for hammering it), that crystalline structure first relaxes, then basically scrambles, completely coming out of alignment. Once it reaches this temperature (which is different for various alloys, but usually somewhere between 1200 and 1500 F), it becomes non-magnetic.</p>
<p>When you cool steel, it needs to be cooled fast enough that this crystalline structure realigns into a strong, uniform alignment, but not so fast that it becomes overly brittle. Different alloys can have drastically different times during which the temperature needs to fall a certain amount for best results, ranging from seconds to hours. The alloys are generally separated into the categories of water cooled, oil cooled, and air cooled. Water cools extremely fast, oil cools slower, and air the slowest.</p>
<p>Most common, non-stainless alloys are called austenitic steels because the crystalline structure you're looking to create during the cooling process is called austenite. There are these funky graphs (<a href="https://practicalmaintenance.net/wp-content/uploads/Cooling-curves-superimposed-on-a-hypothetical-I-T-diagram.jpg" target="_blank">https://practicalmaintenance.net/wp-content/uploads/Cooling-curves-superimposed-on-a-hypothetical-I-T-diagram.jpg</a>) that tell you how fast to cool how much to form the right structure for different alloys.</p>
<p>After the cooling process, the crystalline structure is often too tight, meaning the steel will be strong, but so hard as to be brittle when bending. So it's tempered, meaning it's brought up to a low heat (I usually use 300-350 for many common tool steels like 4140) and left at that temp for a while. This begins to loosen the structure a bit so it can bend, but not so much it loses strength. Now the steel can bend, and the alignment of the crystals will cause it to snap back into shape.</p></div>		</li>
