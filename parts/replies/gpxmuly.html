<p>I can confirm. In her last days, my Alzheimer's-riddled grandmother literally could not put more than two or three words together before losing the plot. She lost her ability to meaningfully communicate well before that. We would sing old songs that she knew from 50 years ago or old lullabies that she used to sing to me together, and she could get through the whole song without any problems. It made her very happy. When it was clear it was time, I sang to her until it was over.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And godamn tragic. Nobody should have to suffer through months and years of slow miserable degradation from cancer or dementia.  But probably 30-50% of us will die like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When my mom was dying from cancer, those last days she wasn't conscious anymore. So we decided to put music on since she always loved to sing. And even though we couldn't get any kind of reaction from her anymore, the music made her toes and fingers wiggle in time of the rhythm. It really made us feel like we gave her a last bit of pleasure right before she passed.</p></div>		</li>
