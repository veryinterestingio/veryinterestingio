			<div class="markdown"><p>Minor points of clarification to a mostly correct post:<br />
The swelling isn’t vasodilation, it’s an increase in interstitial fluid volume caused by histamine release from mast cells. The histamine makes capillaries (but mainly post capillary venules) leaky by increasing the size of the pores between endothelial cells. This is an effort to increase the fluid of the interstitial compartment to allow further infiltration of white cells and to start wash out cytotoxic components from cell damage. Also why antihistamines reduce swelling.   </p>
<p>Anaphylaxis is vasodilation but in arterioles and small arteries. That tanks your BP. The fluid infiltration in the lungs from the increase in interstitial fluid is what crushes the O2 sat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had learned that the intercellular clefts increased in size as a result of vasodilation, but your response points out a major problem in this: intercellular clefts lack smooth muscle. </p>
<p>Today I learned that the intercellular clefts enlarge by contraction of the capillary endothelial cells themselves in response to inflammatory paracrine signals (which I hypothesize are often released as a byproduct of vasodilation based on certain specific signaling molecules involved). </p>
<p>Thank you for helping to point out a gap in my knowledge!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love your explanation, but it’s probably also worth noting that anaphylactic responses don’t have any real physiological benefit. Meaning you can take anti-histamines to stop an allergic reaction because the allergic reaction is ONLY hurting you. Whereas with an injury, the inflammation does allow for improved healing, so you wouldn’t want to completely resolve the inflammation, just reduce it to manage side effects such as pain</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes good point to clarify that! An allergic response is an 'incorrect' response because for some reason people produce IgE Abs to common environmental allergens. These allergens are non-infectious and non-pathogenic so it is entirely inappropriate</p></div>		</li>
