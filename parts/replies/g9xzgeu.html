			<div class="markdown"><p>To me, this is the best answer so far.</p>
<p>Yes, there is a lot of other stuff one can talk about, but the simple answer to OPs question is this right here.</p>
<p>The real cost of a film is much higher than its budget and the studio only see about half of the box office income.</p>
<p>But, it also doesn't include income from streaming, physical discs, tv-deals etc. etc. etc.</p>
<p>So, as a general rule, a big blockbuster needs to make about 2.5x its budget to break even and start making a real profit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, 50% cut is domestic sales. For international ticket sales, rule of thumb is generally the studio gets 1/3 for overseas, and 1/4 for China. </p>
<p>If the movie makes $500m worldwide, but 400m is from overseas, the movie made less than $250m in ticket sales.</p>
<p>Adjusted for this, I think it's very likely Black Panther and the Force Awakens probably made significant more money than others with similar box office numbers (TFA is still #1 domestic box office, above Avatar and Endgame).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The theater cut for disney movies is much much lower. www.wsj.com/amp/articles/disney-lays-down-the-law-for-theaters-on-star-wars-the-last-jedi-1509528603</p>
<p>Disney takes 65% for their big movies and want theaters to show their movies in big screens for at least 4 weeks. If you go against the mouse youre getting cut off most likely. Disney did the same with film reviewers. Those who give unfavorable reviews would get cut off of disney movies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That article is a good one and updates a couple of things I learned in business school about exhibitor splits:</p>
<p>“The studio is applying the 65% split across all weeks of the film’s release, rather than some studios’ practice of beginning a split at a high figure and then lowering it in subsequent weeks.”</p>
<p>This indicates exhibitors were still making less during the first few weeks of a release than later weeks - which is still a sucker deal for most movies (who’s going to see a mediocre movie three or four weeks in, when word of mouth soured the fence-sitters and the enthusiasts have seen it already?).</p>
<p>“Most theatrical releases send about 55% of ticket sales back to studios, though the average split is about 60% on major hits. Hollywood makes more money on tickets sold in the U.S. than in overseas markets, where the split averages about 40%.”</p>
<p>Again this trucks in averages, but I wonder how many domestic and overseas exhibition contracts send more of the first weeks’ take back to mother Hollywood?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know why this isn’t best answer.  It explains where 50% of gross revenues go right away - to the theater owners.  The pie is cut in half at the ticket booth. Then you add in all the film company accounting trickery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it's wrong.  For the first week or so the theater gets to keep <em>zero</em> percent of the ticket.  After that it only goes up to 10 or 20 percent.  Theaters live and die on concessions.</p>
<p>Edit: Second or extended runs make 50 percent, though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I literally ran a 14 screen theater for a few years and none of the contracts with any major distributor were for 0% for any time period.</p>
<p>Maybe you are confusing their box office revenue with some weird leasing structure they had on their digital projectors (often times they will be leased between a distributor and the projector company, but even then we still got 50% of box office)</p>
<p>The only times I got less than 50% were <em>very rarely</em>, usually only for the opening week of a film, and then only down to like 40% (example, James Cameron's Avatar) </p>
<p>I remember some theater operators being worried about certain distributors demanding theaters only take 25% of certain films for a week or else never getting a film from them again, but it never happened with me or any theater operator I knew of and I wasn't some major chain like Regal who could actually throw their weight around. Just some dude.</p>
<p>Box office paid my staff payroll. More expected ticket sales meant I'd need more staff. Less ticket sales meant less staff. It was very straight forward and you'd get pretty good about guessing how well a movie would sell in the area.</p>
<p>Concession revenue paid the absurd utility bills and everything else.</p>
<p>edit: we were a first run theatre in St Louis</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theateers don't make 0% in first week, just lower percentage.</p>
<p>And studios make lower percentage of international box office as compared to US market</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you cite a source?   Everything I see when I google this says theaters typically take 40-50% of ticket receipts (studios keep 50-60%).  First few weeks of a big budget movie the studios typically negotiate a 90% hold (for the studios) but then it then the hold drops quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not a 50/50 split tho. It varies greatly by title and length of play, but on average an opening week for a major studio release, the theatre will only get ~10-20% of ticket price. The longer a film is in theatres, the closer to 50/50 they get.</p></div>		</li>
