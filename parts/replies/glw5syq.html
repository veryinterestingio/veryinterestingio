			<div class="markdown"><p>I was actually completely unaware of the TG that you mention.</p>
<p>So if I understand, having the low TG will make it soft and having a crosslinking polymer will make it have form.</p>
<p>This might sound like a dumb question, but it is only because I do not know much about plastics and chemistry in general; Can any plastic be made as crosslinking? How is crosslinking obtained?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tg means glass transition, so when a polymer goes from soft(souple) to hard, so yeah. Crosslinking happens in any &quot;solid&quot; polymers, it's the bonding between the chains (formed with the monomer(s)). It can be of different nature (covalent, ionic) depending on the type of polymer. When it comes to synthetic polymers, some sort of catalysis has to happen, usually with heat. For example polyesters (it can be made of biosourced products, my PhD subject yay) you use a carboxylic acid and an alcohol molecule, heat those together and they will form a polymer (OH groups bonding with the COOH group by the addition of an H) after sufficient time and temperature. You could do that in your kitchen :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be pedantic, the G stands for &quot;glass transition&quot; and T is almost always notation for &quot;temperature&quot; when you're talking material properties (or engineering equations in general).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I think you understand it :)</p>
<p>Crosslinks are formed by linking two polymers in the kiddle of their chain. Sometimes it's done after the polymer chains are already mixed (like with vulcanized rubber) but other times they're formed as the plastic polymerizes. </p>
<p>Polymers are made of monomers, and at the end of each monomer there's a functional group which allows it to link to another monomer, like a key and a lock, to form that polymer chain. As the monomers keep reacting the entire molecule keeps getting bigger and bigger. To crosslink that polymer chain to another, you need to introduce a monomer with two functional groups, so it can react on either side of itself, bridging the gap between the two chains. </p>
<p>You can also use even higher functionalities to get even more crosslinking. Tetra, hexa, peta functional monomers all exist, and so do dentritic polymers (with 10s of functional groups). This allows the chemist more control over how tight the crosslinking actually gets, and thus allows for a wide range of properties.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use something called climbing skins on my skis which use a similar kind of glue.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski_skins" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski_skins</a></p>
<p>They will readily stick to the ski even in sub zero temperature. They also seem to stick just fine at room temperature. Any idea how they manage that? I would think the Tg would need to be more tuned to a target working temperature?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily tuned to a specific temperature. The usual case is to make the application temperatures all on one side of the Tg, in the ski skin case, maybe the Tg is at like -60, who knows? </p>
<p>Another poster has mentioned tackifiers, which could also be useful in the skins. They're mostly inert big molecules that have very low Tgs. Essentially they drag the Tg of the whole mixture down to where it needs to go. </p>
<p>I'm saying a lot on Tg, but it's still only part of the adhesive equation. The polymer's structure is just as important, or maybe even moreso, it's just so much easier to adjust the Tg than to change the whole molecule.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the info. I have found that glue to be fascinating ever since I started back country skiing. I have had the same set of skins for 9 or 10 years and the glue is still sticky.  When I first started, I thought I was going to need to replace it yearly. The fact that it's still going seems insane to me. They don't last that long for everyone, but usually failure is due to dropping them in the dirt or something.</p></div>		</li>
