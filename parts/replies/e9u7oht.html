			<div class="markdown"><p>Influenza is a single-stranded RNA virus composed of 8 strands that code for different aspects. It has no ability to edit, so it mutates very quickly (called genetic drift), but it can also reassert those 8 strands if you have a co-infection with multiple subtypes (genetic shift). </p>
<p>The part of the influenza virus that the current vaccine builds immunity against (the hemagglutinin head) is very susceptible to small genetic changes. </p>
<p>One of the current avenues of research for a universal vaccine involves building antibodies to the hemagglutinin stalk, rather than the head, which changes less with mutation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Tri-Valent is much less popular in the US but more popular across the rest of the world</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one major reason we have a pandemic ready response. I work for Seqirus, a major influenza vaccine manufacturer and we are ready to produce formulated vaccines in the even of a pandemic outbreak. We have selected pandemic strains every season and are also capable of creating a viral strain with short notice if necessary. Although the response time is not immediate, in the event we have to create the vaccine from scratch,  it's better then having nothing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>ahh yes, because globalism causing one hemisphere's diseases to predictably fall into your own environment is so cool and great. woohoooooo!</p></div>		</li>
