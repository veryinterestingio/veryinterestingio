			<div class="markdown"><p>My sister works for a bank. One day she was explaining this concept, and said it boils down to one thing. The bank would need so many redundant systems and programs to ensure everything was  correct, that it is just easier and cheaper to keep employees doing the mannual processes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, some of my job is automated engineering type stuff, and it's kind of scary how outdated some of the stuff is, but it's so critical we can't afford to have it fail, which also means it's so critical we can't update it, which also means it's so critical we can't really improve it... </p>
<p>It's a vicious cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The financial sector <em>thinks</em> that they are extremely risk averse, but that's because they tend to consider one class of risks while completely ignoring another. Thinking that automated straight-through processing increases risk because it's different is a good example of that asymmetric evaluation of risks. Automated STP of all transactions would introduce some risks and mitigate others. By refusing to change, they're not being risk averse, they're just continuing to ignore the same risks that they accepted before.</p>
<p>Here's my analogy for how big banks view risk and change:</p>
<p><em>You have to walk 10 blocks to an appointment, and there's rain in the forecast, so you bring your umbrella. You walk 8 blocks and then start to feel a few drops of rain. &quot;Well, I'm almost there&quot;, you think to yourself. &quot;Walking with the umbrella closed got me this far with no issues.&quot; You continue to walk in the rain while weighing the pros and cons of opening the umbrella at this late stage. With just one block to go, you decide &quot;I can see my destination now - it would be imprudent to introduce any change at this stage.&quot; And you arrive drenched, holding a closed umbrella, proud of your foresight to bring it, and your conservative strategy in refusing to use it.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree completely.  They are risk averse as they define risk, and as such are actually opening themselves up to far more real risk, but that risk is now defused because no one is willing to put their own reputation on the line to do things different (right).  So even though the actions are as a whole actually riskier, the system views them as less risky because of how they are defining risk.</p></div>		</li>
