			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. As many people have said, NDA's have significant legal penalties. To put a finer point on it, one game isn't a career, though. What big name studio would want to hire someone who got caught violating an NDA? You could get some mad internet points for leaking, but that's it.</p>
<p>If you're working on an amazing title, that people really crave spoilers for, why compromise everything it took you to get there?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can see that, I mean no one is going pay you retirement money to leak details about a video game. Even if you did leak, what would you gain? You'd lose a lot more then any potential gains. I also bet those NDAs are iron clad.</p></div>		</li>
