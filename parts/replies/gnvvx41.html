			<div class="markdown"><p>It's like living everyday in a nightmare you can't wake up from. You know that feeling of dread you get sometimes when you wake up? It's that feeling, every fucking day. You become a number, nobody gives a fuck about you or what you got going on. You take shits and showers in front of other people, you lose every single ounce of privacy you're used to. You're surrounded by hundreds of grown adults that will fight you over your cookie. It's loud. You won't sleep much, and if you do, it's not good sleep. The food sucks, and the people are even worse. I wouldn't recommend it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hehe thank you, sincerely.  I tend to do this a lot and will act inappropriately.</p>
<p>like laughing at a coworker for making an offhand joke about me hanging myself in a tree to straighten my neck out. I laughed hard, telling him my twin sister hung herself in a tree. Lol I still, there was no way for him to know and I thought the coincidence was just a way of my sister acknowledging she was still around. I wasn't offended.</p>
<p>Anyway- I'm usually told that's weird or inappropriate, so I feel great that you appreciate my particular perspective. Kinda validating, so thank you kind stranger</p></div>		</li>
