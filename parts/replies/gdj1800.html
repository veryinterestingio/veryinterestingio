			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth mentioning that devices that suck more power are always made rechargeable. People would go insane if they had to put new batteries in their phone every day or two, but it's not a big deal to charge it every night. Conversely, if a device like a TV remote can go a year or more on a single charge, there isn't much motivation to use rechargeables.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is really the big driver of the phenomenon that OP is asking about. It’s less about a huge difference in the lifespan of the batteries and more that we use them for very different things and the difference in how long one “charge” lasts is a direct result of not wasting single use batteries in devices that are going to burn through them in a couple of hours, which is less of a problem for a rechargeable battery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think OP is just complaining that his electronics don't function to their full potential when using NiMH instead of Alkaline batteries. Simply put, NiMH has a lower power curve that the voltage starts lower and dips faster than Alkaline that has a fairly steady voltage output that drops drastically when expended</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Game Boy practically sipped battery power compared to the Game Gear. </p>
<p>Six double-A's that sucker took, and it burned through them in about three hours. </p>
<p>15 or so hours on four double-A's I can handle in comparison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Roku remote isn’t IR, it uses some kind of radio and also does a lot more like transmitting spoken word to the Roku or audio back from the Roku if you use the headphone slot. </p>
<p>If you don’t use the headphone slot, my Apple TV remote lasts months without a charge and essentially does the same thing as the Roku remote at that point, so not sure why the Roku would suck it down any faster except poor/cheap engineering.</p></div>		</li>
