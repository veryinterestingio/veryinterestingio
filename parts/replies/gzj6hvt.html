			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, liver cancer is a fairly common occurrence. This is also a problem for lung cells, blood cells, intestinal lining cells and other fast-replicating cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say that it's put at a greater risk of cancer just by the virtue of having a higher regenerative capacity because every cell has checkpoints in place in the form of proteins and genes and stuff, to kill any cell that may have gone rogue in terms of mutations and all. Having said that, the genetics, the amount of cell damage that toxins cause, general health of the person play a collective role in cancers. There is a line in one of the pathology textbooks that said, &quot;The only way to prevent cancer is to not be born&quot;. Which brings to light the fact that there's no 100% fool proof way to avoid cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and the risk does increase the more you push it's regenerative capabilities to the limit, via alcohol or drug abuse. Eventually the damage is faster than the healing, leading to scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) and distinctive spots in between where the liver doubles down on cell duplication (regenerative nodular hyperplasia), some of which eventually turn to hepatic cancer.</p></div>		</li>
