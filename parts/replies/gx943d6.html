			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth pointing out that Lions and Tigers can breed, but their offsprings can't. So They're very much not the same species, but part of a subspecies which can inbreed once.</p>
<p>Unlike dogs, which can breed between any of it's varying types without much issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me this is the best answer. We treat the term species as something constant. We think in stereotypes. But what we see is only the representation of a small section of the genes. Two animals might share 98% of their genome, but the other 2 % let them look completely different. Other animals look exactly the same, but share much less of the same genome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which helps because  by the time they meet around the ring, the daughter species often have slightly different ecological niches so if they could interbreed it would damage both populations.  (White-tailed  deer and sensu strictu mule deer have been overlapping in range over the last centuries and  producing hybrids which  have lowered survival chances. When chased,  mule deer run around obstacles, white-tails mn jump them, the hybrids hesitate before doing one or the other</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly, speciation occurs when through time enough differences build up between a population that part of the population can no longer breed with another part of that population, it's officially branched off at this point. This could be for genetic reasons, just incompatible at that point, or for physical reasons, like being way too large or small or something.
I think those &quot;barriers&quot; were called a postzygotic and prezygotic barrier respectively.</p>
<p>This is interesting because it makes me think about dogs, can a great Dane breed with a chihuahua? If not, wouldn't that mean we've bred them to the point where they are literally different species?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it's more of a viable fertile offspring thing. Horses and donkeys can breed and have offspring but their offspring can't have children. Same with lions and tigers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on which definition of species you use.
There are so many ways on how to define a species or how to distinguish one species from another.</p>
<p>There is e.g. a behavioral species concept, meaning two populations of animals are in theory able to produce fertile offspring, however their mating behavior is so different that it will never occur in nature.</p>
<p>It's really crazy, because up to a certain point they are all true and valid.</p>
<p>If you're interested, wikipedia is a good read as usual üëç</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. The human race - especially the pre-scientific human race - likes things to come with convenient labels and in distinct buckets. Life doesn't really fit that model - it's more of a continuous, blurry spectrum.</p>
<p>As for lions and tigers - I saw a documentary on their anatomy a couple of years back. If you were given one of each to examine, minus its pelt, you would need to be something of an expert to say which was which. The difference is almost literally &quot;skin deep&quot;. Basically, they're VERY closely related. Not quite close enough to be able to consistently produce fertile offspring*, but still very close.</p>
<p>*A male lion and a female tiger produce a &quot;liger&quot;, and ligers are normally fertile. A male tiger and a female lion produce a &quot;tigon&quot;, and tigons are normally infertile. But it's important to note that both ligers and tigons are prone to genetic disorders, and often die at an early age. The two genetic pools have moved a little too far apart, basically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Linnaeus isn't really pre-scientific but enough on the boundary that your description can apply. I keep wishing they'd found some non-avian dinosaurs on Tasmania or the Falkland Islands so we would have  a more useful division of the vertebrate classes.</p></div>		</li>
