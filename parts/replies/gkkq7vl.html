			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's the only physics-based explanation when considering the distribution and strength of Earth's magnetic field. The core must contain iron and it must be liquid to produce the magnetic field observed. Other materials besides liquid iron produce noticeable different or non-existent fields in terms of strength and behavior. The same goes for if the iron is not liquid, or if the iron is not at the core: the magnetic field would be noticeably different from that observed in molten iron.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's worth sharing this link to the University of Maryland, that has an experimental facility trying to mimick the geodynamo in the lab: <a href="http://www.danzimmerman.com/fluids/three-meter-experiment/" target="_blank">http://www.danzimmerman.com/fluids/three-meter-experiment/</a></p>
<p>(I am not sure if they still have it, but I heard about it for the first time very long ago)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rotation around the solid core isn't exactly the reason for the magnetic field, which in short is generated by convection in the liquid metallic outer core being twisted by planetary rotation. The slow freezing out of pure metal into the solid core, and especially the associated rising of lighter elements like sulfur, does supply energy to sustain the convection. But as Earth's magnetic field is much older than its solid core (how specifically it maintained a dynamo for billions of years is somewhat uncertain), and early Mars had a dynamo likely without freezing out an inner core, a solid core is not in general necessary--its growth just helps a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To also add, our estimations of the heat budget, thermal properties, etc of the interior of the Earth, are consistent with things that we can directly measure, e.g. surface heat flux (e.g. <a href="https://se.copernicus.org/articles/1/5/2010/" target="_blank">Davies &amp; Davies, 2010</a>).</p></div>		</li>
