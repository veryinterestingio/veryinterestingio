<p>There is no part of the Earth humans haven’t tarnished. Hell, we have downed satellites orbiting Earth. The oldest one still in orbit was launched in 1958.</p></div>		</li>

The planet will continue on just fine producing lifeforms over and over long after all humanity and all our creations and been reduced back to atoms, many many times over by time the sun destroys the earth.</p></div>		</li>

They are natural, so they vary somewhat, with some being quite stiff (makes a good scrubber) and some being pretty soft. They don't pick up stains easily and dry quickly. When you're done they can go in the compost - because you can <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/luffa-plant-profile-4796761" target="_blank">literally grow them in the garden</a> if you want to.</p>
<p>I'm honestly surprised they're not popular.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can start out pretty stiff so I like to have a new one for scrubbing pans and such and after they get broken in a bit they work well for everything else. Some do start out pretty soft, though. Then I just cycle through. A few have fallen apart relatively quickly, and some have seemed to last forever. Again - natural product.</p></div>		</li>
