<p>Tests were done where the core material between the two halves of the brain that connects it was severed. I believe (if I remember correctly) that people who had the connection severed could name an object but not it’s USE when looking through the left eye, whereas when they covered the other eye and had them look - they could describe what the item can do but not it’s specific name.</p></div>		</li>
