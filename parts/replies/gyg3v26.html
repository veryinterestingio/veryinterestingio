			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: we need to tackle <strong>both</strong>.</p>
<p>One of the big reasons we focus on methane is it is beyond low hanging fruit. This fruit is picked, packaged and ready to be sold. 60% of the reductions we were modelling come at low cost or with net savings - companies don't have to break the bank to have a massive climate impact.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/" target="_blank">2018 IPCC 1.5˚C Special Report</a> concluded that we must address all climate forcing emissions, including methane and other short lived climate pollutants (SLCP). The Special Report emphasizes the need for specific measures, such as those targeted by the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, to significantly reduce SLCP sources that won’t be reduced by the broader transformation and decarbonization of the energy sector.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What kind of easy solutions are these? I always thought most of the methane was caused by cattle farms and by melting permafrost. People eating less beef seems improbable and melting permafrost seems inevitable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok so now I actually read the relevant parts of the report, sorry. Changing the diet of people is the way to cut methane emissions as well as increase the health of people. Did you mean this with low hanging fruit solutions?</p></div>		</li>
