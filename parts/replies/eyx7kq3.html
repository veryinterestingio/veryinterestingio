			<div class="markdown"><p>I see you are justinbieberfan42. I have so many questions:</p>
<p>Are you fan number 42, or is 42 your age?</p>
<p>If 42 is your age, do you make a new account every year?</p>
<p>If you are fan number 42, how early in his career did you have to register to get that number. And finally . . </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this, cold water near the coast can often be due to upwelling, or deep water that is brought to the surface. This is important cause deep ocean water is extremely nutrient rich (since, ya know, stuff sinks in the ocean). With more nutrients you get more phytoplankton and more energy can pass up the food chain and support more large organisms (I.e. fish). Nutrient availability tends to trump light levels when it comes to the amount of life in the ocean.
