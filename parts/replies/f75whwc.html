			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a blood thinner.  Its an anti-hypertensive.  It lowers blood pressure.  And as a side effect they found it made you grow more hair.  Nothing to do with blood thinning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've tried a few things, Aminexil clinical 5, after 3 month of use my hair kept falling off, i tried some vegetable root shampoo, same thing, then i tried minoxidil, not only my hair kept falling off, also i started bleeding through my nose almost everyday. i got scared and stopped using that too. I've been reading about Rogaine and i like to try that but.... i also want to keep having erections so i don't know what to do</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small correction, minoxidil is a vasodilator, not a blood thinner. It makes your blood vessels bigger, which lowers blood pressure. Blood thinners stop your blood from clotting to prevent strokes/heart attacks. IIRC it works for hair by increasing blood flow to the scalp, which leads to healthier hair follicles.</p></div>		</li>
