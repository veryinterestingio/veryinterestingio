			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this question! To begin with, it is important to understand that hydrogen is an energy carrier, not an energy source, and the sustainability of the hydrogen depends on how the hydrogen is generated. </p>
<p>For example, hydrogen generation via water electrolysis using renewable electricity is very sustainable. However, hydrogen from coal gasification, which no one does, would not be considered sustainable. Hydrogen can also be generated from municipal wastes and waste biomass. This hydrogen can be considered sustainable, too. Electricity is sustainable only if it is generated from renewable resources. A considerable amount of the electricity comes from coal, which is not sustainable, and more from natural gas. So, the sustainability of both electricity and hydrogen depends on the power source. </p>
<p>This question also discusses efficiency of the conversion of electricity to storage. You are correct that a battery has a higher roundtrip efficiency than hydrogen for energy storage. However, efficiency is not the only measure of usefulness. Some other considerations are the amount of energy being stored and the time it takes to refuel (or recharge). So one has to look at the energy use applications. There are several operations on ports that an electric solution does not lend itself, such as cargo-handling equipment. At a port, costly equipment redundancy would be necessary to accommodate charging times (which can be of the order of several hours to overnight). The smaller forklift fleets already in use have spare batteries. </p>
<p>Also, the physical size of the batteries that would be required for the considerably larger cargo-handling equipment trucks, even if only for a half of a 12-hour shift, would be much larger than the vehicle itself - certainly way more ballast than is necessary!</p>
<p>Another consideration that comes into play is pollution at ports. In order to meet target emissions reductions, alternative cleaner, greener, and sustainable energy sources (fuels) will be required. Hydrogen does meet these requisites, especially when you bring energy use into consideration.</p>
<p>An advantage of a fuel cell coupled to hydrogen versus battery is that, for batteries, the power generation unit and the energy storage unit are the same. If you want to increase the amount of energy stored, the power generated necessarily gets bigger (you buy a bigger battery). I can change the amount of energy stored independent of the power generation unit. For hydrogen coupled to a fuel cell, if I need the fuel cell to generate power longer, I need a bigger tank. One should also consider the refueling / recharging time requirements for the applications. So which should I use, a battery or a fuel cell? Here’s the annoying answer- it depends on the application! If you need long duration, a hydrogen-powered fuel cell would work. If you need fast turnaround time (fast refueling), a fuel cell may be the answer. If it is a lighter-duty application, then a battery may be the answer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I am late but still will try luck. Isn't water not really renewable?</p></div>		</li>
