			<div class="markdown"><p>So Basically what you are saying is that the cells and nervous system stay more or less intact, and don't really get broken down into some primordial goop?  I guess that makes sense.  I was envisioning that everything gets broken down far more than it really does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I don't believe this is what u/zeiandren is saying.</p>
<p>You seem to know what neurons are since you know what a nervous system is.  You may also know that complex &quot;learning&quot; in the brain is the result of cells connecting to each other to form patterns of communication between cells.  What you may be missing is that a simpler form of learning can happen in other ways as well.  </p>
<p>u/zeiandren made the case that the <em>sensitivity</em> of cells to various hormones or chemicals may be responsible for learning on some level.  Cigarette smokers don't learn an addiction because of connections between neurons, rather they learn an addiction because the chemical Nicotine in the smoke changes the sensitivity of all the neurons in the brain to &quot;want&quot; that chemical more.  Even if you were to remove all the connections between neurons and reconnect them some other way, that chemical dependence would remain and the smoker would likely continue to be addicted to Nicotine.</p>
<p>Note that I don't believe u/zeiandren's explanation is true.  No one actually knows how this information is retained.  His explanation may be a good guess that is worthy of investigation, however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That last paragraph is a great analogy; I would extend it by saying the &quot;new&quot; you would have no idea what cigarettes were, but would probably feel like shit without them, and as soon as you caught a whiff of some tobacco you'd be all over that shit.</p></div>		</li>
