<p>In fluid mechanics they call this the &quot;laminar boundary layer&quot; and it's a region where heat can only transfer via diffusion (outside the boundary layer you have convection). It exists around all objects that touch a fluid at all times (the model breaks down at very high flow velocities). However, as the air flow increases in speed, the boundary layer becomes smaller which allows for faster heat transfer away from your body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Air flow also cools you down due to convection. As you stop, air moving stops, convection is way waaaay lower. Therefore body needs to release more sweat so you lose more heat from evaporation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is close, but not quite the answer. </p>
<p>After exercising, the body experiences Excess Postexercise Oxygen Consumption, or EPOC. After strenuous activity, the body still consumes a lot of oxygen in order to restore its energy reserves and bring it back to equilibrium. </p>
<p>It’s used for replacing oxygen reserves (blood hemoglobin, myoglobin, in air in the lungs, and dissolved in plasma), replenishing the phosphates energy system, reconverting lactic acid to glucose in the kidneys and liver,</p>
<p><strong>serving the elevated metabolic rate that occurs as long as body temperature remains elevated by exercise, and supporting increased sweat gland activity, even after exercise.</strong></p></div>		</li>
