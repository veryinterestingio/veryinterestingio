			<div class="markdown"><p>Then I assume people who are uploading videos to youtube should take the extra 20 mins to do that second pass? My program asks for the number of passes and I usually go with 1, but a second would bump up the quality with similar filesize eh? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>YouTube will re-compress your video anyways. If you can (have the storage, bandwidth and are under their upload limit) upload the highest quality to YouTube and let them deal with the rest. And if you already have a video you want to upload (not just a multi-track video editing project that needs to be rendered), do <em>not</em> convert it if YouTube accepts the format you have, as you'll just add a quality loss.</p>
<p>Single-pass compression at a high bitrate will still beat two-pass compression at a lower bitrate. However, some software lets you set a quality instead of a target bitrate. That way you don't know how big the file will be, but you should get good quality with a single pass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>YouTube is actually pretty heavily compressed. Last time I checked (about a year ago) it was ~3,5Mbit VBR for 1080p Videos</p>
<p>If you want your video to be a lot higher quality, just upres it to 2K/4K and enjoy the significantly higher bitrate</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, switching to two-pass will give you much better quality at the same file size. But it will also take about 30-40% more time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Always upload your source video with the best quality ever. YouTube does their own processing, there's no need to waste time and cycles doing your own for less quality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Netflix uses H.265 codec and has no time limits on its encoding. It can take all day to encode a video, getting extra compression and quality prior to releasing. It makes one feed per device category/size (is; HD, SD, iPhone, iPad, etc).</p>
<p>Your cable provider has to live-compress 500-100 channels with fraction of a second delays.  It’s about keeping up, and if you sacrifice quality to do so, so be it. (Or they get a compressed feed incoming, but even that is live-compressing).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Transcoding - converting video
e.g. from original raw file to multiple lower quality files (so you can jump between them depending on bandwidth)</p>
<p>Pipeline - infrastructure (servers and networks) to do this. Netflix use Amazon cloud servers.</p>
<p>Tuning - when doing the transcoding, you can tweak how the program does its work, to help it go faster and get better results depending on the characteristics of the source video
e.g. &quot;when compressing this video, because it's animated, look at area of the pictures 32x32 pixels, and look backwards 3 seconds&quot;

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not suitable for streaming since necessary bitrate fluctuates wildly depending on complexity. </p>
<p>Capped VBR is quite common. 2 pass is better for sure but does cost twice as much compute, so it’s often not worth it. </p></div>		</li>
