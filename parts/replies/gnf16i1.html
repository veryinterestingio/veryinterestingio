(Edit of the phrase “less effective” to “less precise self-checking than DNA” thank you editor!)</p></div>		</li>

<p>I believe one of the things that distinguishes coronaviruses from most other kinds of virus - including other kinds of RNA virus - is that they <em>do</em> have error checking.  They encode their own replication proofreader that catches a large majority of replication errors.  This means their mutation rate is much much lower than that of most other kinds of viruses, which is what allows them to have much longer RNA - which, in turn, is how they've been able to evolve more clever mechanisms for evading immune systems.</p>
<p>On the opposite extreme you have something like HIV, which mutates too much for us to have ever been able to come up with a vaccine.</p>
<p>However, coronavirus proofreading is still much worse than the normal DNA-to-mRNA process for our own proteins.  So their mutation rate is still much much higher than our protein error rate.  Edit: And of course our own <em>mutation</em> rate is even lower, since our mRNA doesn't itself get replicated, and our DNA replication is considerably more reliable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, we have fairly simple proofreading in the processes generating mRNA from a DNA template (transcription, splicing etc). Since our genetic material is DNA, we don't have an evolutionary need for careful error-checking when generating RNA.</p>
<p>However, the mutation rate in human DNA replication is extremely low.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No. The majority of mutations are silent, having no effect. Of those that do have an effect, the majority are detrimental. It's hard to &quot;find&quot; those particular sequences that turn out to work well, out of all the possibilities, with random mutations.</p></div>		</li>
