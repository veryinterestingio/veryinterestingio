My full, legal name is Hannah Thankful Cromartie; my parents literally picked it off an old (1700s) family gravestone in eastern NC (where my family settled after leaving Scotland). In first grade, I started going by my middle name because there were too many Hannahs in my class. Here’s a chart for the weirdly curious/doubters <a href="http://www.cromartiefamilyassociation.com/docs/CromartieChartdraft9.29.08.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.cromartiefamilyassociation.com/docs/CromartieChartdraft9.29.08.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.cromartiefamilyassociation.com/docs/CromartieChartdraft9.29.08.pdf</a></a>.
