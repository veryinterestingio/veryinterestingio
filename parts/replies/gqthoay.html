			<div class="markdown"><p>Also a really important point people forget- in gaming, graphics aren’t about “what we can do”, it’s about “can people’s machines actually run this”. Artists have been making super high poly models for much longer than RDR has been in developement, but baking that level of detail into a real time engine is the hard part. So it’s really the market tech that’s been the limiting factor, not the ability to make the graphics</p></div>		</li>

<p>And then there’s Crytek who was like “lol almost no one’s gonna be able to run this, but it’s gonna look incredible for those who can.”</p></div>		</li>

<p>Exactly. I could do ray tracing 30 years ago by downloading the instruction file from a BBS. The technology just wasn't there to do it anywhere near real-time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personal opinion of mine: you don't need the updates at all to enjoy the singleplayer game, which is the best this game has to offer and online is garbage.</p>
<p>Though you may notice some FPS drops in certain areas which was only fixed at later updates, you will also notice that the graphics are better with the base game.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A good example is the Cyberpunk 2077 fiasco. People look at it and go, &quot;That is what we got after almost 10 years of development?!?&quot; </p>
<p>Although they released a &quot;demo&quot; in 2013 and another video in 2018, they didn't actually start to assemble the actual development team until 2016 after hitting &quot;reset&quot; and starting over again! So it really only had about 3 years of development. If you read how they are approach the patches they release, he describes it exactly as you did.</p></div>		</li>
