			<div class="markdown"><p>Mammals can have pretty amazing growth rates, at least when young, since mammals are milk fed which really provides a huge amount of calories.  Whale babies can pack on more than a hundred pounds a day for their first year of life.  Of course that's whales but elephants do a respectable 2-3 lbs/day during the first year which, given the weight of the baby, is pretty big.  And then you have seals.  Some seal babies double their weight or more in a couple of weeks of nursing.  </p>
<p>Dinosaurs stand out because they grew from tiny to large....and then just kept going!  Mammal growth rate levels off while they must have just ramped up growth  as they could gather more and more food.</p></div>		</li>
