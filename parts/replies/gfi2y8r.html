			<div class="markdown"><p>Because you might need to use them and that's going to waste your healing progress and waste resources. That'd be like trying to refill a gas tank with a car on from a practicality perspective; why take the risk when you've got this nice, reliable, inert period to take advantage of instead. </p>
<p>As for the true why: Because it's either the best system around or at least good enough to make it to reproduction time and time again more than other ways of doing it did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would assume its similar to a high stress situation. In a high stress situation many functions stop functioning like they normally do, others become enhanced, etc.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I would imagine sleep is the opposite in that many things are shut off that we commonly use when awake and the repair and cleaning of cells is enhanced because they do not need to focus on other tasks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The muscle does repair at rest. Basically it's always being repaired, just that when you're awake and active, it's being repaired at a very slow rate. </p>
<p>Another thing is that when you're in deep sleep, your HGH increases. High HGH has been shown to aid muscle recovery / building and it's so good that bodybuilders often abuse HGH to gain an edge in building muscle / recovering faster. The problem comes when they abuse too much of it and face side effects like enlarged organs, bones, etc.</p></div>		</li>
