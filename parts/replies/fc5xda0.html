			<div class="markdown"><p>interesting, i put way less sugar in my cold brew than in hot coffee, but I'm doing it to mellow out the bitterness and it seems like the bitterness mellows out a lot when its cold</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's because of the brewing temp, not the serving temp. Boiling water leaches more bitter tannins out of the coffee grounds than cold water. If you like hot drinks but don't like bitterness, you can heat up cold brew and it's very tasty. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cold brewing coffee also pulls less bitter taste out of the beans. Also bitterness /= acidic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's odd, I put about half sugar in iced coffee because it's naturally sweeter and less bitter (less acidic).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is less bitter I agree I just usually drink cold brew with more milk (kind of like a latte but no espresso?)  but I also make my cold brew with dark roast and usually very strong.</p></div>		</li>
