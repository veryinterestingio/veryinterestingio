			<div class="markdown"><p>Saltwater intrusion is not only common along the coast, but also in inland areas where natural salt deposits can rise to the surface via capillary action. This can cause major corrosion issues for infrastructure. Saltwater observed in a borehole on Oak Island could almost be expected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the early 90s we had contracted a company to dig a borewell for water. We had paid for the borewell to be dug till 150 feet.  </p>
<p>The company found sweet water at about 50 feet. But the elders, feeling short-changed, made them dig to the contracted 150. Guess what? The water at the lower levels was salty. And it now contaminated the water at the higher level</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>saltwater intrusion sucks, overuse of south florida’s aquifer is causing groundwater depletion and advancement of salt into the aquifer (sofla’s freshwater aquifer used to extend beyond the coastline) there is actually some locations off the coast in the ocean that are fresh water springs (fresh water springs in the ocean)</p>
<p>0/10 would recommend salt water intrusion</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Miami is in real trouble due to the actual damage due to flooding AND the sleeper being their aquifer being contaminated with salt water. No amount of pumps will solve the latter. I bet people in high places know this, but given there is still a massive amount of people living there, i.e. tax base, they just pander and put in more pumps and hope that stems the relocation bleeding. Eventually the coastal portions of the city will be deserted and the residents will sprawl or relocate entirely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also this island was created by wash from a river created from the glacier melts supposedly, and where everything from boulders to pebbles were deposited near the mouth of the river from decades to centuries of huge glaciers grinding and the water displacement carried them there.</p>
<p>There have been some very interesting finds there but in the case of sea water being found deep its not of much importance and you can see where the History channels integrity is at right now.</p>
<p>I do believe though that what ever was there was already dug up and found long ago, most likely by the earlier inhabitants like the freed American slave who moved there after the Revolutionary war as he became pretty wealthy all of a sudden. </p>
<p>Whether anything found was from pirates or Templars or whatever is something we'll probably never know though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. There's also the native americans from what is now Mexico that fled to the island trying to escape the Spanish conquistadors. They brought a lot of artifacts of their own, pottery and jewelry mostly. They built many of the wooden structures that have been dug up over the years. Ultimately they and their early descendants are thought have been conscripted or enslaved to build the tunnels and traps for the pirates. Being a very small and isolated society they had limited, if any, need for &quot;treasure&quot; the pirates wanted to hide on the island. Some may have interacted with the Templars or their descendants on the island as well, which is why some of the carvings &quot;almost&quot; match up with artifacts from Europe known to be of Templar origin. The artifacts on the island are like a copy of a copy of a copy created by successive generations. Details and real meaning lost along the way.</p>
