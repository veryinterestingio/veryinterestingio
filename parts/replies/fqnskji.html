			<div class="markdown"><p>If I'm not mistaken, it's because of blood being redirected from organs to the extremities in case of the need to flight. It's essentially the same thing as the stomach drop of being startled or scared, since we associate social survival with real survival due to some evolutionary traits left behind. </p>
<p>I'm probably wrong and I'm definitely not an expert but I believe I remember hearing something about this a long time ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that's what the OP is taking about. There are two different things: One is the initial reaction, like what the body feels when spooked or when you hear really bad news, which is temporary. The second is the long lasting pit in the stomach that can be triggered just by thinking about something bad and that feeling can last for hours, days, weeks, or even longer. It's draining as hell. I feel it everyday less and less but am feeling it right now as I think about something that happened 6 months ago. For the first couple months after a traumatic experience I lived with that pit in my stomach every waking second. The only time I didn't feel it is when I was asleep and dreaming. I looked forward to sleeping at night because I often have vivid and lucid dreams and was free from the physical pain in my gut during that time. I would wake up and still feel good for a few seconds and then reality would hit me and I'd think about what happened and the physical burning in my gut would resume and stay all day until I feel asleep again. It was so bad the first couple months I had no appetite at all. I just wasn't hungry and eating made me nauseous and I lost 20 lbs. I think this is what OP is asking about. I too am curious about what is actually happening physiologically in my abdomen. Why does emotional trauma cause long lasting physical pain in the stomach/intestinal area and why does it come back when simply remembering the trauma?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh then in that case I would indeed be mistaken. That is a mystery to me as to why but I know the feeling. I had to stop talking to my best friend about a year ago because I had had feelings for her for almost 10 years. The emotional pain was so intense I felt it physically for at least a week, after which I just felt empty. Not sure which was worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed.  I've had this feeling for months at a time from heartbreak.  No adrenaline rush involved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very much agree. I’ve had anxiety and ‘pit in stomach’, all feel very different than a broken heart.</p></div>		</li>
