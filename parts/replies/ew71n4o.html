			<div class="markdown"><p>Nowadays it's extremely rare that an incompatible blood type is transfused. It's a huge deal whenever it does happen because so much is routinely done to prevent it. There's even a computer system that will automatically determine compatibility based on test results. It makes some people uncomfortable but it hasn't resulted in a transfusion reaction once yet as far as I know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fast-paced triage situations, like war or disasters, the blood banks will try to procure as much O- blood as possible, but if the patient is known to be Type A, they'll try and provide Type A blood to save the rarer Type O blood for unknown recipients.</p>
<p>Ideally, they will only give Type AB patients Type AB blood, because it can't be used for anyone else anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can check ABO Rh pretty rapidly but there are tons of other blood antigens that can cause a hemolytic reaction, meaning that even type O blood isn't necessarily universally compatible. When time is of the essence, starting a type and screen and finding crossmatch compatible units is most likely going to cause more problems than it's going to solve. Typically in emergency situations, a doctor will order type O neg units and will have to sign off on them, taking full responsibility (and exonerating the lab) in the event of a transfusion reaction. In most cases with the lesser known antigen groups, you can receive incompatible blood once to a few times before you become sensitized to the antigen and develop antibodies that will destroy the blood cells. Generally, if someone has never received a transfusion before, they shouldn't have any major issues when receiving O neg blood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its very fast to check blood type. Under a minute.  But yeah, if they absolutely have no time they'll just give o-. Did you know that almost half of all people have O blood type?</p></div>		</li>

<p>For the 11.1% of the population with Rh Negative blood, O- is more important to have.</p></div>		</li>

1) A and B hate each other<br />
2) O love everyone, but no one love O<br />
3) AB love no one, but everyone love AB<br />
4) Everyone love themselves</p></div>		</li>
