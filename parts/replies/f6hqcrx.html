<p>They have (or had) an enigma machine on display at the spy museum at Ft. Meade.  Apparently some old timer came through with his family and when he saw it, he became extremely agitated, said something like 'you can't have that out like that' over and over.  His family had to walk him out the door.  He'd worked with them during the war, and they knew how to keep a secret.</p></div>		</li>
