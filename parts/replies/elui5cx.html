			<div class="markdown"><p>That's right they don't. </p>
<p>Which is kind of the reason why space telescopes exist. They don't have all that atmosphere to look through so get much clearer images. Even looking at the moon you can see the atmospheric interference distorted the image, making it all weebly and distorted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By the way, planets absolutely do twinkle, just not as often.</p>
<p>If air turbulence is bad enough, and the planet is close enough to the horizon, it will clearly twinkle. I've seen this many times observing Venus near sunset.</p>
<p>So it's not a super-reliable criterion to tell planets from stars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's one reason space telescopes exist but not the only one. There's also the fact that the atmosphere is actually opaque (or at least very hazy) at certain non-visible wavelengths that are astronomically interesting. The greenhouse effect is caused by opacity in the infrared range, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also why telescopes are built at high altitude.
Less atmosphere to look through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neat! At first I thought it would be the other way around as the large area of planets would make it more susceptible to the blinking effect, and that the pin-point light emitting from stars would cause its light to be more stable. Goes to show that what you initially find logical might not be the right answer. But I’m drunk, so who knows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The larger areas <em>do</em> have more blinking pinpoints in them. They just average out so you don't notice it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also recall reading that those perturbations could momentarily make entire swaths of the visible spectrum for the entire star disappear and reappear second-to-second.  But since the refraction angle is dependent on frequency, only certain colors get refracted away from your eyes at any moment.  Does that sound right?</p></div>		</li>
