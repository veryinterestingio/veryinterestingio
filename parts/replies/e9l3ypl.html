			<div class="markdown"><p>To add slightly to this: when you cook, you might notice that most foods weigh less and shrink a little compared to being raw. This is almost entirely the result of water evaporating which doesnâ€™t reduce the calories. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But what this does mean is that when weighing your food on a food scale, or using volume to portion food, cooked food is more dense with actual food, raw food contains lots of water. </p>
<p>If you weigh your raw ingredients then cook those, the calories don't change much at all. </p>
<p>But if you calculate the calories in 1 cup of raw spinach but you eat 1 cup of cooked spinach. You're actually eating multiple cups of raw spinach in the form of 1 cup of cooked spinach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer is that a lot of plant food has digestible material surrounded by indigestible material (cellulose).  The plant cell walls are not digestible by humans so a lot of it passes through us without being extracted.  For example: when you shit out a completely intact kernel of corn - the outer skin protected the starchy interior from your stomach acids and gut flora.  Thus, you don't get as high of a caloric yield usable.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you mash up the corn, you extract more material and you'll get more of those calories absorbed.  </p>
<p>cooking does exactly this - heat weakens the plant cell walls and allows the inner material that is digestible to leak out or get squished out and become food rather than pass through your butthole undigested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This.</p>
<p>The total calorie content doesn't change.</p>
<p>However, the calorie density will change.</p>
<p>For instance, cooking a 100g (3.5oz) piece of raw chicken breast with 125 calories will shrink down to 80g since they often leak out/evaporate 20% of its weight in water content. So it still has 125 calories, but in more tightly packed lean tissue. Thus the calories per gram has technically gone up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's often said &quot;a calorie is a calorie&quot;. What you said is part of it, but not all of it. A calorie is a calorie when you combust food product in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorimeter#Bomb_calorimeters" target="_blank">bomb calorimeter</a>. But that's not an accurate model of how your body digests food.</p>
<p>Simply put: cooking food makes energy in food more bio available. It is <em>not</em> simply a matter of density change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haven't looked in to it in a while but a couple of years ago, I read on a lot of fitness/nutrition sites that cooking things (usually protein pancakes to be specific) could often result in &quot;losing&quot; some of the protein when the cakes were being heated.  </p>
<p>Is that not true as losing grams of protein would result in a loss of calories? Or is the loss of calories from the lost protein made up for by the &quot;gained&quot; calories from cooking the raw food?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your mouth is wet acts as a barrier for the heated eats. Also it's a bit of a sensitivity thing not as many nervesin the mouth as compared to hands.
And also a bit of a tolerance thing how often dto you hold hot stuff in your hands vs put hot stuff in mouth. </p></div>		</li>
