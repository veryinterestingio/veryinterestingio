<p>While the amount paid to interest of course feels bad, the alternative is never having had that money in the first place.</p>
<p>Imagine buying a house without a mortgage. You could say &quot;I'm not taking out a loan to buy a home because I'd have to pay interest&quot; but once you buy the home, you get to use it, live in it, and likely the value of the home goes up more than your total interest payment.</p>
<p>Similarly, imagine a small business wanting to expand its operations to become more profitable. It sells bonds that it will pay back with 2% interest in a year to members of its community. It collects 5 million dollars from selling the bonds, and uses that to open two new locations. Those new locations are profitable and the business has no problem finding the money it needs to pay back the bonds with interest, and now the business has successfully expanded operations.</p>
<p>The government works the same way. It borrows money to invest in itself, and almost always the value of the investment is greater than the value of the interest.</p>
<p>Look at what China has done in the past two decades. They borrowed money out the ass from banks and from many Chinese businesses, and used the money to rapidly build bridges, ports, roads, and even entire cities from scratch. Their debt is due soon, but they're received many many times return on their initial investment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>China example is a good one but it isn’t comparable i think because they are just starting to get to the point where US was 20-30 years ago. Where investments doesn’t return much, it reaches a feasable frontier on it.</p>
<p>The problem is US has massive debt it has to borrow more to make payments on those debts and it is going into a territory where it can’t even cover the interest on those because of rolling them over so many times and these bonds ends up in feds ballance sheet at the end of the bussines cycle.</p>
<p>This creates more of a problem on the independence of the fed because ofcourse the government has an incentive to borrow more and spend more and this creates a moral hazard.</p>
<p>I don’t think anyone knows what will happen in the future with the QE going on but it doesn’t look good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The current government in The Netherlands managed to bring down the national debt quite a bit in recent years. That meant being frugal, implement cuts; it hasn't been fun but it worked. Now the COVID crisis hit and we are in a good position to take on new debt to combat this crisis. Of course it's a shame the gains of the last years are probably largely undone by now, but on the other hand - if we hadn't been frugal, we'd be in a much different situation altogether.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s not costing the Netherlands any money. Those corporations will go somewhere else if the Netherlands upped the tax rate. It’s the Race to the Bottom that means there will always be another tax haven. </p>
<p>Curtailing this practice has to start with the places these corporations actually conduct business for this reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For wealthy European countries it's not quite the same, as they have zero or negative interest rates. A country such as Germany could grow a big debt, but get no interest to pay back. Their infrastructure would benefit from such debt, but their political leadership is too dogmatic in their &quot;balanced books&quot; doctrine to utilize the great debt conditions available to the country.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, current circumstances are very beneficial and taking on some extra debt could have a positive impact. </p>
<p>One issue I see, though: once you are used to borrowing money, can you quit with it once the interest rates go up? The risk is that a country will get used to financing ongoing liabilities (such as pensions or healthcare) using borrowed money. Once interest rates go up, you could be in trouble.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, it didn't work. They cut their spending on services for several years and paid down debt instead - exactly what the people say having lots of debt results in us doing anyway - then when it got low, they had to borrow and spend anyway, pushing it back up.</p>
<p>So in the end, they failed to provide as many services as their taxes could have because they paid down debt, then they had to go back into debt to pay for the services they now need. </p>
<p>At best, they spent years not providing some services in order to save money in the future on interest payments that would have caused them to not provide some services. Only, when you pay down principle, you spend far more money than if you just paid the interest that year. Even at rediculously high 10% interest each year, it literally takes 10 years of interest payments to make up for 1 year of the equivalent principle. Most government debt is in the 2-3% interes range. If takes 30-50 years of interest payments to equal 1 equivalent principle payment.</p>
<p>Why spend $100 today to save 50 years worth of $2 payments? The government will never, and should never, pay off its debt. It should always roll that debt into a new cycle and just pay the interest.</p>
<p>Those debt sales stimulate and maintain the economy, because banks and investors want to buy and sell them. They preserve retirement assets and long term savings because they are insanely secure. They make sure we don't need sudden and potentially crippling tax increases to address the needs of society. And since the government will live on in perpetuity and the interest rate is always floating around the same rate as inflation, the balance sits stagnant and only increases when futher spending is needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not even clear that it’s bad when it grows out of hand - or at least, ‘out of hand’ can’t be nearly mapped over to ‘very large.’ Under some circumstances (eg many highly industrialised advanced western economies) it really seems like a country can grow as large a debt as it likes. It’s not necessarily intuitive, but only because the intuitive explanation doesn’t seem to scale to large economies.</p></div>		</li>
