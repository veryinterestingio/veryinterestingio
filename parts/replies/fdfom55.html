			<div class="markdown"><p>Really no reason to use dumb bombs anymore. With smart weapons you have a higher chance of hitting your target using fewer weapons and much less chance of collateral damage. So you donâ€™t need as many aircraft to deliver them which means less cost, less logistical support (e.g. tankers, mechanics), and less risk to pilots</p></div>		</li>
