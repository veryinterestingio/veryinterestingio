			<div class="markdown"><p>You need to get the &quot;dry bulb&quot; temperature, i.e.: the air temperature, same as you'd always do.</p>
<p>Then put a bit of wet fabric on the bulb, and use a small fan to cool the bulb from evaporation. This can also be done by whirling the thermometer around in the air in a circle, using a &quot;sling psychrometer.&quot; <a href="https://www.globalgilson.com/content/images/thumbs/0001315_sling-psychrometer_600.jpeg" target="_blank">This one</a> has wet and dry bulb in one instrument.</p>
<p>Compare the temperatures; the wet bulb will be the same as the dry bulb if the air is saturated; otherwise, it will be a little lower, due to evaporation.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>related question: why is humidity % colloquially measured, but not the amount of water vapor in the air? I live in a climate where it gets real dry in the winter and really humid in the summer. the humidity % can be the same in both seasons, with much different effects</p>
<p>would it not be as helpful to know how absolutely dry or humid it actually will be?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>No; the amount of sweat that'll lift off your body and into the air (cooling and drying you) depends on the percentage. Knowing how much is in the air won't give you any useful information until you check how much the air can hold that day to compare it with... and that's you back to relative humidity.</p>
<p>It might be good to know absolute levels if you wanted to collect water by condensing it out of the air, in which case 80% RH in winter is going to be a lot less useful than 80% in summer, but that's a pretty niche scenario.</p></div>		</li>
