			<div class="markdown"><p>A magnet indeed produces work when it attracts an object. But then you need to spend the exact same energy to separate the object from the magnet. </p>
<p>So the energy balance adds up to zero if you try to cycle the process, that's why magnets alone can't be a power source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or even gravity. It &quot;powers up&quot; turbines in hydroelectric plants, but the cycle only perpetuates as long as an external energy source moves the water back on top of the mountains (=evaporation = sun power). Sun power which actually comes from nuclear fusion inside the Sun...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks this makes sense, magnets have two poles a N and S and I believe they are of equal strength right? Does this imply that spinning a magnet requires the same amount of energy as separating all the objects being attracted by the magnet?</p>
<p>Because one way to separate an object moving towards a magnet would be to spin the magnet so that the repelling side faces the object and then pushes it away until it reaches some distance, and then spin the magnet again so that the object moves towards the magnet, and repeat.</p>
<p>But if the energy to spin a magnet is proportional the amount of energy used to attract an object, then it obviously all cancels out. Is my intuition correct here?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you therefore say that the object <em>lost</em> &quot;magnetic potential energy&quot;? Like how they say gravitational potential energy is the energy required to lift an object up to the height in question?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, if you've studied physics a bit, that's how you do it (=transformation of the potential energy into kinetic energy), whether we're talking about gravity, electrostatism or even a spring</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Consider that a (ferro)magnet is made from the spin magnetic moments of electrons and other particles. Every elementary particle has an associated spin magnetic moment, and this is fundamental to the particle the same way its spin and mass and charge are. Most of the time this magnetic moment is insignificant and gets cancelled out in atomic configurations. But in some elements (the ferromagnetic ones) this effect doesn’t get cancelled out and it’s possible to start aligning them together to produce measurable magnetic fields. </p>
<p>When a group of these element is aligned together they form a “domain” but for the whole material to be measurably magnetic, all the domains must also be aligned or else they cancel each other out. </p>
<p>Consistently using a (ferro)magnet may weaken its strength by throwing off some domains. Most of this would come from physical disruption of the material (dropping it, letting it hit objects, NOT from just letting it pull on objects, that itself can’t weaken the magnet). This could also be undone by introducing the material back into a stronger magnetic field to realign the domains again. But the magnetic moments of the particles don’t ever get weakened, just the configurations that let them produce measurable effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its the same as gravity. You get energy out when you let something fall down. But it will <em>stay</em> down unless you put energy in lifting it back up again. You can't get continuous work out of a magnet, you can only let things fall &quot;down&quot; towards it once. After that you need to put in energy to pull them apart again.</p></div>		</li>
