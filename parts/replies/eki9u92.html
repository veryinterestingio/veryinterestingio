			<div class="markdown"><p>I study poultry nutrition. The diet they eat is completely related to their microbiome. They are monogastric and so are humans. However, they have a more significant blind pouch that harbors most of their microbial populations (i.e. more defined appendix)</p>
<p>There is a similarity in birds and humans when eating grains high in non-starch polysaccharides (e.g. wheat, barley, and oats). Soluble NSP has drastic effects on the birds intestines and can lead to decreased lactobacillus microbes.</p>
<p>When testing an experimental diet in birds, they are given a 3 to 7 day period to adapt to their new diet before data is collected. A lot of that is related to microbiome changes. Diet is important in feeding microbes. The right diet feeds the right microbes, which can lead to out competing other more harmful bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hasn't there been numerous reports of decreasing diversity of the gut microbiome? For example refugees or immigrants from developing countries migrating to the developed world. Consequently adopting the diets of processed foods which weakens the resilience of the gut microbiome. Furthermore does the gut microbiome  indicate the overall strength of the immune system, and/or are there implications with the kind of diseases that are common in the developed world?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whole unprocessed organic foods grown in un-depleted soil without the use of chemical fertilizers or any type of -cides. Meats from animals raised on a type of diet they would naturally eat in the wild (assuming their food comes from chemically free and un-depleted soil) and are not given antibiotics or hormones. Wild fish and other seafood caught in uncontaminated waters.</p>
<p>Here's the thing though, good luck finding any of the above. At least in the way that I mentioned them.</p></div>		</li>
