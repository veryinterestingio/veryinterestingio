			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Rubbing alcohol will break the surface tension of the water. And, it evaporates much quicker</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dunno about everywhere, but you can buy this mixture over the counter in pharmacies here, ready mixed in a dropper bottle. Might be cheaper than buying full bottles of rubbing alcohol and peroxide if you don't have them on hand already.</p>
<p>Clears just about everything out of your ear, but read the warning labels as it is not suitable for people with chronic or acute ear infection or damage to the eardrum or canal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or get a licensed nurse to do it. Rinsing of the ear canal is usually done with a 50/50 solution (alc/water)
But the eardrum needs to be intact. You don't want alcohol entering your middle ear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rubbing alcohol is great at binding to the water and removing water tension, allowing it to flow out of your ear - and dry up quickly.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Works with electronics too. Rubbing alcohol is non-conductive, so it binds with the water and gets it out more easily and safely. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Of course - use with caution. Blew my ear drum snorkeling, nurse mom did this - worst pain in my life. Got all that seawater out of my skull though.</p></div>		</li>
