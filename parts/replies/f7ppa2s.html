			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you elaborate on this? I've always wondered about it and in my drunken state volunteered you to explain to this idiot. How is it that certain meds like Bayer are for for back pain say over Tylenol? I can't type out the actual medicine names or I'll fuck them up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using the two most common painkillers, Ibuprofen and Paracetamol. Ibuprofen works as the site of pain as a Non Steroid Anti-Inflammatory Drug or NSAID. It’s good for muscle pain or toothache as it works at the site of the pain and is certainly my preferred option.</p>
<p>Paracetamol works at the pain receptors in your brain so you still hurt, but your brain doesn’t know it. Kind of.</p>
<p>Because they work differently you can alternate them for really bad pain as long as you leave four hours between each dose of the same painkiller. And always read the label!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it would, in the case that you stated. If it was neuropathic pain and a more typical pain, like a toothache, then potentially not. It also depends on the type of pain medication. But in the majority of cases, yes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, if the same type of pain (nerve, nociceptive). Have to explain this a lot to patients when they try to get a codeine or hydrocodone prescription despite already being on oxycodone.</p></div>		</li>
