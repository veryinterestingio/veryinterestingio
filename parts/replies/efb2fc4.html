			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there's a little extra blame around the topics of browser UI, caching, cache busting, and content delivery networks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browsers tend to aggressively cache images and data. Often, too aggressively. So server owners often implement some &quot;cache busting&quot; mechanisms that force browsers to re-download data. Lazy developers might do this in an ugly way causing all data to reset</li>
<li>Content delivery networks and modern servers aren't, like, one machine that knows something about a particular file. It's a system of proxies, load balancers, and servers that come and go based on demand</li>
<li>Whether a file has changed or not may be totally unknown to these servers and proxies, who might not even know anything about filesize, hash, etc. A totally different server might be serving a totally different file, with the same name/path</li>
<li>Browsers are optimized for downloading lots of small files. That's how webpages work. The usecase of slow, long downloads was traditionally handled using FTP or other tech, which did/does support resumes quite well. As a result, modern browser have terrible UI/UX to even support this feature. It's generally much safer (and totally acceptable) to re-download a small file</li>
</ul>
<p>Fun topic overall. Seems like it should be obvious and simple, but I think it's actually very nuanced and complex</p></div>		</li>
