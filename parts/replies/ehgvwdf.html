			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question.  Stem cells are amazing cells!  They carry the intrinsic properties to develop into all the cells we have in our body.  We figured out how to guide them towards the fate of the insulin-producing beta cell and its nearest relatives, other hormone-producing cells that are also present in the pancreas.  By doing so, we are generating cells that have the potential to turn into other cell types as well.  For example, in the process of generating beta cells we need to pass through a stage where we generate cells that could form other organs along the gastrointestinal tract, including the liver, lung and gut.  Thus, by modifying our culture conditions slightly we should be able to generate cells that reside in these other tissues. As a matter of fact, we showed that we can generate cells of the thymus from stem cells a couple of years ago.
