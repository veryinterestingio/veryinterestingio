			<div class="markdown"><p>This happens if the speakers are loud enough to trigger the microphone. Turning down the speakers is one way to fix it, but very often the culprit is the automatic microphone adjustment needlessly raising the sensitivity while you are not talking.</p>
<p>In general, it's a good idea to disable that feature entirely. Just take the time to manually set the sensitivity to the right level before the telco.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all, sure, but many do. If it wasn't the case, speaking to someone on the phone and activating the speakers would let them hear themselves very clearly, and while sometimes it is the case, I'm pretty sure it's not always.</p></div>		</li>
