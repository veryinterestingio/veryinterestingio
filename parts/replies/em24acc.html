			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how hard you scratch. If the scaffold is pulled apart up on a part of the scab before it heals, you have a new open wound that needs to go through the healing cycles.</p>
<p>I find that scratching the skin around the scab relieves the itchy feeling without damaging the scab.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently discovered that slapping works really well for relieving the itch. I don't know if you're doing any damage by slapping it, but it relieves the itch without scratching! I've tested it on scabs, ant bites, and mosquito bites so far. 3-4 quick slaps from like 6 inches away seems to work best for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think if it bleeds or hurts to pick it, you should leave it alone. But eventually it's going to be damn near healed and just flake off if you pick at it. Otherwise some scabs will stay on for a long time even if it is healed. For example, my daughter had one on her head in her hair she would not let me touch. Eventually I was like &quot;nuh uh that thing has to go.&quot; She didn't even feel me do it and the skin was completely healed underneathe.</p></div>		</li>
