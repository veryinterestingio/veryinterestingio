If I gave students more flexibility and choice, for example you can submit your work in the form of a written piece, a video essay, an audio recording, etc. (choice) and you have until the end of the semester to turn it in (flexibility), would that decrease levels of stress? Particularly with how likely it is we would move things online, I’ve been looking into redesign.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I bet. It’s probably a good idea to keep your students knowing that you’re not here to be as strict as you can be, and you don’t want to force people to talk or show their faces if they want to. Try putting yourself in your students’ shoes-would you like having to stress your fingers by pecking every single letter on the keyboard?</p></div>		</li>
