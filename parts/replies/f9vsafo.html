			<div class="markdown"><p>You are confused.  I was asking the OP whether or not he was asking these questions.  I was not posting these as challenges to the science of cosmology.</p>
<p>But yes you answered correctly.  Asserting either that atoms shrink or particles gain mass over time is totally testable, as you pointed out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point is, the farther the object you're looking at, the longest time since the light was emitted. The properties of matter changing over time, we'd see light emitted by matter of varying age and compare it to what we have in labs, which is current day matter, and sure it could look like a red shift to us</p>
<p>Honestly this thread's op's questions are pretty great I've never encountered them before and would very much like to know the answer. But I'll try to give it a think first, that's the most fun! I'm thinking stuff about large objects like galaxies rotating or orbiting each other reinforcing the velocity interpretation across all scales in a way an age interpretation can't really easily do</p></div>		</li>

<p>In that case the amount of red shift would depend on the distance, which it doesn't.</p>
<p>There are even blue shifted galaxies which would mean the atoms there would have to be younger than ours for this to work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How would either of the first two things cause red shift? Red shift is caused because things moving away from you appear to have lower frequencies than they really do. Like sound waves from a police car that sounds different if it’s approaching or receding your position. Think of it this way: if a wave passes you let’s say once a second, than walking away from the source at half the speed the wave is traveling will make it seem like a wave only passed you every two seconds. Particle size and such isn’t really related.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re right about me being confused for sure haha. What about why OP said makes you think he was secretly asserting those questions. You stated that there were alternative explanations for red shift, but the ones you gave simply cannot be the case, so your statement that they are alternative explanations is just not true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious about light perhaps getting red shifted as a consequence of traveling long distances through the vacuum itself.</p>
<p>The vacuum creates other interesting effects too, such as the Casimir effect and black hole evaporation, why not some sort of effect that causes photons to very slowly lose energy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But I wanted you to know, that your idea isn't totally rejected.  Zwicky proposed a solution based on it:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tired_light" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tired\_light" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tired\_light</a></a>  </p>
<p>However, Zwicky's idea doesn't hold up because it fails a few basic tests.  For example, the Tolman surface brightness test (i.e. objects that have receded from us are brighter than expected since they initially emitted the light when they were much closer and brighter) has shown that Tired Light is probably not correct (unless there is an unusual effect due to quantum gravity - but that is regarded as a niche study with no current observations that support it).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because Quantum Theory is based on the idea that photons are the basic building blocks of energy.  The statement that a photon could lose energy is a meaningless statement.  And, due to Relativity, no time passes at all (from the viewpoint of the photon), from the time it is emitted from its source (electromagnetically radiated), to the time it is absorbed.  As far as the photon is concerned, since it is traveling at the speed of light, the process is instantaneous and energy is transferred in a discrete packet (a quanta) from one electron to another, either raising or lowering its energy level.  This is why the absorption and emission lines exist in the first place - because there are no transactions taking place in the those &quot;dead&quot; areas that don't correspond to photons' fixed energy levels. Max Planck figured this all out in the year 1900, although he initially rejected Einstein's &quot;quanta&quot; interpretation of it until about 1918.</p>

<p>Edit:  Since we know the photon can't change its energy level in the exchange, and yet, the wavelength somehow changes when we look at photons that have arrived from great distances, the only possibility is that the distance itself increased (Doppler effect).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From looking it up, it sounds like &quot;tired light&quot; involves collisions with particles causing a photon energy loss.</p>
<p>I was thinking about another mechanism, perhaps either through interaction with the vacuum itself, or perhaps through interaction with interstellar plasma:</p>
