			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. My employer has some &quot;in store&quot; branches that are in supermarkets that have hours on Sunday as well.
And even though they are open on the weekend, nothing is processed until Monday. This is because banks work around the federal reserve and their operations.
There's also the fact that now a days you can do the majority of your banking online or at the ATM. There's no reason for banks to extend their hours to have employees there when a machine works 24/7 and doesn't require a salary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use Ally bank. There's no branches and I can do almost everything online or over the phone. I get up to $10 of ATM fee refunds a month so I don't think I've paid a fee once. The only downside is no cash deposits but there are workarounds for that like giving it to a friend or places like 7/11 will deposit cash to your paypal account for a small fee. Somewhat inconvenient but I've rarely had that much cash on me that I couldn't just use for things like groceries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>exactly this.  About 90% of the people I know go into a bank about once a year for something off the beaten path.  Normally things like a cashiers check for a large purchase, account histories that go back over a year, buying/selling a CD (and i think that can even be done at an ATM).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bought a new car this week. DMV is appointment only, no open spots for the next 2 weeks. So they have dropboxes for certain paperwork like registration applications - open 9-4 Monday through Friday. How is that reasonable at all</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ca the Dealers file for you but the DMV charges a convenience fee for them to do it online.  Although there is also a fee for the dealer to do it in person also.</p></div>		</li>
