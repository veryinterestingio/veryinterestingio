			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, even at a subatomic level, you still need to organize matter in a shape or pattern. Such shapes and patterns would naturally be described by geometry as matter exists in spatial dimensions. It would be better to say that the composition of matter is a manifestation of the interaction between its properties, in line with mathematics.</p></div>		</li>

On one hand, shells and harmonic equations are fake, made up constructs created by the minds of humans. On the other hand, they allow us to perfectly predict a lot of physical and chemical phenomena, so must be &quot;right&quot; at least in some sense.   It's crazy stuff.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Math isn't &quot;fake.&quot; We didn't &quot;make it up.&quot; It's just abstract. </p>
<p>It's not an artificial construction or human invention. If it were, then different cultures would have invented completely different systems for mathematics, rather than converging together as history shows.</p>
<p>Numbers are as much a part of a natural universe as atoms, and what we call &quot;math&quot; is just what we can derive from the properties of those numbers. &quot;2+2=4&quot; and &quot;13 is a prime number&quot; are true statements on a <em>fundamental level</em>, not because we arbitrarily wrote the rules that way.</p>
<p><em>Everything</em> within mathematics flows from this. The harmonics of electrons, while complex and non-intuitive compared to our everyday lives, are essentially the still product of &quot;X fits neatly into Y exactly Z times.&quot;</p>
<p>In a more mundane example, it's basically the same principle as playing different notes on a guitar string; playing on different frets changes the length of the string, which changes the stable frequencies at which the string can vibrate, which we hear as different musical notes. The guitar string is 1-dimensional, while the electron shell is 3-dimensional; the math gets more complicated with higher dimensions, but it's still the same idea.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As far as I am aware, there isn't one.</p>

<p>Past a certain point, all the hypothetical heavy elements get less and less stable, eventually reaching a point where they decay so quickly that they can't really form at all in the first place.  But, yes, at least until that point, elements can have increasingly more electron shells.</p>
<p>Last I heard, however, things start getting a bit weird when you get into many shells, because the energy levels of each electron/subshell get more and more spread out, and sometimes you end up where a higher shell has a lower-energy state available before a lower shell is filled up (the lower shell's remaining states are higher-energy), so the behavior of how the excess electrons fill the shells starts to diverge from the order in which the lower shells fill.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not 16 filled shells, since there are limits on the number of protons in the nucleus, which limits the number of electrons (electrons=protons in a neutral atom). So by the time you get to the point where atoms are no longer stable, you are only in the 5th shell.</p>
<p>However it is possible to excite an electron up to a much higher state. This is called a &quot;Rydberg atom&quot;, the highest I have been able to find is 700! This is achieved by giving the electron an amount of energy infinitesimally smaller than its ionisation energy.</p>
<p>So hypothetically if we could make a nucleus which lasted more than a few ns with hundreds of protons, then yes we should be able to get up to n=16 or higher.</p>

Sufficient to say, it was utterly ridiculous, but the point is, you can have as many shells as you want- it’s just nearly impossible to make anything past about element 100, and those we do make only last tiny fractions of a second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this why noble gases are typically considered to be stable, since the outermost shell is filled, and the electrons in that shell are &quot;balanced&quot; against one another?  I thought it was simply that the shell was filled, and didn't really think that those electrons really had any major interaction with one another.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, noble gasses are stable mainly because the shell is filled, and the energy gap between a filled shell and the next shell is typically much larger than the energy of most chemical bonds, whereas the energy gap between states in an unfilled shell is much less, so chemical bonding becomes more energetically favorable.</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure what you mean by saying the electrons are &quot;balanced,&quot; you mean paired into orbitals?  I am not sure that the pairing is important at all with respect to how stable an atom with a filled vs. unfilled shell is, in line with your thinking.  I don't mean to imply that it is the case -- I'm more just elaborating on the math that underlies the number of electrons needed to fill a shell.  Hope that resolves any confusion!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pairing does have to do with it actually (: because electrons are all negative, and suborbitals can hold 2 electrons each, electrons much prefer to put one electron in every possible suborbital before doubling up. This makes for some interesting glitches in what you might expect, where chemicals may react <em>away</em> from a full shell in order to move towards a half-full shell.</p>
<p>More or less, things are reactive if its easy to give away electrons to get to the shell below, get electrons to get to the she above, and also get a boost if they can get a half-filled orbital.</p></div>		</li>
