			<div class="markdown"><p>I think something that must be related is that's it's almost impossible (for me) to breathe with a snorkel, but without a mask.</p>
<p>As a kid I loved snorkeling. Did it all the time. But once in a friend's pool I randomly tried breathing through a snorkel without my mask on and I just couldn't. I swear I thought the snorkel was physically clogged or something.</p>
<p>I think I was able to get myself to finally breathe that way, but it was laborious. I think your body just thinks you're really really under water when you can't see and your face is cold, and doesn't want to let to breathe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of the scuba certification is going down to the bottom of a pool with all of your gear on, then you have to take off your mask, show the instructor that you’re calm and still breathing, then put it back on and clear it.</p>
<p>It’s <em>very</em> hard to force yourself to keep breathing with the mask off, much harder than I expected it would be.  Your body just locks you out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was definitely the hardest part of certification for me. Every time the water rushed into my mask, instincts shot me straight to the surface. I had to spend some time training my brain to override that instinct by sitting in a pool with a snorkel and mask practicing at the surface. Somehow it's way easier to throw away the regulator (air source) than let water rush into the mask...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I found pinching my nose closed after I let the water in the mask, breathing through my reg for a second to calm down, then blowing air out of my nose to clear it was the way to go.  </p>
<p>That second of holding my nose was the key to settling myself. Now I can clear it without doing that, but it's nice to know it's an option if I ever panic and need a second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you back this up because this doesn't make any sense to me. Even overriding any response and completely trying to breath with a strong wind is difficult from a getting a breath point of view, not just a &quot;my instincts tell me not to try&quot; point of view.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not mammalian instincts. It's high velocity air creating a low pressure zone around your face. </p>
<p>Your lungs are then at a relatively higher pressure  then outside your mouth and nose. So when your expand your chest cavity to inhale there's added resistance because the air in your chest is trying to escape to regulate the two pressure zones. </p>
<p>This is why when you're in spastic windy area the resistance can feel like it's tugging and releasing at your breath, the pressure zone around you mouth is fluctuating. </p></div>		</li>

<p>So why does wearing a mask helps? Or helmet? If the low pressure hypothesis was true wouldn't you suffocate on a motorbike as the small bottom opening would create similar issues with pressure? </p></div>		</li>

No recognise it as a reflex, and try to control it. You will fast be able to breath with no problem at all.
