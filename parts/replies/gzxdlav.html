			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the lungs' natural response to a foreign body is to coat it in mucus so it can be coughed up. It gets real sticky down there.</p>
<p>I'm a paramedic. I had a patient a few weeks ago who felt his nighttime meds go down the wrong pipe. He coughed for a bit and went to bed without thinking about it. When he woke up, his lungs were almost wall to wall mucus and he could barely breathe. The hospital had to do a procedure called a bronchoscopy, in which they put a scope into your lungs and grab whatever fell in there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hell, that sounds similar to how I felt since waking up the other day. Figured it was just the ac blowing right on my face all night drying my throat up but feels like I’m breathing through mucous city now. Maybe I got a cocoa puff stuck in my throat while asleep or something</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes to mucous, no to everything else. Anything foreign in your lungs would create a medical critical emergency. Even extra air. There is no food in the lungs, except for people who choke to death, and that usually means the food is in the airways, not the lungs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't know what you're talking about. Most people have things other than air and mucous in their lungs, such as smokers who have tar in their lungs. It creates problems that can lead to COPD and decrease the amount of air your can physically breathe into your lungs, but the only way extra air in your lungs will hurt you is if it's being physically pumped in by a respirator. You can only breathe so much air, and unless you've suffered a severe injury you're never going to breathe in so much air it hurts your lungs. The problem with things in your lungs is threefold: it damages your lungs leading to COPD, it decreases the amount of air you can breathe, and it carries the risk of bringing in something that can infect you</p>
<p>Pneumonia is caused by a bacterial infection in the lungs. There is very little immune response inside the lungs, which is why infections of the lungs are very serious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes tar, dust, minuscule by products that your airway is constantly trying to get rid of. Too much air, like from a respirator (how else do you get extra air), but the lungs are pressurized and can deflate easily. But there are not
food particles or extra water. We agreed on pneumonia. I absolutely know what I’m talking about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A pistachio shell is too big to enter the lungs, you just choked on it. It may have started down the respiratory tract, but it would have been pushed up by your body until it reached the esophagus and would have gone down that. That would hurt, but it wouldn't be dangerous unless it were very sharp. The bronchi is only 2 cm across.</p></div>		</li>
