			<div class="markdown"><p>I know very little regarding this topic or diamonds, but diamond is not a super natural item. While in earth it may be rare, other planets with high pressure or something due to X or Y reason could form unreasonable amounts of diamonds.</p>
<p>You could say that earth is super rare due to water on the planet, probably more rare than diamonds on other planets.</p>
<p>Again, I know nothing, just trying to give very generic, broad perspective of a possible thinking direction</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Carbon bonds with oxygen early in planet formation, forming carbon monoxide that is swept out of the inner solar system by solar wind. Because oxygen is more abundant than carbon, you usually end up with planets with a lot more oxygen left over than carbon, so the bulk composition is mostly oxides.</p>
<p>But in some circumstances you might end up with mostly carbon and little oxygen left over, such that the planet is formed mostly of carbides. As these are compressed, much will be converted to diamond (though you'd still expect to end up with a good deal of silica carbide, and a distinct iron core).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You absolutely get impact diamonds from asteroid strikes, that's actually one way to identify impact craters. However, these are all microscopic in size. Generally, the bigger a crystal is, the longer it took to grow, so the formation of large gem-quality diamonds can only take place over very large timescales.</p></div>		</li>
