			<div class="markdown"><p>Ever used a microscope, and you need to turn the knob to make it clear?</p>
<p>The muscles in the eye can turn the knob, but only in one direction. If your eye needs “focusing” on that direction, great, eye exercises can help. If not, it won’t do anything, as you’re already overshooting your goal.</p>
<p>AFAIK glasses change where the picture is clear, rather than turning the knobs themselves, so regardless of which direction you need the knobs turned they can move the goal to where you need it.</p>
<p>[I’m not an optometrist though]</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Near sighted: I need to put a lens(glasses) in front of the movie projector to get it in focus on the screen.</p>
<p>Far sighted: I can use the lens built in the projector already to adjust the screen into focus even though that lens isn't normally for that</p>
<p>Once the movie projector is over 40 years old that internal lens won't work any more as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Serious question but may sound weird. I wear contacts for a stigmatizum. I found if i pinch my thumb and index fingers together on both hands and press both pinched together sets of fingers together at the nails it kind of makes a box shaped tiny whole. When I take out my contacts and look threw it, i can see normal (even without squinting) threw the very tiny space the light is coming threw. Hope that made sense. But my queation is why?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just so you know, it's an <strong>astigmatism.</strong> I've got one too. It just means the curve in your cornea isn't uniform across your eye, which affects how light comes in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got excited when I started reading this because I came here to comment that I am nearsighted and have an astigmatism. I can push against my eyeballs over my eyelids with my thumb and forefinger and see more normally. I think this is because my eye is too long and squeezing it makes it correct it’s shape. It’s not comfortable so I have only done it a couple of times just to “see”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So this is why my eye doctor wasn’t entirely supportive of me getting LASIK when I asked her about it.  She said that it would get rid of my ability to read things up close once I got older and started needing glasses again, because that will happen.</p>
<p>I didn’t entirely understand what she was saying, but I didn’t question her because she is amazing and there is a reason I still see her after moving 50 miles away. Now I get what she was saying!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that's not correct. you should take another read of what OP is saying.</p>
<p>LASIK does not aggravate a condition, but simply does nothing to reduce the need for reading glasses. Any eye doctor would have told you this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m sure I’m not explaining what she said correctly, it was a few years ago.  She was actually the first one to even mention it to me when I had asked about it (I changed eye doctors quite a bit due to moving for college and husband being military), so not, not any eye doctor would have told me this.</p></div>		</li>
