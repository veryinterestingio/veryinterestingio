<p>Do you mind explaining this further?   </p>
<p>Evolution doesn't stop in small populations.    </p>
<p>In fact, simple random changes in allele frequencies in small populations can be sudden and drastic, so evolution can rapidly accelerate in small populations with no outside forces acting on the population at all.   </p>
<p>And selection certainly doesn't slow down in small populations either.   </p>
<p>I'm struggling to make sense of this statement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Without a large enough breeding population, inbreeding becomes the dominant force, you need variation in genetic code for evolution to select for.</p>
<p>As far as I am aware, mostly populations just die out at that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Inbred populations still evolve.        </p>
<p>A population collapsing <em>is</em> evolution.  </p>
<p>You still haven't explained how &quot;Evolution ... grinds to a halt.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
