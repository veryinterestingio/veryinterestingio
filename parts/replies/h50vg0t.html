			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, fatal familial insomnia - it's generally inherited.  It's also incredibly rare - only 50 or so families in the entire world carry the mutated copy of the prion protein gene (PRNP) that causes fatal familial insomnia, but there's also a variant called sporadic fatal insomnia caused by a very specific mutation in a very specific region of the prion protein gene that causes one amino acid to be replaced with another amino acid.  It's even rarer than the inherited version - as of 2016, only 24 cases in total have been diagnosed.    </p>
<p>Basically, prions are proteins that've somehow become misfolded.  They can cause other correctly-folded proteins of the same type to refold themselves into the incorrect configuration, which is how prion diseases progress.  </p>
<p>Apparently sleep facilitates consolidation of newly-acquired memories via integration of the new information acquired during wakefulness with existing memories.  And speaking of dreams, some people lucid dream - they can control what occurs in their dreams to some extent instead of just being an observer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the information. I did a program on lucid dreaming â€” learned how to keep a dream journal and worked with a Tibetan Buddhist teacher on dream interpretation. I donâ€™t do it anymore because I realized itâ€™s pointless. ðŸ˜›</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm someone who has skipped a lot of sleep in their life before. One time I was up for about 72 hours straight and my brain would seemingly just turn off for several minutes at a time. It was like I'd blink and skip forward 5 minutes. It was not pleasant. Don't recommend. That's about my record. I can't even imagine a week....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Insomnia is a symptom of a disorder I have, so since I was about 14, I've regularly gone 2-3 days without any sleep</p>
<p>My max was 4, i had taken so much sleep medication that I couldn't feel my face the next day, and with every step, I only felt the ground half a second after my foot hit it. I still got a 76 on my differential equations exam. </p>
<p>I didn't experience the skipping of time, but my experience was that I needed every bit of grit and resolve I had to keep n walking, and had to focus with everything I had to order food, talk, or take my exam.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I only experienced it that one time, and it was basically only when I stopped moving (I was just sitting still listening to people talk).</p>
<p>Other times when I've been up that long, I've had no problem staying aware, but yeah, it totally sucked and took everything to keep moving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is terminal. But anesthesia doesnâ€™t make people sleep, we say it does that, but it actually blocks some pain messages from going to the brain. Anesthesia also induces a state that is like sleep, but lacks dreams.</p></div>		</li>
