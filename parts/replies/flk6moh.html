If the answers are &quot;no&quot; and &quot;nothing,&quot; then don't bother. If they're &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;I learn something new about that deer ever single time I take the time to photograph it&quot; then keep going! </p>
<p>From the perspective of the platform, the main things we really do with observations are make maps of where observations were made, make charts of how observations rise and fall over time, and train a computer vision model to automatically recognize species in photos. If you're motivated by contributing to these &quot;products&quot; you might try observing that species of deer in different places, or in different months, or under different lighting conditions (though frankly if we already have a ton of photos of that species of deer, more photos probably won't help the computer vision system). If you're motivated by contributing to a more targeted research project, you should consult the person who will be doing the analysis to see what kinds of records they want.</p>
<p>Personally I just observe what interests me at a frequency that doesn't disinterest me. For stuff I see commonly, I like looking for interactions, e.g. what species of plant is that deer eating, what kinds of flies are buzzing around its head...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not from iNaturalist, but I have many repeated sightings in my iNaturalist log. I work on (usually) the same 1600 acres all year long, and try to take pictures of most things. I’ve been slowly able to track where specifically I see certain species the most, find multiple sightings of the same animal, and track when I see them seasonally.</p>
<p>Will I do anything with this data personally? Probably not.
Do I enjoy having it?
Yes.</p></div>		</li>
