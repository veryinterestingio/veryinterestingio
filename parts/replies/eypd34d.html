			<div class="markdown"><p>In arithmetic, what we normally do, 2+2 for example, is called infix, you can also do post fix or pre fix. <code>2, 2, +</code> or  <code>+, 2, 2</code>. This post/pre fix system is used quite often in computer science, as a general way of operating numbers as well as other objects.</p>
<p>The in fix style you showed is also used in relation theory to relate two objects in a binary relation. e.g SallyRBob (sally relates to bob via the function R), or 4 &lt; 5 (4 relates to 5 via the less than relationship). Usually you'd write code like <code>R(Sally, Bob)</code>. </p>
<p>Some systems are easier to work with depending on other variables, but really we could use any one of a number of systems.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wow. That makes me feel wrong all over. That doesn't look right even if it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up RKM code.
IEC60062 (2016)
DIN40825 (1973)
BS1852 (1974)</p>
<p>So since the IEC and DIN standards are international, it might not be universally used but it's definitely globally used.</p>
<p>I imagine it's primarily seen in electronics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Elec eng here too. It's more for schematics where you will see that notation RKM, on SMDs you'll see the 3 or 4 digit codes 125 (12*10\^5) and 1204 (120*10\^4) being the codes for 1.2MOhm. For resistors lower than 10ohms for the 3 digit and 100ohms for the 4 digit codes, the R is used for the decimal place. It may be that the user above isn't an electronics engineer or isn't involved as much in the design area</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've only seen it with R and K.  No 1M2 for 1.2 Mega Ohm. But 4k7 is common for denoting a 4.7 Kilo Ohm resistor in schematics, while the 1R2 type I've seen on some SMD resistors before they got so small that there was simply no space to put any writing (despite efforts for a new system using letters).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen it used for capacitors occasionally as well - where 4n7 or 3p3 for instance might be seen.</p>
<p>Confusingly, R is used for SMD inductors as well, where 4R7 is 4.7 Î¼H.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know what part of the Universe you do come from, so I take your point - but fact remains that for capacitance and resistance this is not only a colloquially used method but also one that is ratified in electrical and electronic design standards. Right from my school lab and hobbyist stores to technical documentation of actual commercial jobs, I've only seen &quot;1k5&quot; instead of 1.5kOhm. For reference I'm from India.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This only works because there is an assumed unit based on contextual or adjacent information and that you are measuring physical units that will not be negative. It should only be used when space is at an absolute premium, otherwise, almost any other convention is more precise and understandable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can also be read as &quot;10 thousand 600&quot; for something like 10K6 (standing in for 10.6K) which largely makes sense.   Money generally doesnt work like that.</p></div>		</li>
