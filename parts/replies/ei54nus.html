			<div class="markdown"><p>So what about wrapping in blankets to keep the body warm (having your body spend less energy on this helping it spend it to fight the disease better) whilst keeping your head cool with some ice or blanket of water? And what about in general when the fever is not as high as 106F but closer to like 101F?
I’d still love someone with some expertise cause some generalizations are just this thing you heard from your mom once and turns out to be actually off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you carefully monitor so that you don’t cross 104 F then you’re in the clear. Sweating it out is good ole country medicine and your body’s natural adaptive response to foreign invaders. So, you should let it run its course but obviously be careful and have the Tylenol and cool water bath ready to bring your temp down if it goes too high. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, the jury is still kind of out about it in general, different docs will say different things. The closest thing to a conclusive answer is it depends on the person and the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Human physiology professor here! The answer is that it depends. In infants, it can be extremely dangerous. As you get older, it becomes more safe up until a point. So long as you are able to keep your fever at 104 or below, you're fine. 106 is typically where your enzymes start denaturing, and then you have long lasting ramifications, even death.</p>
<p>But, raising your body temp when you're sick is a good thing! Pyrogens, released by you immune system do this. It actually helps activate some white blood cells to kill the infection more efficiently, while simultaneously helping to just cook the infection. The cooking of the virus or bacteria won't always kill them, but at a minimum it usually makes them less deadly to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why does denaturation have long term ramification in this case? Wouldn't they go back to their original shape when the temperature goes down, and return to normal function, thus no long term (positive or negative) consequences?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Think of an egg white, composed of water and protein. Cooking the egg white causes permanent protein denaturing, and the egg stays cooked even when it's cooled down.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Have you ever seen egg white turn back to clear goop once it cools down?</p>
<p>There are probably exceptions but the answer is no. Particularly for the proteins that matter to normal human function.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once a protein is denatured, there's usually no going back. That said, new proteins can be made but if the fever is sustained then they won't work either. Your body can't last for long without working enzymes/proteins. They are necessary for most reactions in your body to occur (including how we make cellular energy!).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, doesn't the good ol rule of thumb from chemistry &quot;Up the temp by 10°C to double the reaction speed&quot; have a play at how the body can fight the infection more efficiently with a higher body temperature?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That does help the reaction speed, but that's not always a good thing. Mostly, it just helps recruit WBCs in the case of a fever :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One time, when I was 11 I was super sick. The most sick I've ever been in my life so far. I threw up a ton of times and when I was laying down I had to cover my skin with a blanket because the breath from my nose felt so hot that it was uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The digital thermometer read 42C/107.6F</p>
<p>Was it wrong? Should I have died if it was right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It miiiight have been right, but probably only for a short bit of time if so-- most likely, your thermometer was wrong. I got sick in college once and ended up sustaining a fever over 104, with a peak of 106.3, for nearly 3 months (stupid mono!). Not only did I nearly die, but I have had short term memory problems ever since and it's been about 12 years since that happened!</p>
<p>That said, the issue is really that at high temps your proteins, and thus enzymes, denature (basically changing shape and thus losing function). If sustained for even a few minutes, you're body can't always come back from that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like it's fine if you're a healthy adult and you don't have a serious illness. But if your body starts overreacting, and your fever gets too high (104F, I believe), then not only should you not bundle up, you should get your ass to the emergency room.</p></div>		</li>
