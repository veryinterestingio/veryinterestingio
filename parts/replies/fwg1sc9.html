			<div class="markdown"><p>Fat, protein, and carbs are all just forms of energy you get from your food. Your body will use this energy to keep it powered or it will store it for later use. If you are high activity, you need more power, so less is stored. If you are low activity, your body will save that energy for later (gain weight). If activity &gt; energy going in, your body will use up some of your previously stored energy (lose weight). This is why calories in, calories out is the most important factor for weight loss. Fat = body’s emergency backup batteries. So your body will use it only when it can’t get energy from any other source basically. Unfortunately, you can’t decide which battery to use, the body will just decide for you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In muscles and liver it is stored as glycogen</p></div>		</li>
