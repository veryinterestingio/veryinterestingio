			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know why cholecalciferol is taken instead of taking calcitriol directly?</p>
<p>Is it cheaper to produce or does it have less potential to cause hypercalcemia? Or is it due to body-generated calcitriol regulating its own production while orally taken 1,25(OH) does not self-regulate?</p></div>		</li>
