			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't had a real burger in over 13 years, but the Impossible burger is sooo close and so tasty! I actually started panic 2 bites in because I couldn't  believe it wasnt actually beef. I made my SO have a bite to confirm it was fake before I finished it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you haven't had a real burger in over 13 years how can you be sure it's so close?  I love red meat and I'm not opposed to the idea of an alternative but I haven't really tried any.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife still eats meat while my son and I don't. Even she wasn't sure it wasn't beef when we had the Impossible burger. I checked the receipt and it was definitely the right one. I'm actually more impressed with the Gardein burgers because they're readily available, cook well at home and are surprisingly convincing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here to say that. Totally agree. I’m really surprised that Gardain’s ultimate burger isn’t more at;key about as its awesome.  And I am a meat eater as well. I just really like good ‘veggie’ burgers... I can tell I feel ‘better’ after eating them. My .02.
Also really really like Gardain’s breakfast ‘patty’. Again, I can tell it’s. Or sausage. Don’t care, just really tasty. I make a veggie ‘sausage mcmuffin’ that I prefer to a real one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're great. Also, Impossible Foods burgers are amazing (I even like them more). According Impossible Foods, texture and heme are key factors why people think meat is meat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems to me for the most part products like the Impossible Burger are geared more towards people who still eat meat but want to cut down on consumption rather than go full veg. </p></div>		</li>
