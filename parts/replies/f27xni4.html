			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly agree with you. However, it’s not always due to a lack of meta cognition. </p>
<p>For example, with anxiety you may know sure as hell that the spider won’t do anything. Still it won’t stop you from feeling anxious and avoid the spider, instead of ignoring it. </p>
<p>Same with emotions. Often people realize they’re being over emotional. They just can’t stop it. </p>
<p>It’s like acting to be normal while on drugs. You know and remember what normal is, you just can’t do it at the moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not diagnosed, but am fairly certain i suffer from BPD. I recently broke up with my boyfriend and in the fight I remember thinking that all my concerns had been addressed. Rationally I knew that things were ok, but I felt STRONGLY that things were not resolved. </p>
<p>This man I was falling in love with had betrayed me (he slightly did, but not to the degree I was taking it). Everything he did to make me love him was a lie and a manipulation, and he had become an enemy. </p>
<p>I was fully aware of these two realities existing in tandem. I was aware that this disease was preventing me from getting my emotions in check, and that rational thinking would not prevent me from feeling as terrible as I did. I broke up with him shortly after that, because there is no way I'm going to let myself hurt another person I care about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason why it's not a good idea to self diagnose is because we're terrible self reporters. An equally plausible explanation for your story would be that you do not believe your emotions matter or you attempt to suppress them if you cannot logically justify them, while at the same time possibly having low confidence in your own perceptions which allows you to too readily take another person's perception as fact. Essentially, your emotions are screaming at you that something is unjust and you're sitting their thinking 'shut up, I don't have evidence' instead of being curious as to why you may think that way. </p>
<p>Honestly could be either, but my guts say you're too logical rather than too emotional as I'm that way and I felt I could relate somehow to the way you speak about yourself. People who fit the description I just gave often think they're being too emotional when they're actually doing the opposite. Best to speak to a professional about this to get a less biased view or you could end up trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist, thereby making the problem that does exist worse.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In a less cynical light, you deserve to be happy and to have a partner too. From what I’ve seen with the people I know with this diagnosis, you can either fight it and treat it as best you can or you can keep everybody out because you are afraid of hurting them and they will let you wither if you depend on that construct. We hurt each other all the time, there’s no avoiding it. It’s about intent and that meta cognition which does not seem entirely lost on you. In my experience relationships are some of the most irrational periods of our lives so don’t jump to any conclusions without seeing an expert or even two because they make mistakes too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Am diagnosed, and thank you for your eli5 explanation, it is one of the most unbiased (nonclinical) descriptions I've ever seen written.</p>
<p>I will add an anecdote in regards to the meta cognition though:</p>
<p>Friend and I (both female 27y.o and diagnosed bpd) have developed differently in this regard, by that I mean as teenagers/young adults/pre-diagnosis we were both very stuck in the impulsivity of the mood or moment.</p>
<p>I've always had more control of this impulsivity than her, unless I was highly stressed (at which point the &quot;meta cognition&quot; would become reduced), however as we have aged I have developed quite a great level of control of these impulses/mood swings where as she has barely improved.</p>
<p>This could be in part due to our differing personalities, or contributed to the fact that I'm medicated (prescription), and she has continued to smoke marijuana (which I ceased to do 6 years ago)..</p>
<p>But anyway food for thought, and thank you again, I hope your mother's condition hasn't brought you too much grief as you sound incredibly understanding xo</p></div>		</li>
