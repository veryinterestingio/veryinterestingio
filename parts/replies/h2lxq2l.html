			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I've never heard of this, but I wonder if my kiddo had it...</p>
<p>He was about 2 and we'd all had colds, but his tuned into a nasty cough and wheezing, then when he was in the bath we saw the scary chest sucking in when trying to breathe thing, so called 111 and they rushed us up to hospital in an ambulance.
Kid was given oxygen and asthma inhalers and has been fine ever since.</p>
<p>Edit: just read the post from the NICU nurse below, he definitely had it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here in Alabama we are having an off-season spike in RSV cases. Which we also were terrible at distancing/masking for a lot of the pandemic but I wonder if the uptick is related to the lifting of basically all COVID restrictions/requirements in the state (to include those for daycare facilities). </p>
