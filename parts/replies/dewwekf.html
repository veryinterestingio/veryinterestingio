			<div class="markdown"><p>Important addition to #3.</p>
<p>WiFi standards dictate that everyone connected to that router be working on the same standard (A,B,G,N,AC). And since WiFi standards are not forward compatible this means you are limited to your lowest standard device. If you have a really old computer, appliance/media device, USB WiFi antenna, etc. then that is limiting the speed on everything connected to that router. </p>
<p>This is somewhat mitigated by the fact that old devices are running on 2.4ghz. Nowadays we have dual band routers capable of 2.4 and 5 ghz allowing for a seperation of old legacy devices and new high speed devices. But it's something to keep in mind if you're still rocking an older router or connect your phone/computer to the 2.4 not 5ghz network</p></div>		</li>

<p>Figured that's what you meant by that. Just wanted to extrapolate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For example, my local ISP Cable One advertises &quot;GIGAone&quot; which is supposedly 1000mbps, nowhere near 1 gigabyte, and they do not exclusively say that the 1000mbps is actually 1 gigabit and try to play it off like a gigabyte for the less informed - is that false advertising?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is definitely not false advertising because they tell you exactly what you are getting, repeatedly and more honestly than many other ISP's (IMO). </p>
<p>Hardly anything (for normal consumers) reaches 1 gigabit speed, so everything else referenced on their page is in megabits. Their chart shows that your iPhone 6 will get about 200mbps on wifi, your laptop might get 270mbps. The comparison to 1000mbps is a lot easier than 1gbps, especially for the many people that don't know 1gb = 1000mb. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well, when it comes to technical specifications</p>
<p>a large B is Byte, a small b is a bit.</p>
<p>But then again a big M is mega while a small m is Micro, which means 1/1000000.</p>
<p>so technicly 1 million of a bit per second is VERY SLOW...</p>
<p>also 1Gbps would be 125MBps, which would require gigabit ethernet running at full duplex over all networking equipment. and even then you wouldnt get there. </p></div>		</li>
