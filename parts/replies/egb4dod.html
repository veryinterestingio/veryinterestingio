			<div class="markdown"><p>That is typically (or at least used to be) an internal motherboard clock that is powered by the CMOS battery. Cell phone a are likely using an internal battery/capacitor to retain a basic real time clock setting until it gets time information from the cell network.</p>
<p>When traveling on the road, I could observe my old, dumb (not smart phone) cell phone automatically update the time when crossing from one time zone to the next. It wasn't perfect going across the time zone, due to still being connected (for a short time) to the old tower on the other side of the zone before handing off to the new one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone in this thread seems to have gotten caught up in quartz oscillators. But RTCs because of cost I'm almost certain use resistive/capacitive or ceramic oscillators more often.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, size is the reason for moving to mems for sure, but cost isn't to be overlooked. A ceramic will always be cheaper than a Quartz, and the quartz needs load capacitors to complete the pierce oscillator circuit, so you have to add two small picofarad caps to the cost most times you want to use a crystal.</p></div>		</li>
