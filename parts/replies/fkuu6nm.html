			<div class="markdown"><p>Ebola would be one. When an area is “hot” it means that the pathogen is killing its host very quickly which in turn limits the spread of the disease. If you look up Ebola Zaire and read “the hot zone” you can get more info</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They have a reasonably good handle on the Ebola outbreak in the DRC and the problem with that disease isn't regular circulation in the human population, it's zoonotic reservoirs. Nasty flu strains like /u/OleKosyn mentioned are better examples.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be clear, we cannot eliminate Ebola because it has animal reservoirs. </p>
<p>That is to say, even if Ebola was completely eliminated from the human population, it would still be present in bats and perfectly ready to infect people again at the first opportunity.</p>
<p>The original disease eradication campaigns focused on smallpox and polio because they are human-exclusive diseases (and some other useful properties like low incubation periods and low mutation rate).  Remove them from all people and the fuckers are dead forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whatever comes up quickly and knocks you down. Flu can put you into bed in a day, some of its known strains are meaner than the others and geographically localized, like H5N1 aka bird flu (this isn't the only flu birds get btw). Oh, I just googled to get the name right and turns out it's hitting China and India right now. Gastrointestinal infections are another one.</p>
<p>A slow-burning is one such as TB, which can lie dormant for months before occurring, and it's quite contagious once it breaks its cover. Coronavirus seems to be a mix of both.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except the whole point of social distancing is to lessen the stress placed on the healthcare system during a pandemic. It might be the best time to get rid of the stuff you want, but that doesn't mean it's a good time to do it overall</p></div>		</li>
