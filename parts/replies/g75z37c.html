			<div class="markdown"><p>I was reading something about that scale after I asked the question (which is how I realized seismographs did exist, and had existed for a long period of time, making me feel really silly).  But it made me less sure of how they'd be able to tell the magnitude of an earthquake when I read this on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Mercalli_intensity_scale#Correlation_with_magnitude" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The correlation between magnitude and intensity is far from total, depending upon several factors, including the depth of the hypocenter, terrain, and distance from the epicenter. For example, a 4.5-magnitude quake in Salta, Argentina, in 2011, that was 164Â km deep, had a maximum intensity of I, while a 2.2 magnitude event in Barrow in Furness, England, in 1865, about 1 km deep, had a maximum intensity of VIII.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seemed to be saying that sometimes a more intense earthquake wasn't as observable by people (whether by feel or by visible changes to the environment) as a much milder earthquake might be.  If we couldn't take eyewitness accounts of what happened as indicators of magnitude (because they were less exact depending on depth, etc) what exactly could we trust to give us that information.</p>
<p>Thanks for the answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's tough when you have limited information, but scientists often look at evidence from multiple locations and what they know from the geology of the area. A smaller earthquake close to the surface will have a small area of higher intensity. A larger earthquake deep underground will affect a larger area at a lower intensity. If the fault that generated the quake is known, you can potentially put an upper limit on the magnitude, or even look at paleoseismic indicators like fault scarps to find evidence of how much it moved. </p>
<p>So a single eyewitness account may not be helpful, but in aggregate they can tell you a lot.</p></div>		</li>
