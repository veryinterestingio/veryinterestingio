			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Look up &quot;swimmer slouch&quot;. I have chronic tendonitis in my shoulders from years of swimming plus weight lifting. (Before anyone comments, I was taught impeccable form in both, but did not work the antagonist muscles enough, causing imbalances.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might get better results by looking up &quot;swimmer slouch therapy exercises.&quot; I will add a few that I've been given by physical therapists over the years, but please note that I'm not a PT or a medical professional and if you are having shoulder pain I strongly recommend getting evaluated by a doc rather than trusting some random dude on the internet. Gutting it out is how I ended up in this position and now I'm in my mid 30s and still paying for my teenage ego.</p>
<p>For preventative maintenance it's important to know what you're already working, so you can work the muscles that oppose them. Freestyle, which is most of what many swimmers do, works the chest and upper back pretty heavily. So you need to work your mid and lower back, especially mid/lower trapezius:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rowing and lat pulls are two common exercises for this. They generally require machines but you can also do them with stretchbands.</li>
<li>Pullups are great but a lot of people are intimidated by them</li>
<li>You can also do &quot;Y, T, I exercises&quot; with only body weight on the floor, or small dumbbells. I recommend getting into a habit of doing these, they're quick and effective.</li>
<li>My single personal favorite is a move called &quot;angel wings.&quot; Google &quot;Angel wings exercize.&quot; I can tell just how bad things are by how terrible I am at these.</li>
<li>You also need to stretch your pecs to increase mobility there. Google &quot;pec stretches&quot; for a few.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have something like this for the same reason. My left shoulder hurt and would give popping noises when I did a windmill. Trainer friend in the gym told me my shoulders are addicted because I didn't balance out my muscles properly so everything was being pulled forward</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ive gotten wrist pain from handstand and body weight exercises, i can personally say that hanging from your hands does wonders. even hanging from a pull up bar or tree branch, but ideally the weight is on just your fingers. It feels like the bones and connective tissue in my hands and wrist get seperated just enough to “breathe” and relax.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Muscles and connective tissues, tendon etc are different. They react differently to “exercise.” They get worn.
My arms and legs are still strong. It’s the knees and joints that get arthritis and if you’ve been athletic -like decades of soccer- your muscles are still good but the hips and ankles take a beating</p></div>		</li>
