			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say that good audio would contribute to a better flight experience. Same with more comfortable seats and enough blankets. The issue is that airline corporations are notoriously cheap, and don’t want to pay for those things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually all of those things cost money and weight to fly especially over the life of the plane. It’s not that they don’t want to pay for it, it’s that they don’t want to pay for the thousands of gallons of fuel it will cost over it’s lifetime</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So… couple thoughts.</p>
<p>1) the cost of lowering the noise of the two jet engines operating at cruise thrust is something you may be underestimating.</p>
<p>2) you really are happier hearing two jet engines at climb power rather than the hull flexing under the changing pressures as the aircraft climbs. Just trust me on this.</p>
<p>All of that completely drowns out any possible audio that you aren’t hearing through any noise canceling headphones connected to something using WiFi.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't think it would contribute to a good flight if people could actually understand the safety instructions? Then try adding to the mix a non-English speaker (int'l flights) with very hard to understand pronunciation.</p></div>		</li>
