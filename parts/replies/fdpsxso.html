<p>when an alternative would be for the soldier to be killed for disobeying orders or even have his family be harmed?</p>

<p>Also, refusal to participate in atrocities were not met with death. SS men or soldiers who refused were mostly given a reprimand/demotion and transferred out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The entire ideology is that the Jews and other minorities were the cause of evil and instability in Germany, and the ethnic Germans themselves were inherently superior and valuable. You can't treat your German soldiers like they're Jewish fodder if you want your Master race rhetoric to be taken seriously by the masses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They knew this was difficult to do for the average man. They started by shooting them down &quot;execution style&quot; and it was impacting morale. </p>
<p>The work camps (aka the work to death style camps, to be clear) were easier on the soldiers' mind because they weren't exactly killing them, just treating them like subhuman thrash (which, let's face it, they were mostly OK with doing). Same idea with the Gas Showers/Chambers, the soldier killing them was further removed from the action, so they didn't have to &quot;deal&quot; with it, and it left &quot;clean&quot; corpses, so it wasn't as hard to deal with emotionally / mentally.</p>
<p>Part of why the Holocaust is so horrible is the Nazis researched these things! They wanted to make their genocide as painless and clean as possible to their own people. So, yes, they knew it wasn't for everyone, and sure, if you weren't willing to take a &quot;cushy&quot; job killing defenseless Jews, you could always help the war effort in other ways like fighting in Russia. </p>
<p>There was no need to kill someone from the chosen perfect German race over mongrel Jews, in their minds anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even the Nazi leadership was aware of the tremendous psychological impact on their soldiers associated with the holocaust.</p>
<p>The reason why gas chambers and other methods were invented in the first place was because too many soldiers in execution squads committed suicide or suffered mental breakdown.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My (deceased) Lithuanian grandfather was conscripted into the Luftwaffe and trained as an electrical engineer after the German military kicked the USSR out of the country. Later in the war he was a senior NCO and commanded work gangs where enslaved Soviet prisoners of war were made to scavenge power lines that had been downed by Allied bombing. My grandmother (and mother) both vocally assured themselves that 'but you would have been shot if you had refused to do that, right?' when he told me about it.</p>
<p>No, he got promoted for doing it, he got extra pay and nicer accommodations, it was completely voluntary on his part no matter how much he regretted and hated having done it decades later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, if the transfer is to the Eastern front, to be honest, most people would rather kill someone than die a horrible death.</p>
<p>I wonder what most people would do if facing a similar choice</p>
<p>And to be clear, I am not saying killing anyone is right, just noting that not all choices, no matter how horrible they are, are black and white in nature</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh! Alright, so they did have a choice, even if they were pressured to do something or could have lost some job potential. It's actually a nice sense of closure to know that they wouldn't have been punished, and that it really was fairly deserved.<br />
Also I don't think Rational Wiki is a reliable source for anything, so I'm glad you provided a few links.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure it is, but it's a significantly less compelling punishment from an outside PoV.</p>
<p>A person's career is only valuable to the person who spent a lifetime building it, a life being ended is a hard stop that anyone can understand.</p>
<p>From that perspective it's easy to see how valuing your life over the lives of others (pretty much hard coded into our DNA) is somewhat more understandable than valuing your life's work over the lives of others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it have changed the Nuremberg trials if there was evidence of serious consequences for Germans who refused to participate in the death camps or other holocaust activities?  And how serious would those consequences have to be?</p>
<p>Obviously facing a firing squad for refusing that would be pretty serious, but would say a dishonorable discharge be enough?  Or would you have to be facing detention or criminal charges for refusing?  What if there were a handful of executions for refusal that were well publicized within the military command, even though most people would just get demoted or even discharged?</p>
<p>I'm wondering at what point does the individual's <em>perception</em> of their risk of punishment come into play in a situation like this vs. the actual odds (which the average refusenik could never actually know/calculate at the time)?</p>
<p>Part of me thinks in absolutist terms that they should have been tried and convicted regardless of how real the threat of retribution for non-participation would be, as the world needed an example set that state sponsored genocide was so grotesque that no level of risk of refusal was acceptable, and it would serve as a totem to future generations of the risks of following a genocidal ideology.</p>
<p>But I also can't escape the idea that there was an element of victor's justice imposed and that the Allies were out to settle scores and punish Germans and Germany for some cultural reasons, perhaps even the continuance of some longer-horizon cultural between Anglo-French and the Germans that dated back decades.</p></div>		</li>
