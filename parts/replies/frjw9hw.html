			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok. Since phones have dedicated selfie cams, why are they not using lenses that cause less distortion? There's 3-4 different lenses on the back of some phones, what's preventing having something better for the front facing one?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 'distortion' is due to the close perspective, not due to the lens.  It's just basic geometry, not special lens optics.</p>
<p>The lens being wide angle just lets you hold it too close.  The camera is barely 2 feet away usually.</p>
<p>One benefit of, for example, a mirror selfie over an arms-length selfie is that the camera is more like 6-8 feet away (distance to mirror x 2).  The downside is the part where most people take them in their bathroom...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a good question for another ELI5. To have higher focal distances, you need space (depth). It's the flatness of the phones that no one wants to give up. <del>To need less focal distance your sensor needs to be huge (expensive!). Both things do not work with phone cameras.</del></p>
<p>Edit: u/MinkOWar is right. Smaller sensors allow less focal length for lenses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To get a longer equivalent focal length you'd need a smaller, not larger, sensor.  The larger the sensor the longer the focal length needed for the same angle of view.</p></div>		</li>
