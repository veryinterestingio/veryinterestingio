			<div class="markdown"><p>Anxiety disorders are an evil fucking thing. The worst for me were the hot and cold flashes. I'm a dude but fucking feel for women going through menopause now. It's no fun having your skin alternate from fiery hell, to freezing cold continuously for 24/7. Your heart will race, and you will lose your breath at the drop of a pin, and if you live in a city may god have mercy on you. Not to mention the excessive sweating, the loss of balance. And those are just the physical symptoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not a “skipped” beat exactly.  It is actually a premature ventricular contraction(pvc) or extra beat.  What happens is that you get an extra signal which causes a premature beat.  This delays the opposing ventricle from its normal beat.  It feels like a slipped beat because you don’t typically feel the extra beat, but you definitely feel the strong delayed beat that follows.  If it happens too often, like 10% of the time it can cause PVC induced cardiomyopathy.  Which is reduced heart function.  This is something I dealt with for the last couple of years.  Just finally had a normal echocardiogram.</p></div>		</li>
