			<div class="markdown"><p>But somehow this also works for songs you don't like. For example, I HATE (redacted artist's name so my inbox doesn't get filled with references) music, but I know he's a good song writer because his songs always get stuck in my head at random times, even though I don't like them. So I respect his ability, but really, really don't like the music.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This artist with a bad song has its own repetitive nature.</p>
<p>Think of people who listen to prog rock or ambient or classical; these aren't exactly catchy genres.  But your exposure to Britney Spears' Hit Me Baby One More Time is annoying as fuck but since it's all over the airwaves your pick it up.  I haven't heard that tune in ages but as I typed out the title I heard her whiney voice.</p>
<p>None of us live in a vacuum so we hear the annoyingly Macarana song but we all know it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ha!</p>
<p>I actually read that in a review of the song.  If you have a song stuck in your head, think of Led Zeppelin's Kashmir.</p>
<p>Unfortunately they did not write how to get it unstuck ...</p></div>		</li>
