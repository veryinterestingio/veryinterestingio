			<div class="markdown"><p>The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons has a lot of good resources - not just for back pain, but basically any joint pain has a set of exercises they recommend to help strengthen it. They have this pdf for back conditioning that might be a good place to start: <a href="https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/globalassets/pdfs/2017-rehab_spine.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/globalassets/pdfs/2017-rehab\_spine.pdf" target="_blank">https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/globalassets/pdfs/2017-rehab\_spine.pdf</a></a></p>
<p>The trick (and the reason a trainer or physical therapist is such a critical practitioner) is that it can be very difficult to evaluate our own technique and posture as we're doing the exercises. You've got to pay close attention to the muscles you're engaging, and using a mirror or filming yourself and watching closely might be worthwhile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many of these exercises we did in our yoga class. It is good to have agreement. Also many people just complain about their back, but actually never did a shit about it except doctors and drugs. There are many people out there in good condition even in their 70s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tbh I don’t want to make medical recommendations without any expertise, but for stretching, lying on my front on an exercise ball and rolling forward and backward slowly has helped me and I kinda doubt that will do any harm.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also: healthy weight, lifting correctly, and good sleep. You can’t do just one, it’s everything you do everyday.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your PT had good intentions, but core strength and “stabilization” is seriously outdated thinking. Any exercise as long as it’s customized to you and appropriately challenging should help with your lumbar arthritis. It is not limited to core stabilization.</p>
<p>Your back, despite the arthritis, may be stronger than you think. Don’t be afraid to stress it and keep exercising frequently!</p></div>		</li>
