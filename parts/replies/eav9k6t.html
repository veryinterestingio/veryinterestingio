			<div class="markdown"><p>A 5 year old girl can get a UTI from wiping wrong.
So explaining to her why she might have a UTI will help her not wipe wrong again.</p>
<p>I’m a dad if a 2 year old and getting her to wipe right is a chore to teach. I can imagine a 5 year old might make a mistake every once in awhile seeing as 5 year old boys can barely aim at the floor</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people have weaker immune systems than others, or differently-shaped urethras (the tube that leads from the bladder to the outside). Women tend to get more UTIs than men because we have a shorter urethra, so the bladder is closer to the outside where the bacteria are. </p>
<p>Some people also don't make as much mucous (the slime that lines the urethra to keep it clean) and that makes it harder to get rid of bacteria that gets inside. </p>
<p>And if your skin is irritated, like if your clothes are rubbing the skin raw or not being able to keep your skin dry, it makes it more likely for bacteria to get past your body's defenses.</p>
<p>Using a harsh soap or bubble bath can make a lot of this worse, since it removes mucuous and can irritate sensitive skin.</p></div>		</li>
