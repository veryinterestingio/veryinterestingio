<p>Antimatter is the opposite of regular matter. For example, hydrogen is made of one proton and one electron, while antihydrogen would be one antiproton and one positron; their electrical charge is reversed (protons are positive, antiprotons are negative, electrons are negative, positrons are positive) but the particles are otherwise identical to their counterparts. If matter and antimatter come into contact, they annihilate each other and convert their mass to energy.</p></div>		</li>
