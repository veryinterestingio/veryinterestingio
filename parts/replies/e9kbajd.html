Embers fly around, starting pockets of fire, and ground movement would be similarly unpredictable. By the time you gathered your wits and loaded the car, the fire can easily have surrounded you. Plenty of videos of evacuees driving through fire with maybe a dozen yards of road ahead visible through the smoke.</p></div>		</li>
