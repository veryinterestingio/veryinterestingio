			<div class="markdown"><p>We are talking different levels of cold though. Room temp or ground temperature water in Malaysia isn't cold. It isn't actaully far below body temperature. An ice bath would be a better approximation of the cold OP is meaning. </p>
<p>In the same way i find the tap water closer to the tropics weird to drink because it isn't actually cold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An ice bath is only a few degrees cooler than many peoples cold tap water. 30 degrees cooler or 37 degrees cooler isn't that big a difference. </p>
<p>My point is that &quot;cold&quot; water in Malaysia will only be around 10 degrees cooler than body temp. Cold water to the OP may well be 30 degrees cooler. (Ice water could be closer in temp to OPs water than Malaysian 'cold' water). </p>

<p>Not at all. For one, we set the hot water temp, not just take essentially the ground temp. Also, difference between body temp and typical hot water is what 20 degrees? Boiling water is over 60 degrees hotter than body temp.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that's probably cos you're heating up beyond 37 degrees so when you use cold water it feels great moreso cos there's more than enough heat to warm you back up again :) if your body temperature stayed low, it would be uncomfortable and that happens in a colder climate</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Therefore the answer to OP's question is.. in a cold country you would like hot baths, in a hot country you would like cold baths.</p>
<p>Isn't that sufficient for an ELI5 answer?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm currently staying with my SO's family in Colombia. There is no hot water. For me every shower is an ordeal while for them it's fine .. for them a hot shower would be horrible and feel uncomfortable. You become used to something and then the opposite doesn't feel good.</p>
<p>Incidentally this is the reason my SO and I can never shower together .. she wants it cold and I want it hot  :)</p></div>		</li>
