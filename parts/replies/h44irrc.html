			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, many people comment that the &quot;floss&quot; dance popular a couple of years ago is oddly difficult or confusing.</p>
<p>That is because the dance is in beats of 3, instead of four, which is the common one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only if people actually danced it to music in 3/4 or 6/8 which they rarely, if ever do.</p>
<p>Instead they do it to 4 triplet groups over 4/4 making it either really fast and hard to do, or the music has to be slower than most contemporary dance. Most just do it randomly though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Balkan dances I think are often in 9/8, which when you think about it should feel similar to 3/4, but it’s typically comprised of 3 groupings of 2 and one grouping of 3, and the grouping of 3 can shift around the groupings of 2. Very interesting music!</p></div>		</li>
