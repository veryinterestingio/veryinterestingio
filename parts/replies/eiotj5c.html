			<div class="markdown"><p>Weird. I'm super introverted in social situations, but if you give me a task or job then I am unfazed. I can handle a crazy morning rush as a barista, or evening rush in a bar, but hate parties or dances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Introvert here as well.  I’m guessing it’s because during social settings, it’s improvised action.  Causing us to drain faster as our mind is constantly stimulated to think about socializing/new conversation or actions.  </p>
<p>When given a job, our minds know the steps to perform the duty. No improvisation, just processing the next known step.  </p>
<p>Sure, some social activities occur, but for example, as a barista, the communication that goes on is typically repetitious, the same conversations the majority of the time.<br />

<p>I could be completely wrong, but I’ve observed this with myself as well, and just think about these types of thing a lot. Heh. :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No that makes sense. I likely found emotional solace in the repetition of pulling a good shot or making foam, and that dampened the social stress. I'll be thinking about this tomorrow at the bar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was first in college I would always gravitate toward the keg at parties, and then start filling everyone else's cup for them. Those were some of the best parties ever. I would just spend three hours making sure everyone's cup was full with little to no head making small talk here and there and it felt great.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i’m definitely not an expert on personality theory, but if we think of personality as ‘traits’ that consistently describe how an individual will behave ie trait theory, some models have more evidence than others.
most common theories are the five factor model and eysenck 3 factor model. both use extraversion as one of their factors,
there is some biological studies to show that people have brain differences depending on if they identify as extrovert or introvert but really these models are more a tool to measure or describe behavior </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dunno about the above referred model, but the &quot;Big 5&quot;/OCEAN  is a pretty widely used and accepted trait personality index used in academic psychology. One of the traits there is extraversion, which also happens to be one of the more robustly researched one along with conscientiousness and neuroticism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually believe that it pretty much is nonsense. People get stuck in certain patterns and behaviors and that becomes who they believe they are. But that can change. Someone who thinks they are introverted because their behavior matches that definition can certainly become an extroverted person if the opportunity prevents itself or they work on improving their self. Things like confidence, self esteem, working out to improve physical stature, communication skills, etc.</p></div>		</li>
