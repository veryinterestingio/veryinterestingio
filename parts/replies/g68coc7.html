			<div class="markdown"><p>Saccadic suppression is still commonly held to be a real phenomenon, but some of us think it's not really real. Most/all studies claiming to show suppression during saccades used stimuli that were not matched (or imperfectly matched) to the motion of the eye; any failure to match eye movement would greatly reduce the energy of a target stimulus during a saccade (considering that neurons at any stage of vision require time to integrate a signal), and it would seem invisible or at least greatly suppressed. Hence the concept.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when the stimulus is presented so as to minimize the motion blur of the saccade, visual sensitivity seems to be pretty much the same as when the eye is still.
e.g.:

<p>You can even see for yourself in some real-life situations - if you ever encounter a very fast, bright LED strobe display (something flickering a bright spot or shape at a few hundred Hz; I've seen them sometimes at concerts or light shows), you might notice that during/after an eye movement you see a trail of images scattered across the visual field: that's perception during a saccade, and you'll notice it doesn't feel dimmer or weaker at all than the same lights without a saccade.</p>
<p>So, I don't think saccadic suppression <em>per se</em> is really a thing, it's just an established idea that many neuro/psych people learn early on and that no one really tries to test anymore.</p>
<p>Still leaves the question of why an eye movement doesn't feel like a rapid, brief motion blur. I think it's a few reasons:
1: it's <em>very</em> brief, just a few milliseconds.
2: there's nothing much to notice (literally)
3: &quot;corollary discharge&quot;: retinal motion doesn't feel like motion when it's self-generated
4: it's perfectly expected, and we tend not to notice highly predictable stimuli (we notice deviations, rather).</p>
<p>That would all mean that the explanation for OP's question isn't really an active process of &quot;saccadic suppression&quot;; rather, eye movements aren't visible in the mirror because the retinal image of the scene in the mirror, including the eye movement, is motion-blurred to imperceptibility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How modified time perception is explained then? Do time blurs to imperceptibility too?</p>
<p>I can voluntarily induce nystagmus and I can see motion-blurred picture. So it's more complex than unconditional masking. But large angular movements of my eyes don't seem to produce motion blurred picture and they can take significant amount of time (up to 200ms).</p></div>		</li>
