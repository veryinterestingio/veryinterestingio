			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth mentioning but if you take the largest electron size that could possibly exist (so just below what we can measure) and you spin it such that the electron has enough angular momentum to satisfy spin +/- 1/2, it would require the surface of the electron to be moving faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>Edit: Yes this is modelling it as a classical system. This explains why you CAN’T model it like this (because nothing moves faster than the speed of light in a vacuum).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's equivalent to spinning around their own axis. Altough this is not what actually happens as from our current undersstanding electrons have no size so they can't really spin around. In particle physics we think of it as just another property  like charge or mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spin is not really rotation/revolution, it's just the name for the quantum state. It's a pretty complicated concept. Put simply, electrons can are in state +1/2 or in state -1/2, and you won't ever find two similar state electrons in the same part of an atom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Spin&quot; is a quantum property of particles, that derives directly from a relativistic modification to traditional quantum mechanics (i.e., dirac's equation). In layman terms, it is something that behaves like angular momentum. You can think of it as if the particle was spinning, but that's not quite what happens, fundamentally speaking.</p>
<p>A particle can have either integer or half-integer spin. The particles that have half integer spin are called fermions - and all fermions have a bizarre but important property: two fermions cannot be in the same exact state. Electrons are fermions, they have spin 1/2.</p>
<p>What happens with spin is that the projection of spin in an specific axis can be ±1/2 (for an electron), and as they have to be in different states, you usually get one particle with projection +1/2 and one with -1/2 in the same energy/orbital.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can an electron change its spin? E.g. the electron is captured by an atom that already has a same spin electron, so one of them will change its spin to keep orbiting the same nucleus. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, electrons can change spin. In general, all electrons are indistinguishable, so any property one electron has, any electron can have. The only difference between them is their energy.</p>
<p>It's maybe easier to think of an orbital as a location, described by series of coordinates one of which is the spin of the orbital. Each orbital has an associated energy. The spin-flip transition, the action that changes an electron's spin, is usually small (at least for non-metals), while the energy difference between a bound and free electron is usually much larger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps you could illuminate me on a part of spin I have trouble finding a decent explanation for.</p>
<p>In the Stern-Gerlach experiment, why does spin always align with the magnetic field? Instead of being in a spin state of up or down and being deflected by the equipment, why can't the spin be aligned left or right and never be deflected?</p>
<p>Secondly, when a particle's magnetic moment is being repelled on both sides by the equipment (like N N-S S), why doesn't the particle rotate 180 degrees like how one would imagine a bar magnet would feel a force to rotate under similar conditions? Is this simply because the particle is going so fast it's negligible or does it not happen at all?</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're going to hate this answer, but because spin &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot; don't exist.</p>

<p>Spin is a type of angular momentum. There needs to be some sort of pathway for an electron to change it's spin, and there isn't one in the stern gerlach experiment (for the time scales involved anyway). Conservation of angular momentum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, having only a spin-paired electron pair in an orbital is much better than single electron with a single spin since the former will have neutral or canceled out magnetic field. The latter will have a magnetic field which is less stable and attracts the magnetic field around it. </p></div>		</li>
