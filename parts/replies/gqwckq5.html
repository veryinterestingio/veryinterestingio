			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of me thinks the conversation around this has been purposefully obscure because scientists and the government don't want to outright say that you're protected after infection for fear of unintentionally encouraging people to get infected or having &quot;covid parties&quot; like they use to for childhood sicknesses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a big part as well is the difficulty of effective science communication. Scientists often use careful language to make clear whether something has been <strong>shown to not happen -</strong> in contrast to something that <strong>hasn't yet been shown to happen.</strong> Then the media reports on it using grabby headlines and unless you're careful in reading the article main text you can be easily misled. </p>
<p>Science communication is a really important field and more people need to care about it imo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a scientist studying immunology, I don’t think that’s it. I think that the venn diagram between people who are really good at explaining scientific concepts to people with no scientific background and people who really understand the biology and physiology at its core has very narrow overlap in the center. News anchors, YouTube/social media personalities, people who make the super simple infographics that pop up on r/coolguides, etc are really really good at explaining things but know jack shit about the things they’re explaining, so they will miss out on some details. The media isn’t lying to you, they literally don’t know and rely on paraphrasing what others tell them. On the contrary, PhD training involves presenting research and having every single detail scrutinized and torn apart by experts in your field literally from year one until you graduate. So scientists get really good at knowing the material but aren’t properly equipped to teach it since theyre used to presenting their work to professors who know more than anyone else on the topic, not the general public.</p>
<p>I think the disconnect arises with scientists trying to explain this sort of stuff to the general public for two reasons: (1) scientists aren’t properly trained to teach to the general public during PhD training, are put out of their comfort zone, and miss details. This is a flaw of the PhD training itself. (2) the topic is intrinsically difficult to understand if you don’t have a thorough background. This is especially true of the immune system, one of the most complex physiological systems. You just can’t explain it to someone with no biology background at all with a single infographic. At least not without missing key details. It’s not the media’s fault that every detail of how the immune system works (at least what’s known) was not explained to you - most people with B.S. in biology don’t even know that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree wuth you, as would anyone who has done anything that ended up in media, most of the timrle there is no any kind of conspiracy, not even &quot;make more clicks&quot; one, journalists just don't know nor understand enough to present that information.</p>
<p>Problem is they are not consulting experts before publishing, but on the other side experta are silent in pointing out this kind of mistakes. Especially when it is as important as it is now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given the results of this study and others that suggest large variability in circulating antibodies which provide immunity, are vaccines recommended for everyone even if they have tested positive for COVID (symptomatic or not) in the past?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vaccines are recommended for those who've had COVID, but not specifically from this study.</p>
<p>In all diseases, the strength of the immune response varies by person and by infection.  It depends on a giant list of complicated variables that can't realistically be measured in a normal environment.</p>
<p>Getting the vaccine reduces a lot of those variables to known values, so scientists have a good idea how you'd respond to a future infection.</p>
<p>The alternative is to have enough time to study people who got infected but not vaccinated, and that would tell you how likely it is that infection provides life-long immunity.  For example, we know that's how chicken pox works, but we know that because we had decades of studies before the vaccine was developed.  And even then we've got the complexity introduced by shingles.</p>
<p>TL:DR: Immune system is really damn complicated, just do what the CDC (or local equivalent) says.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It will not hurt you to get a vaccine and, at least in my country (USA), they’re free, so there is no reason not to. It’s possible that a vaccine provides more robust and long lasting immunity than infection, or maybe they’re about the same. In either case, there’s absolutely no harm in getting one, only potential gain, and presumably your country is offering them for free. So short answer: YES they are recommended for those people.</p></div>		</li>
