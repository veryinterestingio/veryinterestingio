			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the shape of the &quot;container&quot; made by the volume and pressure of the air surrounding it. </p>
<p>If you ever did the density experiments as a kid with oil and water in a jar to see everything separate then that's the same principle. Gas behaves physically like a liquid.</p>
<p>So if you have a clear ball and the dense fluid is at the center, with less dense fluid all round and in between you have little pockets of fluid with density in between, they little pockets will &quot;skate&quot; around on the densest fluid under the least dense fluid according to temperature differences. </p>
<p>The two gases that sandwich in the clouds sort of compact them together so they try to move towards equilibrium.</p></div>		</li>
