			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an answer to your question but you may be interested: There was a recent science fiction book called Children of Ruin by Adrian Tchaikovsky that focuses on attempts to communicate with (uplifted) octopuses. It's a sequel to another book with uplifted spiders. The octopuses' distributed central nervous system and their use of color feature prominently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heh. &quot;Uplift&quot; is a sci-fi term that I think originates from David Brin's &quot;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/41134-the-uplift-saga" target="_blank">Uplift Saga</a>&quot; (I'd definitely recommend the first three books, but maybe not the next three). There was actually a spaceship in Children of Time called the Brin. It just means the use of technology to make another organism sapient. Like making dogs that are actually capable of playing poker. through genetic engineering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've only read Children of Time and Children of Ruin so far, sorry. I enjoyed both. Someone else mentioned loving the &quot;Shadows of the Apt&quot; series. I may check that out since I enjoy fantasy as well, but a ten book series is quite a commitment. It took me a year to get through the Malazan series.</p></div>		</li>
