<p>I somehow memorized that in high school and still remember it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do they know it’s not 9,192,631,771? I mean hz (cycles per second) needs a measure of a second to calculate but your using it to determine how long a second is. You know what I mean - you need to know how long a second is to calculate how long a second is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about clocks in particular, but we use rubidium as a frequency standard in test equipment calibration.</p>
<p>You shine a light through some rubidium vapor, and also bombard it with microwave energy. When the microwave energy hits the right frequency, about 6.8ghz, the light being passed through the rubidium drops dramatically.</p>
<p>With that, we can know the frequency of the microwave energy, and use that as part of a tuning system to &quot;discipline&quot; a less-accurate oscillator like a quartz crystal.</p>
<p>Essentially, this means we know the true frequency of the microwave energy, the relative frequency of the crystal, and the frequency the crystal <em>should</em> have. From there, you can do some magic I don't quite understand to get a very, very accurate frequency. Once you have that, you can multiply or divide to whatever frequency suits your application.</p></div>		</li>
