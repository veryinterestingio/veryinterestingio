			<div class="markdown"><p>yup, it's like a painting.  you don't start with the trees.  you first paint a wash to start the palette.  then you start sculpting the shapes out of it.  you may use a random generator, then be like, &quot;i need to clearly this mountain area out to build a missile silo base.  </p>
<p>games like Horizon Zero Dawn look like they're made this way.  there's no way those shitty mountains weren't procedurally generated.  but points of interest are dropped in where it makes sense for story flow, and then adjustments are made as necessary.  there's a weird tree in the way?  get rid of it.  this place has no trees?  drop some in.</p></div>		</li>
