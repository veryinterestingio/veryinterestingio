			<div class="markdown"><p>Now the flip side, it can take things awhile to move down your throat, I had this problem so much they put me under a live x-ray (or something similar) and I had to swallow a special pill that would show up, the freaking thing went down a little and just stopped, then slowly moved down. This I'm sure causes great irritation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I met a guy with something like this. We were in a prison run treatment program on a separate site where you lived for 90 days. You only had like 20 minutes or something in the dining hall because the next group had to come in. Well this guy was super weird and clearly mentally slow. He couldn't eat fast and would randomly throw up onto his tray so you definitely didn't want him at your table.</p>
<p>He never talked either. After a few days when one of the guards saw this and asked him he said he had a medical condition where he had an abnormally  small esophagus  and couldn't swallow well. He would take a bite that was like a quarter of a normal person like quarter of a teaspoon then chew forever and barely be able to get it down. So they gave him extra time to eat but like come on man why didnt you say something when all the guards are yelling at you saying hurry up you got to be done and go for the first 5 days.</p>
<p>I can only imagine how shitty that must be to have. Like you have To eat but it's this major production to get enough nutrients to stay alive. We felt bad for him and invited him to hang out with us since everyone else talked shit to him and were dicks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll also add a weird case I found out after a few weeks of pulling my hair out trying to figure this out. . . </p>
<p>Sometimes, depending on factors I have no clue about, you can get a ghost object sensation. That is, feel an &quot;object&quot; or lump in your throat consistently that isn't there at all. The happening I'm familiar with is that one side of the throat will have a spot on it that is either weaker than the rest or paralyzed or more dry or more moist than the surrounding area causing you to notice a different feeling &quot;spot&quot; on that side. Then when, say, swallowing, when the opposite side touches that spot, you'll feel two sensations at once; the spot side will register the spot as usual as well as the opposite side feeling that the spot side is different. Again, as either too moist, too dry, paralyzed, etc. This'll create a sensation on both sides of the throat at the same time giving the impression there is an object between these spots.</p>
<p>I had this for a few weeks and it was driving me crazy. Turns out it was somehow stress induced. My work was stressing me out a little and then having this constant item in my throat bothering me every time I breathed or swallowed stressed me even more until I managed to find some talk about it in some corner of a subreddit. After leaving that job, I haven't experienced it once since.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the â€˜lump in my throatâ€™ sensation all of the time when I was younger.  Would get so bad it would make my eyes tear too.  Would last sometimes for weeks.  Decades later I had a doctor explain it was an acid reflux type thing.</p>
<p>Quit smoking and it stopped.  Didnâ€™t realize that the smoking was the culprit until I had smoked a cigar or two and it returned.</p>
<p>So if you smoke and you get it maybe the smoking is helping to trigger it.</p></div>		</li>
