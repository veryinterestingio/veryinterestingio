			<div class="markdown"><p>The nose is part of the “t-zone” and has a ton of sebaceous (oil) glands that can become blocked/inflamed. If you look at your nose compared to, for example, the back of your hand, you can see much larger pores that can be subject to blockage and inflammation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. I believe that the ones we get on our noses are called sebaceous filaments, and not blackheads. They’re more like a feature of your skin vs a form of acne.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to up de ante.</p>
<p>My sebaceous glands don't play nice with me. Forget about pimple poppers as entertainment; </p>
<p>I've done near scrotum surgery without pain relief. Many times. I'll repeat that: surgery where doctors cut you open without any pain relief and with force press goo out of you. It takes hour but feels like hours. </p>
<p>What can I say. It hurts. A lot. </p>
<p>So jokingly I say I can do war. No biggie. A blown up leg or a bullet in the face. Peanuts; I had worse. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a dermatologist, so not trying to armchair diagnose, but I work on clinical trials for hidradenitis suppurativa, a disease that causes recurrent abscesses and boils in skin-fold areas like the groin and armpits. It's a relatively new diagnosis that a lot of providers don't know much about, so might be worth looking into</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a swede and live near a giant hospital. I go there when it hurts too much. Must have been under the dreadful scalpel about 9 times now. </p>
<p>As a dude I had one memorable moment. A young female surgeon fetched a more senior female surgeon who got another female surgeon. They had to cut into scar tissue and that's complicated. Mid surgery this female nurse said (in swedish): Relax. I don't think they are operating anymore, maybe they just want to see you naked?</p>
<p>And I started laughing. And everyone started laughing. We couldn't stop laughing.Three women cutting up a mans nomansland. Someone mentioned 'bring a shield and an axe' (in english) and we could not stop laughing.  </p>
<p>That's swedish welfare in a nutshell. Only costs me the equivalent of $15 if I want to have that much 'fun' again. ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you seeing a dermatologist? It's possible it could be hidradenitis suppurativa if you have reoccuring cysts in the same area. With things that are reoccuring surgery is a last resort as they can still come back after and you'll have lots of scarring. My derm strongly advises against lancing them and instead we focus on prevention.</p>
<p>I use an antiseptic skin cleanser in the shower (can find near rubbing alcohol at a pharmacy) and then apply clindamycin, an antibiotic lotion, on any cysts that pop up. That + friction reduction works wonders! </p>
<p>I need to grab some bike shorts but what works when I have shorts that ride up is body glide! It creates a barrier over the skin but it feels like nothing and it never clogs my pores anymore. Highly recommend. Hope this helps ☺️</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do get it. I even get a baby dose of morphine just to calm me down and turn me to a yes sayer. Tax payed quality drugs thankyouverymuch.</p>
<p>The crux is that there is so much puss and tallow that the sedative has nowhere to go. It helps a bit and I wouldn't be without it. </p>
<p>But I can still feel every cut. I feel everything. I get some foam thing to bite down into and nurses hold me down. We take pauses. I'm pretty sweaty when it's over. It's done within maybe 20 minutes but it feels like hours. And then you have an open wound to care for, for a week. That's itchy.</p>
<p>Second time was the worst. First time I had no idea what I was in for. But the second time I knew exactly what was coming. I hesitated before I stepped in to that ER. After that it got easier.</p></div>		</li>
