			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point. I watched Videos where they hire guys to physically break into buildings to see how secure they are. Basically the same thing. And it’s incredible how easy they „break“ open things  (even without using Force)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You go quite in depth while keeping it understandable. Great job! </p>
<p>I’d like to add that when it comes to hacking, a lot of hacking happens through phishing, even when it’s a big agency that’s behind the hack. Gaining access to an email account gives access to basically everything: all accounts that you have are registered with a certain email address. Your PayPal? Uses your email. Even if you use different passwords, you can simply click “password forgotten” and reset it as you have access to the email. Once your email account is compromised, everything you do online is. This is why two-factor authentication is so important, as it puts up a second barrier for which the hacker needs your phone or your fingerprint, which is a lot more difficult to do. </p>
<p>However, those hacks are quite boring. Hacking also means making sure an email looks legit while the link is fake. Hacking also means waiting for weeks, months even to finally get some useful response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't always. But how traceable they are depends on what method they used. Broadly speaking, they often use multiple anonymous VPNs through different countries before they try accessing the target computer.</p>
<p>But they're not always that sophisticated. When I was in college, the state of the art computer for big systems was called a VAX, and I learned how to be an administrator on one we had at my school. The admin account had a default password that you were supposed to change, and I wondered how many did. There wasn't a world wide web then, but you could connect up to other computers and get to their login prompt. So I tried a whole bunch of government addresses and, when I'd see a prompt that looked like a VAX prompt, I'd try the default admin login. I got into several of them. I'd usually just do a couple commands to look at the system, then logout. I wasn't trying to cause any problems.</p>
<p>It was stupid,  but it was right around the time the movie War Games came out, and it didn't seem like many people, including those in government agencies, really thought about protecting their computers much, or that it was a crime. Anyway, I think that's the mentality of a lot of hackers: just dumb kids trying to see what they can do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget about the dumbasses still using WINXP &amp; 7.</p>
<p>A few years back (2014), when I informed our CEO (small non-profit) that we needed to get our XP machines off the network, she actually asked me if I could call microsoft and ask if they could continue to support it for another year until we could afford to buy new machines. lol I was like, &quot;Yeah, I'll get right on that and call my boy Billy G and see what he says&quot; two weeks later she asked me what he said.</p>
<p>Left that place 6 months later and every year for the past 5 years, I get included on emails (personal email was used as a back up verification email and MS sends redundant emails) to renew the company O365. Thought it was funny the first year because my old creds still worked. Called them and told their new Ops manager they needed to purge old accounts and change my techsoup password along with all my other accounts. They said I'm on it.... 5 years later.... I logged in to numerous  company accounts just last week.</p>
<p>So sad how inept the majority of non-profits, mom &amp; pops, and small business are and how hiring just one contractor for a few days just to audit your vulnerabilities and provide recommendations (oh, and ensuring that your staff are applying those recommendations) can save thousands.</p></div>		</li>
