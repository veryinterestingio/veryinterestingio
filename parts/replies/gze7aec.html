			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of that endurance is because of how we cool ourselves off.  We have sweat glands all over our bodies and little hair to soak it up, so we can cool ourselves much more efficiently on the run.  Most animals have to rely on panting or fewer sweat glands to cool themselves, and panting is difficult for some of them while they are running, so they overheat faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If all 5 dudes aren't running to keep up with the prey, how are they going to be in range to press the chase?  It's not like they're sitting in their cop car a few miles up the road listening to the radio so they can intercept the perp.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Later on, as our brains developed, we did as humans do and use our brains to save on effort. Why chase an animal when you can set a trap?  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, why track an injured animal when you can make a spear, wound the animal, and then catch it a lot sooner. Most predators rely on physical contact to kill. A lioness needs to actually get in touch with her prey so that her teeth and claws can kill it. Humans were able to develop tools to kill prey from a distance. Then we improved on that over and over again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, as nasty as it sounds, primitive man would ambush an animal but not be able to take it down straight away. Instead the goal was to make it bleed (with spear or arrow) and so the animal would run away and the human hunters would slowly but relentless track and pursue until the animal collapsed from the combination of blood loss and exhaustion.</p></div>		</li>
