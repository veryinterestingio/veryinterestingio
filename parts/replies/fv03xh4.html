			<div class="markdown"><p>Plasma donation can be up to 880mL and it can be done up to twice a week but not two days consecutively, which allows them to get the maximum amount of plasma while giving your body the time it needs to replace the plasma that’s missing, rehydrate and rest. Technically it takes anywhere from a few hours up to 48 hours after donating for plasma to regenerate and the body responds immediately by rebuilding missing antibodies so that immunity and future antibody levels aren’t affected.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or does the donation spur generation of anti-bodies?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every time you donate blood you're causing inflammation because there's a needle going into your arm and your body needs to heal. It will cause a <em>very small</em> localized inflammatory response which can briefly increase your overall immune system, but it won't make COVID specific antibodies. Another problem with keeping your immune system stimulated is it's very energy intensive and the stress on your body leads to problems like cancer down the line.</p></div>		</li>
