			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with your write up and think it was really informative, thanks for taking the time to share your insights. On your last paragraph (ie once you hit the magic number you’ve got it), do you really feel that someone with n-1 symptoms is qualitatively different than someone with n symptoms? I suppose I have the opposite stance as you, but am equally open to the other view.</p>
<p>I think the Beck Depression Inventory is a great example (mostly because I know the cutoff off the top of my head). If someone had 16 of the items, then we could say they meet the criteria for depression (and it correlates with DSM diagnosis). If someone has 15 symptoms, they are categorized as not depressed. Just like the person with 1 or 0 symptoms. Surely, the person who is nearly diagnosed could benefit from treatment and it seems like a disservice to tell them they aren’t bad enough to be diagnosed. However, criteria are needed and eventually someone would say “well n-2 warrants help too!” Its a messy situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you that a 29 isn't really substantially different from a 30. One thing you might be interested to know is that 30s are pretty rare so for research purposes they often lower that number to 25. I can imagine situations where a 29 could be just as bad or worse in clinical manifestation as a 30. </p>
<p>I guess it just comes down to how one looks at the world. I tend to be a pretty black and white sort of guy. Say I'm driving my car: I'm either going the speed limit at 100kph or speeding at 101. Practically there's hardly a difference between the two and the cops won't pull me over going 101 but it is technically speeding. There's gotta be a line somewhere but we probably benefit from lines that are flexible. </p>
<p>I guess I definitely see where you're coming from, especially relating to depression. It makes sense to treat people who are 'almost depressed'. The treatment aspect of your comment doesn't really apply to psychopaths because we can't fix them. The irony of treating a psychopath is it can make them better at being a psychopath. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great points all around. I think I’ve gotten more into a gray understanding as I’ve learned more about statistics, but there are certainly times that I’d agree. Speeding is speeding assuming we are certain the thing measuring it is right. The same applies for disorders, but I think we have a bit more measurement error in that case.</p>
<p>I definitely agree on treatment. It’s interesting that the empathy coaching that’s so beneficial for children with an autism spectrum disorder can be used as a weapon by others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does this psychopathy test work? Could a determined and clever psychopath manipulate the test results by well choosing his answers and putting up a convincing act to lower his score enough to not get the label?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Labels are only there to help the treaters streamline similar treating principles into certain groups. Someone isn't just 'psychopathic' or not, it's an internal organic process with a variety of symptoms not being born with 4 or 5 fingers. It's some people's best attempt to group those symptoms into a diagnosable fashion but like any organic process is more of a spectrum than a black or white thing. </p></div>		</li>
