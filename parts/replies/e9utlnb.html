			<div class="markdown"><p>The equivalence principle applies at any point but a human would be moving or at least standing up. A relatively small radius (as on a spacecraft) would produce a noticeable difference in downward force between head and feet and as you move around would create coriolis  forces. So I am pretty sure it would not feel the same to a human.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've often wondered about the small differences between real and &quot;simulated&quot; gravity. In Ian Banks Culture series of books, he describes ring like structures that do not revolve around stars; each of these is the size to have a 24 hour daylight cycle and produce roughly 1 g of force. What I've wondered about is what small differences would really exist, particularly with regards to the <em>atmosphere</em>. My instinct says that might get weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd experience coriolis, so you'd come down ahead (in the direction of rotation, aka spinward) of where you jumped from.</p>
<p>Coriolis is experienced as a spinward force proportional to your speed in an inward direction. So as you start the jump, that's when the coriolis is greatest since that's when your inward speed is greatest. At the top of the jump, the coriolis is zero since you're motionless in an inward direction, but you're moving spinward from the accumulated force from the upward section. As you fall back down, coriolis acts in the opposite direction, ultimately cancelling out your spinward motion just as you land. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>when you run, you are heavier in running in the direction of rotation and lighter if you run the other way.  If you go fast enough that way, you can be light enough to float.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would you really &quot;Experience&quot; corriolis though? It would act on you, but you would be in free fall. It would change your trajectory; but you wouldn't feel the difference.</p>
<p>Instead, climb a ladder. Then you will experience it as the coriolis force will have to be counteracted by your grip on the ladder as you climb. Poor ladder orientation could make for a highly exciting climb. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think it would be any different than jumping regularly (assuming it matches Earth’s gravity). think of a balloon in a car, it doesn’t get pulled to the back of the car as it <del>accelerates</del> <em>moves</em>, it stays in place. You would have the same momentum as the spinning spacecraft so you would stay in the same place relative to it.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>If we're talking about a helium balloon, then no it doesn't - it moves toward the <em>front</em> of the car, because the (heavier) air moves to the back of the car, thereby pushing the lighter-than-air balloon forward.</p>
<p>Don't take my word for it - there are plenty of youtube videos showing this behavior, or you can try it yourself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t mean would you shoot backwards, I mean would you float in the center for a moment until your forward momentum meets the floor? If you’ve got momentum pushing you towards the floor due to the rotation and then cancel out that momentum by jumping, the “gravity” would go away and you’d continue traveling in a straight line until you hit the floor at an angle, no?</p></div>		</li>
