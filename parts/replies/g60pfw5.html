			<div class="markdown"><p>It's totally responsible. The opposite of &quot;fight or flight&quot; mode is often called &quot;rest and digest&quot; because your body stops investing in digestion when it's expecting to fight or run.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Massage therapist here. A big part of our job is getting your body into that &quot;rest and digest&quot; state. It's not uncommon for client's bellies (specifically, I believe, the intestines) to start making loud gurgling noises about halfway into the massage as their digestion kicks into high gear.</p>
<p>Some people feel embarrassed or self-conscious about it, but if this happens to you, you should know that we're used to it, and to us it's a clear sign that your stress levels are dropping, which is exactly what we're aiming for!</p></div>		</li>
