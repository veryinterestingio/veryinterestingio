			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact about the Gemini capsule escape procedures: instead of the escape tower, they were designed with what were basically ejector seats. There's some after-the-fact speculation about whether the astronauts would have survived if it has actually been used due to the pyrotechnics being fired in or near the capsule's pure oxygen environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The worry wasn't about anything in the cabin, that's more related to the Apollo 1 fire. The problem with Gemini was if they ejected that would put them next to a possibly exploding rocket in nothing more than their suits, which may not have been survivable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh that's definitely a bad place to be. I remember reading that with the astronauts and their clothing having been essentially soaked in pure oxygen for a few hours, maybe lighting off fireworks to launch the ejector seats want such a great idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, but perhaps more impressively, during the launch of Apollo 12 when the rocket was hit by lightning and warning lights and master alarms were going crazy, Pete Conrad had his hand on the abort handle the whole time and didn’t flinch, despite the seemingly imminent possibility of disaster.</p>
<p>Order was restored in a few moments thanks to John Aaron, Al Bean, and the legendary “try SCE to Aux” call, but the fact that Conrad didn’t abort is just one of the many awesome historical footnotes in the Apollo program.</p></div>		</li>

<p>He did exactly what he was supposed to do - fell back on training and worked the problem.  And nobody would've faulted him if he'd pulled the handle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not in a rocket but something like that happened to a retired guy in France during a flight on a fighter jet.</p>
<p>Basically it was a retirement gift that was offered to him, he was not fully keen on doing it and the procedure was not followed so he ended up as a passenger with very little explanations. During the take off, he panicked because of negative Gs, grabbed on the first thing he could find which was the ejection handle... He was ejected. Luckily, the ejection mechanism was defective and while the pilot should have been ejected as well he did not and could fly the plane back to the airport. That would have been a much costlier error.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happened to my air wing in Nevada.  A ship captain was getting a good deal ride in an F-14.  The pilot decided to be funny and said he was going to be do a &quot;FOD check&quot;, which normally would have meant check around the cockpit to make sure there is nothing loose.  But instead, he just rolled the jet upside down (idea being that any loose stuff falls down onto the canopy.  Since the ship captain didn't know this was coming, he reached between his legs to brace himself, and just so happened to happen upon a friendly handle.</p>
<p>Same thing, canopy blows, ship captain ejection seat fires.  Pilot is confused.  When did the F-14 become a convertible?</p>
<p>In this case, the partial ejection is intentional.  When a non-crew members sits in the back seat, they set the ejection mechanism so that only the pilot ejects both seats.  When the RIO was in the jet, either crew member pulling the handle sends them both on the rocket ride.</p>
<p>It was funny, but not.  Total shit show when he landed and the jet was toast.  Literally, as in the entire back seat cockpit was fried from the ejection seat rocket.  They ended up striking the jet.</p></div>		</li>
