			<div class="markdown"><p>I've often heard that bolt action rifles are more accurate, to the point where I have just considered it to be fact, but I've never heard a good explanation why. I'm familiar with the M16/AR15 as I served in the US Army for several years, so I know semi-automatic rifles fairly well, but the M16 is also widely accepted to be a very accurate weapon; so what makes a bolt action better in terms of accuracy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Less moving parts, from what I understand. Once the bolt is locked with a round in the chamber there is a solid seal, and there aren't any parts moving aside from the firing pin.</p>
<p>M16s and M4s are loose in comparison. I was also in the Army and the upper and lower receivers on our weapons would jiggle, even the tiniest bit, which could reduce accuracy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing to consider is that for the most part bolt action and single fire rifles will have much longer barrels than their semi, and fully automatic counterparts, which lends itself to greater accuracy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand the lockup from a bolt action is more consistent than that of a semi or fully automatic, usually involving more or larger locking lugs with a more positive lock. Fewer things can change between shots, means more consistent accuracy with good ammo, meaning it's easier to zero the rifle and have better accuracy at longer ranges.  As others have said too, it's simpler to manufacture and maintain as well as fewer possible issues in the field. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's better stated that bolt action can be made to be accurate for less money. Semi auto rifles can be insanely accurate to the point that there's no need for a bolt but you're talking $300 vs $1000.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's generally just a thing done in video games for balancing reasons. Lethality depends pretty much entirely on the bullet. A .308 from an automatic and a .308 from a bolt action are equally as likely to kill you, assuming they land in the same spot.</p>
<p>EDIT: I suppose I was thinking more about short-ish distance shots when I wrote this, and as u/beandip24 reminded me, automatic actions can lower the velocity of a round due to using either the recoil or escaping gas (depending on the type of action) to cycle the weapon. This can indeed affect how much energy is delivered onto the target, especially at longer ranges.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely. The bullet is projected by the explosion of powder behind it which creates a gas. In a gas operated firearm, some of that gas is then used to cycle the action and load the next round. Its probably somewhere near 5% loss of total velocity of the bullet or less, but if you are shooting at a distance you want every possible bit of speed to make it to your target. That velocity difference would also result in a difference of kinetic energy delivered upon impact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are fully automatic 20mm cannons out there, so it's certainly possible to build a semi/fully auto rifle chambered in anything a human being could actually carry around and shoot. That being said the inherently robust nature of a bolt action makes it much easier to build a very powerful gun that won't blow up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of this, but also making it easy to know if there's a bullet in there. I used to teach youth riflery, and all our guns were bolt action. It's just safer with the kiddos that way.</p></div>		</li>
