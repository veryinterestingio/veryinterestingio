			<div class="markdown"><p>Different things happen with different ones, but a lot of them end up getting pushed out the of the liver through the bile duct.  As parts of bile, they actually end up serving a function again by helping to buffer the acids from the stomach.</p>
<p>Others like alcohols are just stored in the liver until they are broken down into much smaller components that can be flushed out of the blood through the urine.</p></div>		</li>

If it gets bad enough it can even cause blood to back up into the portal vein, the veins become distended and can even lead to vomiting blood.</p></div>		</li>
