<p>As a teacher I always discuss the subject light at the end of the school year. So summer is upon them and they are probably going to try and enjoy the sun as much as possible. That's why I always show them this amazing  video <a href="https://youtu.be/o9BqrSAHbTc" target="_blank">How the sun sees you</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans too.  A botanist friend of mine damaged one of his eyes a long time ago and tore a layer off.  In that eye he can see a bit of UV.  Unfortunately, his vision isn’t very good in that eye, so it’s not much of a superpower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, I don’t even know where to start with this massive mound of misinformation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it’s “easier” to make green, yellow, and red because they were able to see them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Uhh... why in the world would you conclude that pigments are more difficult to make if they are difficult to see?? The genes that encode the opsin channels in the retina for color vision are not the same as the ones for chromophores and pigments. Incidentally, most mammals alive today (including dogs &amp; cats) can see blue, but not differentiate red from green. In fact, blue is the most basic flavor of light-sensing opsin — the “non-color” rods of the retina are most sensitive to blue-green light.</p>
<p>Just to follow your logic, while it’s possible pigments visible to potential mates would have some selection pressure, a lot of things have color accidentally. Like the red of blood. Anthocyanins are strong antioxidants in blueberries which may protect them from temperature swings. Many marine animals express carotenoproteins with a blue hue to camouflage with their natural blue background in the ocean. There are also non-biological sources of blue in nature, like cobalt and other blue minerals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>short wavelengths of light like blue and purple are less likely to travel far</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not true, all wavelengths of light cross a given distance of vacuum with the same probability. On the surface of Earth, the dominant factor determining which parts of sunlight we receive is the air. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Atmospheric_electromagnetic_opacity.svg" target="_blank">atmosphere filters</a> out much of the EM spectrum, but blue absolutely reaches Earth (otherwise the sky would not be blue). Sunburns are caused by UV light, which has an even shorter wavelength than blue or purple, but reaches us in abundance.</p>
<p>I honestly am flabbergasted. Sorry to put you on blast, but you’re throwing around a lot of technical words and misleading people.</p>
<p>There’s an interesting history of human appreciation for different colors which is <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gMqZR3pqMjg" target="_blank">revealed by linguistics</a>. Before ROYGBIV was common knowledge, ancient people lumped together many colors we consider distinct today. No matter their location on the globe, societies followed the same order: first red, then green &amp; yellow, then blue, then brown, purple, pink, orange, gray. So, while the recognition of blue as a color in itself is a more recent cultural development, humans have always possessed the necessary optical wetware.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're picking nits rather than correct ing a &quot;massive mound of misinformation&quot;.  The word &quot;easier&quot; was in quotes to alert the reader that it was not being used with its strictly precise definition. It was implied that evolution could accidentally create a blue pigment , but it wouldn't be selected for because it couldn't be seen. Pretty straight forward. </p>
<p>I'm not going to bother dissecting the rest of your comment, because it's a sunny cool Saturday in summer morning where I live, I'm done my coffee, and I've got better things to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly his comment <em>is</em> full of straight wrong information. </p>
<p>The colour blue definitely does not travel through space “worse” than the colour green. Light travels at the speed of light in a vacuum, something I had hoped we all learned in high school....</p>
<p>That guy has no idea what he is talking about. I think he talked out of his ass on purpose to troll this subreddit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It ruffled my feathers and I stand by it. Blue vision is not a recent development in evolution, so that whole argument is moot.</p>
<p>I'm not a chemist, but my understanding is that blue pigments require more complex conjugation structures (lots of alternating C=C bonds) in order to lower the orbital energy gap enough to absorb red. Since those bonds are vulnerable to electrophilic attack, the simplest blue pigments would be unstable in cells. I think that's really why they're not as common as red &amp; orange, but maybe someone with more familiarity can chime in. </p>
<p>The point about feathers and scales achieving blue through nanostructure is true and I think it's a pretty awesome fact about biology. Blue eyes in humans use the same trick</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a complete load of crap. There's only a small difference in intensity of the different visible wavelengths produced by the Sun , and all wavelengths travel equally well through the vacuum to Earth.</p>
<p>The blue colour of the sky is from all the blue light of the Sun scattered by the atmosphere.</p>
<p>And dogs and cats can see blue.</p>
