			<div class="markdown"><p>Go to Aldi. They do just this. Many of their products are private labels but created by the name brand manufacturer. Their copycat Girl Scout cookies immediately come to mind. They are 95 cents a package. I have no idea how much Girl Scout cookies are because I haven't bought them in ages. But those copy cats find a home in my cupboard twice a month!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not in the US, but this is how Lays and many other brands local to my country operate. I'm actually quite happy that the off-brand market exists, otherwise imagine the amount of wasted food, just because it doesn't look right or taste exactly like some lab-monkey's specification.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aldi does that as well as Costco. I think Costco only keeps tight-lipped about which vendors create their Kirkland label stuff for them when it comes to the liquors. Most of the food items are pretty obvious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda true. But often the <em>off brand items</em> are the same thing, different labels. Advertising a brand name is costly. So you are paying into that. Companies like that. But they still want to keep bottom feeders. And it's expensive to open a whole different factory, or production line, to maybe keep out an ingredient or two. Much cheaper to change the label.</p></div>		</li>
