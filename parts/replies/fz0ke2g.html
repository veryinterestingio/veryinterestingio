<p>What would it mean for the Drake Equation if we found life in our own solar system? For example microbes in the water of Europa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finding extraterrestrial microbial life in our solar system will impact somehow our understanding of “f l” member of the Equation, which gives the fraction of life-developing planets.</p>
<p>I think that the big picture question we could ask ourselves concerns whether or not Martian life or Europan life, or Venus life (in clouds), would share the same building blocks we use – life 1.0 here on Earth, or different ones - life 2.0.</p>
<p>So far, it is just us earthlings and  we have just one example of carbon-based life using a specific set of amino acids, nucleotides, fatty acids lipids, and sugars as part of DNA and RNA.</p>
<p>I personally think that finding any life 1.0 life, on Mars, Enceladus, or Europa, would be exciting. Such life would be on the same “Tree of Life” we have on Earth, maybe because of a common ancestor (panspermia here again). If so, maybe all life present in the Solar System would be of “terrestrial type”. or just we are the Martians!</p>
<p>See here is an example of thee of life: <a href="http://bio1520.biology.gatech.edu/biodiversity/phylogenetic-trees/" target="_blank"><a href="http://bio1520.biology.gatech.edu/biodiversity/phylogenetic-trees/" target="_blank">http://bio1520.biology.gatech.edu/biodiversity/phylogenetic-trees/</a></a></p>
<p>However, and here I agree with Chris McKay, finding the ‘holy grail’ of a new type of life, aka the &quot;Second Genesis of Life&quot; , or Life 2.0, would be much much much more exciting!</p>

<p>The implication of multiple genesis of life in a solar system, would lend to the possibility that an infinite number of different life types in our galaxy! This will have a terrific impact on the Drake Equation. If  each extra solar system could develop multiple and very different life forms, then,  it is more likely that some of them would evolve into developing some (techno)civilization, hopefully surviving long enough to be detected, or escaping extinction by spreading beyond their home world.</p></div>		</li>
