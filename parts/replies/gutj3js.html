			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Because you were forming that thought, even if you forgot it. It's not the same as a tree falling, but there was noone to hear the sound, did it make sound? Because that thought experiment is about whether sound is a property of the creater of the sound or the perceiver.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not.  Playing piano, snowboarding, even some crazy videogame bloodbaths have certainly cleared my brain of conscious thought on a number of occasions.  Anything with incredible concentration and determination has this capability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a whole lot messier once you try to distinguish awareness, self-awareness, thoughts, and memories. Meditation may suppress some of these but it’s not at all obvious that you (or the human brain, which is how the question was phrased) are thinking no thoughts while you meditate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am just a beginner in meditation, but I am doubt even the highly skilled meditators have not a single thought in 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Meditation is not about focusing to not have any thoughts, it is more about responding to thoughts in a better, less judgmental way (and not get caught in them). It is like weightlifting for mind, you train alone, so eventually you can apply this learnt skill in daily life, to react better to things happening to you.</p>
<p>Sure, as you get better in meditation, eventually you will also have less and less thoughts coming and distracting you, and I noticed it too - but mind never completely shut up :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Easy to try not thinking about anything particular and call it meditation. Though I've never heard of someone being able not to think at all, and from my experience, it appears impossible.
And since you can't verify if someone else has this skill, not easy to trust it's something we can learn</p></div>		</li>
