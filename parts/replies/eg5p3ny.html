			<div class="markdown"><p>This needs an explanation why/when cv^2 &gt;&gt; bv (such that bv is negligible), and further implies that, at some point, dv^3 would dominate (which is true).</p>
<p>For low speeds, bv is indeed all you need to describe the drag. But needs some physics to describe what &quot;low&quot; means in this context.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think so. The series description in the upper post applies to continuous/&quot;well-behaved&quot; variables, but the signature of supersonic flight is the presence of shocks/discontinuities. That is, if you go faster and faster, as you approach the speed of sound you will start to get shocks in the flow, and the drag will jump up. This abrupt transition can't be accurately represented by the smooth a + bv + cv^2 + dv^3 ... .</p>
<p>The form of the drag equation depends on the Reynold's number, which depends on the size of the object. The speed of sound depends on just flow speed and the properties of the medium -- no dependence on the object shape. I think you will find that large objects (e.g., a car or plane) will have cubic drag (and even descriptions with higher powers) well before reaching the speed of sound. Smaller and more streamlined objects, like bullets, might be accurately described with cv^2 until they hit the speed of sound, but I haven't actually looked at the correlations to confirm this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The proper approach is fluid dynamics. This is a good example of trying to apply a theory to something fundamentally outside of the scope of that theory.</p>
<p>Purely depending on your geometry you can get a variety of different flows which can give various levels of resistance to forward motion.</p></div>		</li>
