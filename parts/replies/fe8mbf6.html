<p>Incredibly low friction. To the point where any 1/2 ton pickup can pull a 1,000,000 lb train on the tracks with ease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Engineering Explained does all the math and explains it, but basically the rolling resistance is so incredibly low for a steel wheel on a steel track that pretty much anything could do it including small SUVs and even sedans.</p>
<p>He was explaining why Ford's ad showing the electric F150 was a great ad, but not really impressive at all because of how easy it actually is. The 1.25 Million lb train only needs about 1875lbs of force to pull on the tracks, and indeed the tow strap they used was only rated for 2000lbs. And keeping that same train moving at 4.5mph only needs around 22 horse power.</p>

<p>If you're strong enough to put the bar in place, you're strong enough to move a train.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The important point is you are not pulling the entire million pound train at once. You pull each car individually. The knuckle in between each car gives some room to start pulling the first car, and then once that is moving, it jerks on the second car, until it moves, and so on. Each train car you get moving adds more momentum to the whole system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just shows you how little force you actually need. That train was around 330k pounds, which translates to about 495lbs of force to get it moving.</p>
<p>Which is a pretty middle of the road squat or deadlift for anyone seriously training for powerlifting.</p></div>		</li>

<p>...terrible for acceleration and braking...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They get around the braking issues (somewhat) by having each train car have its own brakes. Otherwise trains would take even longer to stop than they already do.</p>
<p>Also, some high-speed trains use linear eddy current brakes to generate braking force by inducing eddy currents in the rail via an electromagnet on the train (similar technology is used to stop roller coasters when entering the station).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>and to add to that, another reason trains don't need gears is because they don't climb hills. Train routes are flat, they'll cut into a mountain if they have to because the train can't climb a hill. They could routinely climb hills if we designed the tracks and wheels differently but what a hassle that would be, you'd lose the low friction described by Earthworm Jim, and all the time we'd have underpowered trains rolling down hills and killing people. Even a really weak train can cross the alps, the little engine that could doesn't really happen, why would someone buy a train incapable of making a really steep incline, the owner should have just given up on the whole venture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have it a bit backwards. Yes, train lines are usually very flat due to the low friction design of the trains. However there is a limit to how flat we can engineer a rail line so some lines are quite steep. Still rather gentle compared to the hills on a road but certainly far from flat. These lines did require special trains to be built. In the age of steam they had to be built with boilers that could handle the incline without damage. They also required stronger brakes and more driven axles in order to get more traction. Today this have become more standard for newer locomotives, especially for passenger trains. However there is still some new locomotives that struggles on steeper inclines.</p></div>		</li>
