<p>F=ma is connected to inertia.  Which is different than gravity.  Infact, the two phenomena may very well be totally different.</p>
<p>The Higgs boson attributs inertial mass to matter.  I'll say that again, as far as we know the Higgs has nothing to do with gravity.</p>
<p>Back to the ELI5 question - &quot;<strong>How</strong> does mass have anything to do with gravity?&quot;  The <strong>how</strong> is simple and explained by Newtonian Gravity or General Relativity.  But I think they're actually asking &quot;<strong>Why</strong> does mass have anything to do with gravity?&quot;</p>
<p>What's the difference?  <strong>How</strong> seeks to understand the mechanism by which something happens: how to measure and predict results. <strong>Why</strong> seems to understand the purpose by which something happens: what is the motivation of the creator(s) when they decided to make it this way.</p>
<p><strong>How</strong> is science.  <strong>Why</strong> is religion.</p>
<p><strong>How</strong> - the answer is we've measured that anything with mass has a gravitational effect.  We can predict how it affects other things with mass and have gotten very good at predicting what will happen.  We have explored for some underlying &quot;simpler&quot; mechanism but have not found any.  As far as we can tell: more mass makes more gravity and that's the way the universe works. (ok keeners, yes enough energy can also cause gravity but let's keep it ELI8-ish).</p>
<p>Unsatisfying?  Well that's what happens at the bottom layer of reality.</p>
<p>There's a saying:</p>
<p>- All human behaviour can be explained by biology<br />
- All biology can be explained by chemistry<br />
- All chemistry can be explained by physics<br />
- All physics can be explained by mathematics<br />
- All mathematics can be explained by philosophy.</p>
<p>Edit: titogruul did a great job, but the how/why thing is a big deal for young minds.  Got to start them young on knowing the diff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you’re assuming too much when you say OP doesn’t mean a scientific “how” but rather a religious “why”. I’ll attempt to rephrase the question: space is empty, so what occurs between the Sun and the Earth which results in each being pulled toward the other? People speak of gravitational “fields”, but what IS a gravitational field? Again, space is empty, so what is a gravitational field made of? And if it’s it’s made of nothing... how does that work?</p>
<p>I’m aware that mass has a distorting effect on space, but how? How does mass interact with nothingness? What “communication” can there be?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right.  You're closing-in on a great question there!  I may deviate away from the age-5 requirement, but some handy metaphors and analogies lie within.</p>
<p><strong>Magnetism</strong> between two object has no mediator that we can see or observe.  We model the behaviour using things we call &quot;<strong>virtual photons</strong>&quot;.  It's mathematical tool to say &quot;partial photons, that can never exist, tugs at the atoms between two objects ... except when the virtual photon's energy is high enough (greater than p=1.00) then a REAL photon will appear out of a vacuum&quot;.</p>
<p>The re-appearing out of the vacuum is weird stuff, sure.  But the the communication of a virtual photon as a mediator for magnetism has been used to make staggeringly accurate predictions ... the most accurate predictions ever in fact.  If our understanding of this virtual photon business was off by 0.00000001% your smartphone touch screen would not work. We've pretty much nailed it.</p>
<p>So <strong>gravity</strong> - what's all that about?  As far as we human can tell - and there has been considerable attempts - <strong>there is no &quot;virtual graviton&quot;</strong>.  There is no particle mediating gravity.  Our best model for predicting gravity (General Relativity or GR) says reality itself is the mediator.  What does that mean ? ...</p>
<p>Imagine you shine a laser into space.  it goes in a straight line.  But what if space itself was not straight?  Well, it would bend of course. But could we tell?  How could we know if space was bent?  How could we observe it?  With light?</p>
<p>So fine, if space is curved, where is it curved into?  These are hard to explain in English as the question requires description that defies any spoken language or model a reality.  That's where math comes in!  Space bends into a 4th dimension - time.</p>
<p>Since mass seems to bend reality - straight lines are bent.  They bend into a massive object.  Reality is space and time, standing still near a massive object ... the only straight line is towards the object.  That is, the Newtonian precept &quot;an object at rest tends to stay at rest&quot; causes gravity when reality itself is warped by mass.  We feel gravity because we experience the passage of time.  <strong>Like we're in the ocean and an oncoming wave's undertow is pulling us backwards - that's gravity.</strong>  As we move through the ocean (moving forward through time) there's always a wave pulling us because the earth is so massive, but the chair we're sitting in is keeping us from getting sucked into the wave.  We're perpetually in the undertow.</p>
<p>There have been some very clever experiments with gravity cause time dilation - and they have been able to measure how much slower time passes close to the earth compared to, say, 8 floors above the earth.  It's fits our predictions according to Einsteins' GR.  Chalk another one up to old Albert.</p>
<p>Now, time is the 4th dimension, but it's not linear (1,2,3,4,5) like the other 3 - it's kind of hyperbolic (1, 1/tanh(2), 1/tanh(3), ...). So it behaves very strangely.  But still, predictably.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I said in my original comment, action at a distance is spooky. Feymann addressed this very well: in order to avoid infinitely going into &quot;why&quot; you have to have some common framework to eventually stop at. A lot of questions &quot;why&quot; can be explained with more fundamental concepts. But since gravity (as well as magnetism) <em>is</em> fundamental so you have no such luck - it is what it is and trying to explain it with more everyday concepts (e.g. rubber bands) will go poorly.</p>
<p>And even when things get unified and simplified, that tends to stem from more concepts which makes explaining it even harder. Technically, field communication is done by particles (gravitons in gravity and photons in EM but how exactly is beyond my physics background).</p>
<p>I don't mean to undermine the question, just try to outline why it is a very difficult question and why answers are not satisfying. Now, if you were to ask why ice is slippery, the discussion may feel much more fruitful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>they require concepts that you cannot always relate in everyday life</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hear this repeated like a mantra on every other thread, but no one ever asks to explain to them in everyday concepts necessarily. It's like people are just avoiding the responsibility to introduce those new concepts to the inquiring person.</p></div>		</li>
