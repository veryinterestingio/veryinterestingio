<p>Yeah, that sounds like a special level of hell, friend. A trip to a school, playground, or really anywhere children congregate sounds stressful!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact about ADHD: many people with ADHD can't properly filter out background noise. They may come across as inattentive because they're unable to properly differentiate the conversation they're having from other noises around them. Or not hear their name being called, as it doesn't cut through the background noise as clearly as it would for someone without ADHD.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the &quot;Attention-Deficit&quot; part come from this? The brain's inability to filter out stimuli on a basis of high to low priority?</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Anrikay" target="_blank">Anrikay</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>The attention-deficit label comes from the symptoms seen in people with ADHD. Getting distracted by noises or sights unrelated to what you're supposed to be focused on, as well as wandering thoughts, daydreaming, stuff like that. </p>
<p>This is one of the causes for those symptoms, though. Which also makes &quot;attention-deficit&quot; a bit of a misnomer, seeing as its more an inability to focus attention than a complete lack of attention.</p></div>		</li>
