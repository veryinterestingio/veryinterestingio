<p>No time after the first six months, that's when the clock runs out. They don't die, but they're increasingly anemic from that point on.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I recently learned that the world-wide breastfeeding average cutoff age is two years old. Any idea what that means for those kids at the higher end of the range?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't true at all. Babies who exclusively breastfeed for a year or even two are shown to have normal iron levels. The 6 months recommendation for iron supplements was based on the lower amount of iron found in breastmilk versus cows milk but doesn't take into consideration that the iron in breastmilk is more easily absorbed by baby and comes with protein bonds that prevent other sources from using the iron. So it stays with baby. Also none is lost from intestinal irritation, like what happens with cow's milk. Baby absorbs 70% of the iron each feeding, versus the 12% absorbed from cow's milk</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the baby is usually supplemented with foods, the fruits and vegetables eaten as first foods have iron in them. The mom’s I know breast fed for 18-24 months but the babies were also eating a growing amount of fresh fruits and vegetables. My daughters started eating as soon as they could sit on their own (my NP’s recommendation) like at 4months we would supplement those first foods with breast milk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly never.</p>
<p>Breastmilk is 50x more bio-available than other forms of ingested iron.</p>
<p>So although the total amount ingested might be less, it still might not be a problem if the mother is ingesting enough iron in her diet to replace what is lost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is being questioned actually because the iron in breast milk is ridiculously bioavailable. Here's one research article on the subject finding breast milk fed babies have better iron levels than cows milk formula fed babies. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/577504/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/577504/</a></p></div>		</li>
