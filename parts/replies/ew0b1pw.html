			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a couple follow-up questions about the liquor “Goldschlager,” which has gold leaf shards in cinnamon schnapps.  (1) people always said it would make you drunker because the gold flake would cut the lining of your digestive track making the alcohol absorbed by your body quicker. True? Not true? (2) there was an urban legend about a man who drank a few shots of goldschlager at a bar each evening after work and developed a rare disease that made his bones brittle where gold bonded to this bones.  True? Not true?  Thanks in advance for your response.  This mystery has plagued me since high school nights in the woods / sand pits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah all of that is complete horse shit. <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/karat-slices/" target="_blank">https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/karat-slices/</a> The bit about bones is probably from radium or phosphorus. Radium is similar enough to calcium that it can get used by the body in bones which tends to be bad due to the radiation. Phosphorus can cause bone necrosis because of how it interacts with the body. Gold doesn’t really like having chemical reactions so there’s really no way for the body to absorb significant amounts since digestion and absorption are chemical reactions.</p></div>		</li>
