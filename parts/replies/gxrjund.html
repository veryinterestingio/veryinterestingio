			<div class="markdown"><p>The Native Americans of the Pacific Northwest ate a bunch of bulbs called camas, and it was a major part of their diet/trade.</p>
<p>There is a camas species with the common name “death camas”. All parts of the plant are poisonous, so only one insect pollinates since just that one bee species can tolerate the toxic pollen.</p>
<p>Don’t eat random bulbs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fun part, as Native folks have told me, is that white “death” camas is indistinguishable from blue camas, the staple crop, once the flowers are gone. </p>
<p>So, don’t just not eat random bulbs—harvest your camas while it’s in bloom.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Most things aren't either 100% edible or kill-you-quick. They tend to fall into &quot;this really sucks to eat&quot; territory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can test things for poison gradually. For example if it iritates your skin, it's probably poisonous. If it doesn't irritate your skin you can test it quickly on your tongue. If it doesn't have a negative effect from being put on your tongue you can try progressively more tests.</p>
<p>This process doesn't work for everything, but it does for most things.</p>
