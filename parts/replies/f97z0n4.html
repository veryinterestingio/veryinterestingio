			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a bit like dogs play-fighting. They have signs that show they enjoy themselves as opposed to a serious fight to the death. It's a way to train as they grow up. Seems to me what you say about tickling is kind of similar, psychologically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So itâ€™s almost like itâ€™s evolutionary defensiveness by exerting a sense of trust? Like someone you trust is making you uncomfortable, so you become inclined to increase your sense of protection associated with them by amplifying your usual inclinations of joy like laughter?
5 year old me and I love and thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also trust that the other person will <em>stop</em> tickling when you no longer enjoy it. You might not be able to stop laughing, but like all play, the &quot;trick&quot; is to learn where the boundaries of good interaction are. </p>
<p>Laughing isn't conditioned, hating to be tickled sure can be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah yelling stop while laughing your ass off isn't going to get them to stop. But when you stop laughing and just say STOP, it ends all the fun and people usually stop tickling. At least those of us who are not psychopaths stop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™m talking more about why laughing evolved as a reflexive reaction to tickling, as well as why as infants/small children we laugh and often even enjoy being tickled. I agree, I hate when people tickle me, but thatâ€™s because over my lifetime Iâ€™ve developed a dislike for the sensation. However, I will still laugh as a reflex whilst attempting to kick the person in the head ðŸ˜‚</p>
<p>Also keep in mind, paleontologists estimate human laughter is a phenomenon thatâ€™s about 10-16 million years old. So itâ€™s likely a very deep rooted instinct that can be pretty easily overridden by executive functions of the brain. Like for example, when it triggers more of an angry response.</p></div>		</li>
