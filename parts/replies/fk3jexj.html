<li>Both</li>
<li>I'm terrible at listening to monologues or lectures, I'll hear something interesting, think about it and by the time I'm finished I don't know what they're talking about anymore. I'd turn a movie off before it got to that stage.</li>
</ol>
<p>If I find something I'm engrossed by then listening is effortless. But I need to pay attention to things I find less interesting and I find that difficult, frustrating and tiring. I saw a doc once about ADHD in my mid 20s, he said I'm managing okay and don't need meds. I guess that was both helpful because I don't want to medicate and unhelpful because I didn't really get any feed back</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's focus on point 3 first, To be honest what you may see as a weakness is actually in some ways a strength.  The fact that you get &quot;distracted&quot; because you start thinking about what you had just read means that you are actively reading and thinking about the implications of what you are reading.  This is something teachers try to teach their students, to not just passively read the words but to actively engage with the text and make connections to it.</p>
<p>So the question isn't how to stop you from doing that but to channel it into a productive pathway.  </p>
<p>What I would recommend for reading non-fiction (this strategy will be a little less effective for fiction but can be modified to work)</p>
<p>The strategy I am going to outline is called a &quot;close reading strategy&quot; if you want to do more research about it.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Have a copy of a non-fiction book that is yours that you are willing to write in.  (I know, I know it sounds like desecration but trust me)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every paragraph that you read stop and in two or three words write down the main idea of the paragraph in the margin. Note: do not stress or overthink the words you choose for the main idea.  It doesn't have to be perfect it just has to be &quot;good enough&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only underline parts of the paragraph that are directly relevant to that main idea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a notebook, anytime you start having a brainstorm or start to get distracted by the implications of what you read.  Put a &quot;star 1&quot; at that part in the book and then put &quot;star 1&quot; in your notebook and write down (quickly) the idea that you are starting to think about.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After you finish the chapter go back and look down the margin notes, use those margin notes to jog your memory about what the entire chapter was about and then either at the beginning of the chapter or at the end write a few sentences summarizing the main ideas in the chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>Look over all of the your starred ideas and questions and see if any are worth pursuing.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, I know this look like a lot of effort.  And it looks like it is actually going to slow you down.  BUT the advantage of this is that you will always be making forward progress.  Once you lock down a paragraph by writing down its main idea you will likely never have to reread it.</p>
<p>If you end up trying this strategy would you mind PMing me just to let me know how it worked out for you?  Would love to know your thoughts after trying it.  :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>When listening to podcasts I often have to skip back 10-30 seconds because I donâ€™t know what just got said.</p></div>		</li>
