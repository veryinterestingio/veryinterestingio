			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worse than that. It can remain dormant in the dirt after shedding from the animal through saliva or other bodily fluids, or simply when the animal dies. If plants grow through that soil, even years later, it can harbor prions inside of it. Then that plant is eaten by another deer, and the cycle starts all over again.</p>
<p>Deer hunters are being told to bring carcasses into a disposal facility after dressing the deer for meat, so that it can be disposed of correctly. Even burning the carcass wont get rid of that pesky folded protein.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Prion diseases are unmanageable. You just burn everything that could possibly have the diseases. And then hope it didn’t survive the fire.</p>
<p>They’re rare and there’s usually a strong crackdown afterwards. You can’t donate blood in America if you were in the UK for a portion of the 90s because of mad cow disease, also caused by prions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/prions/cwd/occurrence.html" target="_blank">CWD is spreading.</a> It's not really possible to manage a disease that has no cure, no vaccine, and occurs in a large reservoir of wild animals that are poorly constrained by geopolitical boundaries.</p>
<p>OTOH, it might not be spreading quite so much as we're more aware of it, but it's almost certain it's spreading, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is absolutely seriously affecting wildlife - at least in the U.S. It is very widespread among white-tailed deer and can also infect elk and moose. On the east coast, most states are only actively monitoring counties in which it has already been observed, which means it can spread for a while before someone happens to notice and report a case- usually well-informed hunters.
There's really a lot we don't know about prions, and we haven't completely ruled out the possibility of CWD spreading to humans. They recommend cooking venison thoroughly and opting out of eating it if the deer you shot was acting sick.
Prions are also responsible for mad cow disease and some other similar neurological diseases in other species. It is even responsible for Creutzfeldt-Jakobs disease, which infects humans.
Prions are scary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That being said however, there are several lichens which can degrade prions and some which even have multiple pathways to do so (because apparently to this lichen it's so little of a problem here's two different ways of doing it).  Strangely enough, these lichens are found where infected deer eat.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Prions are scary. Mad cow disease is one of them. They don't even die by cooking/burning them even up to very high temperatures.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And it's hard to argue that they are alive. They're just misfolded proteins... Just this malicious, toxic dust that kills you slowly over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes sense though that they are 'hardy'. They are definitely not alive. Think of them as toxic chemicals (they are, essentially) - just a molecule of deadly atoms. I don't think you can just add acid to, or irradiate say, potassium cyanide and expect it to stop being cyanide (unless an acid will react to it to form a less toxic product of course - not a great example but anyways). </p>
<p>The unique scary property of prions being able to propagate and make more of itself is what makes them scary.</p></div>		</li>
