			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, but the reason isn't oil repellling the water.</p>
<p>The reason is that water is more dense, and burning oil is hot enough to boil water.</p>
<p>So when you add water to a grease fire, you've just introduced a layer of very rapidly boiling water <em>under</em> the firey oil. All the steam from the water lifts and aerosolizes the oil. That gives the oil more surface area to burn and better access to oxygen, and also launches it all over the place.</p>
<p>Use a lid or something <del>dry</del> like baking soda. Worst case, throw a slightly damp rag over the pan; you'll probably lose the rag, but it'll extinguish the fire safely</p>
<p>EDIT: Other fun fact. Baking soda works so well because in that kind of heat it starts to chemically decompose.  2 NaHCOÂ³ -&gt; NaÂ²
COÂ³ (sodium carbonate) + HÂ²O + COÂ². So as it sits on the hot oil it's actually releasing carbon dioxide and water vapor that smothers the fire, while also absorbing extra heat!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sugar particles in the atmosphere is what led to the Imperial Sugar refinery explosion in Savannah, GA in 2008. Sugar dust had built up from poor cleaning and a simple spark caused a massive explosion.</p>

<p>When I was a kid working at McDonalds, I used to empty powder creamers onto a lighter to show coworkers what they were ingesting in their coffee. Given the large amounts of natural gas, open flame, and boiling oil, I was an idiot, even if it was just a packet or two.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Big oof.</p>
<p>I think one key is that the rag needs to be damp. If it's dripping wet it'll get water in the oil (fwoosh) and if it's too dry it'll just burn. It's also gotta cover the whole pan.</p>
<p>Lid is always safer.</p></div>		</li>
