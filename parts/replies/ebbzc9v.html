			<div class="markdown"><p>I still joke that I never hated beer, just the crap my dad drank when I was younger.</p>
<p>But that's not totally fair, as I've got plenty of proof that your own tastes change over time (there's a number of foods I love now that I didn't like as a teen).</p>
<p>I still don't like any of his mainstays, but it's more a preference for a different style. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always hated cheap beer, such as Bud Light, Coors, etc. But when I started trying the good stuff you can only get at liquor stores, I really started to enjoy it. Still hate the cheap beer though. Maybe I'm just a snob. </p>
<p>Edit: if anyone cares, my current favorite is Kellerweis. </p></div>		</li>

<p>You get fat and realize those fancy beers are all sugar and marketing. You just drink hoppy ones with less sugar? Ok but they’re a testosterone/estrogen nightmare. </p>
<p>Still like a beer in the summer or when bonding with friends but don’t want to grow tits? “Let’s try this ‘Triple haupped’ Miller light again.” Or “What’s this blue ribbon stuff about?”</p>
<p>I could go for a espresso stout right now for old time sake </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that's not it. I like bud light now well enough. Also, how's that apply to olives or tomatoes, which I used to not like but now do? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually haven’t had that first beer in a long time but I can remember the last time that I had it,it wasn’t the greatest. I found that starting with bud lights and miller lites made the transition to drinking beer easier. Now that I like more craft beers, I find myself unable to stand those beers now, as they taste heavily watered down. </p></div>		</li>
