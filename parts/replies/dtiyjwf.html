<p>Just as Dr. Wild (or is it Dr. Cat?) said, household pets aren't around other animals enough to get sick. But when they are around other animals, let's say a kennel, they are required to have certain immunizations. So for these temporary moments that they are in a &quot;herd,&quot; they can have a somewhat established &quot;herd immunity&quot; and not get each other sick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an excellent point. I noticed that my dog went from never having an illness to flu like symptoms 3-4 times a year and it coincided with joining doggie sports, pack walks and frequently joining me at the kennel. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes, a low-grade cold type infection can be caused in cats by the feline herpes virus. Cats who are infected stay infected for life, much like people, and in times of stress they can show cold symptoms. Some cats basically have a low-grade cold all the time if they've got a weak enough immune system. RIP Casper, you deaf little funyun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, herpes virus is pretty much ubiquitous among cats. Some 98% of cats are infected with herpes virus. Some might never have an outbreak (usually upper respiratory/ocular signs), some might have 1-2, and some might have an outbreak every time they get stressed. Not a serious problem for the vast majority of cats but some can get super sick or feel crappy a lot of the time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My cat has what our vet affectionally refers to as &quot;the herp&quot; ?  he gets gunk in his eyes and they get all red and he also starts sneezing more. What kind of cracks me up is that I can't imagine what could possibly be so stressful about his life, he literally sleeps 20 hours a day! Haha. Sorry about Casper, that's a great name! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Guinea pigs are as well. I went on a tour of a biomedical facility that produced flu vaccines, and if I'm remembering the tour correctly Guinea pigs are used to challenge-test the batches of vaccine for efficacy. So, vaccinate the guinea pig, watch for symptoms of flu (which would mean the vaccine caused the flu) and expose it to the virus it's been vaccinated against to see if it's immune. Never occurred to me before that moment that they spot-check batches, but it makes sense.</p></div>		</li>
