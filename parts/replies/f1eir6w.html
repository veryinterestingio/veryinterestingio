			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a place outside Chicago called Starved Rock, the small canyons around which were formed by a catastrophic glacial meltwater release. There are several 50-100ft canyons on the south bank of the Illinois river. Pretty cool...though not technically &quot;the east&quot;.</p>
<p>Just the nature of the geography...I think the highest point east of the Mississippi is actually lower than the Denver Broncos stadium. Everything west from the start of the Rockies is so ungodly massive...there's barely a way to wrap your head around what was possible out there over the millennia.</p>
<p>Edit: Nope, Mile High Stadium is 1,500ft lower than the highest point east of the Mississippi.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its crazy to think that our quiet little planet had a 2000 foot deep lake held up by an ice dam that would give out, causing immediate flooding for a thousand miles or more, and that it did that repeatedly over a few thousand years.  I Think this is my new favorite for &quot;if you could go back and watch one point in history&quot;</p></div>		</li>
