			<div class="markdown"><p>Lmao that is hilarious but imagine that as torture from the fly's perspective. Get trapped in a jar. Put in a strange, freezing environment and slowly fall unconscious. Wake up with a giant breathing warm air onto you, and notice that only one of your legs are tied. This giant has full custody of you. Fly around in a frenzy as you're trying to process what is happening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is actually used on a David Blaine's magic setup. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>leave a previously frozen fly somewhere</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pass by that place with your mark</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>grab the &quot;dead&quot; fly and explain you have healing powers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>warm up the fly in your hand with your breath until it wakes up</p>
</li>
<li>watch it fly away and watch as your mark thinks you've resuscitated a living being</li>
</ol></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember my brother doing that when I was like 3 or 4 and then when I went to Sunday school that week and told everyone he brought a dead fly to life one of the moms there got like irrationally PISSED about it and said he'd go to hell if he kept &quot;pretending to be Jesus&quot;. 'twas truly wild</p></div>		</li>
