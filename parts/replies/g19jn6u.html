All the negotiations between all the different devices, resent packets, someone's old iPod pottering along at a/b speeds slowing a whole channel down. </p>
<p>The more I learn about it the more I realise it shouldn't really work and the fact it does is testimony to very, very smart people working incredibly hard....all so I can laugh at the tiger king.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's also a ton of redundancy and fault tolerance built in. Various bits of that process break all the time, but each piece is built so that the whole thing will continue to work anyways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Further to this, in OP's example with the light switch you could equate this to Pulse Width Modulation in which the same frequency is used but the length of time it is transmitted for changes to represent 1 or 0. A good real-world example where this happens is IR remote controls. </p>
<p>That is, OP's light would be turned on with two different time intervals. Think this is called varying the duty cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're tuning into a carrier frequency. In (analog) FM radio, that carrier's precise frequency varies a little up and down, to smoothly track the original audio signal.</p>
<p>In digital radio, the carrier signal only needs two frequencies, because it conveys the data mathematically - not by tracking it directly.</p>
<p>Either way, there can be interference problems if different channels exist on close frequencies, or at harmonics, etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nitpicking, but most digital radio nowadays uses differential phase shift keying. That only needs one very narrow frequency, and is pretty efficient in spectrum usage. </p>
<p>You only shift signal phase, not frequency or amplitude.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>kind of but not really. it's one &quot;frequency&quot; in the sense that it's one big audio wave that's being transmitted. any audio wave can be broken up into an infinite amount of different sine waves, so you're basically taking your original audio waves and cranking that one particular carrier sine wave way up (for AM at least)</p></div>		</li>
