			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. What sort of lunitic would want to kill Parthy?! I’ve done at least 4-5 runs over the years, making different decisions, but the blades quest was always abandoned and Parthanax always lives, because, as you so elloquently put it, I am not a monster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems like in every TES game theres an &quot;enemy&quot; that you have to kill but you dont want to. Skyrim had Paarthurnax, Oblivion had Umaril, Morrowind had Dagoth Ur. Like why cant I join the Sixth House and drive out the mongrel dogs of the empire? Or side with Paarthurnax and kill Delphine and Esbern?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thats just talking one already in motion though, there is also the law of cubes at work and the energy reqired to get something heavy to move in the first place.</p>
<p>a.k.a why pacific rim 1 was awsome, and pacific rim 2 made all the jaegers look like bath toys.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>TLDR: size and volume/weight dont grow equally fast. huge things are way WAY heavier than smaller things.<br />
the heavier something is, the more power is required to start that thing moving. this is why it makes sense that huge things have a slower &quot;run up&quot; time. but once they get moving, they will probably keep going.also means their turning radius will probably be shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: When Chekhov saw the long winter, he saw a winter bleak and dark and bereft of hope. Yet we know that winter is just another step in the cycle of life, a fact understood perfectly well by Galileo Galilei. Galileo’s last book was the <em>Two New Sciences</em>, a dialogue in four days. The third and fourth days describe his solution to the longstanding problem of projectile motion, a result of obvious importance and the birth of physics as we know it. But this was only the second of his two new sciences. What was the first one?  </p>
<p><em>Two New Sciences</em> begins in the Venetian Arsenal, the shipyard of the Republic of Venice, with a discussion of the effect of scaling up or scaling down in practical construction projects, like shipbuilding. The discussants include two of Galileo’s closest friends, Giovanni Francesco Sagredo and Filippo Salviati, and an Aristotelian philosopher Simplicio, who is perhaps Galileo’s friend and sometime adversary Cesare Cremonini, although he is never identified by his real name. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that these three men actually met in life, as Sagredo was a nobleman of Venice, Cremonini was professor of philosophy at Padua, and Salviati, a nobleman of Florence and patron of Galileo, may have been Galileo’s student at Padua. The dialogue form is not intended to represent a real meeting, but rather to provide a framework for developing ideas in a lively, engaging way.</p>
<p><em>Two New Sciences</em> begins with the subject of scaling. Galileo’s observations on scaling in general are ingenious and elegant, and entirely deserving of the prominent place he gives them. These ideas are basic in physics, and are introduced in most introductory physics texts under the heading of dimensional analysis. We could even say that modern renormalization group methods are just our most recent way to deal with problems of scale, still recognizably in a tradition pioneered by Galileo. It is true that Galileo didn’t have the algebraic notation to do dimensional analysis the way we do, but his insights within a restricted arena are the same as ours.</p>
<p>An example of such an insight is “the surface of a small solid is comparatively greater than that of a large one” because the surface goes like the square of a linear dimension, but the volume goes like the cube. Thus as one scales down macroscopic objects, forces on their surfaces like viscous drag become relatively more important, and bulk forces like weight become relatively less important.  Galileo uses this idea on the First Day in the context of resistance in free fall, as an explanation for why similar objects of different size do not fall exactly together, but the smaller one lags behind.</p>
<p>Even though the idea is completely general, most of the discussion on scaling is directed specifically to the strength of materials. That subject is introduced immediately in <em>Two New Sciences</em> with the assertion that large ships out of water risk breaking under their own weight, something that is not a concern with small ships. The same subject occupies most of the Second Day, which is devoted to the strength of beams. The question is put in an especially paradoxical way by Sagredo, who says,  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Now, because mechanics has its foundation in geometry, where mere size cuts no figure, I do not see that the properties of circles, triangles, cylinders, cones and other solid figures will change with their size. If therefore a large machine be constructed in such a way that its parts bear to one another the same ratio as in a smaller one, and if the smaller is sufficiently strong for the purpose for which it was designed, I do not see why the larger also should not be [sufficiently strong] . . . ”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This argument is remarkable. It combines faith that (1) physics “is” geometry, and (2) thescale invariance of the theorems of geometry. For the purpose of this paper we will call it Sagredo’s theory of scale invariance.  </p>
<p>A typical example of the new considerations that arise when “we fill these figures with matter” starts with the breaking of a wooden beam. If the beam breaks, all its longitudinal fibers break, and because their number is proportional to the cross-sectional area of the beam, the beam’s strength in withstanding a longitudinal pull should be proportional to its cross-sectional area. If a supported beam is subject to a transverse force, however, the associated torque must be balanced by the first moment of the stress in the fibers, which introduces an additional factor of the diameter of the beam.9 Thus the beam’s strength in withstanding a transverse force should be proportional to its diameter cubed. If the beam is made longer, the torque due to the same transverse force applied at a geometrically similar position is proportionately greater and the beam is proportionately weaker, and so forth. Then follows Galileo’s very famous observations on why animals cannot be simply scaled up, but rather their bones must become proportionately thicker as they get larger.  </p>
