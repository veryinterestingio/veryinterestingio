<p>spiders eat other spiders and wasps</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of my period of quarantine in the Amazon. Where I and a half dozen other unfortunates had nothing to watch but the bristling leviathan tarantula bunched up on the rotting, flimsy thatch perhaps eight feet above our faces. </p>
<p>Spiders the size of your fist, their fangs glistening with venom and their thousand-fold black eyes shining dully in the gloom. In the darkness you would hear the sudden anguished hiss of a spider being struck by an adult leopard wasp and in their mortal struggle they would plummet to oneâ€™s bed still biting and stinging and thrashing. Did you know that you can smoke a hornet?</p></div>		</li>
