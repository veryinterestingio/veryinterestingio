<p>From photography point of view, the light from the mirrors might be too bright compared to the surrounding area and overexposed the shot. However this is 80s and not sure what kind of sensor/film was being used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Landsat uses what are known as a push-broom sensors where the image is scanned across a linear array of solid-state light sensors comprising thousands of elements for each spectral band.</p>
<p>There were US satellites still using film in 1980 but they were military spy satellites. Their film had a very high dynamic range so could handle extremes of contrast but the brightness range in this case could be a bit too extreme to avoid blowing the highlights.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure that a massive mirror would simply be white unless the camera was super high tech and could correct for any exposure problems. I live in Denver, and someone up in the foothills has a huge mirror facing the city and when the sun comes up, all you can see is a blinding white light like what's in this pic. </p></div>		</li>
