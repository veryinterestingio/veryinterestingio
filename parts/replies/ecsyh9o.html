			<div class="markdown"><p>The recipients health insurance (almost always Medicare in the US) pays all related medical bills. Yes, you can give to someone you don’t know. Donating to a stranger is an amazing opportunity that can open up a long chain of donations for people waiting for the right matches to fall into place. My own non-directed donation opened up an additional 6 donations. Kidney, liver, and bone marrow can all be donated from a living donor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I donated a kidney, the recipient’s insurance (in this case it was Medicaid or Medicare) covered the cost of all the pre-donation tests and evaluation in addition to the surgical costs and any postoperative costs related to the donation for up to 2 years.  I’ve been living with 1 kidney for a year and haven’t noticed any change in the quality of life. It was such an easy thing for me to do which had such a significant impact on the recipient’s quality of life that I would recommend it to anyone.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi there. I’m assuming you live in the United States given your question about medical bills. I’m actually not sure; my partner works under a universal healthcare system so the state generally pays for both the donor and recipient’s surgeries.</p>
<p>As for your other questions, you can give a kidney or part of your liver during a live donation, and they can absolutely be donated to someone you don’t know. It’s called altruistic donation and is similar to how one might give blood to an unspecified future recipient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been somewhat interested. I have type O blood. I've never been sure if that helps with finding a match, but thought it might. If there were little to no downsides (outside of the actual surgery), I had thought it would be something kind I could do for someone at some point.</p>
<p>Other than what you mentioned is there any other downside? Long term effects? Will my other kidney have to do double work? Would it limit my diet at all?</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for the responses! I appreciate the information!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not like you have a “spare” kidney. You need them both to function optimally, but most people can survive on one alone. Kidneys are rather fragile organs and can be injured if your body is struggling for some reason. The thing is, if you one day have a problem with the one because it is doing the work of two you might be screwed. Sometimes you have to take medication that was developed with 2 functioning kidneys in mind or simply getting old can reduce renal function. Dialysis is a bandaid solution that can be very uncomfortable. Kidney donation is not without risks and should not be taken lightly. All surgery comes with inherent risks of complications from anesthesia, risk of bleeding, blood clots, infection even though they take great precaution against it, could kill you. IMO living donors are saints who take on great risk for the life of another. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi there. Blood type does play a role, and having type O blood does increase your odds of being able to donate to someone else. However, a donor and a respective recipient must also be tissue typed to make sure their kidneys are a match. Without this, the recipient’s antibodies would immediately recognize the new kidney as foreign, resulting in rejection. This is actually the more important of the two tests in recent years, as several treatments have been developed to allow for mismatched blood type donations.</p>
<p>Your other kidney will have to work harder to compensate, but a healthy kidney is fully capable of compensating with minimal-to-no deleterious effects. There’s research indicating that having one kidney (medically known as solitary kidney) may increase your chances of high blood pressure later in life, but most people live normal, healthy lives with no dietary restrictions. <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/kidney-disease/solitary-kidney" target="_blank">The NIH</a> states as much, though I’d need to look around for a primary source other than what they link on their site.</p>
<p>*Edit: In response to a few other comments I’ve seen on this thread. Your risk of complications due to something that affects one of your kidney (like physical injury or an infection) is higher if you only have one kidney, but your chances of receiving an injury or infection itself is no higher than the general population.</p></div>		</li>
