			<div class="markdown"><p>To just underline this, cellulose can be made into a plastic-like material, cellophane. Cellophane is used and is commercially available. However, the choice of the polymer for a particular application depends on various factors like price, processability and properties. For cellophane, water permeability is high, which precludes it from being used in many common applications. For example, you couldn't make freezer bags out of cellophane, because moisture would seep through and frost the product over with ice. This is a problem that is hard to fix, because it's caused by the hydroxyl groups of cellulose, which are an essential part of its chemical structure.</p>
<p>Derivatives where the hydroxyls have been blocked off also have their markets. Cellulose acetate is widely used as a plastic for making things like eyeglass frames, playing cards and cigarette filters. Alkylated derivatives aren't used as plastics, but as lubricants, coagulants and additives in applications like foods, paper, and construction chemicals.</p></div>		</li>
