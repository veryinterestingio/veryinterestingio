Customers preferred to hear a heavy <em>thunk</em> as it implied heavy materials and quality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many industrial tools are far quieter than tools sold at your local hardware store. Most noise in industry is not from the big tools, but all the air powered tools, impact tools, and parts banging into each other.</p>
<p>Sauce? I work with big industrial tools. You can stand next to them while they run, and have normal volume conversations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Early on after the Berlin wall went up, houses were removed all along the wall to make an inspection and security road.</p>
<p>The was surprised when they saw the East Germans digging and installing a main communications line down the edge of that road.</p>
<p>After that comment line bundle was installed, the west dug a tunnel to it, and put recorders on all of the lines, which then identified the important lines during military exercises in the East.</p>
<p>The first time it snowed, observers saw that due to the warmth of the spy-room they had set up underground, that spot was the only place where no snow would build up, and it stuck out like a sore thimb.</p>
<p>They immediately shut down the room heater, and waited a couple days before starting operations up again, this time with air conditioners and parkas.</p></div>		</li>
