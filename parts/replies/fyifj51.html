			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course. Viral load is basically a determination of how much virus is in a given sample at a given time of reading. For example, I test how much virus you have right now in a sample from up in your nose - that will tell us your viral load. The viral dose on the other hand would be the amount of virus that you are first given that leads to infection or not. Imagine here how much virus you breathed in when I sneezed on you last week.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, does this mean that at initial onset the viral load and dose are the same? </p>
<p>You sneezed on me, my doze is now also my current viral load. One diminishes with time or increases with additional exposure, the other is constant. Am I understanding that correctly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With regards to question 2, the fact that medical workers have a much higher CFR than the general population is strongly suggestive of the inoculatory dose correlates with disease severity. The absence of evidence of any significant surface transmission also supports this theory. I've also come across one or two anecdotes that to me suggested the inoculatory dose one can receive from a surface is too low to make one ill. Surface transmission is theorized to be responsible for China's most recent outbreak, which is supported by phylogenic analysis, so even if it doesn't make one very ill it can still cause outbreaks because they could infect others. </p>
<p>More study is desperately needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is very likely! As I said in my comment I think it has been shown for most viruses that the size of the dose directly related to the severity, with few exceptions. That evidence from health care workers seems to support this. The other possibility is that repeat exposure is occurring in this case which somehow affects outcome too. Without discreet studies however the jury is still out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yet another possibility is simultaneous infection by multiple mutations of SARS2. There was a study published quite recently suggesting as much. So much about this virus we still donâ€™t know...</p></div>		</li>
