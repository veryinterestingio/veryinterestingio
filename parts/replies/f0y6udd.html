			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: Duct tape was originally called duck tape. It was originally made by applying adhesive to duck cloth. Hence &quot;duck&quot;. The name &quot;duct tape&quot; only dates to 1965 after it had come into widespread use on air ducts. So it wasn't specifically designed to stick to metal ducts, but rather for all purpose reinforcement including metal stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The adhesive doesn't really stick to the tape, it sticks to the primer material that's stuck to the adhesive side of the tape. They spray or roll on a chemical that will stick to the tape material, and then apply the adhesive to that. So when you unroll the tape, the adhesive stays on the sticky side.</p></div>		</li>
