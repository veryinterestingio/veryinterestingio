			<div class="markdown"><p>An individual launch produces a whole lot more greenhouse gases than your car commuting to work, of course, but they are rare enough that they don't have a significant impact on global warming.</p>
<p>That said, there is some concern for the future impact of rocket launches, should they become much more common.  The effects are rather complicated, and can be either warming or cooling, depending on the type of exhaust the rocket emits.  There may also be impacts on the ozone layer.  One problem here is that many previous studies were based on Space Shuttle-type rockets that use solid rocket boosters that produce a lot of smoke, but it looks like future rockets will burn mainly liquid fuels, whose environmental impact is different -- and probably better in many respects.</p>
<p>To sum up: no big deal right now, but if we start launching a hundred rockets a day, it's a different story.</p>
