			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing to keep in mind is caffeine can be a strong appetite suppressant. Often when I feel like this I’ll realize I haven’t eaten in too long. Better to drink coffee after eating. </p>
<p>Also reprieve from withdrawal can be a big part of the waking up feeling in the morning for frequent coffee drinkers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Black coffee does have some benefits to it, but I'd say the biggest plus is that it contains so little calories that it won't break your fast. Check out intermittent fasting or time restricted feeding if you're interested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Stimulants are basically another world for ADHD. My ADHD specialist is even tolerant of me using nicotine spray, just cause it fills the gap on bad med days. It's like &quot;Well, normally this is bad, but if nothing else works, then it's better than nothing.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that's generally true, but also ADHD is a complex phenomenon and the logic
if stimulants = mellow then ADHD;
definitely more true than
if stimulants = jitters then NOT ADHD
which is all beside the fact that caffeine and amphetamines/ritalin are very different drugs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why a lot of &quot;energy blends&quot; in soft drinks are a mix of caffeine to suppress the tiredness, niacin to increase blood flow, and B vitamins (6 and 12 generally) to increase metabolism of amino acids. This combination is meant to make you feel less tired</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Based on this, is it possible to figure out when is the right/optimal time to drink coffee(intake caffeine)?</p>
<p>So as not to do it too late and lose the entire point of drinking it?</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JoushMark" target="_blank">JoushMark</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, to wake up, with breakfast. The mild stimulant helps you shake off the dust in the morning while your blood sugar is stabilized by a light meal. The worst time would be when your blood sugar is low, you've already had some and you've been awake too long, as the extra caffeine isn't really useful to keep you awake but does make the side effects worse and it can't fix the fatigue products in your blood or increase your blood sugar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But try not to drink caffeine at least one hour after waking up. There are hormonal processes in the body that supposed to wake you up naturally over the course of the morning. Drinking caffeine too early blunts this process and is a good way to become dependent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Turkey we drink coffee right after breakfast and other meals as it helps with digestion. Breakfast literally means “under coffee”. You eat first so that you can drink coffee without hurting your stomach or getting indigestion due to caffeine or ruin your appetite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're drinking it because you're tired the best approach is to drink a mug of coffee, then take a 15-20 minute nap.  Caffeine takes about 15 min to kick-in so doing it that way you get a bit refreshed from the nap, and the caffeine kicks in after that kind of locking you into that more alert state.</p>
<p>Without the nap you're effectively locked in at the already tired state.</p></div>		</li>
