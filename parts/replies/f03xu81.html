			<div class="markdown"><p>There are ND filters for moon observation. Have you ever looked at the moon with a 150mm or larger aperture scope? Even after your pupils are undilated it's really bright and unpleasant to look at for a longer period.</p>
<p>But yes, there are other types of filters aimed at enhancing the details of the moon that aren't ND filters as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the size of the telescope and thus how much light it is gathering. I used an 8-inch telescope without a filter one time. It hurt. I had trouble with my vision in that one eye for months. I felt something was “off” for a couple years afterwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd recommend seeing an opthalmologist. If you did do a little damage, you've opened up yourself to a higher chance of weird vessel growth in the future and that's something you'll really want to monitor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I almost did it with an 18 inch telescope.  Fortunately I've had many eye exams since then and no sign of any issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's odd. I've looked at the moon through my 8 inch dob without a filter a bunch of times, and it's never had any long-term effects (that I've noticed anyway). I mean, it did hurt after staring for a bit and it threw my seeing off for a couple moments after I stopped looking, but nothing major.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I managed to almost do it but it required looking through an 18 inch refracting telescope. We were taking turns looking at different objects in the sky and decided to take a look at the moon. Since it was direct vision observing I was getting some pretty concentrated moonlight right into my eye, plus I was taking my time examining the surface. When I looked away I had a strong purple/green image of the moon flashing away in my retina for a good 15 minutes or so. I almost thought I'd damaged it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's cheating. If you look at anything with a big enough telescope it could do damage.</p></div>		</li>
