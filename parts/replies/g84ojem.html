			<div class="markdown"><p>Question: when you have a shortcut for a long phrase, e.g. &quot;ladies and gentlemen of the jury&quot; or &quot;may it please the court&quot; or whatever (I don't actually know what lawyers say commonly), do you have to wait until they've finished saying the whole thing to transcribe it, or do you transcribe the shortcut immediately?</p>
<p>And, if the latter, what happens if they get cut off, or they don't actually say that? Do you have to go back and correct it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes I anticipate what they're going to say, like in a deposition attorneys will often say &quot;after the accident&quot;.  So, if I anticipate that, I'll write it and then erase it and fix it if it turns out to be &quot;after your accident&quot; instead.  But I'll usually wait a beat to make sure and then write out the brief and catch up with what they're saying pretty quickly.</p>
<p>It's hard to gauge because it feels like it's all simultaneous since it's happening so fast. but some days I have time to fix my mistakes if there are breaks in the questioning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am always amazed that someone figured this out and made the theory(s). I still run into things that twist my fingers though, after 12+ years on the job, and then I fix it, and I guess that's kinda like writing the theory right?</p></div>		</li>
