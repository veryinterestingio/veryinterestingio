<p>That's probably the same as if you were imitating his voice outloud. So it's still &quot;your voice&quot; it's just how you would try to imitate his voice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Language is integral to how our brains function. It is the device driver for memory, abstract thought and self awareness. If someone fails to learn language, because they are deaf or other reasons, they will be significantly handicapped mentally until they learn a language, even though there is nothing wrong with their brain. If they do learn language late in life they will still have some learning problems.</p>
<p>Someone who is completely deaf and is forced to only learn spoken language will only be slightly better off than someone who didn't learn language. This is because the spoken language is too abstract for the deaf person and they never develop and inner voice which is necessary for the brain to process information. </p>
<p>We know this because in the 1880s it was decided that deaf people should only learn spoken language and they weren't allowed to sign. This is why deaf people were thought to be mentally handicapped until pretty recently.</p></div>		</li>
