			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the oil getting the tar off. It the petroleum distillates in the WD-40 dissolving the butyl rubber adhesive. I don't know where everyone got the notion wd 40 was simply mineral oil. It is oil mixed with petroleum solvents. The solvents clean up still and the oil helps temporary lubricate it. that's why wd-40 doesn't prevent rust long-term. No safer that mineral spirits or acetone. </p></div>		</li>
