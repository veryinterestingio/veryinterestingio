			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm...Honestly, I think the skills and experience you bring to an employer are more important than the degree. But since you asked, I'd recommend getting a bachelor of science in a field that you find interesting and will make you employable directly after college. I'm partial to chemistry and geology because they both can have an environmental focus and can land you a job. You could always tack on a minor in ecology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a degree in environmental science and I work as a chemist in a lab right now, and while I love lab work I would love to do something more field work oriented like this. Any advice on how to make a transition into that line of work?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>â€” first of all thank you for doing what you doing. Hope more opportunities will be open soon so we all can help the planet in some way or another.
I know you said bachelor of science (in any field), I am taking b.a in psychology, will it be useful?</p></div>		</li>
