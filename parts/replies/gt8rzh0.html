			<div class="markdown"><p>If the hole gets too small, (on the order of \~5-10 wavelengths) light starts to stop acting like a particle (ray interpretation of light), and starts acting light a wave. This is where you get diffraction effects.  the smaller the hole the better, until diffraction starts to cause problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not about the light waves interfering, just that if they are coming into the pupil from different directions, from a range of angles, they will leave the pupil at the same range of angles, and end up blurred on the retina if the lens isn't adequately focusing them. Any hole (aperture) smaller than the pupil will reduce the range of angles coming in, and thus leaving the opening, so they can't spread out as much before hitting the retina, resulting in less blur. If you make the aperture too small, you actually do get light waves interfering with each other, and you get diffraction patterns, reducing sharpness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What matters is that the hole filters out light that reach <em>some</em> of your light receptors.</p>
<p>Remember that in general, a source emits light in all directions. Light rays which reach cells of your eye are focused and read out by your light receptors.</p>
<p>So even if a small part of your eye is obstructed it immediately start removing light that would produce blur.</p>
<p>You do it all the time by squinting! And short-sighted people even more often.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hm... then were early monocles empty rings that people placed around their eye to block the excess surrounding light? To the Wikipedia!</p>
<p>Update: I learned a lot of random stuff about monocles which I will forget by afternoon, and have not answered my question in the slightest.
But hey, did you know corrective/magnifying lenses date back to ancient Egypt (5th century BC) and Ancient Rome (1st century AD) but then were essentially totally forgotten about until the 13th century?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're looking in the wrong direction: this effect needs a teeny hole, so it's not really the most practically useful (and people figured out the basic idea of lenses before the pinhole effect was widely known, as you discovered).</p>
<p>A fun, more relevant rabbit hole would be to look into pinholes and their role in camera development - a lot of early understanding of how to create photography, etc. came from lookin at pinholes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A pinhole needs to be tiny, like the size of a pinhead obviously. If you had a monocle like that, it would need to be like a disc of metal with a tiny hole in it and would need to be positioned perfectly in front of the eye, which would have the side effect of extreme tunnel vision.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This is true, and such discs are used as rear sights for precision target shooting. They're called diopter sights, and they work very well. The combination of forcing consistent eye alignment, focusing light due to the pinhole, and causing tunnel vision (AKA removing distractions) makes for an excellent sighting system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems for me text gets bigger as well. Is this because that there is a deviation formed when I make the hole smaller?</p>
<p>Like:</p>

....\| | |/           </p>
<p>Light with bigger hole:<br />
.....| | |<br />
