			<div class="markdown"><p>Hijacking top answer to add that, a long time ago Microsoft said that a lot of crashes for past Windowses was down to drivers, in fact mostly video card drivers. Video card drivers that don't implement the functionality the same as the game expects -- say, between AMD and NVIDIA, or even between versions — may cause the game to hit something it doesn't expect, and then crash. This is why when you run a game from Steam it may download a very specific version of DirectX, but that doesn't guarantee the game runs the exact same way.</p>
<p>Not having the hardware differ and having all the drivers written by one company -- Apple or Google, or whoever made the hardware -- means there are no or few bugs due to driver differences. The &quot;drivers&quot; may only update when you update your phone.</p>
<p>[Edit]</p>
<p>Adding, as others have said, that this really remains the leading cause of crashes in Windows and most games. Video card drivers have gotten ridiculously complicated to the point where they now manipulate the commands issued to the video card. For example, NVIDIA may supply their own shaders instead of the ones that come with a game. Or the driver may re-order the draw calls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Third party drivers are the overwhelming reason for XP and later windows crashes. It wouldn’t shock me if graphics were the pinnacle of them. This is why they’ve been moving them to userland the best you can.</p>

<p>“Previous drivers were fully implemented in kernel mode, whereas WDDM is implemented partly in user mode. If the user mode area fails with an unrecoverable error, it will, at the most, cause the application to quit unexpectedly instead of producing a blue screen error as it would in previous driver models.”</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I’m wrong but Vista was the OS that moved drivers out of kernel mode. Video card drivers can still take down the OS but it’s harder.</p>
<p>And yes, I read several times that internal reports showed video card drivers as being the leading cause of preventable crashes. It’s harder to do anything about, say, faulty memory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Drivers are still causing me issues. The Dell Latitude e7470 would have the Realtek audio driver crash causing a BSOD error when connected to an e-dock. There's an update from 1/29 that fixes it, but it was a problem for about 4 months before a fix was released. I had to just downgrade the driver in the meantime. </p></div>		</li>

Without root, SELinux completely jails the process to it's own data files only and access to the SD card with permission. Root level security flaws are rare and get removed from Google Play pretty quickly once discovered.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Rooting your phone requires enough mental competence to follow a series of written instructions (or sometimes a video). It emphatically <em>does not</em> require you to understand what you're doing, though a decent number probably Dunning-Kruger themselves into thinking they do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. It is a system designed on trust, and acknowledging that the user is usually the least trustworthy or secure component in a walled garden system. </p>
<p>Put simply, you are why you get viruses. Even if the operating system and software was extremely buggy, by preventing you from seeing or touching those things, from being unable to change things, or to write your own software or Config files without significant hoops like needing a different device for the privilege, there just isn’t that much a user can do to break things.</p>
<p>Take away a user’s ability to plug in random hardware, limit their apps if not prevent them from installing anything you don’t want, from being able to open most downloaded files, from even seeing what the file system looks like, take away 90% of the settings menu and the ability to see what is happening on the device and it too will not get viruses.</p></div>		</li>
