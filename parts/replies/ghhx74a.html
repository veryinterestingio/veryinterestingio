			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. A lot of the money is also just going into the net worth of billionaires. Stocks and other securities have been rocketing up. That money isn't getting into the economy, essentially. It's just going into brokerage accounts. If the rich ever start spending it, then that would have an effect on inflation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has funnelled a lot of money into equities, yes, but it's unfair to say that the money is inactive once in the stock market. Companies use that money to invest in new technologies, facilities and jobs. This is an explicit objective of a zero interest rate policy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that only applies if the companies themselves are selling the stock, right? If you use a brokerage and just buy stocks from other brokerages/users, that isn't money that is going to the company unless they choose to sell additional stock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest problem is that the rich try very hard to lower the amount of spending they do. When they do aquire things it's new investment to boost portfolios, which oftentimes aren't startup ventures so it's just rich money moving around or real estate which props up property values lowering the amount poorer people can spend on consumer goods as rents increase. </p>
<p>Honestly the biggest sink is venture capital, but they can't make up for the massive wage decreases and tax declines we have (governments great at spending and it actually works to boost economies no matter what the dipshit Republicans say.) </p>
<p>Trickle down economics is the dumbest system. Poor people are morons to keep voting conservative. </p>
<p>Helps me out though.</p></div>		</li>
