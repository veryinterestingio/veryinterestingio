			<div class="markdown"><p>What is this sensation, I'm unfamiliar with the expression? (like what does it feel like)?</p>
<p>Is it the same as shin splints</p>
<p>Edit: it appears it's what I've always been told is a stomach cramp</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh no definitely not shin splints. It's a sharp cramp in your side that can make it hard to take a deep breath or continue with your current activity. I imagine it's what it would feel like to get stabbed with a knife. In some cases it feels like an extremely hard pinch.</p></div>		</li>
