<p>Respectfully, this is inaccurate. A Martian &quot;day&quot; (called a Sol) is close to the same length as Earth -- only about 40 minutes longer. The equatorial speed is a function of rotation rate <em>and</em> planetary radius. The rotation rate on Mars is close enough to the same, but the planetary radius is about half of Earth's radius.</p>
<p>It's like swinging a pencil by the eraser. If you swing the pencil in a 90ยบ arc, the pencil tip moves faster as a function of pencil length. </p>
<p>Wind is created on Earth by pressure differences, that in turn are caused by the unequal distribution of heat. If we slow the Earth's rotation, the temperature differences become <em>more</em> significant, not less. Imagine the alternative scenario -- if our planet had only 1 min day/night cycles. The planet wouldn't have much time to heat or cool, and temperatures would be more uniform. Faster rotation results in <em>less</em> heat differential, not <em>more</em>.</p>
<p>The decreased equatorial speed on Mars doesn't much affect its heating/cooling cycles, but it <em>massively</em> affects the Coriolis forces present. </p>
<p>The Coriolis effect occurs because &quot;still&quot; air at different latitudes is traveling at different speeds. On the equator (on Earth), &quot;still&quot; air is traveling 25,000 miles East every 24 hours. At the poles, &quot;still&quot; air has no eastward momentum. It's a bit like <a href="https://external-preview.redd.it/OY7xRuBBRkx8JFrjYoh3PswM2VMBDHBv4oXbpIEcB3Q.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=1a12316259fdfd314d4060f44f30260735741da5" target="_blank">this comic</a>. I'm not spending much time here explaining the Coriolis Effect because it is a bit tricky. We're just going to say it exists and leave it at that.</p>
<p>The faster air moves on the equator, the more pronounced the Coriolis forces will be. The Coriolis effect is the primary cause of wind effects like the Jet Stream, Polar Vortices, and other East-West movements of air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well. Rotational speed is one of those engines that powers the earths weather, giving rise to the equatorial eastern tradewinds, the 30-60 degree westerlies (like the roaring 40s and furious 50s).</p>
<p>Even if mars had an atmosphere as thick as earth, those winds would only be about 25% as energetic (so instead of roaring 40s we'd have the &quot;mild breeze 40s&quot;), and the effect is decreased even further due to the thin atmosphere.</p>
<p>As a result, even though the winds are fast on mars they barely have the energy to make a tent flutter.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's <em>angular velocity</em>, though - not <em>tangential speed</em>. The Coriolis force is:</p>
<p>F = -2 (mass) (angular velocity X speed of object relative to frame)</p>
<p>Note that only depends on angular velocity (how many rotations per day), not tangential speed or planetary radius or distance from the rotation axis, so...</p>
<blockquote>

<p>...is incorrect. (At least based on rotation arguments, anyway.)</p></div>		</li>
