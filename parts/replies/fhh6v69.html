<p>Asteroids orbit close to the Sun and so have been heated up and modified from their origin; Oort Cloud objects were formed fairly close the Sun, but were ejected far away. Kuiper Belt Objects like Arrokoth were formed far from the Sun and so have always been cold and well preserved. -SAS</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When Jupiter and Saturn were forming at the very beginning of the solar system, they actually made a migration into the inner solar system, possibly wiping ‘super-Earth’ planets that were forming at the time out of existence, and ejecting lots of asteroids accreted around the Sun into the outer solar system. This is known as the ‘Grand Tack’ hypothesis. These asteroids’ orbits then get modified over millions of years into circular orbits. Sometimes they make their way back into the in or solar system when Neptune gives them a gravitational kick. Hope this helps!</p></div>		</li>
