			<div class="markdown"><p>To add onto what you are saying  the reason why fries can become greasy is the way deep frying works.</p>
<p>Oil can become very hot. Water can too, but compared to oil, it's reletively cool. Water boils away at 100C, or 212F. Compare that to oil. Canola oil begins to smoke at around 200C, or 400F. When water is at atmospheric pressure it is incapable of getting hotter than its boiling point.</p>
<p>When you put your cut potatoes into the hot oil, the water in them heats up extremely quickly. The surface water instantly starts boiling, which is what causes the oil to bubble. What you're seeing is the steam attempting to escape, both the potato and then the water. As it continues to cook, more and more water will escape, which allows the <del>Millard</del> maillard reaction to occur, which is when the outer portion crisps up because of no water.</p>
<p>However if you are cooking at too low of a temperature, the water can't boil away fast enough. The boiling water helps to keep oil out of the food. So, since oil is entering, the fry becomes oil filled. And you can definitely tell.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Tip from a cook. Certain things can be soaked in water, like potatoes, to help it crisp up. Works real well. Try it with all sorts of things you're crisping up, like meat skin or fat, fried starchy foods, and more than I don't even know of.</p>
<p>Google it cause, I'm not as smart as our AI overlord. </p></div>		</li>
