			<div class="markdown"><p>Porn doesn't really have that many viruses in it.  They have a vested interest in securing their own servers (so outside attackers have a hard time piggybacking) and they prefer to show you ads or have a subscription, both require people to come back over time - you won't if your system sucks because they dumped a lot of malware on you.</p>
<p>Ironically, the more virus-prone website tend to be pages for religious organizations.  This is primarily because they typically have a volunteer running their page and don't allocate resources for security.  Their pages are typically easy to hack and add piggybacking maleware or viruses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Traditional advertisers don't advertise on porn sites. Even the most mainstream of pornhub is all &quot;sexiest video game&quot; or &quot;grow your dick 5 inches now!&quot; shit. The ad servers can install drive by malware just by being on the page and can really fuck you up if you actually click on them. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Not sure I know many apps that do this, it'd be a crap business model. Apps that harvest data are usually free, because it allows them access to a greater amount of users.</p></div>		</li>
