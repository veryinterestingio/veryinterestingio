			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. First does gives 0-70%, while second does only gives 70%-95%. More first dieses should be prioritized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The benefit depends on the age though</p>
<p>bringing a bunch of 80 year olds from 70 &gt; 95 might save more lives than bringing a bunch of 20's from 0 --&gt; 70</p>
<p>but then there is the overarching point of increased herd immunity from 1st dose and the detriment to keeping society locked up... just to illustrate it's not that straightforward.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But based on the actual study in The Lancet, that isn’t the case?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In participants who received two standard doses, efficacy against primary symptomatic COVID-19 was consistent in both the UK (60·3% efficacy) and Brazil (64·2% efficacy), indicating these results are generalisable across two diverse settings with different timings for the booster dose (with most participants in the UK receiving the booster dose more than 12 weeks after the first dose and most participants in Brazil receiving their second dose within 6 weeks of the first). Exploratory subgroup analyses included at the request of reviewers and editors also showed no significant difference in efficacy estimates when comparing those with a short time window between doses (&lt;6 weeks) and those with longer (≥6 weeks), although further detailed exploration of the timing of doses might be warranted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, the mixed messages and confusion around all of this has brought me to a point where I don’t know who or what to believe anymore. If I read too much, I just get different answers to the same questions and stress myself out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The statement above and the text of the article you linked both confirm that delaying the 2nd dose should have little to no impact on efficacy. Nothing to stress about. :)</p></div>		</li>
