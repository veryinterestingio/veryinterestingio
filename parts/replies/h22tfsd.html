			<div class="markdown"><p>Many of the replies here are great and informative. This one, Medicalmysterytour, is excellent. I know about all the conditions listed above bar lipodystrophy! So interesting to read about that. My initial guess would have been visceral fat and increased fat excretion via urine and stool but wasn't sure about the rest. Clearly it would be a colossally stupid thing to do for various reasons but atheroma and fatty liver which could lead to cirrhosis and complications of the heart would super dangerous. I have a very inquisitive mind and a semi decent medical/physiological/anatomical knowledge but sometimes my daft questions far outweigh my knowledge 🤣 Thanks again for the reply and educating me further 😃👍</p></div>		</li>
