			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I'd imagine it's hard to pull a 24hr shift when a couple hours out of the day are spent napping, and a couple more spent downing doppios haha.</p>
<p>I kid though, I greatly respect the laid back enjoyment of life Italians have.</p>
<p>I knew a guy who worked in some office in Japan for a couple years and it burned him out. Long hours, high pressure, no breaks, high expectations to drink after work with the bosses. It drove him crazy he said and was going to have a mental breakdown. He Googled where in the world had the most laid back working lifestyle and Italy regularly topped the list. Went from the biggest stressful office experience to one of the chillest. He said it was <em>too</em> laid back in Italy though and he couldn't adjust to that either. Ended up going to China later, which is a weird combination of both.</p></div>		</li>
