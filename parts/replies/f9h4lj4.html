			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry in advance maybe a silly question, but why are C-H bonds not easy to break? What about CH4 and C2H2, for example? They can burn easily and break down. Again, itâ€™s been a very long time since I dealt with chemistry in school, probably Iâ€™m missing something.</p>
<p>Edit: clarification.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Loosely speaking, breaking that bond is what allows it to burn. Both the carbon and the hydrogen can be oxidized, in our atmosphere oxygen does the oxidizing, but fluorine would also allow them to burn. Now I want to see random garbage exposed to an atmosphere of pure fluorine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The simple way to think about it is in terms of cazyness and neediness. How needy is the element? Hydrogen is EXTREMELY needy. Because it only has 1 electron in it's outer shell (or at all for that matter). It wants to have 8 to play with but it has 1. This makes it CRAZY NEEDY, so needy that it will explode, that's the crazy part. Carbon has 4 electrons in it's outer shell but wants 8 so it's really pretty need but not crazy. It will bond with pretty stable things but hydrogen is so crazy needy that when it contacts carbon, carbon looks like a handsome guy with a good job and married parents, Hydrogen grabs on for dear life and won't let go. The general idea is that the less stable the two elements are alone, the more stable they are together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would hydrogen want 8 electrons? It's ring only has room for two, of which one is already filled. Hydrogen isn't very needy at all.  If you want crazy needy  elements, go look at things like the halogens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hydrogen and Carbon are equally needy, as both outer shells are 1/2 full. First shell only fits two electrons ðŸ˜œ</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The strength of a bond can be thought of as the amount of energy required to break it. By subjecting the bond to fire ( a shit ton of heat energy) you can break the bond. Weaker bonds, like ionic bonds (salt for example) will break apart just from the relatively weak electrostatic force of water molecules.</p></div>		</li>
