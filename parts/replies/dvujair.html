			<div class="markdown"><p>This as well! Messing up your sleep cycle without good reason is dumb. I have all kinds of minor sleep disorders, and letting myself oversleep is the number one way to feel like 💩 for a week due to this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean my sleep schedule is beyond fucked. Because of only getting 4.5-6 hours every night during the week I use Saturday morning to &quot;recharge&quot; and get 10+ hours. If I miss the sleep in Saturday I start to loose my mind a bit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I struggle with this all the time I have extremely low energy and can honestly sleep for up to 16 hours a day sometimes (mostly it’s around 11 or 12) and it’s exhausting. Whenever I’ve tried to keep a sleep schedule it only works for a while then messes up again. Is there a way to get out of this when you’re stuck in it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just slept 12 hours, it's 2PM, and I would probably feel better if I dodn't sleep at all. Am interested in an answer too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First of all, get your butt to a doctor if you haven't already. So many readily (and cheaply) fixable things cause that kind of exhaustion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah I have 4 different vitamin deficiencies because I don’t eat. Probably should have said I’m really depressed and basically don’t leave my bed at all unless I have to. I know this is the problem I was looking more for a way to reset your clock but I guess there’s no way to fix that without fixing the other stuff which I can’t so :/</p></div>		</li>
