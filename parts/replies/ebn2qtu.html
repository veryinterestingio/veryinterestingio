<p>this is more like waste removal than what humans think of as burial.</p>

<p>I wonder if we just made a ritual out of what was then once waist removal. The benefits of burying a body that far out way what we tie onto it emotionally and/or spiritually. Dead bodies stink, spread disease and can attract animals and dangerous predictors. Making it an important ritual would make it more palatable than just putting someone someone in the dirt for the colony's benefit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think there's really much evidence for burial-as-waste-removal preceeding burial-as-ritual, like you'd expect if that was the case.  Burial predates settled societies, and you can more easily avoid the issues associated with dead bodies in society of small, temporary encampments by either dumping the body some distance away (or leaving it where the individual died) or just moving camp.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>But they must have had a reason to dispose of dead bodies before they came up with the idea of burying them. The concept of burial is pretty wide spread and I doubt it came from a common source. I'm suggesting the necessity was there before the ritual.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Don't want to know how that guy died, it might be dangerous! Best to just bury him underground and forget about it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Human burial is actually also just waste removal.<br />
Those humans who left their dead rotting likely didn’t survive natural selection as it attracts predators and diseases.<br />
Burning corpses wasn't a solution either, the amount of wood required is too high and you'd still be left with juicy bits.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;confrontational scavenger&quot; theory works well with this idea. For most other species, it's OK to let predators eat the dead; for us, who are smaller than predators but (hypothetically, early in our evolutionary history) made a living by beating them up and taking their kills, it was vitally important never to let them get a taste of us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting. If you study the amount of human deaths caused by wolves you’ll find that France far outnumbers all other countries in wolf-human conflicts. Mostly because hundreds of years ago they weren’t consistently burying their dead and wolves learned to prey on humans after getting a taste. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's never *just* waste removal. Humans typically bury people with important objects that have value to them, which is the opposite of waste. They're burying not just the person, but also taking out of use items that have a lot of use to living people.</p></div>		</li>
