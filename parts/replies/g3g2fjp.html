			<div class="markdown"><p>it's usually 0 degrees. It's good practice to leave 2 to 3 times more chain lenght than the depth of the water, so that the weight of the chain also serves to maintain the ship in position.
So from the boat you see a 45 degrees approx until it reaches the sea floor, and then it crawls on the seabed until the anchor.
This is how we do it in sailing vessels of small and medium sizes at leats.

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would all depend on how deep the water is. Less is better but the deeper you are the longer rope you need for a smaller angle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a very complex question, as the anchor is embedded deep beneath the seabed. At the anchor shackle (in the ground), the angle is typically around 30 degrees up from horizontal, however the chain or wire will then curve so that it's actually at a 0 degree angle at the seabed, pulling completely horizontally. The mooring chain/wore typically has a few thousand feet of &quot;grounded length&quot; before lifting off the seafloor towards the rig. This is because the mooring chains/wires are extremely heavy, and often 10,000 feet+ long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if you need to stop suddenly at a spot where it's like 30k feet, are you screwed, do they make anchors for those depths, or do people generally just avoid those areas?</p></div>		</li>
