			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question. I don't have the answer to this. But if I were to guess, I might think that airlines along with other tourism businesses, will look to stimulate demand with pricing as well as other strategies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because there's no hard ending to the crisis, I'd suspect that there's not going to be a sudden &quot;run on the airlines&quot; that would cause prices to skyrocket. People are probably going to be wary of airplanes for a while.</p></div>		</li>
