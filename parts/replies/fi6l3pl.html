<li>The comma may introduce ambiguity (If you want to thanks 3 entities, if you don't use the Oxford comma you get &quot;To my mother, Ayn Rand and God&quot;, which is clearly a list of 3 entities, while if you use the Oxford comma you get &quot;To my mother, Ayn Rand, and God&quot; which could be interpreted as 2 entities instead of the 3 intended).</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>To me, the sentence with the Oxford comma is the one that is less confusing. The sentence without it makes it seem like your mother is both Ayn Rand and God at the same time (it reads to me like an appositive).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you could argue that the order of the entities in that list was chosen intentionally for poetic (?) reasons. They're listed in descending order of proximity to the speaker. They also have a sort of rhythm that is lost when you reorder them. Often in writing, ambiguity is accepted in exchange for something desired.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;I'd like to thank my mother, Ayn Rand, and God&quot; &lt;- makes it seem like my mother is Ayn Rand.</p>

<p>Both can be resolved with and without an oxford comma by reordering the list.</p>

<p>I've yet to see an example in a text, where there isn't enough context to solve the problem by reordering the list.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've got to upvote you because you're presenting the explanation.</p>
<p>I still think it's a bullshit explanation though. If you're not using the oxford comma to specifically break apart each entity you're doing a disservice to us all.</p>
<p>Every time I read a list without an oxford comma, I read the last two entities as a single entity and then have to re-read it to make sense of it.</p>
<p>I like apples, bananas and chocolate <em>wait, does that mean he likes apples and bananas with chocolate, or apples, bananas, and chocolate separately?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, you <em>should</em> pause at the oxford comma in the exact same way you'd use a brief pause between earlier entities in the list. Otherwise a listener (if you're reading aloud) could have the same trouble.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A comma originally was used for a pause, going back to Shakespeare where they needed to talk the actors where to pause.</p>
<p>It became more than that, and now marks a clause.  Typically a clause is also meet with a pause (and/or change of tone), but the comma doesn't mean &quot;pause&quot; anymore, and these days you'll find it <em>not</em> used in places where it once was.</p></div>		</li>
