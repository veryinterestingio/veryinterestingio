			<div class="markdown"><p>While I believe that’s true, isn’t it also true that behavior doesn’t necessarily have to produce a survival benefit?  As long as the behavior doesn’t have a negative impact on survival it can still be passed along through evolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True! Most things serve a purpose though, more than we think and things can be a byproduct of human survival. Like sport is for most a way to stay healthy or compete in the dating pool.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A good into to at least the art portion of this a Kurzgesagt video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O5kNPlUV7w" target="_blank">here</a>. As well as its sources <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/kgssourcesbeauty/startseite" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>I know Richard Dawkins has some interesting perspectives (aside from his militant atheism imo.) Especially when it comes to &quot;ideas&quot; (memes) and evolution. There are several of his lectures on youtube and he has a few books as well.</p>
<p>Something tangentially related is the work of <a href="http://www.danko-nikolic.com/practopoiesis/" target="_blank">Danko Nikolic</a> whose research I follow topically. It gets into the idea of human intelligence and adaptive artificial intelligence systems through a theory called Practopoiesis.</p>
<p>Happy reading and listening!</p></div>		</li>
