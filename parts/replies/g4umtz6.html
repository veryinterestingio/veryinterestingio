			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing charges to 100 since 2015.  What you read as 100 is actually slightly below the batter's rated voltage for exactly that reason.  Charge to a hundred all you want.  Leave it on the charge cable, the engineers know what they're doing.</p>
<p>Edit:  Yes, naysayers.  Your opinion is noted, stop sending me threatening messages.  Follow the sources, Wikipedia is actually right you'll find; anything that says I am wrong is generally, at a minimum, 8 years old.  This sort of technology does not stagnate and if you can't be bothered to stay informed, stop spreading your bullshit.</p>
<p>You're like my father who keeps telling people to check for IRQ conflicts.</p>
<p>Edit: this is well on its way to my most upvoted comment lol.</p>
<p>Yet another edit:  That Battery University article is citing sources THIRTEEN YEARS OLD.  Stop quoting ancient tech articles.  Nobody needs to check their autoexec.bat anymore either.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do they even tell people what IRQ is as a historical curiosity anymore?  It seems like it would be no more relevant to the industry today than knowing what leaded gasoline is to auto repair.  In ten years will we still be teaching about carburetors?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got a death threat once over a random post talking about how showing the willpower to get up 15 minutes earlier to scrape ice off windows is a basic requirement for continuing to keep a driver's license. If you're too lazy to do that, you should absolutely get your license revoked because you're piloting a vehicle that can kill or maim people in an instant. And <em>choosing</em> to leave your visibility limited while driving proves you aren't showing proper respect to your responsibilities for operating it.</p>
<p>Giving a modicum of anonymity emboldens the fuck out of the braindead stupid people on the Internet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, most* cordless housephones use nickle-metal hydride (hopefully correct spelling). Which is a completely different chemistry and will wear out differently to lithium.</p>
<p>It's still recommended to replace your cordless house phone batteries every two years though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Really cheap charging circuitry (and really cheap solar garden lights) will use NiCd instead of NiMH because the safe trickle charge rate is higher. </p>
<p>If your cordless landline phone said to let it charge for 12-14 hours before first use, the charger circuit was just a plain constant current at a few mA. Pretty much the dumbest, slowest, and cheapest circuit they could make.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It’s pretty smart in that it bases how much to charge the battery off of usage history.</p></div>		</li>
