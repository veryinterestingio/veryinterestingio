			<div class="markdown"><p>Really makes a lot sense! Thank you for this short explanation. But now another question arises: When the cloud rises from the bottom it expands in higher altitudes, which basically gives this mushroom shape. Why does this expansion happen? And why does it always form this particular shape?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It stars falling as it cools. But it can't fall down because rising air is still below. Hence it falls sideways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because hot air is lighter than cold air, so it goes up. As it cools, like the other guy said, it sort of &quot;falls back down&quot; to the sides, making that shape</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't really expand. The hot central gas column is rising very quickly, where it encounters the gas at the top of the mushroom that's been slowed from encountering stationary air above it. When the hot column pushes up, the top of the cloud has to 'get out of the way', so to speak, and it does that by moving sideways. It still has some upwards momentum, so the whole cloud rises, but the central part rises faster than the rest of the 'umbrella'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a line in the original Moonraker story where they pass off a nuclear explosion by &quot;spinning&quot; it as &quot;all large, hot explosions do that&quot;. </p>
<p>I always thought it was funny that it was supposed to be a lie by an intelligence agency, in a fictional story, but Flemming actually got that bit mostly right.</p></div>		</li>
