			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to open this up for non-experts... Electrons are placed around isolated atoms in &quot;atomic orbitals&quot;, which are kind of the &quot;shells&quot; you saw in chemistry class. However, a whole shell consists of multiple orbitals. Orbitals aren't necessarily circular or spherical, but can have other shapes such as double teardrops or double teardrop/torus combinations - this is important here. Now, if you combine two atoms to form a molecule, their orbitals merge to form &quot;molecular orbitals&quot; (MOs). MOs have a physical shape, such as a teardrop, but also an associated energy. Now, when a single bond forms, that means a &quot;bonding orbital&quot; called the sigma orbital forms between the atoms. This is shaped like an oblong spheroid between the atoms. However, the same orbital solution includes a higher-energy orbital, or &quot;antibonding orbital&quot;, called sigma-star. This is physically on the opposite sides of the atoms. Placing electrons in this orbital is equivalent to negating the bonding effect of the bonding orbital and breaking the bond.</p>
<p>The trick here is that you don't have to actually fill the antibonding orbital. You can just transfer a little of the electron density from another orbital, short of transferring an actual electron pair, as that would break the bond. The antibonding orbital is still an empty orbital, and transferring electron density there is energetically favorable.</p>
<p>For this to work, your donor orbital has to be physically next to the antibonding orbital. In fluoroethanol, we have a chain of the atoms <del>O-C-C-F</del> H-C-C-F (Edit: it's H, not O, donating), which is bent so that the H-C bonding orbital can donate to the C-F antibonding orbital, because they are right next to each other and aligned. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Gauche_effect_hyperconjugation.png" target="_blank">Here</a> is a diagram for the H-C-C-F case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct.  For small substituents steric repulsion is minimal so electronic effects take over.  Orbital mixing easily overcomes any dipole effects and you get a small but persistant bias in favor of the gauche conformation.  Where you don't have strongly polarized bonds, there's less effective orbital mixing (i.e., the unoccupied orbital is too high in energy) and the sterics takes over.  I would recommend looking at some of the polychlorinated natural products (recently worked on the Vanderwal ( <a href="https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/cdv/publications/" target="_blank"><a href="https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/cdv/publications/" target="_blank">https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/cdv/publications/</a></a> ) and Carreira ( <a href="https://carreira.ethz.ch/publications/recent-publications.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://carreira.ethz.ch/publications/recent-publications.html" target="_blank">https://carreira.ethz.ch/publications/recent-publications.html</a></a> ) labs (among others) for examples of how this effect works with Cl bonds as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you clarify something I misunderstood? You wrote &quot;Where you don't have strongly polarized bonds, there's less effective orbital mixing (i.e., the unoccupied orbital is too high in energy)&quot;
Don't you have greater orbital mixing with less polarized bonds because the atomic orbitals are then more similar in energy allowing for mixing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer.  The donation into the sigma star orbital by the antiperiplanar C-H bond is overall more stabilizing, overcoming the strain of the fluorine and oxygen being gauche.</p>
<p>Also, this is considered the donor acceptor effect, hyperconjugation is more specifically donation of sigma orbitals into empty p orbitals. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's still the case- we tend to call them orbitals now.  an orbital's shape is still defined by the probably of finding the electron in that space.  They do tend to be spherical in nature, but can get somewhat oblong like a bowling pin, depending on the orbital and bond.</p></div>		</li>
