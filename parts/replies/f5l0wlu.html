			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for explaining although my scale is abnormal. But, whyâ€™d you go from G to Ab and Bb rather than A and B?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because Ab and Bb are in the c minor scale. A and B are a part of the C major scale</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that there are a few different versions of the minor scale. Natural minor, harmonic minor, melodic minor, etc. If you're using natural minor (the modal version, Am = CM) then you have flat 6th and 7th scale degrees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because those notes in C minor which is the basic structure you are modifying in your proposed system by starting on a minor C chord. If you went to naturals there you would have even less coherent feel to the chord progressions you have listed. But as your proposed chords are abnormal I just made assumptions. </p>
<p>But Those chord as majors would be A C# E and B D# F#. I wanted to avoid the C# for the system as that throws things really out of whack.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't the starting note of the iii chord be determine by the i chord? So iii would actually be Eb Gb Bb. So the fourth and fifth scale degrees would be the same tone... It also sharps the 8th scale degree... Point is, it's not really a progression based on a scale, which I believe is your main point too haha</p></div>		</li>
