They were designed to take photos of the far side of the moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. I see so many people claiming 35mm film has 8K+ of resolution, but they’re often basing that information on 35mm still frames, which are a much larger size, and not taking prints into account. That being said, many of the new 4K restorations being done nowadays claim to be scanned from the original negatives, which would be the best available quality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Based on my personal experience scanning film photographs, 4k (8ish megapixels) is my personal limit for 35mm. You can set it up to scan 8k but it's just adding pixels where there really isn't that much of a difference in data. Lawrence of Arabia was rescanned in 8k but only because it was shot on 70mm film. </p>
<p>Another think to take into consideration is vfx and cgi elements in the final product. Star Trek The Next Generation was shot on 35mm film and could be scanned at 4k. They did an HD re-release a while back and part of the process was redoing all of the VFX and CGI. The final product of the original was for SD television so all of the effects were rendered and exported for that standard. For the re-release, they scanned all of the original raw film and redid all of the vfx and cgi so that it would look good for the HD blu-ray release. </p>
<p>These are rough equivalents but can vary depending on film stock, quality, etc. </p>
<p>8mm = SD
16mm = HD
35mm = 4k
70mm = 8k</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that film photographs have a frame size of 36mm×24mm, because the film is run horizontally through the camera, whereas movie cameras/projectors run the same film vertically, resulting in a smaller frame size of 22mm×16mm (for Academy Aspect Ratio). That being said I think I’d agree with your estimates.</p>
<p>Also a good note on VFX, which for most modern films are rendered in 2K (2048 pixels wide).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, for Dunkirk you can probably get 6K of detail onto 35mm because it’s a highly detailed IMAX negative being scaled down to that print. In reality most 35mm films (especially older ones) probably don’t have 6K of detail in them because of the limitations with older lenses, coarser film grain, or focus accuracy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm oversimplifying a lot but film has a base of polyester-based film (the plastic stuff) which has a layer of tiny silver halide particles (like tiny grains of dust) adhered to it.  These particles are light-sensitive and their default value is black... so when the camera shutter opens, it focuses light through the lens which is projected onto the film and the particles capture the spectrum of light they are exposed to and react. Once light stops hitting them, they stop reacting (this is why shutter speed is so important in exposure). Once you take the film and run it through development chemicals, the particles become stable and any extra particles are stripped away from the base. If you zoom in really close, you can actually see these small particles which look like grains of sand (hence, film grain). It's a lot like a Monet painting which is made up of many little points of individual colour which our eyes blend together. To shoot in really low light conditions, larger particles are needed to capture as much light as possible for the shutter speed you want to use... Why can't you just leave the shutter open longer to compensate for low light? You certainly can but then you risk camera shake and a blurry image.</p>
<p>Modern photography uses the notion of grain as well but instead of physical particles, it uses a digital sensor. It's a small chip that is subdivided into thousands of tiny squares, like a screen door. Unlike film, there's a fixed number of little squares, they just range from pure black to pure white and all the colours in between. When you see noise on a low-light digital shot with high ISO, it's usually caused by heat because the sensor is drawing more power to capture more light. Same thing with long exposures, the sensor heats up and distorts the signal the camera is capturing. Film, on the other hand, physically strips away the grains so to get white, all the particles are gone and the light shines through the film base without any obstruction.</p>
<p>I don't know if this helped but there are many online resources that have great diagrams and video to explain the difference.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my experience doing B&amp;W dark room photograph in high school larger &quot;grain&quot; means that when light hits the film it will produce larger &quot;clumps&quot; of photosensitised chemicals. This is especially obvious if you &quot;push process&quot; low ISO film to a higher ISO (basically you develop it with warmer water and it does the equivalent of cranking the exposure slider when doing a DSLR raw format conversion). High ISO &amp; push processed film looks like it was drawn with a large tip sharpie.</p>
<p>The digital equivalent is &quot;noise&quot;. Random brightness fluctuations between adjacent pixels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>simplifying, but &quot;grain&quot; ( also known as noise) is kind of like the &quot;smoothness&quot; in the color quality of a photo. When there is a lot of grain or high noise, the photo will look kind of textured. <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/Z7VfdKUwJNeQftKu7" target="_blank">This phenomenon also happens in digital photos.</a></p></div>		</li>
