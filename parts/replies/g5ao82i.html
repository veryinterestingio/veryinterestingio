			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm I never thought of killer virus as a symbiotic relationship. I usually imagine symbiosis as both organisms benefitting from the outset. But with killer virus it's more like a hostage takeover, the cell either does what the virus says or it gets killed. I know I'm anthropomorphizing here, but there's a distinct difference in how the two scenarios feel, so I wonder if there's a more accurate word than symbiosis for the type of relationship between the cell and the killer virus here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both the host and the virus are benefitted though. The host gets a leg-up on the competition, and the virus gets a host. Besides, the host <em>can</em> evict the virus if it &quot;wants to.&quot; Also, &quot;symbiosis&quot; is a pretty broad term.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many types of symbiosis. This is arguably an example of mutualism (both host and virus benefit from the symbiotic relationship). </p>
<p>You could also make an argument that this is an example of parasitism (virus benefits, host is harmed) if the yeast is made less competitive by being used as a factory, or commensalism (virus benefits, host is neither harmed nor enriched) if the stress from being used as a factory &quot;cancels out&quot; the advantage of having the competition removed and leaves the yeast neither better nor worse off for being infected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does that work?
It releases this toxin?
Isn't that metabolically expensive for the infected yeast cell, making it less able to compete?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends how much competition there is. Another factor to consider is the satellite's helper virus, L. If unchecked, L replicates to crazy high copy numbers, but M &quot;steals&quot; proteins from it for its own replication and tampers it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this similar to the prions that some species of yeast use to prevent mating with the wrong type? I remember reading it does what you are describing.</p></div>		</li>
