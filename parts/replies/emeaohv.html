			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you figured this yourself or is there some  literature behind it?</p>
<p>I think the voice in our head is only there when we need it, typically when imagining or recalling a conversation. It just doesn't seem right that you'd have a 'second voice' for acknowledging what you're reading. Certainly in my case I just know if something feels true without having to verbalise it in any way. </p>
<p>I don't think I hear an internal voice when reading most of the time, either. I'm just absorbing the information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm working on digging this up myself. The book Sapiens (or is it Homo Deus) talks about many voices in our head, but then talks about two. I'm trying to find more on where the author got this. Unfortunately the study of the brain is still in it's infancy.  </p>
<p>Subjectively if you put me in a test tube you'd probably find 8-10 voices, all me, but serving different roles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, that's interesting. I have a hard time convincing people that I normally don't have a voice in my head. I normally just feel and know things, which I figure must be the stage before words anyway. </p>
<p>I do sometimes imagine conversations and scenarios, and words can help to structure those things in my mind. But I can 'think' fairly complex things without having to put words to them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is literature behind it, but it actually refutes the claim. </p>
<p>There is no “control tower guy” for your mind. Your inner monologue is just internalized speech. </p>
<p>The rest of how your body acts is just your brain interpreting various inputs and outputting electrical signals to make movements or other sensations. </p>
<p>For example, if you are alone, and “feeling” afraid, it’s because your brain is physically afraid for your body, and you notice that and <em>think it</em> as opposed to saying it out loud (both connected to speech). </p>
<p>There is no separate “driver” or “self” or “voice” that is broadcasting / telling you that you’re afraid.</p>
<p>Self-awareness (being aware of your own consciousness - only eight species have it) is also not this concept. </p>
<p>It’s just a function of higher brain abilities. Just like someone who is better than you at math doesn’t have a “voice” telling him the answers. Just a brain that’s better at math than yours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is anecdotal, but I think that there are regions of my brain that get 'bored' when I am doing simple tasks and distract me. I find that if I do a mechanical task, like painting, doing a puzzle, or putting on makeup, I find it easier to think. However, if I'm reading or using numbers I can't multitask at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. If I'm trying to write something, I feel WAY more productive if I'm smoking - fidgeting in other ways kinda feels the same, but I don't get the same dopamine release I think. </p>
<p>Cliche? Sure it is - the writer hovering over his typewriter with a cigarette and a glass of whiskey - but there you have it. If I didn't really, really, really want to quit I would just chain smoke myself to death and hopefully have a few novels before it did me in in the end.</p></div>		</li>
