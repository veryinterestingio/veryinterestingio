			<div class="markdown"><p>Disney has been quoted that they will still make R rated films in those franchises.  Sure it's a family company, but it's a money-focused company first.</p>

<p>Disney has released quite a few R-rated movies recently.  For instance, there is the new Kingsman prequel coming up, or movies like Ford vs. Ferrari which is doing well at the box office.</p></div>		</li>

<p>-So let me get this straight- you expect us to spend 50 million dollars on a movie about talking super monkeys!? Damnit man, it's just so crazy it might work!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was the '60s. Apparently drugs were inexpensive.</p>
<p>Besides, the make up aside, the film really didn't have much in the way of special effects. Sure there was the ape town but it probably wasn't very expensive to film, relative to a western. My memory is dim, but much of the film takes place outdoors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea that an &quot;all women Ghostbusters&quot; movie would be a money-making because the original Ghostbusters were men and the public is now interested in seeing women in historically male roles (wokeness).  Which led to a movie that bombed at the box office.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Obviously copying women into male roles of otherwise successful movie franchises is fucking stupid, and misses the point of wokeness entirely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Conservatives saying that movies without strong white male protagonist are doomed to failure. They bring up &quot;Woke movies&quot; like Ghostbusters (the all female remake) but ignore movies that are actually woke such as get out because to them its about blaming non white males at all costs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Making a really good movie is very hard.  If you focus on things other than making a good movie (like being PC), it makes a very hard task practically impossible.</p></div>		</li>
