<p>Suppose you have an empty universe containing two massive galaxies. In a no-dark energy universe, they fall toward each other. But if you tune dark energy to the right amount, they appear to hover at the same distance apart forever. Dark energy is acting like a force.</p>

<p>Are there examples of galaxies &quot;standing still&quot; because they are the perfect masses and distances from one another that cancel out the dark energy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because any minor imperfection (to the tune of one atom's worth) would in the long run make one of the two forces stronger, and when you're talking about the universe, everything is long run ☺</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But I assume that the “force” of this dark energy could be calculated by finding multiple sets of galaxies that are almost in the equilibrium. Is the idea that this force has changed over time? Getting more powerful and thus galaxies closer us would appear further from one another if “in balance” as oppose to one’s further away (and thus further back in time)? . </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This comment contains the right answer. The observable effect (expansion of the universe accelerating) can be modelled in the cosmological equations with a term that behaves like energy would. Therefore, without any knowledge of what is actually causing the acceleration it has been named dark energy.</p>
<p>In the absence of this term in the equations we would expect the universe to be expanding, but for that expansion to be decelerating due to the matter (dark and normal) providing a gravitational force that counteracts the expansion.</p>
<p>It's possible that calling it &quot;energy&quot; is completely misleading, but this would not be the first case of scientists doing this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thankyou for high quality answer! </p>
<p>hold up though</p>
<p>if it's constant across all space and time, and spacetime is expanding, <em>and</em> it's acting like a force, how does it not violate the conservation of energy? unless the answer to that question itself is moot due to the bizarre force-not-force nature of the stuff</p>
<p>but even in that case, do we have any idea how it's getting away with doing that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah - this is an important point, though, and a significant objection that people raise.</p>
<p>The problem is resolved because the assumptions in the principle are that spacetime is flat and unchanging; in an expanding universe (and one with curved space because of gravity), it's not strictly true. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Conservation of energy is a very slippery concept in general relativity. Energy is, of course, <em>locally</em> conserved, but when you try to figure out what the total energy of the universe is, you get yourself into trouble pretty quickly. Things that are conserved need to be conserved over time, but <em>whose</em> time? Time doesn't point in the same direction across your spacetime. In a normal sort of spacetime, you can come up with some moderately silly workarounds like drawing your &quot;perpendicular to time&quot; surface to go back in &quot;time&quot; to before any given black hole forms to avoid singularities. You can assign energy to the gravitational field to cancel out any energy you seem to be losing. At this point, though, a lot of GR workers just throw up their hands and say global conservation of energy doesn't make any sense in GR. Others more doggedly try to keep making it work; I guess they would say that the extra apparent gravitational potential is being cancelled by negative potential energy in the field.</p></div>		</li>
