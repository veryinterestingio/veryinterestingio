			<div class="markdown"><p>Bacteria was part of the reason for cooking meat. But possibly the more important aspect was the ability to consume and digest more meat easier when it was cooked rather than raw. Possibly aiding in brain development. Or maybe that last on is putting the cart before the horse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah - and I mean, those are the reasons why it's an evolutionary advantage to cook. But that's not why people did it; they probably just liked it more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it would be a mistake to separate what we like to do/eat from what has an evolutionary advantage. I'm fairly confident a component of the brain's evolution has been developing mechanisms for tricking humans into doing what's best for them. Did the preference for cooked meat precede the tendency to eat it? Or where those who just happened to prefer the taste of cooked meat less likely to die from diseases/parasites?</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's a guy I know in Frankfurt who, when I visit him on business, loves to try to get me to try stuff, so we went down to this little butcher shop and had it on a nice roll. It's actually really good, but my American food safety alarm bells were clanging really loud.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Likely no worse than steak tartare. There you put even a raw egg on top.</p>
<p>Neither is something I would want to eat regularly or in a large quantity but if it is fresh and prepared by a trusted (and competent) butcher or chef who isn't going to try to kill you by putting dodgy meat in it (old, didn't check for parasites, not refrigerated properly ...), it is not really that dangerous.</p>
<p>Both parasites in pork and bacteria poisonings (salmonella, listeria, etc.) are fairly rare in Germany, so the chances that you get something from eating something like this when prepared by a reputable butcher are low. It is still risky but not excessively so. </p>
<p>You are more likely to catch something from ground meat sold in a supermarket (grinding old unsold pieces and using the meat to prepare sausages  or other products instead of properly disposing of it is sadly not unheard of ...) than this. If the butcher sickens his customers, he can close shop, when it happens to a supermarket, they get a fine, fire some scapegoat low level grunt claiming it was an &quot;individual failure&quot; and everything goes as before ...</p></div>		</li>
