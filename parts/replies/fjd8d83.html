			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the answer is no -- on the contrary, the existence of magnetic monopoles would make Maxwell's laws more symmetric, and it would also immediately imply quantization of electric charge which is something we observe in nature but which remains unexplained.  Many grand unified theories also predict the existence of magnetic monopoles.  In general, a number of things would work out better mathematically if magnetic monopoles existed, so it is a bit of an oddity as to why magnetic monopoles don't actually seem to exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's one of the issues solved by inflation; it allows for monopoles created abundantly at high temperatures corresponding to the GUT scale (10^16 GeV) to be diluted away to on order ~1 per Hubble volume by the end of inflation, when the universe reheats to a mere 10^11 GeV and the hot big bang begins with the creation of standard model particles and beyond the standard model particles like dark matter, but no more monopoles because the temperature is too low for them post-inflation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/326/5951/415.full" target="_blank">weird special case where you can create pairs of monopoles</a> in what's called a spin ice. They appear to be dipoles outside of the ice, but they can move around within it and to a hypothetical observer embedded inside, they appear to be monopoles. This is not my field of expertise, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is amazing! I've been learning more about theoretical physics and the math that was used to determine things like the Schr√∂dinger wave equation, so this is really interesting for sure. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Physics would not break, like others have said Maxwell's equations are prettier if magnetic monopoles exist, it's just that <em>if</em> they exist then they're very very rare. At the moment the upper limit (highest amount possible given our current observations) is one monopole in 10\^(29) nucleons. That's insanely rare.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's like one nucleon per 10 people. I understand that's very rare compared to, for example, the amount of uranium you eat. However, I don't understand how rare that is in terms of difficulty to detect, other than nobody's been able to do it yet?</p></div>		</li>
