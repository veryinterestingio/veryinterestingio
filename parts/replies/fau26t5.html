			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer, depending on what the question actually was asking. The copper wire twisted pair helps prevent &quot;crosstalk&quot; on analog lines until it reaches the local station where it is digitized. Like sending any digital signal, there are plenty of ways to do it, but everyone here already knows they can listen to many audio streams at once without interference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What this answer covers seems to be missing on others. The telephone cable running down the street is not one cable. It has hundreds or even thousands of copper pairs. Everyone's house has their own cable within the big cable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are painting way too rosy of a picture, the problem we have is that as the OP thinks there is no interference but there IS interference! The pairs are not twisted as well as they should be, and they do suffer from crosstalk leading to slower speeds. Not forgetting all the various signals, ADSL, SDSL, ISDN 90V?, VDSL all in the same cable causing everything to slow down. How about we get started on aluminium, lead cables and paper insulation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep but it is a ELI5. It is just the basic of how it tries to resist crosstalk.  There are lots of different cables and issues that doesn't help with interference but it soon all gets very complicated.
Just the cable fill had an effect on BB. Sometimes swapping from one pair to another can improve BB due to how the cable is filled.</p></div>		</li>
