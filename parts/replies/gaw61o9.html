			<div class="markdown"><p>An estimate based on surface rocks however turns out to be too low, as the Schiehallion and Cavendish experiments confirmed. The significant differece between the density of surface rocks and the Earth's overall density is what made geologists first theorise it has a metal core.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We know water is on the surface of the planet, so whatever is deeper is probably denser than water.  </p>
<p>Of the densest common elements, iron is a good candidate. Iron is roughly 7.8 times denser than water. So that's probably around the limit. </p>
<p>So it's safe to say Earth is most likely between 1-8 times denser than water.  </p>
<p>Then you add some other information, like the density of common rock being somewhere around 3-5 times that of water and estimating the gradient of change as you go to the core and eventually you arrive at the 5t/m^3 , that is five times denser than water estimate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question. I'm not sure how Newton came up with his estimate which is surprisingly close to the real value of ~ 5.5 g/cm3. I do know that his error was in the size of the earth resulting in the underestimation. </p>
<p>However, people have historically tried to estimate the density based on measurements of the crust. While we have a lot of water, its all on the surface and does not contribute much to overall planetary weight.</p></div>		</li>
