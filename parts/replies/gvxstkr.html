<p>The air pressure simply isn't dramatically increased by the very small change in volume of the ball in contact. </p>
<p>The scale of that effect is tiny compared with the same idea of pressure increase, except this occurs at higher order of magnitude in the solid stress deformations and elastic rebounding of the ball itself.</p>
<p>More simply, your understanding of how the air pushes back is correct. That &quot;pressure&quot; is analogous to the stress in the ball skin.</p>
<p>That skin on the ball is prestressed by the higher air pressure and therefore rebounds with greater energy.</p>
<p>The air pressure stretches the skin of the ball, and like a guitar string when you pluck a more stretched string it has a higher pitch /energy.</p>
<p>It's both the air and the ball skin, but in a very good bouncing ball it's the rubber that does most of the work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure this is the right explanation, could you follow my reasoning and see if you agree? The amount of energy the ball has before it is dropped is a constant, so after the bounce the energy in the deflated ball has to go somewhere. As others have also said, I believe this goes into deforming the surface of the ball. Let's say this takes no energy, then a lower deformed ball would still increase in pressure as it slowes down, untill all the gravitational potential energy is transformed in pressure energy. After this it will be converted into potential energy again when bouncing up. Since the starting energy is the same and the only losses would be deforming the ball and air resistance (which we neglected), a low pressure ball would bounce the same height as a high pressure ball. Knowing this, is it not more correct to say that a lower pressure ball loses more energy to deforming it's surface, rather than say it can store less energy (which I believe to be untrue)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not your OP but let me try because I think your &quot;which I believe to be untrue&quot; is your error. Why? A higher pressure ball has more energy dumped into it (literally I have to pump it more; that's what we're doing, we're putting more energy in). In a simple mock way, say low pressure stretches ball chemical bonds 1m vs a high pressure ball 2m (these are obviously bs units). Fine! But importantly, the higher pressure case system has more energy in it, the &quot;spring&quot; is stretched more, also meaning the &quot;spring&quot; has more room to &quot;give&quot;. It can be compressed by twice the amount of the low pressure ball prior to considering other effects (eg. non-elastic). So, yeah I drop them both from 1um off the ground, and both can absorb that amount of kinetic energy elastically (in those bonds/springs), but at what height do I start getting too much energy to be elastically absorbed by the low pressure one yet not a problem for the high pressure system? At that point their bounce ability drastically diverges.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But a stretched spring doesn't have more room to give than a non stetched one. If we use the spring analogy, the higher pressure ball has springs that are compressed more, the bounce would compress them even more, so it would &quot;bottom out quicker&quot; (even though gasses don't work like this).</p>
<p>Also, if the parent comments theory is true (which again I don't think it is), where does the energy that is lost go to?</p></div>		</li>
