			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was a kid I had to sneak quietly around most of the time and I developed this habit of rumbling my ears because it covered any sound I made. Obviously not the best solution seeing as I'm the only one who heard the rumble over anything else.</p>
<p>I've been trying to train myself out of it for years. If I get up in the middle of the night orc something I still do it. It's crazy how loud it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have this in both superior canals.  There's a small subreddit for it at /r/scds.  I can hear it through my skeleton if you tap my knee or even my ankle with a tuning fork.  AMA</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes I have that - its called Semi-circular Canal Dehiscence -  its rare - and it sucks - sound is very distorted and when you’re in a crowded restaurant for example you can barely stand the noise because the sound is so loud and distorted.  There is a surgery to fix the hole but it means having your skull cut into and your brain lifted up during surgery .... so I’ll just continue living with it.  But it can drive you to distraction sometimes.</p></div>		</li>
