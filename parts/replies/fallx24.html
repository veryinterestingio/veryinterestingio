<p>It's a non-spectral hue.</p>
<p>I think you start losing your audience when you try to tell somebody what isn't a color. I like to think that perceiving all the colors is part of the human condition. It's different for some people, sure, but seeing the combination of different cones being stimulated simultaneously is common to most of us, and we've already built our language around that experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_color" target="_blank">Related to this, you can trick your brain into perceiving colors that shouldn't exist.</a>  If you send a red image to one eye and a green image to the other eye, your brain will attempt to mix the red and green input and you'll see a color that's... in between red and green.  Which can't happen under ordinary circumstances.  You can do the same thing with blue and yellow.</p>
<p>To experience it really effectively you need two independently adjusted monitors but you might be able to get it with one screen (I got blue-yellow pretty effectively).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Red and blue ARE primary colors. It's just that they're primary additive colors, not subtractive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Listen, just because your nice video says some cool and likely mostly correct things, doesn't mean you should go around believing every last word of the video like gospel. </p>
<p>For people confused, yes, magenta <strong><em>is</em></strong> a color.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on how you define color whether magenta qualifies or not. It's a semantic argument.</p>
<p>We <em>know</em> magenta exists as a combination of red and blue wavelengths, but not as a unique wavelength.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One common distinction is spectral vs non-spectral color.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a color is representable by some <em>pure</em> frequency wave, it is a <strong>spectral color</strong>. Otherwise, it is a <strong>non-spectral</strong> color.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Spectral colors: red (can be represented by 680nm), green (can be represented by 550nm)</p>
</li>
<li>Non-spectral colors: magenta, brown</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Non-spectral colors require some spectral distribution of wavelengths which activate human SML cones in just the right combinations. Note that this distribution is <strong>not unique</strong>. Trivial example: mix in an infinite amount of UV light into your distribution, and humans will still perceive the same color. (Though they might go blind... and burn alive... and basically disintegrate... and turn into some wacky blackhole... and perhaps go out with a big bang...)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a difference between ink color and light color. Light is an additive process (you add colors to create color), while ink is subtractive (hence why magenta and cyan are used of the primary colors). Black is added as it’s own color to give the image more reflectance. High end plotter printers can have more than one black, each with a different purpose and base.</p></div>		</li>
