			<div class="markdown"><p>It gets a little semantic. A gamecube disc is definitely ROM. It's a DVD-ROM. Read only memory encoded on optical disc. It's a series of bits, that happen to have a filesystem encoded on top of it. A disc image is a ROM in every sense of the word, with extra formatting applied at the next level. Otherwise you could save to the disc. It's just not a silicon chip.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of old arcade cabinets either used solid state ROM or PROM (ROM programmed by a chip writer - you could then manufacture a cabinet entirely in-house) on the board.  Cartridges were always solid state (a manufacturer is a necessity, where with a board you could solder it yourself). In any case, MAME (originally Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator, but now a variety of old hardware) popularized the term ROM because it was one of the first major project that supported multiple different old arcade games, but you needed a ROM dump to run them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I remember when MAME was the new kid on the block. Sparcade was the OG. Maybe it was called Spice?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a dramatization of someone reverse engineering the data out a ROM chip. How accurate would this be?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The story at the beginning is correct, measuring the voltages is something that would be done but the majority of the pins wouldn't be a set voltage, but instead fluctuating. The Oscilloscope output is pretty much unrelated to what's being probed and if it's a voltage they're just trying to measure a multimeter makes a lot more sense. The way they dumped the ROM is viable, if not an unnecessarily slow way of doing it.</p>
<p>The major problem is while they can dump the ROM, it comes to the issue of copyright, as the dump they retrieved is the copyrighted bit. In many reverse engineering efforts it may need to be proven that this original code or dump had not been observed</p></div>		</li>
