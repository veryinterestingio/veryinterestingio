			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this explanation because it addresses a concept that a lot of people seem to struggle with: the veins and arteries are only connected through capillaries and organs. It’s not like an artery is just one long circular tube running through the body, halfway around becoming a vein. They are (nearly) two separate systems</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also didn't realize this, but now that I think of it, it makes perfect sense. In fact, the old thing I thought (one long circular tube) is what doesn't make sense!</p>
<p>The whole point of blood is to get things into and out of the cells, so why would your body waste any energy looping blood from one side of the heart to another without touching other cells along the way?</p></div>		</li>
