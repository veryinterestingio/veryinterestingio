			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting with this that some products take advantage of this to look like they're stronger.</p>
<p>Ibuprofen comes as standard in 200mg tablets. Ibuprofen Lysine is marketed at 342mg. Now while Lysine is faster absorbing that ibuprofen acid. 342mg of Ibuprofen Lysine is equivalent to 200mg of Ibuprofen so they're the same strength.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's the medicines.org page for the nurofen brand. It Peaks at <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15460211" target="_blank">35 minutes after taking rather than 90 for a normal dose</a>. But the post peak intensity is basically the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Salt in the chemical sense means an ionic compound where an acid and a base have nutralised eachother forming a compound with an anion and a cation (Ibuprofen and Lysine). This salt is more water soluble than the straight acid (Ibuprofen and Hydrogen).</p>
<p>Salt as in table salt is the chemical salt of Sodium and Chlorine. Adding table salt would have little effect on the absorption of your ibuprofen salt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small chemistry-related correction: You CAN make a tablet with an ionized drug, but you need to add the opposite ion to balance charge. You don't combine it with a salt, it IS a salt when the drug is ionized and combined with opposite anion/cation. </p>
<p>Since an ion can never just exist on its own you don't actually add ions together, but for example when you react the base-drug with HCl you ionize the drug and create Cl- as opposite anion at the same time, so the drug is in salt form.</p></div>		</li>
