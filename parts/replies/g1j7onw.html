			<div class="markdown"><p>Next time you see any vehicle with &quot;dual&quot; wheels in the back (even a pickup truck), note the shape of the front wheels, they bulge outward like the bottom of a bowl. The rear outer wheels bulge inward like the inside of a bowl. For the &quot;dual&quot; wheel setup on the rear axle, it is two identical wheels, with the inner wheel bulging out (exactly like the front wheel), and the outer wheel bulging in, they are bolted together where they contact. The &quot;middle sidewall&quot; referenced by OP is simply the sidewalls of the two tires alongside each other.</p>

<p>but a single tire 2 wide will bulge out way too much. </p>

<p>Huh? Super singles work even better that two singles. The only reason they're not universally adopted is redundancy.</p>
<p>You can limp a ways on a single, but you're dead in the water with a flat super single. That's why you see them mostly in dense areas where a repair truck can be out quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to say this, you a lot of 18-wheelers with these single tire setups. I believe the redundancy of the dually setup is still useful for vehicles with only 2 axles, but for a semi with redundant axles, they apparently are finding lower rolling resistance and potentially cheaper maintenance with wide single setups.</p></div>		</li>
