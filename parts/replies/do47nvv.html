			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have any special tips for those of us with chronic-ish issues?</p>
<p>I had a ton of ear infections as a kid, ended up with &quot;tubes in my ears&quot; (which i think lead to hearing loss on some frequencies, specifically very low freqs), and now flying on planes seems to be getting more an more uncomfortable as I get older (30s now).</p>
<p>I flew a lot as a kid, so I'm very familiar with pinching my nose and forcing them open that way, but it just doesn't work sometimes anymore.  Chewing gum sometimes helps, sometimes not.  Massaging the ET area behind the jaw feels good, but not sure its ever done much. Tugging on the lobe while I pinch my nose and pressurize seems to be a new area of efficacy, but I wonder if there is a better way?  I'm always worried that I'm going to go too hard and blow out a brain gasket or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did you get permanent tubes? It's far more typical to get temporary ones which fall out after ~6 months, after which the eardrum is supposed to heal. Some don't, leaving a hole, which is kinda like a natural tube. If you have tubes/holes in, you don't need to equalise your ears when you fly (the tube allows air to pass through the eardrum already).</p>
<p>Without knowing whether your eardrums are intact or not, it's quite difficult to give more advice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to get the temp tubes many times in high school, my ENT was stumped why the issue would not go away. Said I had the thickest fluid he’d ever seen. As a last ditch effort, he suggested I get my tonsils and adenoids removed at age 18/19. Had that done and haven’t had an issue since. Went to the ER 4 times in the week following that surgery though from clotting complications. Not fun but very much worth it </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ear drums are intact.</p>
<p>I just had the temporary tubes as a small child, they fell out and I was fine, as you described.  I tend to think I did incur some hearing loss, as I've never been able to hear a spectrum of noises that most people seem to be able to.  </p>
<p>For example, when I lived in an apartment, my wife and friends could all hear people stomping around upstairs all the time.  I might have heard them once in 3 years.</p>
<p>Bass tracks in music are often very very faint for me.  I can pick them out if I turn the music way up, and then sometimes recognize them later if I already have the gist of the pattern.</p>
<p>Anyway, its just my hypothesis that the tubes caused this, I have no real evidence for it, but I've never been involved with much else that would cause long term hearing damage.  Never liked loud music, never went to many concerts, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if I had tubes for 3 years then I had surgery to take them out? My eardrums are very damaged(can be seen like a silk inflating and deflating if you look through that thing that goes in the ear) but my hearing is within normal range, I kept getting othitis as a kid. I keep inflating the pressure in my eardrums because if I let them pop without any air stuck in I hear things too loudly..  I'm even able to exhale through my ears, but I am not able to go underwater without silicone protectors designed for my ears because water just gets stuck in the eustachian tube.. And I used to be a pro swimmer before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a Q tip addict so I've learned I really need to clear my ears out with hydrogen peroxide before I fly to get that wax buildup I've pushed towards my ear drum out of the way so my ear drum can relax or whatever is going on in there. </p>
<p>Could be psycho somatic but since doing that I don't cry after a plane ride anymore like I used to  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have really bad wax buildup in my ears, but q tips are terrible for managing the problem. They're dangerous to your inner ear and you should stop using them. <a href="https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/5600401" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<p>Multiple doctors have told me that removing cerumen lightly with your fingers is safe, but that's only to help remove the globs that are already being pushed out of your ear. The rest of it needs to stay in your head. </p></div>		</li>
