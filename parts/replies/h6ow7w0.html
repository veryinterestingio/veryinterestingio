			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good answer, I'd also like to add the following: </p>
<p>Travelling is uncomfortable, on a psychological basis atleast. Here in the comfort of your home you can just doze off for half an hour in your underpants and it's all okay.<br />
When you're travelling you need to process and react to much more sensory inputs than sitting around the house. Go through TSA, Keep the passport and tickets ready, sit on the correct seat, get off on the correct bus stop if you're on one, make sure your luggage doesn't get left behind, make sure your children don't get left behind. All that requires you being more alert than usual, and it may seem trivial, but over 8 or 10 hours it really does add up.</p>
<p>Similarly, people are quite amazed what a professional Chess player goes through in a 6 hour game of Chess. Just sit and think, and move tiny pieces back and forth a feet or so? It's a massive effort to do that though. Atleast, if you're planning to win.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those two are great answers. I'd also like to add one more factor for plane trips:</p>
<p>Planes fly very high. A regular long-haul comercial flight can fly at anything from 34,000ft (~10,300m) to 41,000ft (~12,500m). At those altitudes, the air is too thin for you to be able to breathe normally. To compensate for that, planes are pressurized.</p>
<p>The pressurization on an aircraft makes it possible for you to breathe, but the air is still way more thin than if you were at your house, closer to the ground. This is called 'cabin altitude'. </p>
<p>Long-haul aircraft have a cabin altitude ranging between 8,000ft (~2,500m) and 6,000ft (~1,830m). Higher the cabin altitude means that the air inside the cabin will be thinner.</p>
<p>Breathing thin air for long periods of time can cause headaches and make you feel very tired, especially for people who aren't used to it, or live close to sea-level. That greatly contributes for the tired feeling you get after a long flight.</p>
<p>Apologies if things got a bit confusing, English isn't my first language.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is hugely significant when it comes to air travel. It's also one of the reasons why you need to be sure to hydrate well while flying and also lay off the booze, which only exacerbates this effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Especially with a mask. When I was last on a plane back in March 2020 after everyone from school was sent back home, I didn't drink anything that whole flight and I was damn near passing out by the time we landed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also the amount of exertion of getting up very early (in many cases), fighting traffic to the airport, standing in line, dealing with baggage check, running to your gate, collecting your baggage at baggage claim, (sometimes) going through customs... and then having an uncomfortable flight on top of that... particularly with shrinking legroom.  If you get an exit row or sit in first class, you'll at least be able to stretch your legs, but sitting on a 2-3 hour or longer flight with barely any legroom is very aggravating.</p>
<p>In fact, common torture techniques include having the detainee sit in a fixed, constricted position for long periods of time.</p></div>		</li>
