			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of stuff we eat and even consider pleasure is contextually dependent. Such as with an aged cheese, which releases the same molecules like stinky feet. So whether you feel disgusted or start salivating depends on what you are currently primed to by either seeing feet or cheese (if we ignoring any stinky feet fetish).</p>
<p>Getting &quot;used to&quot; soapy taste of coriander and connect it with a good food is I think much more likely than somatic changes in receptors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this makes the most sense, at least in relation to my own food preference changes. when i was a kid, anything green or onion was disgusting (or at least i thought it was) but as i got older i associated these components with the actual flavors they gave to a dish i really liked, and over time added more and more greens/ onions to dishes as i learned to cook. </p>
<p>i think really what this boils down to is just &quot;developing a pallet&quot; and understanding flavors more imo </p>
<p>all of the evolutionary examples are really cool but at the end of the day its an occam's razor deal where i think its more likely less about evolutionarily-advantageous (if thats a term) behavior and more about kids just having bias/ misunderstanding of flavor</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's funny you mention pleasure and fetishes, because I recall a study that demonstrated disgust is inversely proportional to arousal in general. Even in the absence of a particular interest in some objectively disgusting thing like a bowl of roaches or a dirty diaper, participants rated them less disgusting if they were sexually aroused than if they weren't. Which makes sense, I guess, because sex is ultimately pretty gross, but no complaints here!</p></div>		</li>
