<li>The contact schedule depends on the activities. During a flyby, every day. During hibernation, once per week. </li>

<p>Data rates are about 1 kilobit per second now. An 8 hour contact would deliver approximately 3.6 Megabytes</p>

<p>Itâ€™s completely old and obsolete: Nucleus Plus OS. It runs on a 12MHz Mongoose V processor.</p>
</li>
<li>We upload plans every couple weeks during normal operations. Less often during hibernation, more often during a flyby. We make adjustments on approach to a flyby based on the images taken by the LORRI instrument on the spacecraft. -CH</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radiation hardened hardware is usually older and slower than consumer electronics, due to the way the chips are fabricated. Combined with the time it takes to design, build, launch, and get to the outer solar system - you end up with some outdated hardware compared to what we're using on earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i dont know much about cpus,
but looking at the clock speed. </p>
<p>Its similar to the Intel D8086 released in 1978.</p>
<p>Cpus Released in 2006 ran at  close to 200 times the clock speed</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a follow up to 4. If you do make minor adjustments, approximately how long does the signal take to reach New Horizon and how long do you usually have to wait for some sort of feedback.</p>
<p>Also, thank you for your contribution to space exploration.</p></div>		</li>
