			<div class="markdown"><p>According to quantum electrodynamics, it’s possible. However it’s a very rare process and you need fairly high energies to detect it. </p>
<p>It happens via something called a “loop” diagram. Scattering of particles in quantum field theory is described by Feynman diagrams, where the most important contributions are called “tree level” and corrections (due to quantum mechanics) are called “loop level”. But photon-photon elastic scattering only occurs at loop level, so at tree level there is no photon-photon interaction at all. This makes the process very rare and difficult to detect.</p></div>		</li>
