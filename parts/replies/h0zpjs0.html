			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually doesn’t have a long period where it can be spread before symptoms start. The virus has to be in the salivary glands of the biting animal to infect another animal. Once the virus reaches that stage, it’s usually only a couple of days before symptoms start and then the animal will not last long. That’s why the general rule of thumb if you get bit by a domesticated animal is to quarantine the animal for 10 days to watch for symptoms. I work in a veterinary diagnostics lab.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a comment higher up that explained part of this but the virus is predominantly only transmittable if neurologic symptoms are present, so you need to biopsy the brain. The general protocol is if you get bitten by a low risk animal (squirrel, rabbit, mouse/rat, rabbit), post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with both rabies vaccine and rabies immune globulin isn't indicated. If it's a high-risk animal (bat, raccoon, skunk, fox, coyote), ideally you trap it so it can be euthanized, or kill it outright and bring it with you to the hospital so it's brain can be biopsied. If it's positive for rabies, you get PEP. If not, you don't. If the animal isn't available, you get PEP to make sure. Bringing in the animal can save you a lot of money (upwards of 35k in the states), if the animal isn't rabid.</p>
<p>With domestic animals, you quarantine the animal for 10 days and watch for neurological dysfunction. If it's healthy in 10 days, you don't get PEP. If it develops neurological symptoms, you're still in the window of successful treatment. If the pet isn't available for quarantine, you get PEP. It's kind of hedging your bets with weighing the risks and benefits. The protocol can prevent unnecessary treatment, as well as save us from having to put down our pets if they bite someone. </p>
<p>So the takeaway I guess is if you get bitten by a skunk, kill it and bring it to the ED to potentially save yourself $35k.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Human vaccination requires several shots (Verorab) before exposure and only gives you more time before you need 2 more shots after exposure. Also booster is needed every 5 years.</p>
<p>Without vaccination you need 5 shots very soon after exposure, possible including rabies immunoglobulin.</p>
<p>Mostly useful when travelling to places where the time might count or someone working with potentially infected animals.</p>
<p>Though I still don't understand how other mammals can be vaccinated permanently, but not humans (?)</p></div>		</li>
