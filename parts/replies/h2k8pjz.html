			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, i've been looking for someone to point this out. The manner and execution in which the Roses &quot;buy Schitts Creek&quot; is super fictional. It's evident very early on in the series that &quot;buying the town&quot; was just a device to get the plot going. Notice how Johnny Rose has NO autonomy or control over what happens in the town, thats not too crazy cause an existing town would probably have laws in place that regulates mayoral elections and town council procedures, regardless of who &quot;owns&quot; the town. BUT what doesn't make a lot of sense is how little the Roses benefit from their &quot;asset&quot;. If Mr. Rose was as savvy as he's protrayed, he would've sold chunks of that rural backwoods town to developers, leased parcels out to business, and surely as the owner of the town he would have landlord rights over SOME.of the residents, no? Even as the series goes on it just stops referencing his owning the town all together. It's a great show regardless but that BIG detail always bugged me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a story of a small town in Oregon called Tiller a few years back. It used to be a lumber town, but with the closure of all the local mills, people moved away and one dude ended up owning most of the town.</p>
<p>Interesting story for sure.</p></div>		</li>
