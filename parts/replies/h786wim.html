			<div class="markdown"><p>So if it’s normal to lose 1/5 of your blood volume during a c-section, I must have lost way more with my second son, I ended up getting two units of blood, and they almost gave me a third. I just remember asking them to take my son off my chest because I felt like I was going to fall asleep, and I was just very tired and cold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>possibly. sometimes ppl just start out anemic and we give blood prophylactically. feeling sleeping, tired and cold is pretty normal during a c-section, remember that even though you're not feeling it you're literally getting splayed open which is taxing physiologically on the body, regardless of blood loss lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was my second, I had the shakes the first time like I was freezing, but this time is was like I was drifting away. Turns out they had cut my bladder open as it was adhered to my uterus from last time, I think they may have been where the blood loss came from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Happened to my wife too. And man I’ve never been more terrified than when my wife had her C sections. All 3 had me figuratively shitting my pants for so many reasons in addition to the blood transfusions. All I kept thinking was, “please don’t die please don’t die.” And I know that’s somewhat irrational when getting some of the best medical care in the world but I couldn’t help it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really not that irrational, mate. It's a fairly serious surgery and not to be undertaken lightly. Of course, it's also been a lifesaver for many people, but there's nothing wrong with being concerned.</p>
<p>Seems like it all ended well, though. Good luck with three kids (assuming no twins or the like), two is enough to kick my butt right now!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My poor husband ended up sitting in the recovery room holding our newborn son for 2 hrs while he waited for them to finish with me. My first c-section had taken only 45min or so, so as time went on he said he got increasingly terrified. Didn’t help that no one had come out and told him why it was taking so long. (My bladder was cut open and they needed a urologist to show up and double check everything was good.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My sister had to get blood.
She had already been home after her cesarean and as the day went on she got more and more pale and said that she felt like the “life” was draining out of her.
Eventually her state of consciousness started coming into question and an ambulance was called. Turns out she needed a lot of extra blood.
She told me it was the most amazing feeling in the world and that as the blood was going into her body she felt like she was being resurrected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, what a feeling?! I wonder if that's a common/well known feeling and if anyone has tried that on purpose. I'm glad your sister was ok in the end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense, I naturally have pretty low BP and during my csection after they took my son out and started suctioning the blood I tanked. I felt tingly and then within a few seconds I was about to pass out. It happened so quickly. I remember looking at the machine and the bottom number was 40, I dont remember the top one. I didnt actually pass out somehow, they injected a medication into my IV and I was normal again within a minute. Scary feeling though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes this is pretty normal for c-sections, the neuraxial anesthesia (i.e. spinal or epidural or combined) you get causes a lot of it though rather than blood loss as it messes with the nervous system</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your response I like. </p>
<p>Few years ago I had an emergency appendectomy. A day or so after I got home my body started shaking and I was freezing, wouldn't stop. Froze and shook till I couldn't take it anymore and was admitted to hospital for tests and overnight observation. Doc said I was healthier than him and discharged me.</p>
<p>I googled and read later this is a thing. Jeez why didn't they know?</p></div>		</li>
