			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. In that case they sort of had time as the cubes 4th dimension and he was able to move in 3D space to different rooms to change which time he was observing. Sort of a trick space to help out a lowly being unable to perceive the higher dimensions.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/N0WjV6MmCyM" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/N0WjV6MmCyM</a></p>
<p>This is a really hard concept if you haven’t thought about it before, but this Numberphile video does a good job of explaining it by explaining how 2D objects work to form 3D objects, and then explains how 3D objects work to form 4D objects, using physical models and animations of shapes including the hypercube (tesseract) and beyond into 5 dimensions and more:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/2s4TqVAbfz4" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/2s4TqVAbfz4</a></p>
<p>It’s a mind-bender for sure!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perspective tesseracts always bothered me because of the &quot;warped&quot; cubes on every side of the &quot;smaller&quot; cube . It didn't hit me until Sagan showed the shadow of the transparent cube and pointed out the rhombus like sides and how it's the same perspective model.</p>
<p>I actually yelled in revelation. Fucking nuts.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It represents 4D objects moving in a 4D space, and creates some visual strangeness because we can only see 3D representation until we use the slider in game to move our perspective through the 4th dimension.</p></div>		</li>
