			<div class="markdown"><p>One time i stopped a sneeze by accident and felt the force reverse down my body and into my testicles. It hurt so bad so i went to the doctor and turns out i had an inguinal hernia. No way to tell if this was the only cause but this is when it started hurting</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Donâ€™t try to quell sound too much or they will wake at the slightest sound later, which you donâ€™t want.  Remember, your baby is used to noise.  They lived their entire lives in the womb hearing your heartbeat, digestive noises, etc, as well as noises that originated outside the womb, at all times of the day.  They can handle it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Took me a long while to unlearn it, and even now I sometimes subsconsiouly do it.</p></div>		</li>
