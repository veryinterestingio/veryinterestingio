			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed,</p>
<p>Many people often think there are hardware limitations, or other excuses, but in reality, its always 'what is good enough' and companies only aim to satisfy that.</p>
<p>Teams could perfectly be super snappy, but it isn't, because Microsoft doesn't think the programming effort would be compensated by potential sales or income. </p>
<p>And before people come along saying 'but it needs to run in a webbrowser, you can't compare it to a native application', I would say that is a choice by microsoft first of all, to not create a native application, because of cheapest option. Second of all, API latency is an optimization problem, you can go ridiculously fast. And third of all, even within a web context, you can do so many things to make user experience a lot faster. If facebook, and google, amazon and those big sites can handle super low latency calls, anyone can.</p>
<p>In fact, there are even frameworks like gatsby that allow you to create ridiculously snappy sites yourself, by using prefetching and caching technologies.</p>
<p>Same for zoom: zoom is capable to do this better than a random embedded video, because they care about that performance. A video on a news site cares more about the advertising being shown than actually showing you a great video, superfast.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's constrained by electron, even the best electron apps tend to be slow. Visual Studio Code comes to mind, it's usually responsive but sometimes the browser shines through.</p>
<p>Native apps will always be much faster, but much less portable. Teams can run anywhere election can, which is anywhere Chrome can, and they get that more-or-less out of the box, as well as letting them have an identical web client with little extra effort.</p>
<p>Web browsers weren't designed to be the desktop application framework of choice, but here we are.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Agree, but this is a Microsoft choice to use this framework. There are many, many other web frameworks out there that offer vastly superior performance for the end user, usually at the cost of not compiling directly into apps, but requiring some additional work. Nobody forced microsoft to use electron, that is a choice, because it allows them to very cheaply offer teams on a lot of platforms. </p>
<p>Zoom on the other hand rewrote large parts of its app for each platform to offer good experiences. That is also a choice by Zoom. There is no right or wrong or better or worse way, these are all just business decisions, aimed to make as much money as possible.</p>
<p>I personally find a hybrid solution best: have a dedicated app for each environment, and a managed central server somewhere combined with p2p connections. A bit like whatsapp: it has native apps that are fast AND it has a web version.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it's <em>constrained</em> by electron, the idea that a web browser needs a second to switch tabs is silly. When all you're making is a chat app, a browser is perfectly capable on any modern device.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Visual studio code is electron too right? It always felt way more snappier than teams. Even for big projects with ors of files.
The thing that bugs me about teams is that the desktop application is so sluggish but the ios app is very fast.</p>
<p>I used to only use my ipad for teams at work. Next to my computer. But now I don’t even get that because my company changed security policies and want to manage my device.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha so relatable. Same here, I hate the desktop app with a passion. I always use it through chrome, works much better. And indeed, I always noticed the best experience is on an iPad.  Battery life of my ipad is a disaster though with Teams running. It goes down fast running teams chats, than when I am gaming on it with my playstation 4 controller connected over bluetooth. </p>
<p>By the way, is your company using intune? There is a setting that they lock down teams, but not your entire ipad. This is, as far as I can tell, not intrusive. Downside is of course you cannot copy paste into/out of the app, access your on-device files or any other cloud fiel services like dropbox, cannot use your camera, and to click on weblinks in teams chats, it needs to open in Edge of all browsers (so yes, I had to install Edge on my ipad because of this ... and only use it for work)</p>
<p>If anybody reading this tells me this setting still allows my company admins to see/control stuff outside the teams app on my ipad, please let me know.</p>
<p>I did lose teams on my android phone though, because then I would need to install the actual intune app on it, and give up total control.</p>
<p>VScode is electron too, but the real bottleneck of teams is the API layer. Code is very local, almost never needs to call some API over the network, that's why its more or less ok.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Meanwhile, modern computer games draw millions and millions of 3d triangles on the screen in less than 0.02 seconds. There is no technical explanation for this. It's just laziness on the developer side.</p>

<p>Actually there is. </p>
<p>Videocards are completly different kind of hardware than CPUs. They are specificly designed to do those calculations as fast as possible. They have the same components repeated over and over again.  Multiple components to do fixed and floating point calculations. Thousands of computations done in parallel.</p>
<p>Normal CPUs are built to do a variety of task. Jack of all trades, master of none.</p>
<p>It's like comparing your knife at home with a fillet knife used by a butcher. You can use your all purpose knife for the same job, but it won't be as efficient as the fillet knife. And the fillet knife won't be good at cutting bread while your all purpose knife is slightly better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Besides, I wouldn't call it lazyness.</p>
<p>Developer here, I am not lazy, I do actually not have enough time to make things perfect and deadlines do not permit it, it's more like a &quot;best effort&quot; approach as for any other software issue which we face every day. If we don't use a best effort approach, I can assure you would not have 3/4 of the software which are at disposal right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, due to deadlines, developer experience is often valued more than user experience.<br />
If an app takes 300ms more to do something, but makes it easier for devs to work on, optimisation will be postponed until there are a few of these to optimise - and until there is time/budget.</p>
<p>Modern development is very much feature driven</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's no excuse for how abysmal the performance of MS Teams is.</p>
<p>It literally freezes for second when switching chats, and that should just be fetching messages from the API and rendering boxes on the screen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus there's obviously the cost /benefit equation.</p>
<p>Assuming you could work on the chat tab switching thing (assuming that's true) and bring it down from 1s to 0.1s </p>
<p>Will customers care ? Will you sell one more Teams license because of this ? Is it development time well spent ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which still does not explain the lag in MS chat that was described. It’s just „laziness“; or more precisely nobody took care to optimize the view, it’s likely cluttered from subviews with unnecessary real time text rendering, and so force.</p>
<p>Nobody took care because it’s not an important selling point for the software. Constant &gt;30fps in a shooter game is, as we have learned from the cyberpunk debacle (again).</p>
<p>You are correct that GPUs are quite specialized, but everything else is blazingly fast these days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Overall decent comment, but </p>
<p>1) comparing rendering text with a CPU to rendering graphics with a GPU are different matters.</p>
<p>2) developers aren't lazy. They've got time and budget constraints to work with. They're not doing the bare minimum because they couldn't be asked to do beggerz they do the bare minimum because they have finite resources and need to prioritize what gets more attention.</p></div>		</li>
