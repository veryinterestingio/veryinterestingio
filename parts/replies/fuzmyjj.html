			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I’m glad someone pointed that out. Although the two sets given in the original post are actually the same ‘size’ of infinity, that’s not true for all infinite sets - it is possible to have one infinite set being ‘bigger’ than another.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, a countable set is a set that has &quot;as much&quot; elements as the set of the natural integer(ie &gt;=0). For example, you can pair each relative integer with a natural integer (0-&gt;0,1-&gt;1,-1-&gt;2,2-&gt;3,-2 - &gt;4 etc.). What you are doing is counting the elements, hence the name. In opposition, you can't count the elements of [0,1]. (An easy to understand proof is the prrof by  <a href="http://mathonline.wikidot.com/the-set-of-real-numbers-is-uncountable" target="_blank">diagonalization</a>).</p>
<p>In short, all countable infinite sets have the same &quot;size&quot;, and are &quot;smaller&quot; than uncountable sets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would imply that infinity can be measured though? Isn’t infinity just a concept to represent something that is quite literally uncountable? We say something is infinite when its measurable size does not exist as a countable, feasible integer? To say the set of integers is larger than the set of real numbers is a fallacy because neither set is countable. It is not conclusive that one of these sets is larger than the other because there is no such thing as “the biggest number.” Using infinity so loosely is probably why so many people find it hard to understand in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are different types of infinities, the natural numbers are a countable infinity since they’re infinite but we’re able to list them all out theoretically i.e. they can be “counted”. Examples of countable infinities are the natural numbers, even numbers, odd numbers, perfect squares, prime numbers etc. </p>
<p>The real numbers are an uncountable infinity though. Theres no way we could ever list them off, they’re just too dense. And continuous interval is an uncountable infinity. So the set of all real numbers are an uncountable infinity, but so are the real numbers between 1&amp;10 or even between 0.000001 and 0.000002</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've taken the &quot;infinity is not a number&quot; thing way too far, and in fact the differences between infinities even has real applications in probability and statistics. Discrete vs continuous infinity is actually somewhat important in that realm. </p>
<p>So while infinity is certainly not a real number, as in &quot;not an element of the set named the real numbers&quot;, and is also certainly not an integer, that doesn't mean there can't be infinities that aren't real numbers or integers. And their sizes can be measured, as has been described.</p>
<p>Here's an example of making an infinity:</p>
<p>You say there is no largest number, and in normal English, that means &quot;there is no largest real number&quot; or perhaps &quot;there is no largest integer&quot;, and that's absolutely correct.</p>
<p>But you have to remember that numbers are points, and while we like to think of the natural numbers as a series of evenly spaced dots going out forever, you don't actually have to think of them like that.</p>
<p>So instead of laying out the natural numbers like that, instead grab the real line, and put 0 at 0, 1 at 1/2, 2 at 3/4, 4 at 7/8, and so on.</p>
<p>Every single natural number fits between the reals 0 and 1, without using the number 1.</p>
<p>Now put another dot at 1. It is to the right of, hence greater than, all of the natural numbers you put down. It isn't a natural number, but there's no reason you can't put a dot down and start talking about &quot;the natural numbers and also this dot&quot;.</p>
<p>And since that dot is greater than all the naturals, you could call it infinity - but we usually call it omega, because again there can be several infinite numbers.</p>
<p>So now you have constructed the first infinity: The ordinal omega. But of course, there's nothing stopping you from putting a dot to the right of that, and calling it omega + 1. And continuing on.</p>
<p>But then you might realize that for many of these infinities, you could rearrange the dots to get the other infinities. You didn't use more dots to make omega + 1 than to make omega: take the last one, put it before 0, rename the naturals appropriately, and now you have omega again. Move both dots before 0, and you're back to the normal naturals, with no infinite numbers at all.</p>
<p>So are there an infinite sets that cannot be rearranged into each other? The answer is yes. You <em>can</em> take the natural numbers and rearrange them to get the integers, but you <em>cannot</em> rearrange them to get the reals. But you <em>can</em> take some of the elements from the reals and arrange them to form the naturals. Thus, we say the reals are larger than the naturals, despite both being infinite. </p>
<p>This is a way of measuring the sizes of infinite sets: if two sets can both be rearranged to match each other, they are the same size, if not then not. It's not the same as holding up a ruler, but it's a form of measurement nonetheless - and the various sizes you can get are called the cardinals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! You're talking about a concept called cardinality:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>If you can map between two sets without any leftovers, they're of the same cardinality.  If you can't, one has a higher cardinality than the other.</p></div>		</li>
