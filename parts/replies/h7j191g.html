			<div class="markdown"><p>I got a topical ointment from my doctor that’s a steroidal cream that knocks it out in 3-5 days. The only time it took longer was when I had a super large spot (probably golf ball sized) and that took 7-10 days to disappear.</p>
<p>It may also be psoriasis. The doctor didn’t diagnose what it was specifically. They behave very similarly as well and respond to the steroid treatment. I probably need to get to a dermatologist and get an official diagnosis and treatment plan, but I have so much shit going on right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been to dermatologists and have the cream. Only problem is that it never goes away completely and you're not supposed to use the cream for too long. Wash your face regularly as well as pillow cases, etc. That's the treatment plan. Not much else they can do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on which cream. For a steroid (usually betamethasone) then this is true as topical steroids will cause the outer layer of skin to thin making the living tissue underneath more prone to irritation. For an antifungal (usually either Ketoconazole or Clotrimazole) then you can use them indefinitely with no negative side effects.</p>
<p>Seborrheic dermatitis can have two root causes. One is an overproduction of sebum (skin oil) which leads to an overabundance of the absolutely normal yeast that lives on every single human being's skin multiplying out of control because it's a buffet. The excretions of these fungus after they eat is an irritant to human skin and will cause the skin to shed as your body attempts to expel the irritant. The second cause is being more sensitive or allergic to the yeast's secretions than the average person. Both of these alone can cause seborrheic dermatitis, but some people unfortunately have both. The typical person without either of these afflictions receives such small quantities of the yeasts secretions that it doesn't affect them in any way.</p>
<p>The steroid is used to treat the inflammation while the antifungal keeps the yeast population under control. The steroid should only be used if and when you have a lot of redness or scaling. Basically, it's used to get the dermatitis under control. Afterwards, you use the antifungal daily which is perfectly safe and keep the steroids around in case of another breakout. And yes, frequent face washing is highly recommended for people suffering seborrheic dermatitis. Remember to dry thoroughly otherwise the yeast will have a very hospitably moist environment in which to breed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My ears are just disgusting with what I'm pretty sure is  seborrheic dermatitis. It's been going on for years. I need to see a dermatologist, but I don't want to jam a bunch of ointment crap in my ears, so I've put it off year after year.</p></div>		</li>
