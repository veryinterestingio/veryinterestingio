<p>Very heavy emphasis on <strong><em>WE</em></strong>. Its not just the rich people destroying the poor peoples lives. Its everyone that decided to take a better quality of life at the expense of the less affluent/able</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Misery is outsourced to other people. If you have money you can live a comfortable life.</p>
<p>What bothers me about inequality is the ability for corporations to use their power to protect themselves further against the less affluent/able. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Philip Morris v. Uruguay case started on 19 February 2010, when the multinational tobacco company Philip Morris International filed a complaint against Uruguay. The company complains that <strong>Uruguay's anti-smoking legislation devalues its cigarette trademarks and investments in the country and is suing Uruguay for compensation</strong>.</p>

<p>They are trying to put the ability to sue governments for loss of profits into &quot;free trade&quot; agreements such as TTIP and NAFTA, which is why there was so much pushback some time ago. They hope to nip any regulation in the bud with those agreements.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The ISDS actually works quite reasonably in practice. Not to mention that they have no enforcement arm outside of just removing the country from the free trade agreement and any country can leave a trade agreement more or less at will.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is where government <strong>should</strong> come in, to protect those who don't have the ability to protect themselves from being exploited and marginalized by those with the power. Instead, half of our politicians are working their hardest to convince people that they should just trust the powerful not to use their power and that the government can't help them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. That's what regulation is for, and that's why middle and lower income people shouldn't vote for conservatives. Their <strong>entire</strong> philosophy is anti-regulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are under the mistaken impressions that government serves the people, and that the government is more powerful than private business owners. The government is just a vehicle though which the upper class, the rich business owners, manages the economy for its own benefit. A government that serves the workers must necessarily be socialist.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are three people in a room, a rich man, a working class man and an immigrant. There are 10 apples in this room.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait can you explain why they are 1/2 now? You said we changed economic system. How did it change and why did the best worker get 2 more instead of 1 more and the idea man get 3 more? I like the analogy though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very easy. Cost of living increases all the time. Wages however, did not, at least not in the lower regon incomes. </p>
<p>So even without chaning wages, it is becoming less and less by default. That is why a healthy economic system takes inflation and rise of cost of living into account to constanntly adjust wages to compensate. A practice that stopped in the 80ies</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's pretend that /u/This_Is_The_End said it was &quot;15 baskets&quot; of apples instead of &quot;15 apples&quot;...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Due to a mix of changes in technology and inflation, the size of a &quot;standard&quot; basket is now bigger.  Also, an old basket sold for $80 at market, the new, bigger baskets go for $120/each.  Those four workers may be getting the same number/weight of apples in their 1/2 basket, in truth they are really only $60 for their work now.  (Cost of living increases not keeping up with inflation.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Idea Man sold his extra apples every year and saved the money so they could buy the orchard, so now he demands more of he harvest, hired security to make sure nobody steals any apples, and on top of now calling themselves the CEO of the orchard and it's landlord, they get all the extra apples or they threaten to burn the orchard down so nobody can have any.  (I can't think of a less clumsy metaphor for the massive rise in CEO/executive pay and the investor class demand for return on dividends at all cost, but the two groups which frequently overlap...)   </p>
</li>
<li>In-fighting among the workers meant the two best workers go a job title and extra apples, and a few of the workers also got pay bumps that allow them to just keep up with inflation so they don't look for jobs at some other orchard for better pay.  But like This_Is_The_end points out, it's only going to enough workers to keep 6/10 people happy.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anyone here read Malthus? In addition to competition in pay, there is competition in goods. Malthus noted that welfare has the consequence of hurting the guy just above the threshold for benefits, most. Why? Because by increasing the buying power of low income individuals, welfare increases demand, but not supply. This puts upward pressure on prices. Malthus pointed out that the guy in the most danger is the person just making a little too much to get welfare. He is the one competing with those on welfare for similar goods. The welfare recipient isn't buy caviar, he's buying bread. So its the bread that goes up in price. But the guys already buying the bread now must pay more for it.</p></div>		</li>
