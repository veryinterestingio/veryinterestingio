<p>Edit: Also want to plug my other favorite British youtubers who also have a <a href="https://youtu.be/BtYKDamqo2I" target="_blank">kinda but not totally relevant video</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Both Scott's Youtube channel (05-2006) and xkcd (09-2005) are less than a year younger than reddit (06-2005). That's why they're relevant so often, they've been around a long time and covered a lot of stuff.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The 4K streams Iâ€™ve seen are much lower bitrate than an HD disc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Too many variables there to give a blanket answer. Some of those variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>anything on a disc is going to be using an older codec which is less efficient at storing data. </li>
<li>discs have a lot of data available to use</li>
<li>your 4k stream might be from a provider who is trying to highlight their service and encoded it at a particularly high bit rate.</li>
<li>your disc might be an older master</li>
<li>you could be viewing this on a 1080p screen</li>
<li>hdr support</li>
<li>etc</li>

<p>That's not true.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>4k Discs use the same codec as most streams (x265)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or in Netflix's case, require you to perform a magic ritual and align the planets to get a 4k stream (on pc, at least)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming we're still talking about a 1080p Display, another interesting wrinkle here is chroma subsampling.</p>
<p>The 4K video, downscaled to 1080p, would wind up not being chroma subsampled, while the Blu-ray still would be. Honestly, I doubt that would make a huge difference, but it might be noticable side by side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Streaming codecs in general are designed to be adjustable in quality. That's their main strength (what allows them to adjust to the connection quality on the fly). So every one of them has a &quot;quality knob&quot;, that's automated to some degree by default. And content providers can adjust this knob for other reasons, to regulate their bandwidth, or to fit different types of content, or even to incentivize better payment plans... So no blanket answer.</p></div>		</li>
