			<div class="markdown"><p>Therapist and clinical director of private psych practice here, to expand on this excellent and correct answer with a different take:</p>
<p><strong>Why</strong> are some people more prone to this than others? </p>
<p>In my clinical work with couples, people who most resist &quot;being controlled&quot; ie lashing out or becoming defensive in these situations are those who have avoidant attachment style.</p>
<p>Avoidant attachment is a personality trait that develops when you are made to be overly independent, and have less experience with things like empathy and emotional expression. You learn to negate, ignore, suppress emotions and needs.</p>
<p>If you are used to tending to your own feelings, solving your own problems, and doing things for yourself instead of asking for help, it triggers you when people vent their feelings to you, ask you for help, or expect you to do tasks for them that you have done for yourself </p>
<p>Within relationships, I would argue against the classic intrinsic/extrinsic model and argue for attachment wounds, with the primary cause of OPs behaviour being attachment based protest behaviour. &quot;I have earned my independence, don't tell me to do something even if I was already going to do it.. my free will is a reward for my emotional struggle and will not be taken from me&quot;</p>
<p>It's the same reason older people get triggered when youths have an easier time of something. &quot;In my day we didn't have these tractors, we had to plough fields with ox. You lazy kids!&quot; Why not be happy people have to do less? Well, you didn't have that privilege, so it can trigger you to see someone else have access to it. Unfairness.</p>
<p>In married couples, resistance to helping someone is most often the same thing. &quot;Don't ask me for help, and if what I'm doing is now going to be framed as helping you, I won't do it. You don't get to feel that if I never did&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really interesting comment.</p>
<p>I'm avoidant and struggled to establish good habits after my diabetes diagnosis when my mother was constantly 'reminding' me to do basic things like testing and taking injections. It very much made me feel like I was only going through the motions to avoid criticism or to try and reduce future prompts rather than because I wanted to be healthy. I still find myself unable to test, calculate carbs, and inject on any sort of healthy regimen, although I'm wondering if that's a hold-over from the early days of failing to handle it or if there's another issue at play.</p>
<p>This also affects things like housework. I've moved back in with parents after living alone for years, and I find it basically impossible to do any chores while my parent is home/might become aware of the work being done before I complete it. Of course, having a depressed parent who is almost always home and expects me to do all of the housework in common areas is just leading to a very dysfunctional household.</p>
<p>Do you have advice on how I can address these sorts of problems?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes - find a good attachment therapist! </p>
<p>A distant second is personal reflection. Ask yourself why you enact these behaviours, how they help you (if it seems like they don't, keep digging - animals don't execute unhelpful behaviours repeatedly) and what the consequences are. When you have more awareness, it's easier to change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had similar things happen with my family. My parents made me take piano lessons from age 7 to 17. I hated the lessons but occasionally enjoyed being able to use the skills I learned for fun. But it was always an instant mood killer when they'd pop by the piano and make comments like &quot;looks like those lessons are paying off&quot;.</p>
<p>They'd often do things for me even if I'd done them myself. Most recent example is my dad offered, out of the blue, to replace my mattress. A nice gesture but for an unneeded item. I have a futon but only ever keep it in bed form so we were going to get a regular mattress, not a folding futon one. My dad asked the dimensions of my mattress to make sure it was the same as a regular mattress (full size). My room is a bit cramped where my bed is but what I got was within an inch of standard ones. My dad didn't like my measurement and wanted too measure, himself, despite him originally telling me to do it. As I've been in therapy I stood up for myself saying I did it right. Then I did a bunch of googling for futon and standard mattress sizes and sent him links that they're the same. But he refused to buy me a mattress without measuring it, himself. </p>
<p>Before that they are the ones that put in my application to college even though I didn't know what I wanted to do and wanted to take a year off. So they set me on a degree path. A year in I wanted something else, but since they took parent loans they didn't want me to start something else, so I had to finish what they picked for me. Now I'm 40k in debt for a degree I never wanted. </p>
<p>I've told them that my struggles stem from them making my life choices for me, making it feel like my life isn't even my own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The housework thing is super relatable. I can’t clean my apartment if my roommate is home because it feels really overwhelming. But when he’s not around, I’m totally fine with doing the dishes or laundry or sweeping and mopping the kitchen.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most couples don't ever talk about emotional dynamics. A great conversation would be asking him how he perceives you asking for help. </p>
<p>Avoidant is one side of the coin - if this sounds like your husband, you likely have a preoccupied anxious attachment style. Most of the time the woman is more P/A and the man is more avoidant.</p>
<p>The husband's complaints are usually that his wife is emotionally demanding or impossible to please. They feel lots of shame and inadequacy but don't have the tools to express it. </p>
<p>They feel anything they say makes their wives angrier, so they try not to say anything. Or they get mad to try to back her off.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, wife interprets silence as you don't care about me and gets triggered and escalates. She becomes more upset and he feels more ashamed and inadequate. Rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>When couples have these conversations it changes their marriage. Just knowing what's going on when your partner shuts down or gets defensive, what they're thinking or feeling, helps a lot.</p>
<p>Golden rule of relationships: if you're frustrated, start asking questions.</p>
<p>Frustration is a symptom of not understanding someone or their motivations.</p>
<p>Clarifying questions are important - how do you see me? Why do you think I nag you? How often do I nag you? Do I do other things that make you feel the same way? How does this affect our relationship? What do you think I think of you?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm like this too, and honestly I think the best way to get around it is to ensure he views chores as a team effort, not as you being the household manager making him do stuff. Try phrases like &quot;we need to do dishes and laundry before we leave the house, which do you want?&quot; or try coming up with a daily chore schedule between you with equal input from him so that he views the chores he does as his own choice.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you genuinely <em>shouldn't</em> be the household chores manager. This isn't the 50s. If this is causing serious problems you might need to get him to acknowledge this behaviour and seek help for it. And that might not be pretty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My first thought was that when you are doing something on your own you are mostly conforming to your own standards, but when somebody else tells you to do it they have also made you responsible for satisfying their standards (or those of a competition). One can easily succeed at completing a task for themselves, but success becomes more difficult or even unattractive for someone else.</p>
<p>TLDR: You generally know what you want to achieve with a task, but it’s difficult, impossible, or unattractive (etc) to know/consider what someone else wants you to achieve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting. My kids and I have a schedule of &quot;reading time&quot; and &quot;board game time&quot; and it's been working out fine for us until recently my daughter told me that playing board games wasn't as fun anymore because she now feels that she &quot;has to play.&quot; I'm afraid this might creep into reading as well. I know that they love reading and really get into our games when we're playing, but when I take away our schedule during holidays and school breaks they just revert to sticking to their phones and gadgets all day, which prompted me talking to them about it and they actually agreeing that it was bad for them. And so they suggested, &quot;Why don't we put up a schedule?&quot; And so here we are.</p>
<p>I'd like to build a balanced healthy routine for my kids that takes some of their time away from gadgets and watching, but if this &quot;extrinsic motivation&quot; method is actually scaring them away, I'm open to suggestions on how I could approach this differently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a psychologist, but as a parent who wishes I’d approached it this way, I would do something similar to what you’ve been doing, tweaking it as you go along. Keep the kids involved in the schedule-making. Identify which things it is important to make time to do: tidying their spaces, doing homework, pursuing goals in their hobbies/interests (for example, music, sports, art). Once you all have the important things identified, work with them to fit those things into the schedule, with you asking them lots of questions of how much time each item on the list should take, especially versus how much time they’d <em>like</em> it to take. You can role play with your own schedule to show them. Perhaps your hobby is creating cosplay. You might <em>like</em> to spend every evening creating your costume, but to be well-rounded, you also need to devote time to other items on the list, so you will only reasonably be able to devote two hours, two nights a week - that’s still four hours that wouldn’t get done if you didn’t schedule it. So, maybe you also want to be sure that you spend time with your family, so that gets a time slot, planning your menus for the best nutritional value gets a time slot, etc.. This way they also learn how to schedule, how to evaluate their needs vs their wants, &amp; they have some measure of autonomy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree 100 percent. Yeah, involving them in making their schedule helps tremendously. They get to see how many hours their gadget time takes, so when I ask them, &quot;so is it fair to devote 2-3 hours of board game or movie time for the family per week? see how little chores and reading take up your time?&quot; it makes more sense to them. Next time we talk about scheduling, I'll make them decide how to allot their time and see how it goes from there. Thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To me, motivational crowding out doesn't mean that you should never use extrinsic motivators - there are plenty of situations where extrinsic motivators are needed because there are little to no intrinsic motivators, and society would probably collapse if everyone decided to only do what they felt like doing.   </p>
<p>What to do with your kids is beyond my academic expertise, but I think your idea of involving your kids in planning their schedules is a good one. I'd suggest negotiating a daily allotment of screentime versus reading time versus whatever else time, and let them decide what goes when. I'm not a parent, but in my experiences teaching students, they seem to respond well to being given some autonomy, even when it's constrained.</p>
<p>An aside which is more about nurturing creativity/curiosity, if your daughter is tired of playing boardgames, maybe you can make an activity out of inventing a new boardgame or a new twist to the rules of an existing boardgame? There's some neat work with little kids showing that if you give them a toy that does ABCD things and tell them, &quot;This toy does A and B&quot;, they'll just play with it in the A and B ways and not discover that C and D exist. Whereas if you give kids the same toy and tell them to just play with it, they'll explore it and find more ways to play with it. <a href="http://eccl.mit.edu/papers/BonawitzShaftoetal2011.pdf" target="_blank">(PDF link to study)</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the suggestions! And thanks for the perspective on motivators—I do agree that structure does help and is sometimes necessary.</p>
<p>I've tried giving my kids &quot;free play&quot; schedules before, but I noticed that they just gravitated towards doing the same thing, with my daughter reading and my son drawing and painting the entire time period. I wanted a bit more variety, which is why we came up with our subsections of &quot;free play&quot; time such as reading, exercise and family time (movie night, board game night, etc).</p>
<p>As for board games, well, I'm a bit of a collector, and we have hundreds of board games around the house. Modern games probably fit your suggestion of integrating creativity, in that a lot of games give you a bunch of components and some rules and tell you that it's up to you to figure out how to win or how to score the most points, usually done through a multitude of ways. I can say that board games have helps my kids a lot, not just in being strategic, but it also teaches them patience, sportsmanship, team play, etc., and all this in a fun manner. I'll have to figure out a way to keep my daughter interested in board games without scaring her away because I honestly believe it improves her as a person and tightens our family bond.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a simpler solution, why not flip it around? They already like reading and board games, so they're happy enough to do that in their free time already and the intrinsic motivation is already there. Just schedule phone and gadget time instead and make clear boundaries for when gadgets shouldn't be used, like meal time or bedtime.</p>
<p>Plus it's really good they are aware, agree and on board with less gadget time, so if it's presented as an option and they are part of the planning process then it's also their choice rather than a punishment or enforced upon them. Afterwards, you can check back in and ask about how the usage changes are and if they feel they have been able to do more of the other things they like to do and revise together if needed. So it's more guided but self-initiated behaviour where they have freedom of choice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the suggestion. That was our initial schedule, with just &quot;no gadget time&quot; implemented, but I found that they just stuck to their own same activity over and over again. But I wanted for them to have a healthy variety of activities; hence, the sub-schedules we have today. </p>
<p>I once gave them &quot;free time&quot; by allowing them to choose the order of what they want to do first as long as they do them within the day (for some/week for others). I think this is the best approach, but it takes some mental load from me as a parent to check up on and enforce (plus I think them needing to &quot;log in&quot; their time is a bit too much. We also tried with me giving them poker chips for accomplishments done—still a bit too much for me). Our sched right now is easier to check, 'cause if it's reading time, then I know we're all reading, or if it's Friday, then we'll be having move night tonight. I believe the routine is good for them too.</p>
<p>I think what works most for us is a balance between &quot;free time&quot; mixed in with some scheduled activities that need to be done (i.e. chores, family time). The reason I asked OP in the first place was because our board game time was meeting resistance with my daughter, but I didn't want to let it go 'cause I think it's an important family activity. I think I just need a different approach so she doesn't think she's being coerced into playing. Other than this everything seems to be working out fine so far. Thanks again for the suggestions and I will keep them in mind when next we do our schedules.</p></div>		</li>
