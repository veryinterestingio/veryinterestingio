			<div class="markdown"><p>A British company has developed an antibody test that takes 10 minutes to get the results and is very cheap. Itâ€™s entering testing stages now, so hopefully before too long there will be a quick and easy way for us all to access this test. It will hugely improve our collective response to the virus, as those who have recovered will be able to resume more public roles, but care will still be needed to avoid spreading the virus via objects and clothing.</p></div>		</li>
