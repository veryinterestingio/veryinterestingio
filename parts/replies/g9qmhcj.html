			<div class="markdown"><p>It can also cause general dysautonomia which can be pretty disabling. In my experience some doctors assume it simply means &quot;dizziness on standing&quot; and others understand it as a complex chronic health condition. It's often (but not always) associated with a genetic connective tissue disorder called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/page.php?ID=30" target="_blank">Dysautonomia International</a> has a pretty good explanation of POTS.</p>
<p>I have severe neurological dysfunction, but I never faint and I don't experience a lot of dizziness. Unfortunately where I live no one knows much about POTS and my doctors usually ask <em>me</em> questions about it (including &quot;what is it?&quot;)</p></div>		</li>

<p>not sure about that... i once saw a kid fall flat on her back from the monkey bars..(6'?), she cried for 15 minutes.  If i do that, I think i would cry for 3 hours and probably break something.</p></div>		</li>
