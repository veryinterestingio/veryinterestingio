			<div class="markdown"><p>I went to Vegas two years in a row, the first year I went was the first time. I was blown away that you could smoke in the mother fuckin' mall, I loved it. The next year I went back and I went to ash it and there was no ash tray on any of the trash cans, just a hole where they used to be. Nobody said anything to me though, and I finished my cigarette, ashing in my hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just ash.. It's not pleasant because some sticks to your hand, but it typically isn't hot if you've let a decent amount accumulate. Once you're sure it's cool you can throw it away safely.</p></div>		</li>
