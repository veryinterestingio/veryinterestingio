			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm one of the students that got done a disservice. In the power industry now, but your explanation actually made me understand the basics intuitively for the first time. Whenever I would ask those critical thinking questions like <em>what is happening on a physical level to create potential, current, or resistance</em>, my professor would just hem and haw and we'd move on. </p>
<p>Can you expand more on any other elective topics like this? For example capacitance and inductance? What is happening physically that creates those concepts?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll give it a try for capacitance:</p>
<p>You know what a capacitor is: In the simplest case, two plates of metal with some insulator in between. </p>
<p>Let's first imagine the plates to be far away from each other. We connect a battery, which then charges the two plates. What does this mean? The battery (remember: an electron pump) pulls electrons from one plate (the one connected to its plus terminal) and pushes them onto the other plate. </p>
<p>Now remember that there are not only moveable electrons in the metal plates but also the rest of the atoms: the whole atom, including it movable outer electrons, the immovable inner electrons and the positively charged atomic nucleus, is electrically neutral. However, once the battery pulls electrons off the plate, the charges are no longer balanced and the whole plate is now positively charged. The other plate, with the extra electrons pushed onto it, is negatively charged.</p>
<p>This is why the battery will only be able to pump for a brief moment. Then, the positively charged plate will pull back the electrons that the battery tries to pull off, and the positively charged plate will push away the electrons that the battery tries to push onto it. Our circuit is not closed, so everything comes to a standstill after only a very little bit of current has flown.</p>
<p>But now, we bring the two plates really close together. Now, the electrons that the battery tries to push onto the negative plate will not only feel the repelling push from the electrons that have already been pushed there but also the <em>pull</em> from the positively charged plate which is now so close by. </p>
<p>And the electrons that the battery tries to pull from the positive plate will get a little extra push from the negative plate that is now right next to it. So, even though the two plates are not connected, they are so close that the electrons feel the charge from the other plate.</p>
<p>And hence, things can move again and more current can flow before the system comes to a standstill again. With the plates together, the battery can pump  more electrons from one plate to the other than before, when the plates were far apart. We say that the &quot;capacity&quot; of the two plates to take up charge has increased because we moved the plates together. </p>
<p>A capacitance of 1 Farad means that a battery with 1 Volt will manage to pump 1 Coulomb of charge (i.e., 6*10^18 electrons) from one side of the capacitor to the other before current flow stops. To get a high capacitance, you need to make the plates big (to offer room for the electrons) and get the plates close together (so that the electron can feel the charge on the other plate). This is why the capacitance of a plate capacitor is proportional to the area of the plates divided by distance between the plates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this - there's a voltage at which even the staunchest insulator will allow current to flow through it.
Please correct me if I'm wrong, I've only studied electronics tengentially to other studies, but I believe this is what allows a charge to build up to a certain point before allowing current to flow through the capacitor, effectively creating a &quot;delay&quot; on the circuit.
So electrons can only jump through the insulator between the plates after the plates reach a critical potential/voltage, and different capacitors achieve different thresholds by adjusting the size of the plates, the distance between them, the thickness of the insulator and the type of insulator.</p>
<p>Again this is my relatively uneducated understanding, please correct me if I am mistaken</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because if you get down to it, what's happening at the physical level is quite a bit more complicated than the picture presented in the post you're replying to. It's a useful picture but a simplified picture nonetheless. </p>
<p>If you actually want to go down to the 'physical level', you need to deal with funny things like the quantum behaviour of electrons, solid state physics, etc, all of which were beyond the scope of the course your professor was trying to teach. Anything else is just another analogy that may or may not be more applicable or easier to understand than the picture of water in pipes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;why&quot; can be asked ad infinitum until the answer is &quot;we don't know yet&quot;, and professors have to take their limited time into consideration; however I don't think they should avoid the question. They should direct students to the right source to find the answer themselves. They should also humbly explain why they won't answer the question.  </p>
<p>Call me an idealist, but I dislike answers that dissuade impressionable students from seeking further education.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whether the explanation is in terms of electrons as balls or in terms of the math in quantum physics and fields, they are all abstractions if the underlying physical phenomena. The latter being more precise and capable of describing the system together with other physical forces. Learning is a stepwise process. Early scientist didn't arrive at quantum physics and fields right away. They started with explanations using concepts they understood and then drilled down into areas where those concepts fell apart and couldn't explain observations made. What wrong is it for us to learn through that same process of exploration?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you've just explained would help many 1st/2nd year engineering students - it's a brilliant summary.
I didn't understand above until I did an electromagnetism unit in uni (which came after many units of looking at circuits...).</p></div>		</li>
