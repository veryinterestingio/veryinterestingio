			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, thanks. I once held a (small) presentation about that concept. And judging from the wikipedia page it sadly does not seem to have advanced much since I did that in 2007 or when that was.</p>
<p>One of the biggest problems with such a design was the linear accelerator that needs to produce currents that are outside of the reach of the accelerators that existed or were affordable and, even worse, the uptimes have a very tight requirement. The beam must not fail for longer than very short (I cannot remember again which it was, but it was in the order of few seconds). That required quality regarding the beam was far outside of what current proton accelerators could do. </p>
<p>The most interesting aspect of the Rubbiatron is that long-lasting and high-risk waste could get transmuted into material that decays much faster, and you also get energy out on top of that. Thus, if such a design were to work, we could transmute a lot of the problematic waste we have today into something that is saner to manage. That's why I think it is sad there does not seem to be a lot of research in that direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this information. </p>
<p>Their website states in news from Sept 2018 that the financing of around 560 million euros is decided by the belgium government and that the facility is  expected to go into service in 2026. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fast neutron reactors (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast-neutron_reactor" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast-neutron_reactor</a>) have all the benefits you list in your last paragraph. Considerable research is being done with fast reactors to make them safer and economically competitive, so don't worry! The tech will be there in the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose I should also mention that molten salt reactors (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molten_salt_reactor" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molten_salt_reactor</a>) have also been making progress in the commercial sector and some designs propose using spent fuel from thermal neutron reactors in order to better use up the fuel and provide those benefits mentioned above in reducing the half-lives of the waste. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SHINE Medical Technologies is using a similar approach for a medical isotope plant.  An accelerator will create fusion neutrons which will drive a subcritical assembly.</p>
