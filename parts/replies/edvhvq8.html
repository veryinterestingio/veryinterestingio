			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I understand it, it can take your body up to four days to totally digest food. I recently found out I have dietary sensitivities to sugar, dairy, and cayenne. For years, I might notice bloat or discomfort about 7 hours after eating these things (though I didn't know what was causing it), but my body would ache for the next three days or so after, feels like the flu - muscle aches, awful lower back pain. Anyways, since I didn't know what was causing the discomfort, I felt sick all the time, but it was my normal so I thought I was fine with occasional discomfort. Fast forward a couple years and the digestive discomfort was so bad it made me vomit every night. Couldn't figure out what it was, but it was bad enough I knew something needed to change. Enter the food sensitivity test and a strict elimination diet, and my body felt like I was in high school. No aches, so much energy, no mood swings. It was night and day. Didn't answer the question, but I guess the bottom line is that digestion can take longer than you think.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How did you find out? I've been having these issues on and off, sometimes ongoing for weeks, but I can never identify what it is - I've been thinking it might just have been stress, plus eating too much of the same stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best way to figure out possible intolerance or mild allergens (mild meaning not causing full anaphylaxis) is an elimination diet. Just FYI intolerance/sensitivity = gut reaction, allergen = immune reaction. A lot of people use terms interchangeably but it's important to know the difference. Go down to bare bones, then slowly add foods back in and see if/how you react. Keeping food and symptoms long are important. </p>
<p>Food intolerance/sensitivity doesn't show up on tests, again because it is not an immune reaction. (IgG is not at all valid for this, even though some places will try and sell it to you.) Allergy testing can be good, but it's just the beginning of showing you where to look (IF you have food allergies). You can be allergic to a food and it may not come up on allergy tests. You can not be allergic to food and have it come up positive on allergy tests. (Recently went through the whole false positive allergy testing thing, so I've done a lot of research around it). The gold standard for intolerance or allergy is if you are symptomatic after eating a food. The tests are just helpful tools to attempt to narrow it down. Of course if you have any mild anaphylaxis like symptoms (itching, swelling, tingly/numb mouth, hives, tight throat), allergy testing, possibly followed by a food challenge, can be the fastest way to find what is causing your reaction.  </p>
