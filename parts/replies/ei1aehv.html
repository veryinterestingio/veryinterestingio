			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this: No material is truly &quot;ohmic&quot;. The linear relation is an approximation. However many materials behaves very similar to this in certain situations. And it is therefore much easier to calculate their behaviour if we just assume linearity within a certain range of conditions, rather than some very complex quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>It is kinda the same thing as with elasticity. No materials truly follow Hooks law. But under certain conditions(like small deformations) they get very close. So we save ourself the trouble and describe them with much simpler models, well knowing that it only works as an approximation within a small range of conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Superconductors would be very non-ohmic. With zero resistance, the I-V curve is vertical...up to a point. Superconductors have upper bounds to their current carrying capacity due to the magnetic fields created by the current. Large magnetic fields drive the material out of the superconducting state. This process is different in different types of superconductors, but the effect is still the same.</p>
<p>Then, once back in the normal state, it would depend on the material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Superconductors basically relate to this by allowing as many electrons in the ground state because the electrons move in Cooper pairs and therefore act as bosons instead of fermions. So instead of having any slope, they would have a slope of zero where normal conduction that slope is basically a relation of the number of states/elections it is possible to have at any energy....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess, ohmic until you get to the saturation current or whatever the proper term is.  Just, R=0, so you get some absurdity when you try to use the formula - the voltage can't tell you the current anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tungsten does not only allow a certain amount of current to pass. </p>
<p>Tungsten heats up and increases in resistance in response to that, but then so does basically all conductive materials. (Some alloys may be made to have a neutral or even negative temp coefficient)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-ohmic-and-vs-non-ohmic-conductors/" target="_blank">https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-ohmic-and-vs-non-ohmic-conductors/</a></p>
<p>States that tungsten is indeed ohmic and only becomes non ohmic due to temperature increasing its resistance. but that is true of just about everything.</p>
<p>The only real non ohmic conductors are things like semi-conductor junctions where current flow will change drastically with a small change in voltage and does not flow symmetrically. And arcs, that are by nature 'negative' resistance since they increase in size and hence reduce resistance and even voltage drop with increasing current. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, one could say that a reason for stating that tungsten is non-ohmic is that a common use for the element is as the filament in light bulbs where its entire purpose is to get very hot, making the V-R relationship very nonlinear?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, one would just note its tempco and expected operation temperature and call it ohmic but with a resistance corresponding to its operation temperature, while noting it may experience a bad inrush current of several times that when initially turned on due to its resistance at ambient temp. </p>
<p>Calling it non-ohmic and assuming it only has steady state operation would completely ignore the fact that when turned on, huge inrush currents occur from the low initial resistance that can fry control devices like dimmers, switches, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tungsten was used as filaments because it has a very high melting point. Of all the non-radioactive elements, only Carbon has a higher melting point than Tungsten (3500C vs 3410C). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ohm's Law stipulates that everything else is held constant. Tungsten is Ohmic, because the change in resistance due to a change in temperature over time is irrelevant to obeying Ohm's Law.</p>
<p>What would make it non-Ohmic is that, everything else held constant, two different applied voltages were met with two different electrical resistances.</p>
<p>V1/I1 =/= V2/I2</p></div>		</li>
