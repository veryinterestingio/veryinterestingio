			<div class="markdown"><p>The most profitable part that you didn't include is the 3rd party company looks at your stickers and makes very accurate guesses about who/what you are.  A sticker from a baker and a butcher?  You are probably a 34 - 45 year old professional woman who owns a house worth 400 to 500k and makes 90 to 120k a year.  They are very good at that and sell that audience data for big money.  The loss of that audience data will be the biggest effect of the changes, and ads will be forced to rely on contextual more.</p></div>		</li>
