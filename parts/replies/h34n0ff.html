			<div class="markdown"><p>You do need to be conscious of that.  It’s a lot easier to get a paper published in Science or Nature that is about a new species of humanity than it is when you are describing the 83rd through 105th Neanderthal individuals found in a valley.  So the worker is going to have a bias to interpret evidence that gets him or her tenure or that cushy Yale gig where you fob off your undergrads on the untenured peasants.</p>
<p>But the mundane science is important too.  And failures never get published, which is a real shame since you know somebody somewhere is going to repeat your mistakes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. We should really have a database of all the failed studies too. It’s just as important to know “Hey, X didn’t work” as it is “Hey, Y worked!”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a video accompanying the press release, Chris Stringer guesses that this is a Denisovan. We'll have to wait and see. There is a lot of work to be done on all the fossils that have been gathering dust in China for decades.</p></div>		</li>
