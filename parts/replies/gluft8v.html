			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesnâ€™t that correction just mean that itâ€™s calibrated to be accurate at that temperature? So the advice to fill up when itâ€™s cold still holds?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wouldnâ€™t make a difference because most (if not all) fuel tanks at stations are buried, and since the earth stays a fairly consistent temperature the fuel stays a fairly consistent temperature as well. For instance, in my area of Ontario the fuel temp isnâ€™t going from -10C to +25C throughout the year like the weather; itâ€™s staying around 7C to 10C which is ground temp. This is why geothermal heating works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I guess everywhere is different so the temperature differences are more aimed at countries that experience wide swinging fluctuations from exreme heat to exreme cold. I guess where you are the regulation is about pump preservation as well as fuel temp regulation. So I guess the tip is only useful if there is no temp correction sticker on the pumps. ðŸ˜‰</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yep, they are all (at least all of the pumps I have seen) corrected to 15Â°C in the UK.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You only have to go about 12 feet below the surface before the temperature remains the same all year around. </p>
<p>In the U.K. where all tanks are underground  the temperature of the fuel doesnâ€™t change from season to season, let alone from hour to hour. </p>
<p>The exception to that will be immediately after a tanker has delivered, when the fuel might not have got to equilibrium yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Underground fuel tanks remain at a fairly constraint temperature throughout the year, and the temperature definitely doesn't vary significantly over the course of a day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, it varies significantly, especially in the final run where the pipe is close to the tarmac on a hot and sunny day.  It can vary as much as 20C during a single fill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That last part isnâ€™t true, most countries should sell fuel standardized to a certain temperature. As the fuel is dispensed its temperature is measured, some math is done and the volume is calculated to a certain temperature, in Canada this is 15Â°C and is written on the display somewhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps in 1st world countries this is the case... however this tip was one I learned from spending time in Zimbabwe and South Africa in my younger years. Maybe it has changed over the years but I stick by it ðŸ˜‰</p></div>		</li>
