			<div class="markdown"><p>There've been a couple cats (Belgium and Hong Kong I think) and a dog (Hubei maybe), although clinical symptoms have been mild or non-existent and shedding is also thought to be negligible. Serologies have been positive and virus has been recovered over several days, indicating active infections. (Search ProMED - promedmail.org; all cases have been reported there) E: I'd link but it's not straightforward, enter &quot;cat&quot; or &quot;dog&quot; + covid, looks like at least 3 cats and a dog. </p>
<p>It should come as no surprise, both SARS viruses are considered to have passed through wild mammals prior to their appearance in humans (raccoon dog and civet cat for V1, I assume we'll learn a similar story for V2 when all is said and done).</p>
<p>Yes, similar viruses have been found in bats or pangolins or whatever, but the key is likely these wild carnivore intermediaries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Documented incidences of human to cat transmission are also extremely low of course - think of how many people have cats and how many humans are now COVID-19 positive. If it was easy for cats to become infected we'd be hearing of large numbers of sick cats, but that's not happened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well keep in mind that symptoms in the few that have tested positive so far have been mild and that cats are very good at hiding illness. The numbers aren‚Äôt going to be reliable right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont think alot of cats get tested. Like our human count raises substantially with more available testing im sure if we had animals tested it would raise as well.
But still i would hope it stays around nill</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it doesn't automatically follow, because the ability for a species of animal to be able to transmit a respiratory virus can be different in different species, and depends on the virus' ability to &quot;shed&quot; - to cause the animal to emit droplets containing viable virus.  It's thought that shedding (for sars-cov-2) is negligible in animals such as dogs and cats.  To shed, a virus needs to be able not just to reproduce inside the host, but then to find some path out of the host which requires finding a way to travel through the body to somewhere where it will be transmitted.  Physiology is just different in different animals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mammalian plumbing is largely the same though isn't it? Some of the twists and turns might be different, but it's largely just two flesh sacks, a damp tube and some mucous filled openings that have a tendency to spray when irritated. I don't think a virus would need a map to find its way in and out of a host, be it feline, canine, human, or otherwise. And if you've ever been near a sneezing dog, you'll know it can cover anything in a six foot radius in slime.</p></div>		</li>
