			<div class="markdown"><p>Electrochromic film or electrochromic glass. Brand names include Smart Tint, Switch Glass, etc. It's not cheap. Film applied after the fact is typically between $50-120/sqft for the material, labour is on top of that. Glass with the film pre-applied is significantly more, depending on the product you'll see prices between $140-300/sqft for pre-applied film as the interlayer of 2-on-3 laminated glass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called switch glass or switch film - two different types of products to get the fog on/fog off effect. Cost is anywhere from $75-150 per square foot depending on source, quantity, type of install, labor costs etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have this film on my front windows at home. Here are several videos of it in action.</p>
<p>It is fairly pricey, but no more expensive than a nice set of Roman shades for these windows.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly it was about $1200 in material, and I opted to install a self adhesive film that is very similar to window tint, but more rigid.</p>
