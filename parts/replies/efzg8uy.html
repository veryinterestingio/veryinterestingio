<p>Edit: changed some wording.  A  commenter told me put a piece of printer paper between them, but that paper may get glued to the original project.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Afaik if you secure the corners firmly the rest of the paper is unable to move so it would act similarly to the book, no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Use rubber cement or other glue labeled &quot;no curling, wrinkling, shrinking.&quot; I literally have no idea how it's made different but it is. Paint both sides with rubber cement, let it dry, then stick the sticky sides together. Practically permanent. </p></div>		</li>
