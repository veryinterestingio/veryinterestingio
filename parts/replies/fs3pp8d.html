			<div class="markdown"><p>Bobcats are fairly ground-dwelling cat. They can climb trees, but they don't tend to climb very high and don't spend a lot of time in trees. Because it is much harder for them to adjust their balance as they fall, or to jump from limb to limb, than it would be for a similarly sized cat with a tail.</p>
<p>The advantage that Bobcats get for not having a tail is that they lose heat less quickly as a result, so they do better in snowy environments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about pronghorns?
From what I know, they are amongst the best runners, have relatively thin legs (compared to a fairly stocky body for endurance), and I do not think they have much of a tail.</p></div>		</li>
