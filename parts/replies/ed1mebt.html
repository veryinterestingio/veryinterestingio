<p>Are home desktop CPUs using light these days? I must have missed that. I thought we are still using electricity. If we are using copper, then why does the speed of light matter?</p></div>		</li>

<p>280,000,000 m/s / 3,000,000,000 s = electricity travels 0.093 m in 1 clock cycle of a 3 GHz cpu. That’s 9.3cm or about 3.6 inches. The highest speed cpus about double that for 1.8 inches. At those speeds, they basically just don’t wait for the previous cycle to finish, which can lead to problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The speed at which signals travel in a processor is mostly limited by the speed at which the transistors can switch, not by the speed at which the signal travels through a copper wire. This is determined by the size and type of transistors as well as the voltage applied to them - the higher the voltage, the faster they switch.</p>
<p>This has led to a principle in CPU design called the &quot;pipeline&quot;, where the calculation is broken up into several stages with buffer memory inbetween. The clock speed is limited by the time it takes for the longest part of the pipeline to finish; above that the processor behaves no longer deterministic and can cause errors. Early CPUs might have only had 5 stages. In the race towards higher clock speed, the number of stages skyrocketed: The Prescott Pentium 4 processors had more than 30 of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are still using electricity- but the speed of light still matters for 2 reasons- </p>
<p>One is that we use electric fields to move those electrons in the copper around. Electric fields are fundamentally made up of photons (the particle of light). Light is actually just a special case of electromagnetic waves at certain frequencies</p>
<p>But more importantly, what we call the 'speed of light' is a bit of a misnomer. It turns out that that this is a fundamental speed limit of our universe- <em>nothing</em> can travel faster than this value (as far as our current physics understanding can tell us, and it's been heavily tested). That includes stuff with mass, stuff without mass, information, etc.</p>
<p>The reason it's named the 'speed of light' is just a historical quirk because light happened to be the first time we encountered it (light being a convenient massless particle, it travels at this speed, and it's easy to make/measure)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No they use copper/silicon</p>
<p>It's relevant because current moves through the wire at 95% the speed of light</p></div>		</li>
