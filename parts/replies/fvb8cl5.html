			<div class="markdown"><p>imo this is a much better answer than any other ive seen here.  the human body adapts, thats why you work out.  you can adapt to run fast and get a strong back and get big, just as readily as you adapt to atrophy.   slouching is just another kind of immobile unloaded state that you can adapt to by losing muscle mass, losing bone density, and losing confidence in movement, which contributes to perception of pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The human body is amazing - for literally any era but ours.   Needing very little rest to recover from very hard work, able to heal injuries that would kill other animals, able to store absolutely any excess energy for lean times.   We put that energy into powering our big brains, which are insanely impressive, but what <em>really</em> sets us apart from other apex predators are our ability to Macgyver tools and our ability to <em>throw</em>.   Plus we can literally out-walk anything on the planet.  </p>
<p>All of this makes us absolutely unsuitable for a modern lifestyle, of course.   Modern lifestyles suit reptiles: slow metabolisms and bodies made to sit still for hours at a time with short bursts of activity.</p></div>		</li>
