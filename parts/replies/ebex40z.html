			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m curious if OP was watching blue planet 2 when they came up with this question? Cause there’s a section on them....and to add to what was said in the first reply, they mention that brine is a result of the decay process of organic material that also produces methane gases....it was unclear to me if that was the only source but it at least confirms that brine is being replenished....diffusion is still probably taking place</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you have warm brine beneath colder fresher water, both salt and heat will diffuse across the boundary, but heat diffuses faster than salt.  This means that the fresh water right above the boundary will be warmer than usual, so it will rise into the freshwater above.  Contrariwise, the uppermost part of the brine will be cooled, and sink into the brine.  This creates strong mixing within each layer, but sharpens the boundary between them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could I observe this in a beaker or does it require a larger scale to see the effects? Would adding a dye to either brine or water show the effect visibly, or would the dye particles do their own thing not related to the salt/water dynamics? This sounds like quite an interesting thing I'd like to try and observe myself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn't work in a test tube. Not really because you need large volumes of water, but because the effects of the tube as a boundary. Get a deep pool and you should be able to reproduce it</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sometimes in freshwater lakes you end up with a sharp enough boundary in temperature you can see it on sonar/depthfinders. I've never really noticed being able to visibly see it, but, you can certainly feel it if you dive down swimming with fins at certain times of year.</p>
<p>Then at some point in the fall the lakes turnover.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have actually seen this phenomenon demonstrated in a beaker, not with salt and heat, but with sugar and salt.  (Dissolved sugar diffuses across the boundary 3 times slower than salt does.)  It doesn't work well with heat because heat can conduct out through the walls of the container.</p>
<p>The demo I saw was also the other style of double diffusion: in which &quot;warm, salty&quot; water overlies &quot;cold fresh&quot;, leading to rising and sinking &quot;fingers&quot; of the the two fluids which interleave with each other, as seen in the figure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_diffusive_convection" target="_blank">here</a>.  This style erases sharp boundaries rather than strengthening them.</p>
<p>There's a photo of this demo in <a href="http://www.itg.cam.ac.uk/people/heh/Paper42.pdf" target="_blank">this review article</a>, see Figure 3.  I can't find a recent photo or any detailed recipes, unfortunately.</p>
<p>And yes, the demo I saw put food coloring in the upper layer, so the fingers were easily visible.  It looked really cool, but it's apparently tricky to get the concentrations exactly right.</p></div>		</li>
