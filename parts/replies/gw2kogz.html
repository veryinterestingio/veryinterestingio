<p>My grandmother died some years ago and left me a pretty sum of money. I knew I was going to buy a house eventually, I just wasn't ready at the time. A few years later when I was ready, I used that money plus mortgage money to buy the house. </p>
<p>Even though I had that money, the company selling the new construction house had to have complete documentation of where that money came from. I couldn't just wire them the money, I had to provide pretty much a history of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, any legit business is going to file an IRS form for cash payments over $10,000.  I once bought an out-of-state car that had a lien on it.  The only way to get the Lien Release that day was to pay the seller's bank in cash, so I took the cash to the bank with the seller.  The bank just assigned an employee to count it and another one filled out the IRS forms.  </p>
<p>If the IRS had wanted to, they could have then looked at our financials to see if buying that car with cash made sense.  In our case, they would have quickly determined that the cash was withdrawn from our bank on day 1, then no day 2 it was deposited in the seller's bank and a lien release was given, followed by a new title without the lien.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Buying a home with cash right now seems painfully dumb... Interest rates are bonkers low, and if inflation kicks in a few years from now (which it seems like it kinda has to...), that would devalue what he owed on the mortgage significantly.</p>
<p>Money is extraordinarily cheap right now. Make a bigger than normal down payment? Sure. Shorter term than typical? Sure. But buying with cash instead of getting a crazy attractive interest rate and investing the remainder? Why?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had this as an issue once.<br />
I have two banks, one that I use mostly for savings, one for everyday checking, bills, etc..<br />
I go to buy a project car, and take out just over 10k from savings.. I think it was 12k. been a couple years.<br />
when I check out the car, its rusted much further than the seller said. so I dont buy it.<br />
Its friday afternoon, the bank would be closed by the time I drove home, and I  dont want to hang on to 12k in cash all weekend until monday.  My checking bank had a branch nearby so I deposited the cash there. They checked my ID matched my account, but that was it.. I think that since I was a member, they had the info for the paperwork.  </p>
<p>Later that week, I withdraw the 12k and drive to my savings bank.. deposit the 12k back. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>2 months later I get called from my bank about some irregularities. we get it worked out, but apparently I set off some flags in one of the systems, and they didnt do their paperwork right and if the bank didnt work this out they were going to be fined.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It turns out that paperwork is not just who I am, the amount, etc.. but where the money came from, what I do for a living, etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yep, all of that.  Those questions are what prosecutors like to call &quot;kill shots,&quot; because if they can prove you lied on those, that is a separate and very easy crime to charge and convict on.  </p>
<p>The lesson is not to lie.  If you're unsure of what the answer should be, let someone know and write something like &quot;I think x, but I'm not positive.&quot;  Anything to let it be known that you're not trying to lie on a government form.</p></div>		</li>
