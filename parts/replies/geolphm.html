			<div class="markdown"><p>If what I googled is right, we can convert heat to electricity with 40-50% efficiency. </p>
<p>I wonder if at least for large scale conversion plants, we could collect heat with some sort of vanta black painted elements (thus absorbing a wide spectrum of frequencies), then convert it to electricity with a net efficiency higher than the current photovoltaic tech, or if the losses would end up amounting to the same final efficiency, in some sort of physical justice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are solar-thermal power plants out there. They typically have an array of mirrors that concentrate a large area of light into the top of small tower that contains a working fluid. By concentrating the heat you can get to hundreds of degrees C, enabling higher efficiencies.</p>
<p>There's a big one right off I-15 on the border of CA/NV. So much light gets collected you can see the beams from the freeway. Looks like a doomsday device coming from the eye of sauron.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just about to mention this. I came across an article about that exact plant while researching for a college paper. If I understand correctly, building these is not a very cost efficient option either, at least as far as up front cost goes. It cost something like 9 million dollars to make, and on top of it, they got sued by some local wildlife department cuz of the amount of birds that were flying towards the mirror and dying from getting burned up in the heat. And if i remember correctly, the fluid used to transport the heat was molten salt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a system that I believe was trialled in Australia where they built a massive black tent out in the desert. The sun heated up the air in the tent that then exited through a vent in the top, powering a turbine. The efficiency was probably pretty rubbish, but it was extremely cheap to build because it was just a big, black tent! </p>
<p>This is ideal if you have lots of empty space that gets lots of sun, so you can see why it was tried in Australia! Middle Eastern and Saharan countries could probably make it work too, and maybe some of the mid West US states. </p>
<p>The fact that they're not everywhere makes me suspect that it didn't work quite as well as I'm implying though - if it was good, I'd expect it to have become really popular, given how simple it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is itâ€™s useless at night when temps drop way down in the desert. The solar farms that use mirrors to boil water that powers a turbine actually do keep running at night, as the mirrors all focus on a bunch of salt. The mirrors melt the salt and keep heating it up during the day, and at night it traps enough heat to keep running until the next day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess the limitation for Saharan countries is what you can do with the turbine on site in regions that host mostly nomadic cattle herding. An enlightened government with good stability for foreign investment might be able to do something with it (not a huge number of countries) but theyâ€™d need good advice. Thatâ€™s where the World Bank or UNDP should come in, but unfortunately they tend to be very out of date with this stuff. Maybe one day....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a previous house with a large roof, we had both Solar electric to help power the house and Solar thermal to heat the water system. In the summer it was exceptionally effective and it would cover nearly all the hot water. I suppose in effect it already has the energy storage system built in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So we are thinking about getting solar panels as well and asked a neighbor who just got them (not hooked up yet to ask about usage) as they look less obvious than the ones I normally see. She said â€˜we have the lower efficiency ones as I couldnâ€™t emotionally handle driving up to my house every day to the traditional looking ones.â€™ And it still cost them 25K ($). So when it comes to the higher efficiency ones vs lower efficiency ones, whatâ€™s the power benefit? The purpose would be to get off the electrical grid, but can you do that with the cheaper, lower efficiency (and in my eye better looking) ones? Thanks! Just now learning about this!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah! It all comes down to $/W (how much money you spend for each unit of power) and how much the solar panels degrade over time. Cheaper solar panels generally produce less power and can degrade more, but should have a lower $/W. </p>
<p>In terms of whether itâ€™s good for the environment, anything is better than nothing! Itâ€™s always better in my mind to take baby steps so that you donâ€™t burn out on helping the environment. Lots of small steps over your lifetime build up more than one big step taken once!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Love the attitude about the small things over time rather than one big thing. I do drive a Prius and it does bring me some peace as Iâ€™ve been waiting for battery technology to get better. Sure Iâ€™d prefer full electric but the range was not viable for our lifestyle. And canâ€™t afford a Tesla. And so Iâ€™m the odd mom who will ride her bike to events and to yoga as my off set. So the $30K cost of solar panels is a tough pill to swallow. I liken your thought to the one I use for stillness and silence. 5 minutes a day is better for our well being than 20 minutes once a week. ðŸ˜Š</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've learned in trying to &quot;get off the grid&quot;, it's not really possible or cost-effective. </p>
<p>The best we can do is feed power into the grid with our panels, but when the grid power goes out, so do you. It's frustrating. </p>
<p>There's 2 issues: safety of line operators, they need to repair lines that aren't being fed by someone's rooftop, and power storage when the power goes off during non-peak hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer. Depending on the materials used, a solar cell requires a minimum amount of energy to produce electricity. You can build a cell tuned for red light that most of the visible spectrum can excite, but the extra energy from green, blue, etc will be wasted as heat. Then you can build a cell that's tuned for blue light, but then red light will produce no electricity because it doesn't have enough energy.</p>
<p>You can build more complex panels with stacked cells where the top cell absorbs red, the cell under absorbs maybe yellow, then green, etc to increase efficiency. I think most simple panels are tuned for green, since those are the most intense (most number of photons) frequencies emitted by the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most simple panels are silicon, which has a band gap in the near infrared because then you can harvest the visible light range :)</p></div>		</li>
