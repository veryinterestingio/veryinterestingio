<li>I think scientists and science-related professionals that use AI need to understand it. Depending on the level of use, obviously, a different level of familiarity is needed. If you are actually developing a model it will require more understanding as if you are using a black-box tool. The problem is, of course, having the wrong expectations and frameworks and better resources for AI as a &quot;user&quot; should be developed. I think AI tools like deep learning will become more like linear algebra tools. I don't necessarily need to know how numpy works internally to use it effectively. That is not the case necessarily for the current frameworks that carry out ML.</li>
<li>Yes. I have not taken it myself but people keep talking about it. I like these two books: <a href="https://www.deeplearningbook.org/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.deeplearningbook.org/" target="_blank">https://www.deeplearningbook.org/</a></a> and <a href="https://books.google.ca/books/about/Gaussian_Processes_for_Machine_Learning.html?id=GhoSngEACAAJ&amp;source=kp_cover&amp;redir_esc=y" target="_blank"><a href="https://books.google.ca/books/about/Gaussian\_Processes\_for\_Machine\_Learning.html?id=GhoSngEACAAJ&source=kp\_cover&redir\_esc=y" target="_blank">https://books.google.ca/books/about/Gaussian\_Processes\_for\_Machine\_Learning.html?id=GhoSngEACAAJ&source=kp\_cover&redir\_esc=y</a></a> but there are many resources available to you.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why does understanding the concept of AI described as some kind of grandiose feat? You could easily learn it, you don't even need to know any computer science related things. Neural networks are just math, matrices, in specific. Look into it. Btw 3Blue1Brown did a good series on it, check it out.</p></div>		</li>
