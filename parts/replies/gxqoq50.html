			<div class="markdown"><p>Since crocodilians are in fact not the only surviving archosaur line, would this be why birds have different sex chromosomes to mammals? Rather than females being XX and males XY, birds have females ZW and males ZZ. Completely opposite setup with the female having the heteromorphic chromosomes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find this super interesting--typically the 50/50 male to female ratio is ideal from an individual fitness perspective, but on the population or species level having more females is a bit better as your reproductive output will be higher. So as long as the ratio doesn't get too extremely skewed to the extent that there aren't enough males to mate with most females, this could actually be a boon to sea turtle conservation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Potentially, yes. Scientists are still investigating whether having fewer male sea turtles is happening, at what rate, and what the effects would be for the Sea turtle population. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article243584187.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article243584187.html" target="_blank">https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article243584187.html</a></a></p>
<p>While increasing female population may benefit the population (you only need one male to fertilize many females), there are some considerations: </p>
<p>- It would decreased genetic diversity<br />
- As beach temperatures rise, and eggs get warmer, too much warmth can lead to unhatched eggs as the embryos die.<br />
- evolution: any gene that causes more males in warmer eggs might be selected for, leading to a return to the 50:50 ratio in the long run.   </p>
<p>But ultimately: we're still not sure. I guess we'll find out?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolutionarily (at least in social species) most of the mate-selection pressure happens with the males. I.e. only the &quot;fittest&quot; mates have offspring, while virtually all the females produce offspring (see for example the human evolutionary history <a href="https://genome.cshlp.org/content/25/4/459/F2.expansion.html" target="_blank">where at most times only one man per 3-4 women is represented in the modern genome, bottoming out at only <strong>one man per ~15 women</strong> in the wake of the agricultural revolution</a>).</p>
<p>In that context you need both the males and the females. The males provide the avenue of mate selection, and the females produce the offspring.</p></div>		</li>

<p>(no genetic difference between males and females, so hard to check)</p>

<p>How does that work? Do they not have X and Y chromosomes? How do males and females differentiate if they are genetically the same? Is it closer to species with no biological sex?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Turtles are reptiles, and the XY sex determination system is mostly found in mammals and some insects.</p>
<p>As such, there is no X or Y chromosome in a turtle.</p>
<p>The temperature activates or inactivates certain genes which then result in development as a male or female.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there an underlying reason for that to happen? Like a evolutionary benefit to determine if male or female? </p>
<p>I'm clueless on this since most of the eggs hatched would have the same sex, since they were buried in the same location, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. In birds for example, there's the Z/W system, where the males are ZZ and the females are ZW. This system evolved independently of the XY system in mammals, with the Z chromosome in birds not being related to the Z chromosome in other reptiles and not related to either X or Y.</p>
<p>It works the opposite of our system, where males have two large chromosomes and females have one large and one smaller chromosome. It is then the female hormones that overpower the 'default' male hormones and make a bird female (if a bird's ovaries are damaged, the bird will for example start growing male plumage patterning).</p>
<p>In mammals it's the opposite, the presence of the SRY gene will override the 'default' female pattern and make a mammal male (men with low testosterone since birth have more feminine features, but women with low estrogen don't look more masculine.)</p>
<p>Or in a few mammals with the X0 system, the males are X and the females are XX, there is no separate Y chromosome (they gradually lost it until there was nothing left, not even the genes that normally determine sex in humans like SRY.)</p>
<p>And if you go with platypus and echidna, they have like 5 X and 5 Y chromosomes (so they follow the XY system but with no relation to that of other mammals) and they do really weird stuff when creating gametes: the males do some weird stuff where they chain the X and Y chromosomes together then pack the bundles separately into separate sperm, so you have XXXXX sperm and YYYYY sperm. (Which leads the question what happens if, say a XXXYY sperm is created and fertilizes an egg? Is the offspring fertile? Is it male or female? Will it even live?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. They do not have X and Y chromosomes. As has been said, differentiation is triggered by temperature rather than genetically. </p>
<p>The mammalian XY system is far from being the only option. Sex is far and away the life system with the most diversity across the kingdoms.</p></div>		</li>
