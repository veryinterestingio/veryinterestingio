			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, there are a few that don't actually require you to spend anything.</p>
<p>Dungeon Maker is one I play from time to time. It doesn't make things harder or easier based on whether you've paid or not. You can buy unlocks to progress faster, but the whole goal of the game (imo) is to unlock the power ups by playing it. And you can definitely unlock everything just by playing, even if it will take a while.</p>
<p>But it has no stupid gambling mechanics or premium currency. If you buy something, you get to see exactly what you get for your money.</p>
<p>Think it's like 5$ or something, can absolutely recommend if you like defence style games.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correction; those games do exist, but because discovery on mobile is essentially nonexistent, you're screwed. What some people do is search on something else like PC, where you can find out more targeted information e.g. by publisher/dev, go to their forums and see recommended links, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Just browsing the mobile app store, yeah you're gonna have a bad time.</p></div>		</li>
