<li>I think it does. But I haven't seen any qualitative analysis on this.</li>
<li>yes, at least studies showing double-anonymous reviews increase trust among authors:<br />

</ol>
<p>that's one of the reasons IoP recently announced they will move all their journals peer review model to double anonymous:<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>A follow up for double blind review, is there any sense of how to deal with identification by topic (i.e. is double blind really double blind)? For example, I'm one of like 5 people who regularly publish on a particular mountain range. Within that 5, I'm the only one doing a particular type of analysis, so if I submit a paper on that as double blind, does it matter because it will be clear who wrote the paper even without my name attached?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>great point. Indeed double blinding in niche topics doesn't make much of sense as in some cases even the writing style reveals one's identity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very interesting point: remember to actually blind your reviews (remove editing tracks from documents and cite yourself, if you need to, but don't write 'we recently showed ... ): it's possible to make it less obvious who you are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find double blind peer review quite useful. It also highlights the importance of knowing what kind of peer review is expected when writing an article! In small fields it does make things a little more complicated though it does highlight the element of trust.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. We should also keep in mind different disciplines require different review models. E.g. smaller academic communities might be more in need of double blind review</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To follow up, I’ve seen a number of scientists who won’t publish in or review for journals that make reviews public. The arguments I’ve seen are that 1) reviewers may be less candid with their expertise, 2) younger, less established scientists may be afraid of backlash, or 3) that reviews are intellectual property. I’m not sure what to think. If scientists have these concerns, does it throw too much of a wrench in the process, or is the transparency such a boon that these are essentially growing pains?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>quoting an editor of a journal which publishes peer reviews (with or without names):<br />
I don't know what makes a researcher who proudly puts their name on a their paper and stands behind it not to stand behind their peer review.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's a bit of an odd standpoint. I have many conversations with people about Open Scholarship, particularly Open Access research and Open Data. Whilst people are fine with publishing research many instantly freeze at the mention of making data open. Obviously there are some considerations for some data not being made open but it is more of a cultural change. If you can publish a dataset, have a DOI associated with it, and then receive citations coming off it <em>as well as</em> the paper as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the concern is that there may be backlash if they’re critical of well-known names in the field, especially if they’re early in their career.</p></div>		</li>
