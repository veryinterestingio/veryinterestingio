			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the color difference arise from the fact that specific sizes of particles have plasmon resonance frequencies dependent on the size? I.e does the size change what modes are in resonance? If so, is this why smaller particles look more red (i.e. blue wavelengths more strongly interact with these surface plasmons, thus transmitting red wavelengths)?</p>
<p>Also, any recommendations on where to find books on the subject?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been a few years since I was in this field, but Google resolves quite a few scientific articles. </p>
<p>The effect is a standing wave at the material interface. In the particle in a box quantum model, only wavelengths that match the size of the box are permitted. Particles with different &quot;box sizes&quot; therefore have different resonant frequencies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>\^\^ This answer should be on top. The other one is correct, you have to think about how to fold it in the launcher and unfold it in space, but there are solutions for that (you can always use a gold plating on another material). Wavelengths are the most significant factor.</p>
<p>Adding to that, infrared in space is normally a concern when close to a planetary surface. But JWST was designed for L2, far away from Earth, where the Sun is the primary heat source and all of its radiaiton comes from the same direction (in low Earth orbit, you'd have to worry not only about plantary infrared but also about sunlight reflected from Earth). So JWST needn't worry about infrared from its environment (or at least not as much as LEO satellites).</p>
<p>Another thing I'd like to add, if a material absorbs a significant amount of visible but reflects all (okay, most) infrared, by Kirchoff's law this means it also won't emit infrared to get rid of its heat. Gold would heat up to insane temperatures if exposed to direct sunlight. (The same is true for aluminium, but the difference is much smaller, it absorbs like 3% in visible and emits like 2% in infrared. You can manage that by ading kapton or another infrared emitting coating on the other side.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That isn't correct. The peak irradiance is in the visible, but most of the energy is in the near and far infrared. You can see this by integrating the solar spectrum over the two regions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even then, aluminum is better over the whole solar spectrum. It's almost as good in IR and much better in visible.</p></div>		</li>
