			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair: Green screening another neighbourhood outside the window is not going to cost that much. Still fully agree with you. I had a great talk with some guys who were working on one of the fast and the furious movies. Their job was laying the tracks the camera follows. An incredibly specialised and precise a job that requires multiple people on set the entire film? That's going to have a pretty huge cost by itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why Hollywood is such a big industry. You can take a camera, write a joke and have your brother act it out, and you could call that a movie. To make it feature length, you need more time and maybe a better story and a few more actors. But if you want to do it <em>right</em>, you have to build on the skills of all these other people that can tell you how you can achieve the effect you want to achieve. Costumes here, sets there, some character development over there, etc. And because they've been doing that for a big long while now, they have gotten pretty good at it. It's not a miracle, it's a century of cultivating an industry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's more, many production companies will spend millions on advertising. Sometimes, it'll cost almost as much to market a film as it does to produce it.</p>
<p>Then if it flops, they've lost out on everything including the marketing which is a sunk cost anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd be surprised how few people in the big crowd scenes are actually people a lot of the time.... a couple of layers deep round the stars the shot zooms in on or pulls out from, the rest.... likely CGI... motion capture has led to the easy creation of background figures doing exactly what you want. They'll be wearing period correct clothing and moving bang on cue every single take, so you only have to wrangle a couple of dozen actual trained actors and never touch extras again.... or feed them, or put them through wardrobe and makeup, every single day....  Source: I work for a company making mocap stuff.... They started doing this back with Titanic and that was almost 25 years ago, these days if you're paying for VFX anyway, a digital crowd scene setup is a cheap bolt on compared to catering and insurance on 2000 extras...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yea but often times you don't need to really look even that closely to notice its just a bunch of extras multiplied to the horizon and that looks really bad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked as an extra in a film in a scene filling a boxing stadium. About 50 of us filled one section, and it was filmed, then we exchanged costumes and places and filled the next section and so on until all 12 sections were shot. It was all joined in post production showing a packed stadium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude I've been on set and if the script says extras into the three figure range most productions I know will just hire that many people and deal with the problems on set. Maybe with like thousands and thousands in a crowd of if you only need that many for a few specific shots but for most crowd shots practical is still king.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on some other stuff too. If it's a bunch of people set in modern day standing/walking around you can have extras just show up in their own clothes. If it's like the D-Day invasion in Saving Private Ryan you'll probably use some CGI because otherwise you have to have uniforms, rifles, helmets for everyone and then have them reenact an invasion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked on a movie for IMAX last year and one day we had 200 background actors on set. They hired like 6 extra ADs and 10 extra locations PAs to help mitigate the disaster that is that many people.</p>
<p>Way cheaper to give 200 people $200 than to give 50 people $200 and then pay for VFX to fill the space.</p></div>		</li>
