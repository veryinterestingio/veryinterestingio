			<div class="markdown"><p>TLDR:  Your body develops a basic 'countdown' system like an hourglass.  The more you stick to a schedule (waking up at a certain time, going to bed at a specific time), the more you calibrate the hourglass.  The sand represents various hormones and chemicals that get used up throughout the day and when they run out, your brain says &quot;hourglass is empty, it's time to shutdown&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you know that you need to wake up at a certain time, your brain will try to keep track of that while you sleep. </p>
<p>Around an hour before you need to wake, it will start slowly raising the levels of the stress hormone adrenocorticotropin in your blood to wake you.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty much right, except that habit has nothing to do with it. We have an &quot;internal clock&quot; which is about 24 hrs long, and it adjusts slowly depending on your activity. It isn't calibrated through habit, it's a biological phenomenon. It's just there! If you sleep erratically the internal clock will still be there! However, it will be adjusted all the time. The internal clock can be adjusted about an hour every day. </p>
<p>The &quot;tool&quot; that adjusts the clock is melatonin, which is affected by light. If you get daylight in the morning at the same time, the biological clock won't change. If you pull down the blinds and lie in darkness for a whole morning (crying over our miserable existence on Earth, presumably), the internal clock might adjust itself an hour later at maximum. This affects a lot of hormonal processes, body temperature etc.</p>
<p>Now I'm excluding those people who have something wrong with their biorhythm. For example, some elderly people's bodies has trouble generating enough melatonin. People with visual impairment can have &quot;free floating&quot; internal clocks because their eyes can't regulate the melatonin discharge. The result of such an uninterrupted rhythm becomes that they have a &quot;biological day&quot; which is often consistently longer than 24 hours, so that they normally get tired later and later every day.</p></div>		</li>
