			<div class="markdown"><p>At my first job, I would take all the checks to the bank to be deposited. One day though, the company did a charity drive where they got cash donations from all employees. It was my job to take over $10k in cash to the bank along with my normal checks. I was so paranoid, I basically ran to the bank to give them the money.</p></div>		</li>
