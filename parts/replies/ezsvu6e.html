			<div class="markdown"><p>The first mobile game I played was Toon Crush.  I eventually reached a stage where I had to get a <em>lot</em> of one particular color block in order to clear the stage and 95% of the blocks were of course the wrong color.  After failing and trying again, I noticed about 90% of the blocks were the wrong color. Then 85%.  Then I realized that I was wasting time losing until  the game felt like letting me win, and I uninstalled it.  Now I play Puzzle and Dragon where all of the abuse is in the gacha system and I can play casual levels for fun without worrying about whether or not I have a team of 10* whatevers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hundreds? Oh no, thousands. Brother worked for a fairly popular mobile game as the head marketing artist. He said that their CEOs goal was to &quot;land an oil whale&quot;. They managed to land what they believed was an oil sheik's kid who would dump upwards of $10k a week on the game. Then it got even better when they must've recruited some of their uber-wealthy friends. Brother said there was a group of them (conveniently the top players in the leaderboards of the games) who spent hundreds of thousands a month on the game. He said that these oil whales or anyone form the uber-wealthy Asian market were the targets in any mobile game. Hundreds of dollars is a blip on the radar to these companies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i'm definitely not the target.</p>
<p>but we notices, when you get stuck on a level for 4-5 tries and leave the game alone a couple hours or a day, its usually much easier to pass that level after that break.</p>
<p>we assume thats because the developer rather have you continue and potentially spend money down the road than lose you as a customer for good.</p>
<p>which is what happened to me with candy crush - i got stuck on a level 3 or 4 years back. uninstalled the game because i was trying to get along for a week or so.
every couple months i reinstall the game and try to get past that level. i dont. i uninstall the game again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's like minesweeper except designed more nefariously</p>
<p>minesweeper coded 'properly' will only generate the board on the first click, so your first click never fails. Then you start doing the right+left click to clear sections out, and the game gets harder and harder until you're firing at 50% probability shots and eventually lose, or clear the board. Or sometimes you're lucky enough that you don't have to do any guessing on the board.</p>
<p>but think about it like if the minesweeper board was designed to show you 20% of the board on first click, then 10% the next click, then 5% ... just by designing the board as you click. And your chance of death increases every click until you're eventually making 50% or worse clicks every time.</p>
<p>then they could start charging you for &quot;check a tile&quot; before clicking, and milk people for cash.</p></div>		</li>
