			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact, one of the ideal of Winston Churchill was the &quot;Q Ship.&quot;  It was a ship that looked like a merchant. When the Uboat would surface to tell then to abandon it (and back them it was a very polite and civilized affair), the sides of the ship would open up and many hidden guns would start to fire at the, now extremely vulnerable U boat.  It didn't take long for Germany to stop asking, and just start sinking.</p></div>		</li>
