			<div class="markdown"><p>Good article. I am a beekeeeper myself and am absolutely fascinated by them. They can also measure the inside of the prospective hive location to see if it is suitable to hold and sustain the size of hive. And a couple fun facts about bees: they navigate using light vectors (snow confuses the hell out of them), they have special groves in their front legs that they use to clean pollen off of their antennae, and their fur has a high static charge which, when the bee is on a flower, holds on to any pollen the bee touches, then the bee uses integrated combs to move the pollen to its back legs into the pollen press on the opposite back leg (I call them saddlebags, it's easier imo).</p></div>		</li>
