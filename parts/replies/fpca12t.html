			<div class="markdown"><p>you’re right, the docuseries has been around a while. And perhaps it’s just an anecdotal experience but I am seeing a lot of makers choose the docuseries format for concepts that only have enough meat for a good 70 minute documentary. Perhaps I have been looking for good documentaries more lately and my anecdotal experience doesn’t reflect reality but they do seem more prevalent and they feel forced. Thank you!</p></div>		</li>
