			<div class="markdown"><p>I have not summarized a particular interpretation of quantum mechanics, but only the limitation that you can derive from violation of bell inequalities.</p>
<p>I do not assume locality, but no-signaling and I didn't mean to talk about indeterminism but about fundamental unpredictability by any observer, because that is what we mean by 'random' in the context of non-locality.</p>
<p>All the theories above are no signalling and fundamentally unpredictable, so they are all included in my discussion</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, fair enough. This use of the word 'random' clearly has a different technical meaning in quantum cryptography than it does in philosophy of physics. Understanding this different use of the word random, I see now why almost none of your post is interpretation specific.</p>
<p>The only part that still gets me is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Could there be something causing these events and determining their outcome?</p>
<p>No, there cannot. They way to show this is using so-called Bell inequalities. By studying those, you can show that anyone who could predict quantum randomness, could use it that to communicate faster than the speed of light. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which sounds like it excludes NLHV theories, where presumably the outcomes of experiments are caused precisely by the state of the NLHV (though we agree the outcomes are still unpredictable by any observer from elsewhere in the thread).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the explanation. I had heard of multiverse/many worlds as a possible theory for the origin of our universe, but never in relation to this before. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The multiverse and many-worlds are two different things. In MWI there is still only one Universe, but it's in multiple states all at the same time (a superposition).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea the two share some similarities, for instance in both MWI and these inflationary multiverse theories, any 2 universes share a consistent history for some time, but then after that they diverge.</p>
<p>However, there are significant differences. For example, in the inflationary models each universe typically has different values for all of the fundamental constants of nature (this is supposed to be part of their appeal). But there's no way for this to happen in the MWI; all of the 'universes' have exactly the same physics according to the theory. </p></div>		</li>
