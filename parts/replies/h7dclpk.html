<p>That’s the first step; being able to remember all that detail and turn it into art later is another skill which probably requires some natural ability; some people <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-34039054" target="_blank">don’t seem to be able to imagine a scene and visualize it in their head</a>.</p>
<p>People in many fields learn how to see the kind of detail that’s useful for their work.  An artist, architect, structural engineer and city planner will all see more when looking at a building than an average person would, but they will likely notice different things from each other.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And artists still use reference material, just to drive the point home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right, but I don't think that is what the question was about. I see the question like &quot;why can't I draw with the same precision as I can imagine&quot;, i.e. why can't many put the mental image to paper.</p>
<p>Maybe they don't actually imagine anything about teeth. Some artists just draw a convincing outline of the mouth and everyone can see that it captures the &quot;wide and open smile&quot; without the details. I can't do that. Some caricaturists draw just two of the teeth and capture everything that makes an image look like that person. Exactly the thing that people do notice and imagine in their heads. But most of us can't draw even those features that we do notice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do think it's the same answer - they don't actually imagine with precision at all. They might imagine something like a beautiful blond with a bombshell body, but don't actually have a complete picture when asked to describe them. Shape of the eyebrows, the hairstyle or even basic body proportions that are essential for drawing them. If they had a precise mental image, they would be able to answer questions like &quot;what is the ratio of their height to their hip width&quot;. But people don't image complete pictures in their mind - instead they more likely have a list of characteristics.</p>
<p>If I asked someone to describe those characteristics with detail in words, they would probably give very undetailed descriptions because they never though about the details. Neither they could accurately describe the relative positions and sizes between those characteristics.</p>
<p>Someone might even have a good mental image of a big pair of titties from the side, but their most familiar imagination of a torso might be from the front and those are difficult to mesh together.</p>
<p>As for line drawing, it's a skill of simplification or reduction. We don't see nor often remember people as line drawings. Someone might draw many different kinds of mouths with just a single line in different shapes, but that's also a learned skill with a lot of trial and error. While practically everyone can see a cartoon characters or 16-bit pixel art and extrapolate the missing details (our eyes have a lifetime of training for completing fractured data), selecting which details to retain when simplifying is not an innate skill.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think you've captured what I find the most hard about drawing. Even if I know the details, I think of them as 3D objects and can't imagine how a single 2D projection of that all looks like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To illustrate your point, look at the bicycle pictures people drew in this fascinating project:  <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/35437979/Velocipedia" target="_blank">https://www.behance.net/gallery/35437979/Velocipedia</a></p>
<p>I don’t want to spam this too much in the comments here, but I feel it should be among the top comments.  Really illustrates how people can <em>think</em> they know exactly what something looks like, but they really don’t. </p>
<p>Part of learning to draw is learning to truly <em>look</em>.  To <em>really</em> pay attention to what something look like, when you look at it.</p></div>		</li>
