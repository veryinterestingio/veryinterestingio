			<div class="markdown"><p>But that’s not quite how movie distribution works. First you sell $15 tickets for the theatrical release. Then it comes out on blu Ray for $25 a pop. Then it gets licensed to streaming services and network television. Then on top of that there’s merchandise. Also, films reach a far wider audience since they are cheaper and don’t require expensive hardware to run.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the end of the day, both industries require specialized firms that focus on their particular industry. It's not easy to go from one to another.</p>
<p>But your logic is flawed. Companies don't get &quot;satisfied&quot; with their profits and get lazy. If Rockstar could make money in Hollywood, they would. But both industries are extremely competitive, and apart from licensing their IP to film studios they simply can't directly compete.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't say they got satisfied. I said that movies are much riskier and less rewarding. The closest thing to a real-world example of this that we've seen is The Warcraft movie, it did not pan out for them.</p>
<p>It's easier for most game companies to license the IP for a guaranteed profit and let someone else take the risk and expense. So that's where we are.</p>
<p>Warcraft movie cost essentially 450 million to create and market and made 433 million a loss of roughly 17 million for a product that took 2 years.</p>
<p>There was a point where Blizzard made nearly 500 million every 3 months off of WoW subs alone.</p></div>		</li>
