<p>It's stop mucus build up, nothing to do with underlying nasal passage change in size as per above.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How were they able to just swap out the active ingredient of cold medicine with a clearly inferior formulation with no consequences? As far as I understand it phenylephrine hasn’t actually been proven to relieve congestion, so big scam all around. </p>
<p>(Yes I am still bitter. My state requires a prescription for real pseudoephedrine but decriminalized all hard drugs, WTF.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then how come when my sinuses swell to the point I physically can’t breath through my nose, I exhale the menthol through my nose and get instant relief. I can all of a sudden close my mouth and actually sustain myself through just my nose. It seems to actually be opening up the airways to me</p>
<p>Edit: it’s menthol vape juice</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you breathing the menthol in with steam? If so it's the steam that's doing it.</p>
<p>If not... then perhaps doctors would like to examine you? Because there's really no other known explanation.</p></div>		</li>
