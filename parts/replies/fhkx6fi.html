			<div class="markdown"><p>Out here in Oz they lower it +/-.00x every few hours (seemingly, but still from observation[179.9, 179.1,... 169.9) for days at the peak of prices, then by a few cents...then after no global war breaks out back to 124.6 and woosh, another thingy goes boom and what took weeks to go down ~20% is back at the peak in moments. It's worth knowing the trends and swooping both cars to the pump as soon as the first station ticks up</p></div>		</li>
