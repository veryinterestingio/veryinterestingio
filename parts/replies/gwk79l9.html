			<div class="markdown"><p>No need to stop at donut though. The whole surface of the donut is a permeable membrane, actively exchanging with the environment. Stuff goes in and out all over. We sweat water and salt and absorb air and other chemicals. And all of that stuff, us included, is made of atoms that are mostly empty space, which subatomic particles are passing through or colliding with. Neutrinos are zipping through us at unimaginable rates as we hurtle through the jet-stream of space-time, our bodies temporary eddies on a 4D surface, our consciousness an eddy within that whirling fabric of our selves.</p></div>		</li>
