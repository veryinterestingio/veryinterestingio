			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;one way to think about it is that the time it takes light to move from one point to another is actually the time it takes for space-time itself to change to accommodate a changed state in some other location&quot;</p>
<p>Most of us have heard before that if the sun were to instantaneously disappear, it would take 8 minutes for us to realize it because it takes that long for the light that left the sun the instant before the sun disappeared to reach the earth. </p>
<p>But what really blew my mind and what ties to your statement is the fact that the sun would also still be exerting it's force of gravity on the earth for 8 minutes after it disappeared from existence as well, because it would also take that long for space-time on earth to change to accommodate this new sunless state.  So we would still be orbiting something that no longer exists for 8 minutes until shooting off into the cosmos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems common even today that people think of space and time as separate entities instead of as spacetime. They are one in the same, and things get really weird when you follow that rabbit hole.</p>
<p>I would recommend the book Parallel Worlds by Michio Kaku as a solid bathroom reader.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That one isn't really that strange. Imagine if a machine gun was fired and the split second that the 100th bullet left the barrel the gun disappeared. Even without the gun those 100 bullets still fly towards their target and damage it when they hit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it's not quite like that either, is it? Because thinking like that implies that there is a universal time frame, when actually special relativity tells us that there is no such thing. We will not be orbiting something that does not exist for 8 minutes, rather would the sun, while no more being in its own frame of reference, actually still exist in ours for 8 minutes. There is no such thing as absolute simultaneity. The universe is weird as fuck. What's not to love?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But causality still exists. The sun will disappear before the effects of it disappearing are felt by the Earth. You can boost into other frames to make that time as arbitrary large or small as you want, but it will not be zero.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TL:DR is that, to the photon, the speed of light IS infinite.  It is just time dilation that makes it less so for the rest of us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was very hard for me to understand, and still is to a degree. A while ago someone posted an x/y axis that explained how the speed of something and the time were correlated and how light perceives it with a good explanation. Would kill to find that image and post again, because that's when it really clicked for me but I lost it. Weird how that can happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember a physicist explaining it like below and it helped me (paraphrasing):</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything in the universe has the same 'speed' through spacetime and it is the sum of velocity and the rate of passage of time.</li>
<li>If an object has a higher velocity, the rate of time has to be slower and leads to time dilation</li>
<li>If the object has a lower velocity, time...does the opposite of dilate, whatever that word is.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wasn't a math major so I probably didn't use the right terms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might be interested in a small series by minutephysics which uses a diagram like the one you're describing,  and they describe a bunch of different relativity concepts using it.</p>
<p>I'm on mobile, but I could dig up the link if people are interested</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From your perspective, if you left the Earth traveling at the speed of light, you could arrive anywhere in the universe instantly.  The caveat is that time will continue to pass in Earth time.  Travel 1 light year and it will be 1 year on Earth.  Travel a million light years and a million years will pass on Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is under no obligation to make sense to you.</p>
<p>Causality has a speed.</p>
<p>The physical can only have an effect at that speed.</p>
<p>High level physics doesn't make sense, except in terms of the data and observation.  Insisting it make sense at a low, classical level, is the first mistake students make and it's part of why they have trouble with it.</p>
<p>Trust the data first.</p>
<p>Then note that even if relativity doesn't make sense, it matches the data.</p>
<p>That's the only way to make sense of it; to accept that reality is weird, and that we were not evolved to make sense of things outside the scope of our perceptions.</p></div>		</li>
