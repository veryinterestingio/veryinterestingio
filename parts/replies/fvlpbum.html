<p>Not really. It’s mostly an aesthetic choice. Some stones can stain, which is not ideal. I just love soapstone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There really isn't a &quot;best.&quot;  Even the most-expensive materials have advantages/disadvantages.  Some are more likely to get cracks and chips.  Some are more easily stained by certain foods or other products.  Some are more likely to get damaged if you set a hot frying pan on them.  And, of course, each has its own unique appearance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stainless steel appliances are now &quot;average&quot; because even cheaper models are made in stainless by default.  Our white fridge went kaput right at the end of lockdown. When we went to get a new one, white to match the rest of our kitchen would have cost more, and have be ordered, but because of lockdown,  factories were on backlog with special orders. So we settled for a steel fridge, upgraded our stove to match, now we a stuck with a 6 month old white dishwasher (also had to be ordered).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of &quot;average&quot; or typical things are still seen as good selling points, to potential buyers.  It's like advertising a car with interval wipers, cruise control, or a rear-view camera.  Such items are very common, on modern vehicles, but mentioning them in ads still works.  It's just keywords, within a short description, to keep a shopper's interest and make them want to know more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cheap stainless steel appliances need to be cancelled. So annoying to clean, and I swear that the “stainless” steel fridge in my “luxury” apartment is fcking stained. Like a ghost stain, a weird spot where the steel is just a slightly different shade and literally nothing ive tried gets rid of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get it. It used to mean something when the only stainless appliances were Sub Zero fridges and Wolf stoves for 12k each, but now every cheap appliance is made in cheap stainless by default. Another thing i noticed, if you dont buy from the same manufacturer are slightly different sheens and colors of &quot;steel&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
