<p>Its important to note, that all things that bind with hemoglobin do so on a saturation curve. That means that they never bind 100%. Instead it binds and falls off and then rebinds. Carbon Monoxide (CO) doesn't bind permanently, it just binds faster and tighter than Oxygen (O2).</p>
<p>To go further we need to talk about equilibrium. In all simple chemical reactions there are actually 2 reactions: a forward reaction and a reverse reaction. Because the CO is not permanently bound, there is a forward reaction (binding), and there is a reverse reaction (unbinding). In chemistry there are many ways to shift equilibrium, most notably remove the product from one side. We want to shift towards unbinding so we want to remove the CO from the system so that more will unbind.</p>
<p>Next we need to talk about competitive binding. Which is the idea that each binding site can only bind a specific number of molecules. So if something is already binding something new can't kick it out.</p>
<p>Next, take the two ideas and combine them. By removing CO from the environment (I.E. expiration). We create new binding sites. And by exposing the new site to a higher concentration of O2, we prevent the CO from rebinding. </p>
<p>Eventually as equilibrium is continuously stressed, the CO will be slowly purged from the body. </p>
<p>All this from just breathing high concentration O2.</p></div>		</li>
