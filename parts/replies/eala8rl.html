			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) but yes, it's absolutely massive and it gets internal rainclouds on humid days. They apparently open the doors to prevent this. Couldn't find a picture sadly</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That building is cool in that neither the footprint or the height are actually that huge, but the building is a cube which is a very efficient volume to surface area shape so it feels enormous on the inside compared to how it looks on the outside. I got to tour that building about 6-7 years ago and it was just after the shuttle program had been shut down. Discovery was just sitting in the corner waiting to be moved to the national air and space museum and I got to touch it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really cool! I never got to go near it, was just on the bus tour of the landing pads that drives past it. You're right that it really doesn't look as big as it is. Its' proportions don't give you a good sense of scale. It looks like a big building, but not excessively so, until you really pay attention to the cars parked near it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming OP was wondering how big a building would have to be that it has its own water cycle that includes clouds, so this should be a solid enough example at least. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that is more or less what I was asking, but I was more specifically wondering if there were some specific limiting factors that you would have to overcome to make it happen, and how you fix those kind of things, you know?</p></div>		</li>
