			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that definite though? I mean I know about the sulfuric acid rains there, but does that actually happen at the altitude and temperature we are talking about? Is it like rain on earth, in that it happens occasionally, or does the actual air around you contain sulfuric acid at all times like our air contains water vapour at all times?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it does. The sulphuric acid is also naturally occurring in the air, so ignoring rains we’d still need protection. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would depend on what you’re standing on. The reason the outside of an airplane is so windy is because the airplane uses its engines to push itself through the air. The “wind” you are talking about is created by the motion of the plane. If you went up to similar heights using an air balloon, or other method which moves according to prevailing air currents, the wind drops dramatically. The height you can reach standing exposed in an air balloon is limited by oxygen content, not by wind (as long as you’re ok coming down a long way from where you went up).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem isn't just uv rays though. Earth's fabulous magnetosphere protects us from tons of other dangerous EM radiation from the sun, as well as the surprisingly dangerous cosmic radiation bombarding us from the rest of the galaxy at every moment. Radiation protection will need to be significantly beefier than whatever you'd be using to protect you from the chemicals. </p></div>		</li>
