			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it was probably an inevitable transition.  I never bought $0.99 apps.  I'd blow $1 on tea at McDonald's, rent a crappy movie for $4, and forget to call Comcast to get my promotional rates back, but the idea of paying $1 or $2 for an app or game was just too far out of my comfort zone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually exactly the same thought process led me to become a paying customer.
I will enjoy McDonald’s coffee. For 5-10 mins. I may enjoy the app (or get benefits from it for so much longer).
So I started buying apps and paying to remove the ads because this was actually saving me time.
Problem is now decent apps cost a lot more than 0.99 and without demo or decent video review you are stuck with your own gut feeling whether or not such and such app is worth 10usd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I'm from the era where if you wanted a free game you'd get a disk that had a load of demos on it, and then just buy the game later.</p>
<p>I do think the consumers share blame with developers here, though; mobile gamers especially are often incredibly unwilling to drop £5 on a well-rounded and complete game, and instead will drop £50 on a freemium cash-grab just because the cost is offered as smaller sums at a time. </p>
<p>I was really excited for mobile gaming when it first started becoming possible, but it's just so saturated with trash that I find I just end up playing emulated games from other platforms. My most used game on my phone is nethack...</p></div>		</li>
