			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to learn something even a bit more interesting, check out &quot;two's complement.&quot;  Basically it's how you turn addition into subtraction.  So 5 - 3 is instead represented as 5 + (the twos complement of 3).  Check it:</p>
<p>3 = <code>00000011</code></p>
<p>two's complement of 3 (invert all the bits and add 1):<code>11111100</code>  +  <code>1</code> = <code>11111101</code></p>
<p>Okay 5 = <code>00000101</code></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So now we add 5 and two's complement of 3....</p>
<p><code>000000101</code> (5)</p>
<p><code>+11111101</code> (two's complement of 3)</p>
<p><code>---------</code></p>
<p><code>000000010</code> =2</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Holy crap... we just *added* two numbers to accomplish subtraction... computers are crazy like a fox.</p>
<p>...every math operation is therefore derived from addition... CPUs have a circuit called an &quot;adder&quot; and that's its whole job... of course, we've built all kinds of crap on top of that these days, but conceptually they all work the same way at the lowest level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if all computers can do is flip bits, add bits, store bits, and retrieve bits. How do we get from addition to machine code to a compiler that can interpret high level language? Can anyone explain a basic hello world program in terms of addition? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just wanted to add to this, as I found it interesting: </p>
<p>The &quot;Inversion + 1&quot; for representing negative numbers works because its just like borrowing ones while doing subtraction.</p>
<pre><code> 1111111           11111   
 00000000          00000000
-00000004 =       -00000100 =
 --------          --------       (inverted)        (+1)
 99999996          11111100  ==&gt;   00000011   ==&gt; 00000100</code></pre>
