			<div class="markdown"><p>The world will never change to meat free. Trying to pursue that is useless. Though I do not disagree with you sending that message does more harm then good. Tell the world to eat no meat nothing will change. Explain to the world why their meat intake should lessen. That is possible. Specifically in the red meat area. I am not an expert but I watched meatsperocy (spelling is wrong) recently had the content is great but the message is wrong. Increase the price of red meat. Remove government subsidies and force the population to pay more then they will eat less. Stopping of eating meat won't happen but if every person cut their meat consumption in half (especially beef) then the positive impact to the planet and space would be big enough to make a difference. </p>
<p>IE kill mcdonald's, bk, and all other fast food chains. Not only do they use much of this meat, they waste more than all humans do in their homes. </p>
<p>My opinion. But remove meat won't happen. Convince the population to make it an additive and not a primary part of the meal. That can happen. Maybe. Someday. </p>
<p>Again. This is my opinion. Disagree or not it is not scientific fact. It is simply my opinion. I eat meat. I just eat way less than the average person. Veggies taste great in the proper cooking techniques.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just need to make sure it doesn't get killed by the entrenched interests and that'll be a huge ecological advance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this point. As long as you don't tell the average person it's cultured. The vast majority of meat eaters say that cultured meat isn't real and therefore they won't eat it. But I agree this has a lot of potential in solving the eco problem. Interested to see where technologies in meat can take us. </p>
<p>Big issue is lack of eating meat and cultured meat will kill many local farms and there jobs as major farms 500 head or more strong are very industrialized. And they have a lot of money. They won't go down without a fight. </p>
<p>I come from a town of 1500 people that has 1800 head of cattle in just two of the many farms. The count comparison is confusing. But they are major industrial farms and are basically the problem. </p>
<p>We also had small farms that are dying (aside from one, dead) because of industrial farming in the area. </p>
<p>That being said all innovations are hit with backlash bit it is meant to enhance our world and meat sciences will have a huge impact on the survivability of our planet and out wanting to eat meat at the same time.  It is a regional thing though. My home area dominates the land with agriculture. Most towns around me have more cattle than people. No joke the demographics are very unbalanced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Never said to stop eating meat all together. Well done you for eating less than average. That's more than could be asked for. </p>
<p>Everybody going strictly vegan is unrealistic and would affect a lot of business. There's a difference between veganism and sustainablism.</p></div>		</li>
