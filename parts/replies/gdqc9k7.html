			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, no. It's not that pharma was caught &quot;flat footed.&quot; Pfizer has multiple protein subunit vaccines in their pipeline for infectious diseases, vaccines aren't really a neglected area. The pneumonia vaccine I believe is Pfizer's top drug by revenue.</p>
<p>The advantage of nucleic acid based vaccines for COVID is mostly about speed to market. DNA/RNA is easier to use as a platform technology, as you can take a template, insert your target gene, and go. Proteins require more individualized process development in order to successfully produce, which takes time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. The pneumococcal vaccine is indeed profitable, but it's an outlier. The vaccine industry was shrinking over the last several decades, though the pneumococcal and HPV vaccines did revitalize the industry in recent years. </p>
<p>Of course a company the size of Pfizer would have vaccines in their pipeline, they have literally dozens to hundreds of projects in development at any time. Based on info from their website, they have 8 vaccines for infectious diseases (3 of which are additional pneumococcal vaccines), vs. 33 drugs for cancer and 25 drugs for immune diseases. In comparison, Astrazeneca has 172 projects, and their only vaccine project is the COVID one. Draw your own conclusion from that. </p>
<p>Speed to market is an important point, but it is not a surprise that both Moderna and BioNTech are frontrunners, they were literally using the same mRNA platform to develop cancer vaccines immediately before COVID.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look, I used to work at Pfizer on vaccines. Calling it a neglected area is a bit of a laugh; they really want to find the next pneumo. The big reason for the difference in the number of new projects is that there aren't a ton of high profile infectious diseases left without vaccines. Meanwhile, there is huge unmet need to oncology, so it's a lot easier to fill a niche. Most of those oncology projects will end up failing, while vaccine projects tend to have a higher likelihood of success. </p>
<p>Part of this is related to trial size, in that vaccine trials tend to be quite large compared to oncology trials. If you are giving a drug like a vaccine to healthy individuals, the tolerance for safety issues is quite low. For someone dying of cancer, the tolerance of safety issues is much higher, so they don't require clinical trials to be quite as large. All that is to say, the large size of vaccine clinical trials means that pharma companies like Pfizer only advance really promising candidates that are mostly likely to be approved. Meanwhile, for oncology targets they will put tons of candidates in the clinic since the trials are relatively cheap.</p>
<p>In any case, Pfizer has in-house platforms for making protein subunit vaccines. I know because I worked on one. I also know that it takes years of development for Pfizer to get a protein subunit drug ready for clinical trials. Take RSV for example. Development of Pfizer's RSV vaccine was enabled by the discovery of the RSV spike protein crystal structure by the NIH in 2013. Pfizer's protein subunit vaccine against RSV entered clinical trials in 2018. While I wasn't exactly privy to Pfizer vaccine development strategy, I expect that Pfizer discussed making an RSV vaccine as soon as they were made aware of the NIH results.</p>
<p>Pfizer could have easily made a COVID vaccine by adapting their techniques for making protein subunit vaccines if they felt it was beneficial. There would have been big advantages to this for Pfizer; no sharing revenue with BioNTech, less retrofitting of manufacturing plants required since they have experience with protein subunit vaccines, etc. They went with BioNTech simply because it was by far the fastest way to get a vaccine in the clinic.</p></div>		</li>
