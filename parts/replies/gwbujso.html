			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the rationalizing part of my brain is reading this as &quot;you cannot experience reality as it exists without the bias of human interpretation&quot;, just as a fly can observe the world by piecing together hundreds of images from its multitude of eyes, we are limited to the two we see out of to perceive reality, as well as how our brains evolved to interpret that reality</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of the argument that a coach talked to use about. In shorter words, he said that we are our own gods. Like, when people pray in essence they are talking to themselves to achieve something they are hoping god assists with. For some reason the more work they put in the closer they are to getting to that goal and thanking god for the assistance. In actuality, you are speaking to yourself and believing (placebo) in outside powers assisting you. </p>
<p>The people that do nothing and pray for assistance are always the first ones to complain they weren't getting what they wanted.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It seems patently obvious that when we pray we're just talking to ourselves. Some might think that is of no value, then. I disagree - I think that if we do so with intention, it actually has a great deal of power.</p></div>		</li>
