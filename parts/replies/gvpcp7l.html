<p>You're starting with a tiny group of people that have suffered breakthrough infections and an even tinier group that have had serious consequences. Then you cut it down further by crosstabbing by [age, previous infection, etc.]. The vaccine is so effective it will take a long time for any meaningful estimates to be made about the rates for these small populations and the rates are too small to spend much attention on.</p></div>		</li>
