			<div class="markdown"><p>Electric cars do have gears but not gears you can change for multiple gear ratios. A Tesla Model 3, for example, has a gearbox with a fixed  9:1 reduction.  To reduce the rotation ratio you neat at least two gears in the gearbox.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have an electric and it has gears. No transmission, but it has a gearbox that is full of gears.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>car traveling at 80mph... Wheels are 24in in diameter. The circumference of the wheel is approximately 75 in. The car is traveling 84480 inches per minute. So the wheel is rotating at 1200RPM. Most electric motors operate at peak efficiency at RPMs higher than this, such as 3000rpm (Though you can design their efficiency for a particular RPM.) So your electric car has gears (such as 3:1) so that the motor is turning at the most efficient speed for the most common speed you drive at and the diameter of your wheels.</p>
<p>It is also advantageous to have a transmission in electric vehicles so that the motor is always spinning at its most efficient rpm and the transmission changes this output to match the current speed of the car. Continuously Variable Transmissions (CVT) are especially good for this. </p>
<p>However, I suspect vehicle manufacturers aren't putting transmissions in because it increases their cost. Electric cars are far cheaper to manufacture than gas engine cars. A gas engine consists of hundreds of parts; many moving requiring high tolerance bearings. An electric motor consists of less than a dozen parts and only one moving part that requires comparatively simple bearings. Maybe another dozen parts for a static gear box. But companies don't want to educate about that and they crank the cost up because it's new and they can also crank it up further because they know they can convince you to pass the cost on to your state and federal government as rebates. Made worse by you also don't need a transmission which is a horrendous collection of precision parts. The only new cost is incurred is a battery and a complex high power electrical distribution system. But as a commodity product this is not all the expensive because it can integrated quite well like the motherboard in your computer.</p></div>		</li>
