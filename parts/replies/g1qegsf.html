			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically what DNA does, it tells your cells what proteins to grow. After you got those proteins, they start adding some other stuff on them, say lipoproteins(with fats) and glycoproteins(sugars). Those are the proteins that give the cell its shape and function. Whenever this system is broken, you get cells with different degree of abnormalities. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this. Cells make protein to create a structure and also destroy structure to create complex structures.</p>
<p>Take  for instance your hand, there were cells in between your fingers that  were their during development but then died, creating that space between  fingers. So the hand wasn't just created one finger at a time, that  would be very difficult. Instead many places in the body have a rough  draft that then gets sharper over time, by adding and subtracting.</p>
<p>Now, I hand it over to another more knowledgeable redditor</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In rare cases the cells between the fingers during development donâ€™t die and when the baby is born it basically has webbed hands. Surgery can help correct this.</p>
