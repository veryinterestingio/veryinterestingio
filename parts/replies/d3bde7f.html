			<div class="markdown"><p>So if we were to have a kilometer long line, and we stuffed it into your normal jeans pocket, and we maintained a constant walk that didn't change - we could actually calculate the number of knots? Or does it not work like that?</p>
<p>Or what if we threw the the kilometer long line in a 1 cubic meter box, and released it into space whilst spinning - would it not get tangled if it were to just drift and not spin? What if the box was spherical, would that make a difference?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't work like that, You could calculate an expected average, but not a precise number.</p>
<p>It's similar to the way bingo machines and lottery machines work.  On average, we can predict with incredible accuracy the results of a thousand draws....  but predicting just one is virtually impossible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK, so let's say your pocket is 6 inches deep. That gives a Schwarzschild radius of 3 inches; multiply by c^2, divide by 2G, divide by 66 grams per metre (for 12mm cord)... gives 82 billion light years, or 25 Gpc; that's 90% of the radius of the observable universe. </p>
<p>At $1/m that rope would cost approx. 54 trillion years' worth of US GDP; put another way, if the entire economy of the Old Republic had been dedicated to producing rope to stuff into your pocket, by the time of the Battle of Yavin it'd still be only 15% of the way through the task.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At a BoE estimate: is your pocket maxes out at about a 5cm radius sphere then that is the Schwarzschild radius of ~3.4*10^25 kg, rope is probably about the density of water, and we'll say since you're fitting it into your pocket that the rope is about 2cm thick so that gives a length somewhere around 3*10^29 m, or about 30 trillion light years. </p>
<p>It would take a while. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you were somehow able to put a kilometer of anything you would describe as rope into your pocket, it's going to be stuffed so tightly that it wouldn't be able to move relative to itself, so other than anything that happened on its way in, it won't tangle. I just skimmed the paper, and they don't appear to mention it, but the box they're shaking the string in seems like it's mostly empty space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your intestines are at little risk of knotting up as they aren't just heaped up inside your belly. They are attached to a fold of tissue called the mesentery, which keeps them in place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your intestines can get knotted (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvulus" target="_blank">volvulus</a>); but the intestines are attached to the lining of your gut in spots to minimize this.  It is not a good thing when it happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the intestines are held in place by the mesentery*. Nevertheless it's possible for a loop of the bowel to at least twist or in some cases even knot (in the &quot;tight knot&quot; sense in math-speak), a condition termet a volvulus. Apparently this hurts quite a bit.</p>
<p>* I've been told they cut that off when taking the intestines out for surgery. But don't take my word for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This strikes me as an entropy sort of thing, right? The number of states we'd consider a &quot;knot&quot; probably far outweighs the number of states we'd consider &quot;not tangled.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sorta, but we're way too far from the thermodynamic limit for this way of thinking to provide really useful quantitative predictions. For example, you really cannot assume any kind of ergodicity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably also an &quot;energy&quot; thing.  And by energy here I mean transition probabilities .  knotted states are probably harder to get out of so you have progressively more knotting over time </p></div>		</li>
