			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a point of clarification - the liver can be divided into four lobes (right, left, quadrate, caudate) but typically in medicine it is divided into 8 anatomic segments (Couinaud segments), as the segments are determined by blood supply. The amount of liver you need to survive (aka the minimum amount needed to regenerate when left behind) is 20-30% for a person with a young and 100% healthy liver. It is not based on lobe. If you have had chemo in the past, any type of chronic liver disease, you will need more. There are perfusion studies that can help determine how much liver you need to leave behind in a liver resection. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The liver doesn't regenerate lobes, by the by. The existing lobes just swell in proportion to the missing lobes, which is why you can only donate once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not a minor surgery. Anytime you open someone up, even for simple stuff, it’s a big deal due to risks involved. Risks might happen only like1% of the time, but if they basically maim someone for life, that’s 1% you want to avoid. Also, surgical risks aren’t just during or shortly after, even the fact that you have surgical scars is in itself a fairly serious risk (as now you can more easily have your innards catch and stick on the scar tissue). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For donation, they would need more than a single segment, as it's not just the liver that needs to be taken from you. They need to take adequate artery, vein, and bile duct to reconstruct normal blood flow and biliary drainage in the recipient. Additionally, the organ recipient will be ill with liver failure and need more than a single segment to survive. </p>
<p>Although it is wonderful that living donation is technically possible and an option for people in need, it does not come without risk for the donor. It is a major abdominal surgery. Specifically for the donor, you are on the operating table for a long time (5-6 hours) and risks include blood clots, bleeding, death, bile leak, injury to surrounding structures, etc. The recovery will also take 4-6 weeks. If you are interested, all the major transplant centers have information on their websites. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since physical trauma to the liver is so life threatening (I’m thinking even just stab or impalement, because bullet trauma is a whole other level), how do transplanted livers and their host survive, since the liver lobe has been cut in half? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Liver trauma is dangerous because of uncontrolled bleeding, and in severe liver trauma, uncontrolled bile leak. In a transplant situation, the bile ducts and blood vessels are very carefully controlled (ligated, cauterized, reconnected in the recipient). Simplified - in a trauma, you don't die from liver failure, you die from bleeding (which if you bleed enough, you cause liver failure amongst other things). Although a surprising amount of blunt liver trauma can be managed with just careful observation, there is low threshold to go the operating room if you suspect the patient has ongoing uncontrolled bleeding (or they come in with penetrating injury). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't believe so. The liver grows back to the original size but not shape. So imagine you have a 2000sqft house, the kitchen catches fire. The kitchen doesn't get rebuilt; instead the dining room, garage, and pantry all get bigger. When you donate you basically donate a few rooms, the rooms themselves can't be subdivided.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No because it’s not just the liver that is needed for donation. The artery, vein, bile ducts are needed too, and those don’t regrow. And you can’t just attach a piece of liver to a liver.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. One and done for liver. Once you donate part, your liver regenerates almost as “one big liver” rather than one with multiple lobes so you can’t cut it again and regrow. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually I think it’s your immune system that wears on the transplanted organ.  The drugs are to help with that, but they’re not perfect.  </p>
<p>Probably they strike a balance, using drugs that leave you a somewhat functional immune system, so you don’t die of infection, but suppress the immune system enough to prolong the organ’s life</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The drugs used post transplant turn your immune system off.  There is a risk of infection, illness, and cancer. Liver transplants require the least amount of drug, heart/lung require high dose meds, and kidney s fall in the middle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is more or less correct. Depends on the transplant, but many will fail due to chronic rejection before age of the donor organ is much of an issue. The antirejection drugs help with that, but only go so far. Lungs in particular tend to fail quite quickly and haven't really seen much improvement since we've started doing them. </p>
<p>30 years would be pretty impressive. </p></div>		</li>
