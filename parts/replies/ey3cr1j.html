			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, this program is absolutely magic. I've got ~5tb of files across three physical drives in my pc, and Everything was able to index everything in seconds, and then the search result list updates in real time as you type into the search box.</p>
<p>It's unbelievably effective, to the point where I wonder how it can do it so well while every other tool fails so hard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Windows has a very sophisticated file handling so any program can just say &quot;give me that file&quot; and Windows does all the work of dealing with the file system used, decompressing and decrypting as necessary, informing the antivirus software, etc. All this flexibility results in complexity and is fairly slow.</p>
<p>Everything knows that all it needs is a list containing every file, so it just skips Windows and reads the Master File Table directly from the hard drive.</p></div>		</li>
