<p>omeone please answer this; I thought the hissing was related to the suspension change in the schoolbus, when it starts hissing the suspension drops to allow easy access into the first step of the bus. I havenâ€™t seen a reply ye</p>

<p>Yes, correct. When they do that, its more of a ssssssssss sound, but when a heavy vehicle engages the park brake, its like a PSSHhh sound, which is what the OP is referring to. If that makes sense.</p></div>		</li>
