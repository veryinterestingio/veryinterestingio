			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question: why did stagecoach drivers sit on the right side? No steering column, no drive shaft, no pedals...</p>
<p><a href="https://truewestmagazine.com/why-did-stage-drivers-sit-on-the-right-side/" target="_blank">https://truewestmagazine.com/why-did-stage-drivers-sit-on-the-right-side/</a></p>
<p>Because most drivers are right handed and sitting right would let them whip the horses and not hit their passengers on the left. And they could use their free hand to yield a weapon right handed while their left holds the lines.</p>
<p>Of course if you look at old pictures if there's no passenger they would sit in the middle sometimes.</p></div>		</li>
