			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome 👏🏻. I think people don't understand how vital our nervous are. Without them we wouldn't function. I just had a Ulnar Nerve Transposition. Everyone at work acts like I've been exaggerating my pain and the surgery. Even after my doctor has explained over and over how serious surgeries with nerves can be. Nerve pain is excruciating. I'm not suicidal, but having problems in both arms after a 12hour work day, I have laid in bed crying and just thought I can't live like this for the rest of my life. I couldn't pick up even a fork without being in pain. I imagined taking a knife and cutting my wrist because i know that the pain wouldn't even be comparable to what I was already feeling and my pain would go away and I wouldn't have to go through this anymore. Without our nerves the muscle connected dies, without muscles we can't move. People brush over nerves like they aren't no thing 😐. Luckily, our bodies are amazing and with technology. Like I had my nerve worked on and moved, if something went bad and it died in the process, my nerve would grow back, it would take years though, but with technology they would have been able to keep my muscle alive with electric therapy. Unfortunately, once there is permanent damage though there is little they can do because no sane doctor is going to paralyze someone on purpose to let it grow back out. So if there is damage that doesn't work out with surgery someone is SOL. Like most females with Synotic nerve damage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Repetitive work. Like mine happened from bending my elbow for about 10,000 times a day for 7 years and being pushed past my limits without rest 😕. That's why people hate factory work, which is what I do for a living. If I was allowed proper rest it could have been prevented, but considering my job looks at me like 🤑 they don't allow many people proper healing and try pushing them past restrictions and work. So they push them to the point the only option then becomes surgery. I was worked past recovery stage though before I even realized I had it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>it in this TED talk</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's not a TED talk that's a TED<strong>x</strong> talk. TED talks are thoroughly vetted and it takes a lot of work to get one. TEDx talks allow literally anyone with the time and money to do one. Everyone from snake oil salesmen to moon landing deniers have done them. </p>
<p>It's like if there was a Harvardx that gave you a degree in anything for the cost of $5. Then the guys with $5 Harvardx degrees say &quot;Oh I went to Harvard!&quot; and their friends go &quot;oh this guy went to Harvard!&quot;</p>
<p>Look I'm sure that guy has good points but as a rule you and everyone else should ignore Tedx talks. It's a scam.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing with TEDx talks is that their quality is indeed not <em>guaranteed</em>. It doesn't mean that they are always trash though. Some of them are very good. It's just that you can't watch one with a blind trust... But then again, you can't either with TED talks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My problem is that TED talks you can accept are going to be of good quality and the talking points will be sourced to an extent. Even if the claim turns to be bullshit or you disagree with them you know the talk will be interesting and will be able to stand on it's own. As a result any TED talk is looked up on.</p>
<p>TEDx talks on the otherhand banks on the quality of Ted talks to draw people in but are not subjected to the same standards. If a TEDx talk can be anything from &quot;the holocaust isn't real!&quot; to &quot;Hi I'm Elon Musk and here's how I'm working to get to Mars!&quot; than what's the point of calling it a &quot;Ted talk&quot;. At that point you should just say &quot;I saw a presentation&quot;.</p>
<p>The whole reason people emphasize the &quot;TED talk&quot; part about real TED talks is because that way people know that regardless of the presentation you know it's going to be well presented, sourced, and the presenter will be well educated. Just like how people will emphasize if they went to Harvard but will just say &quot;I went to uni&quot; if they went to some random local community college. </p>
<p>In the end both require critical thinking but ultimately TEDx talks are more likely to be trash than TED talks are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Either way,  I support efforts to mitigate confusion between the two brands like this. We shouldn't be posting links to TEDx talks and calling them TED talks. That's not what they are. </p></div>		</li>

<p>But Moseley conducts research in the field, and even though his research is not flawless (pain is a really hard subject to investigate) he did add to our understanding of pain and the treatment of some syndromes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I'm not bashing on Moseley. I'm more or less just saying that you should say &quot;Moseley's presentation&quot; and not &quot;TED talk&quot;. Since TEDx does no vetting it's irrelevant to mention it was a TEDx talk since it's no different from any other talk. </p></div>		</li>
