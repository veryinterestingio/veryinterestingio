			<div class="markdown"><p>3D movie systems that use both techniques exists, and afaik circular polarization is what is mostly used now, because it does not break if the user tilts his head while wearing the glasses.</p>

I didn't know you could do an eyewear filter for this type of polarization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, they've been circular polarized for a long time.</p>
<p>Last linear polarization system I saw used was a LOONG time ago</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the ones I kept and took home to test were definitely circular polarizers.  It’s a linear polarizer and a wave plate, using my linearly polarized desktop monitor and this circulary polarized phone showed clear differences, which differed based on whether the light went through the 3D glasses front to back or back to front.</p>
<p>Definitely circular.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah... apparently my understanding of polarization was not up to par. I stand corrected.</p>
<p>This is interesting. I don't quite understand the waveplate....</p></div>		</li>
