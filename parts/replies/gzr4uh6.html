<p>So now you know what to Google if you want to know more. :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Okay, it's pretty much black magic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not too crazy. Your eye just really doesn't care a ton about colors in comparison to contrast. Your brain makes up a lot of the colors you &quot;see&quot; in real life anyway, so there's not much point keeping things exactly right as long as the overall gradient is somewhat realistic. Your brain literally just fills in whatever is missing.</p>
<p>If the actual shapes or brightness levels are wrong though you can see that immediately. So most of the bandwidth goes towards that.</p>
<p>Watching a video in 4k still has increased brightness detail, though. So it's not just about the color improvements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure this is as big a factor as you think it is. The down scaled image may still be in the same 4:2:0 sub sampling as the original, and not 4:4:4 like you've described. It would depend on the internal implementation of the scaler software.</p>
<p>I can easily believe that they use that extra chroma information during the scaling process, but it may very well be lost in the end step.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meh, trilinear (bicubic) scaling for 4k to 1080p should still keep much of the chroma, but that depends on the scaler working in either yuv 422 or rgb. I'm guessing it's pushing an overlay surface to hardware and that surface is either 4k or 1080p, the 4k one should come out as well scaled (basically the 3d engine runs a shader on it) a 1080p surface would just be normal crap.</p></div>		</li>
