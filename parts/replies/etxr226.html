			<div class="markdown"><p>does every single person on reddit edit their comment right after I post a response to make them seem more correct,vrendering my comment nonsensical after the fact?  I guess being 'wrong' on reddit is worse than death, even if they have to edit history to reverse it. I'm starting to have had enough of this place. thanks for your reply. I liked your comment better the first, more honest version</p></div>		</li>
