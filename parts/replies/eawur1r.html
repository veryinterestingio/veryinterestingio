<p>Could you help me understand this distinction as it relates to quantum mechanics? Because what I am really wondering is if it is possible for the universe to be deterministic. It wouldn't bother me so much that we weren't able to predict or know something, but the idea that we exist in a universe where things happen for no reason or are uncaused is more troubling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your statements are too strong. Bell's inequality leaves the door wide open for an underlying deterministic theory with non-local hidden variables. All we can say for sure is that such a theory would violate Special Relativity. We can also be sure that we don't know definitively if SR is fundamental or not. In fact, I would say that at the vanguard of modern Physics it's fashionable to think about space-time, and consequently SR, as an emergent property, perhaps involving entanglement... ER=EPR anyone?</p>
<p>I think a more accurate answer would be; we think QM randomness is fundamental, but the door is still slightly open for some other deterministic underlying theory. We will probably need a better understanding of Physics at the smalles scales to be certain.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Any non-local deterministic non-local theory like e.g. Bohmian mechanics still retains the property that it is fundamentally random.

<p>Why do you think this? In the Bohmian framework, if I know the initial positions of all the Bohmian particles, then I know their positions for all times. And I can use the knowledge of those positions to predict experimental outcomes with 100% certainty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Many Worlds theory is a deterministic theory that can be made consistent with Special Relativity in the same way that the standard theory is made consistent.</p>
<p>Some infer from the fact that it seems difficult to make the Bohmian theory consistent with Special Relativity that such a reconciliation is impossible. That generalization seems hasty, to me. It was also difficult to make the standard theory consistent with Special Relativity. It took years of dedicated work from many researchers. Almost no one has worked on the problem of making Bohmian Mechanics consistent with Special Relativity, with the notable exception of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.1714" target="_blank">these papers</a> by Detlef Durr and colleagues.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, there cannot. They way to show this is using so-called Bell inequalities. By studying those, you can show that anyone who could predict quantum randomness, could use it that to communicate faster than the speed of light. Special relativity tells us that that screws with the concept of causality, so it basically tells us that quantum randomness is fundamental.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isn't this hingent on our current understanding? </p>
<p>Which is to say, isn't it possible that we're &quot;slightly&quot; wrong, in a way that we can't appreciate or recognize at this time, and that some day we might realize it's all deterministic and we just didn't have the tools or mindset to see it? </p>
<p>Or, perhaps, that some completely deterministic theorem will come along that describes everything exactly as it is and predicts it perfectly? A theory of everything that ends up being deterministic? </p>
<p>I guess the real question is: </p>
<p>Shouldn't the statement be &quot;<em>We don't have any evidence this is the case, and lots of evidence it isn't, but we can't prove that it isn't actually the case</em>&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I said in my comment, it is not just that our current theories imply that it should be indeterministic. Of course quantum mechanics can turn out not to be the most appropriate description of nature - in fact we already know regimes where it cannot be.</p>
<p>But Bell-inequalities do explicitely not rely on quantum mechanics or any other physical theories, it shows that any theory that describes correlations that we have seen in experiments (and that are also predicted by quantum mechanics, but that is not the main point) must either allow for superluminal communication, does not allow the notion of choosing what property you want to measure that is independent of the state of the observed system or must allow for fundamental randomness.</p>
<p>Option 1 doesn't make any sense to our current knowledge, because it would allow for all kind of nonsense like retrocausality.</p>
<p>Option 2 would be pretty sad, because it would mean that empirical science is very limited: The idea that I can choose to measure a certain property of a system independently of the state of the system is something we have to be abler to assume if we want to learn byyobservation.</p>
<p>So Option 3 hurts the least by far.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking we don't know which Option it is, but we definitely know that we have to sacrifice one of them. And the reason why we know that is because there is mathematical contradiction in having free will, our notion of causality, determinism and the experimental correlations that we have measured.</p>
<p>Now you can say: Maybe we measured the correlations wrong, but Bell tests have been refined for several decays now taking into account even the most paranoid ideas of what could trick us into performing not the kind of experiment that we think we perform and now even that we came up with a version that is widely regarded as loop-hole free, the results are yet the same.</p>
<p>Even with all this you can say of course &quot;We never can know anything for sure&quot; and might not be wrong with that, it is still important to stress that we don't believe that nature is random because we have a theory that we trust and that describes it as random, but because we did a really tight hypothesis test on this question which does not depend on a certain theory of how nature works, but a small set of very well-defined assumption which all seem like the kind of assumptions that we almost necessarily need to make if we believe in empirical science as a concept.</p>
<p>edit: To distill the essence from my rambling: The reason why this is much stronger than just our usual physical theory is, that we used falsification. While it is very much true that a theory can never be shown to be true by the means of observation alone, it can be falsified by observation. It's the difference between: &quot;All swans we have seen so far a white and therefore we conclude that swans are white&quot; which can always turn out to be wrong even if the observations were correct and &quot;We have seen a black swan and we therefore conclude not all swans are white&quot; which can only be false if we were mistaken in the observation.</p>
<p>We have experimentally falsified ALL local and deterministic theories of nature by doing the Bell test.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Why is the 3rd option that it must allow superluminal communication? My understanding is that it has to allow superluminal <em>action</em>, but you can have superluminal action without superluminal communication. I mean even the standard collapse theory has superlumincal action, when you do a measurement in spacetime region A, the wavefunction everywhere and 'simultaneously' collapses to the appropriate state. Same with the Bohmian theory, disturbing the particles in one region is 'simultaneously' felt everywhere else in the universe, but that doesn't allow superluminal signalling as far as I know.</p>
<p>Unless you're talking about something I heard once, but was never able to verify, which is that superluminal signalling is somehow possible in the Bohmian theory, it's just statistically unlikely or something like that. Never understood the claim or where it came from.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Don't experiments like the Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser experiment cast doubt onto this certainty about retrocausality?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In order for the theory to not be 'random' there must be a better theory with more information used that would allow you to calculate the value ahead of time. The Bell inequalities are general enough to say that it doesn't matter what kind of 'hidden information' the system is using or how that better theory is constructed. You will always be able to tell that this information exists and is being 'used' to make QM deterministic (but appearing to be random to our experiments).     </p>
<p>The only escape I'm aware of is that if QM isn't a 'local' theory, then there could be this hidden information and we wouldn't be able to tell it's there. 'Local' is kind of a fancy term for 'information cannot travel faster than light'. So if QM allows for faster than light information exchange then there could be deterministic QM that simply looks random due to our limited theory. Personally I think that this is unlikely and ugly, but it is entirely possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, interesting. </p>
<p>To be fair, I wasn't trying to suggest either was more likely. I just sometimes feel we tend to say say &quot;can't&quot; or &quot;definitely&quot; in a way that implies we already know the truth. </p>
<p>Whereas science tends to be an evolving field. So I got curious!</p>
