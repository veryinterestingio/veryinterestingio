			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been trying to drink more water, but I've living by primarily drinking very, VERY low sugar tea for years.  The only real downside is a nasty caffeine addiction that feel like 4 mules and a very large elephant all kicked me in the head if I stop for more than about a day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No joke long ago when I was depressed I turned to soda for my liquids and literally only sodas. Dr pepper to be specific. That's it drink wise morning, noon, night, and middle of the night thirst it was soda for like a yearish. I definitely didn't die lmao. But I had leg cramps almost every night one kidney stone and 1 kidney infection. Thankfully nothing more but I definitely was dehydrated I craved cool/cold water a lot. While I would shower I'd get a strong urge to turn off the hot water and just drink from the shower head. But now that I'm older I drink water a lot more I'm too scared of potentially giving myself diabetes from diet, lack of exercise, and age. Still working at it but hopefully I'll get to a good point.</p></div>		</li>
