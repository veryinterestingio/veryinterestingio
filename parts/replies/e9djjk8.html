			<div class="markdown"><p>To me the weird thing is that, when voting on national level, you still have different rules on who can vote depending on state. In the EU elections (which is like your national level) everyone 18+ can vote (except for Austria, 16). People in prison are allowed to vote as well. </p></div>		</li>
