			<div class="markdown"><p>One question I have, does the infectious time in asymptomatic cases differ from those with symptomatic cases? I would think that if that were the case then the R naught value would be much higher than what is currently known, as there would be a larger window for an asymptomatic person to shed virus that can be picked up by others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the problem is that  community spread is so prevalent that it's probably very difficult to determine for how long asymptomatic people are contagious. It's also very hard to tell when they first got it, since they had no symptoms. it complicates everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of the issue is that at the moment, asymptomatic people are <em>less likely</em> to widely spread COVID because they aren't sneezing and coughing, so you'd need to get closer to them to catch it from them in other ways. But if someone is asymptomatic for COVID but has a symptomatic cough or cold from the flu or seasonal colds, it's easier for them to spread both the cold and the COVID.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mask wearing in the US (as of late June) was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/17/upshot/coronavirus-face-mask-map.html" target="_blank">lower than most of Asia, but much higher than Northern Europe or Australia</a>.</p>
<p>Edit: Yes, I realize that not every country on that list was in the same spot. Not every state in the US was in the same spot either. The only point was to say that mask adoption in the US was relatively high, in particular compared to the place that OP’s study took place. If you have more recent data I’d love to see it (and “you hardly see anyone without a mask now here” is not data).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn’t be surprised if employers other than hospitals and medical clinics will require their essential employees to get a flu shot this year and highly encourage non-essential employees to get their shots. Those who don’t receive a flu shot may be asked to WFH during peak cold and flu season if they have the capacity to do so to keep others in the workplace healthy. I’m sure there will be a run for flu shots more than usual this year and don’t be shocked if they’re in short supply with those in greatest need getting priority.</p></div>		</li>
