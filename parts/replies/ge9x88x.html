			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm having trouble thinking of a protein that does NOT undergo post-translational modifications. </p>
<p>Maybe it's a stretch to say, but I'd wager that the VAST majority of proteins undergo some form of PTM.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't ubiquitination or any other degradation method  necessarily a PTM? Thus are there any proteins which are physiologically non modified throughout their entire  life cycle after translation till degredation is initiated? I would like to propose the following extreme examples: is the occupation of the central Fe2+ ion in Häm by O2, CO or whatever a kind of PTM as it changes the kinetics in allosterically? Does a Protein PTM per definition require a covalent addition of an atom/molecule to an aa chain/removal of originally translated aa s in the chain? If yes then what are we talking about if we say a proteins PTM? Does it have to be a regulated process initated by another protein, peptide or enzyme? Is thermo initated breakage of a protein a PTM? Does it require a molecular actor for the initation of the Modification? Why draw the line between a molecule and let's say a radical?</p></div>		</li>
