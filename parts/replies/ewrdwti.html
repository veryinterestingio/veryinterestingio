			<div class="markdown"><p>In the 80s and 90s we saw some travel coffee cups with weighted bottoms and a flared wider bottom.  This was before the almost universal presence of cup holders in vehicles, so we actually put them on the dashboard or floor.  I know it seems so weird to think of it now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did they also not have travel mugs that stay closed until you press a button?</p>
<p>I drive a car from the '80s without cup holders and it's mostly just been an issue for takeout, but I don't like to waste money on drinks anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also the time period that cup holders were an extra that people bought.</p>
<p>I remember wire and plastic doohickeys that were designed to fit on doors (part slipped between the door and window) and gave you a precarious space to put a hot cup of coffee.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It’s easier to stack a cup that’s wider at the top than one that’s the same width the whole way up or one that’s wider at the bottom.</p>

<p>This is the answer. The rest doesn't matter.</p></div>		</li>
