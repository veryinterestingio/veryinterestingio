Before insulin, as /u/insomniac29 said, diabetes was treated mostly through starvation, and the picture on the left would have been pretty typical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was wondering, when I read the description of kids in comas dying, how old they would've been. How long could someone survive with such poorly-regulated sugar? That's kinda horrifying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is...Type 1 diabetes is an auto-immune disorder. It can crop up at any time in your life. The reason it was seen as a child's disease was because it's not especially common for kids to just fall severely ill once they've made it past infancy and the early portion of toddler.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, chances are they'd be mostly 4-7 and 10-14 year olds. Those are the highest risk groups for developing the disease. And typically speaking? They probably wouldn't see their next birthday once they've had their first bout of ketoacidosis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly it depends. There’s actually a stage called the Honeymoon Period where white blood cells are actively targeting and killing beta cells, but there is still enough producing insulin that the difference is negligible. Honeymoon Period can last anywhere from days to years depending on an individual’s immune response, and ends when all beta cells are gone. After that it’s a diet of low carb, high protein/fat food and water until you die. </p>
<p>Personally, after 10 years of experience, I become unresponsive when my blood sugar has been over 400 mg/dL for a week or so and completely comatose if left untreated for another 24 hours. Once I did actually die for a little bit (in the ER, rescued by adrenaline to the heart (twice)) and getting there from perfectly healthy took 9 days.</p>
<p>Those dying kids could have been anywhere from days to 16 years old, because nobody knows when it’s gonna hit them.</p></div>		</li>
