<p>With the caveat that the most hedge funds these days <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/2699015-do-hedge-funds-really-hedge" target="_blank">don’t actually hedge</a>, but that’s their problem.</p>
<p>Also, PE holding periods are often longer than 2-4 years. You’ll certainly seen those holding periods in PE, but usually that’s closer to VC. I work at a specialized PE where we seek to hold for ~10 years.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A good example of this was what Terra Firma did with EMI, the record company, and ultimately the lender (Citibank) owned the business - but by then TF had got all its own cash out plus some more.</p>
<p>This case study by Terra Firma is useful reading if you want to understand what some PE firms do:</p>
