			<div class="markdown"><p>Why r^3? With no attenuation the intensity would go down as r^2 since that's how the surface area grows, but if the attenuation is constant you'd have some e^(-ar) dependence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does it really not follow the Inverse Square Law like sound and light do? (D1^2 / D2^2 )*I, where I is the intensity at D1? Or is my math just really rusty, and that somehow approximates to a loss of r^3 (very possible, it's been a while)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The shock propagating outward actually photodisintegrates a lot of the heavy ashes of previous burning stages. The star is layered like an onion at that point, where you have the ashes of silicon burning in the core, followed by all of the other stages as you move outward.</p>
<p>The shock creates extremely high temperatures, so the inner layers of the onion structure reach nuclear statistical equilibrium, and the probability of producing any given nucleus is just related to the temperature, the binding energy, and how neutron-rich the environment is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™ve been asking questions like these to my astronomy teacher in high school and not sure if I blame him but he always sort of gives me a dumbed down answer that he would give to the kids who never paid attention. Anyways I was wondering how you know this, really enjoy reading your responses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nitpicking a bit here, but we don't really expect to see very much gold produced in supernovae since even during/immediately after core bounce they shouldn't have the high neutron densities required to synthesize a heavy element like gold. Hence the excitement for the neutron star merger confirming those events as potential sites for heavy element formation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stiffness. If you threw a flexible object like putty into a ball also made of putty, they would probably add on to each other. But if you roll a stiff object like a billiard ball into another billiard ball, they bounce off. Neutron stars, once formed, are more like billiard balls than like putty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the insight! But here is a related question: how is it that all elements (good for example) ends up in chunks as opposed to distributed at the atomic level across the universe? Is it grouped during its production, or or is a phenomenon that happens later (e.g. stratification while it's part of asteroids or planets)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Production of gold deposits is a result of volcanism/tectonics in the latter stages of planetary development that allow different elements concentrate &amp; aggregate into &quot;chunks&quot;. Sometimes there is a biochemical process involved (bog iron for example). IIRC, a lot of the iron ore deposits are thought to correspond with the &quot;Oxygen Catastrophe&quot; as early life pumped free Oxygen molecules into the environment, causing iron oxide to precipitate. Ores are not necessarily &quot;chunks&quot; but rocks where the concentration of certain elements were increased due to these processes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is just atomic or molecular dust when the supernova blasts it out; as the dust clumps together in the formation of planets, geological processes (such as water moving through cracks in rocks and then evaporating, leaving behind any gold particles it was carrying as a vein of gold deposits) create the chunks of stuff you're used to seeing.</p></div>		</li>
