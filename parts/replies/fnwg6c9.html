			<div class="markdown"><p>QuickTime requirements, DirectShow filters that are missing (codecs), or requiring older versions of .dll's. Any of these  can break videos or music in older games.</p>
<p>For example, Monopoly Tycoon, Test Drive 6 and Ford Racing 2 encounter stuttering music that skips all over the place when version 6.05 of a system component (.dll) is present in Windows. Whereas version 6.03 of the .dll makes the music operate properly, however it also requires a removed component to function.</p>
<p>Later versions of Windows Media Player changed how the files were played, as they are now translated by a newer system in Windows. This new implementation causes the music to stutter in <strong>only</strong> these three games.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Whoops, I didn't ELI5. Simplified.</p></div>		</li>
