			<div class="markdown"><p>Viral genomes are nornally smaller, and as all genomes they have conserved parts. Some bacteria have short fragments of viral genome in theirs, in the form of repeats called CRISPR. Those, when transcribed into RNA (guideRNAs) act as guides for the Cas9 to detect when a virus has entered that cell.</p>
<p>In short, they don't check so much for the integrity of their own genome as they do for presence of foreign elements.</p>
<p>Edit: as u/howlitup pointed out, gRNAs themselves are not palindromic, but the way they are organized in the bacterial genome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The palindromic repeats for which CRISPR derives its name strictly refers to the repeats that are separated by “spacer” sequences. Those spacers are actually the snippets of foreign (e.g. virus) DNA, not the repeats. An array may look like: RSRSRSR, where R is a repeat and S is a spacer. I also mentioned this above, but Cas (CRISPR-associated) nucleases like Cas9 often check for the presence of a PAM sequence before they search for the presence of a matching spacer sequence. In this way, CRISPR machinery does a quick check to verify that the targeted sequence is not actually the bacterial genome itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question. Some bacteria actually have an adaptive immune system like us, although it is altogether different. Bacteria are capable of remembering past viral infections by “storing” information at the CRISPR loci of their genome. When viral genetic material enters the cell, its checked and if the viral genetic material matches up with what’s stored at the CRISPR loci, it triggers a cut.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Checked&quot; might be too strong, as a lot of these processes are stochastic (they depend on chance, that the right molecules bump into each other at the right time).</p>
<p>But it happens with enough generality that most of the bacteria successfully fights off the virus.</p>
<p>(Though now I'm interested in looking up studies that have data on this. Because for the virus it's enough if it survives and replicates in a few unlucky cells, so probably there's some equilibrium of this.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey hey, just wanted to add on to your last paragraph, insects have a similar system! They have the Dicer system, which grabs dsRNA that is assumedly from a virus, dices it up into 20nt long chunks, and then searches the insect body for matches to then destroy that RNA. You can take advantage of this system to make the insect target its own mRNA and knock down gene expression. People say insects don't have an adaptive immune system but what's so different in displaying a chunk of RNA to find enemies from displaying a surface protein to find them? Bugs are cool. </p>
<p>I know this Q was about unicellular organisms, so let me add that I think fungi have Dicer too.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>To be clear, it's an argonaute protein that is loaded with the 21-22 nucelotide short interfering RNA and surveils the cell to find and destroy the target RNA, not dicer. Also insects generally use different dicers to target viruses from the dicers used to target endogenous RNAs but there is <em>some</em> redundancy (i.e., you don't totally abrogate antiviral RNAi if you get rid of the primarily antiviral dicer).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They have used CRISPR in vitro (in cells) to disable the HIV provirus in latent cell lines, I believe. The biggest challenges that remain are (1) delivery and (2) mutant proviruses. In other words, it is really hard to deliver CRISPR-Cas9 in a whole organism to all the relevant cells and we're likely to miss some latently infected T cells even with the best delivery methods. And HIV mutates very rapidly so unless you had the right cocktail of targeting CRISPR RNAs you'll likely miss some mutants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They did this with fetuses in China, a doctor decided to try to remove the possibility of HIV infection by removing the CCR5 surface protein from T-cells. HIV is a retro RNA virus, it also undergoes hyper mutation, the reason we can’t beat it is because it’s constantly mutating which means it constantly changes its genetic structure. The current treatment is a cocktail of 3 suppressors of HIV mechanics, and even that isn’t a cure. Some of the HIV virions will embed themselves within T cells and not cause disease. They basically hide from attack and replicate. So it’s hard to kills them all off</p></div>		</li>
