			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Even though I'm lazy and have some random sites with a default password (that's actually been leaked in the past) I use a password manager for most sites, and have a separate (complex) password for both my password manager and my email, both only stored in my head. Even if I'd lose password manager access to someone I could still fight back with email access, resetting everything. If I lose email though I'm fucked. So strong unique password and 2FA is the last line of defense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you know someone who does this and they refuse to use a password manager, at least suggest they prefix each password with the first two letters of the site or service it's for. It at least prevents this, which is by far the most common method of unauthorized account access. If they use the password &quot;honey&quot; for everything, then the Amazon password becomes &quot;amhoney&quot;, the Gmail password becomes &quot;gmhoney&quot;, and so on. Still much worse than using proper unique passwords, but for the forgetful and stubborn, it's almost no extra effort involved and drastically cuts down on the likelihood that passwords leaking from an ineptly implemented and unmaintained web game you played in 2009 gets someone into your email account today.</p>
<p>Likewise, if they write all their passwords down on a chart stuck on their office wall, at least make them unique per site and have some easily-remembered that isn't written on the chart. Have it read &quot;Amazon - B@!K5, Gmail - Y01KN&quot; when the passwords are actually B@!K5-honey and Y09KN-honey. Only one extra thing to remember and now someone can't get into everything just by snapping a photo of the wall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Top comment was removed so I'm assuming we're talking about shifting ip addresses.</p>
<p>If so, you're correct. Even Facebook paid out a bounty and did repairs about a year ago to someone who found they could brute force attempt like 9 times before shifting ip addresses and wouldn't get locked out. With enough virtual machines, they could be brute forced decently easily.</p>
<p>Yes they can lock the account, but if you stay under the threshold (I'm this case, I'm assuming it was 10 attempts) and use US based IP addresses the entire time, you could by pass their lockdown measures. It's been fixed since on Facebook.</p>
<p>Also, hackers just look for leaked usernames and passwords. If they see your email address and old password, they'll try the same combination everywhere else. It's probably the most common tactic, especially when spamming a login page.</p>
<p>I can't stress unique passwords for your amounts enough</p>
<p>Use a password manager if you need to</p></div>		</li>
