			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a selection mechanism that we don't quite understand. If a beekeeper creates a frame with the intention of growing a bunch of queens the bees may or may not accept the eggs provided. They might detect damage or some other weakness and avoid developing the eggs they found unsatisfactory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Read an article which theorized they choose for genetic diversity. Workers can distinguish their full sisters (same father) from half sisters (different father), iirc by pheromone, in the egg as well as adults. The researchers assumed workers would raise queens from genetically-related eggs if possible, ie in the same sub-family, but were surprised to discover the opposite. They tended to pick different sub-families and genetic outliers. Don’t know if the experiment has ever been repeated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmmm, Italian queens also hatch at 16 days-&quot;Honeybee Biology and Beekeeping&quot;, Dewey Caron for a source.  Edit-there are references showing Africanized queens hatch up to two days quicker.  I've heard that Africanized drones do tend to out compete pure Italian drones in flight and in staying out longer during the day making them more likely to mate with queens and hybridize the colonies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're very nearly correct. One minor difference in what you said is in how a queen cell is made. The cell is actually built first. All cells are. The queen walks around laying eggs in the cells. So when she detects a queen cell, she know to lay a fertile egg in it.</p>
<p>Why is it important? It possibly doesn't make much difference. However in the research world, it has been theorised that she might actually produce a higher quality egg when she detects the Queen cell.</p>
<p>She has the capacity to decide whether to fertilise the egg. I could go into greater detail about how we know she has the choice about fertilising eggs, but it's a huge detour from this topic.</p>
<p>There is an exception. What if there are no Queen cells that have been prepared, and the beekeeper accidentally kills the Queen when inspecting the hive? With no queen to lay a new egg into a new queen cell, there will be no replacement and the hive dies.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the workers will build a new queen cell, and choose an egg to place into the cell, then move it. They really don't like to do that, but in an emergency they will. Furthermore, if the Queen hasn't laid eggs recently (rare that this happens, but it could in the winter), and there's a recently hatched offspring. They can move one of the hatched offspring that is under a day old. The Queen produced under these circumstances has definitely been noted to be weaker. It is suspected that an egg that is unhatched and moved into a cell is weaker also, but last I'd heard, there was no research to support it. However this is why it's important that the Queen might lay higher quality eggs when she detects a queen cell. </p>
<p>Tl;dr : any female/fertilised egg can be turned into a queen under special circumstances,but usually an egg is laid especially in the queen cell to become a queen.</p>
<p>Source: biological researcher and former beekeeper</p>
<p>Edit: also, there are rare circumstances that 2 queen's can occupy a hive at the same time. But it is incredibly rare.</p>
<p>Queen cells start appearing in late spring through to summer too. When this happens, the huve can split. Right before a new queen hatches, the Queen leaves the huve with half of the adult bees. They follow her as a swarm, find a new home, and one hive becomes two. Those that stay behind get the new queen as a replacement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome that you know so much! This info is spot on. Anyone curious about bees should read The Beekeeper's Lament - it's highly informative and goes into what bees experience now in comparison to the past, and the issues that beekeepers and their bees have to deal with. It's actually my favorite book of all time - highly recommend to anyone who wants to know anything about bees because it answers it all.</p>
<p>It's also free on Kindle Unlimited. I read it a couple times and then I bought a copy of it for a friend as an Xmas gift and they enjoyed it. Can't recommend enough. Was totally oblivious before but feel like I understand bees and the challenges they face so much better now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if you are getting into bee keeping do you buy a queen? Do you need a queen for each bee box? If you are wanting to make a new bee box and already have one, and you happen to need a queen for every box, how can you get a queen for that box from your other box?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically you would buy a nucleus (Nuc) hive, which is a &quot;starter&quot; hive that comes with a queen and at least a few hundred workers.</p>
<p>Nucs come from existing hives.  When a hive naturally wants to reproduce, the existing queen will lay several queen cells and prepare to leave the hive with about half of the workers.  A beekeeper can watch for this behaviour and remove the existing queen plus some frames of worker eggs and nurse bees (young workers) to another box, leaving the queen cells for the existing colony to produce a new queen for themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are several ways to do it. The easiest is the most expensive. Buy a hive that has everything in it.</p>
<p>The cheapest is to buy the equipment, and set up bait boxes. It's an empty hive in an area where a free flying swarm might fly by. When they swarm they look for suitable homes. You've provided a perfect home and basically just hope a swarm finds it. Many beekeepers leave bait boxes out as often as possible. They often get free bees this way.</p>
<p>A middle ground option is to buy what is called a nuke. It's a very small hive. You put it in the empty hive. There's enough bees in there to support a hives development, and the Queen lays the eggs to fill the hive to capacity. There's maybe 200 bees in it, where a typical hive has 30000 plus bees.</p>
<p>Buying just a queen won't start a hive. It needs workers to collect food. Usually about 6 come with a queen. That's enough to care for the queen. They produce royal jelly to feed her and groom her. But a hive needs bees to produce wax and build. It needs guards to protect the hive. It needs gatherers for food.</p>
<p>You buy a queen to replace your queen. Some beekeepers want specific queen's with specific genetics/traits. Queens get less productive with age, and they want the optimal genetics and optimal queen who can lay maximum numbers of eggs daily. Those sort of beekeepers often change their queen annually (or every 2 years for some). Personally I favour the leave it and let them sort their own queen as needed.</p>
<p>If you're considering starting a hive, it can be cheaper to join a local club and ask them about buying starter equipment. You could also build your own, finding patterns online, or clubs can direct you to patterns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weird that the queens with bees have the responsibility of placing eggs. After ant queens have sufficient workers, they permanently turn into effectively an egg machine that doesn't really do anything. The workers are entirely responsible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's complicated. The Queen is mobile and keeps walking round. She is effectively an egg laying machine though. She gains so much weight that she can't fly. If she needs to fly again in order to swarm, she actually has to slim down a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a fourth generation beekeeper who raises queens from grafting.</p>
<p>Any female larva that is less than ~12 hours old can be successfully grafted to become a queen.  Larva up to a couple of days old could potentially become an emergency queen, but the best queens come from larvae that have just emerged from the egg.</p>
<p>The caste system of the honey bee is a classical evolutionary adaptation to shortage.  Bees cannot produce enough royal jelly to feed all the larvae.  As a result the larvae are fed bee bread.  Bee bread is a mixture of royal jelly, honey, and pollen.  Pollen contains p-coumaric acid, a plant flavinoid.  The p-coumaric acid inhibits the development of the ovaries in the larvae that eat it.  They develop into smaller worker bees with a shorter abdomen.  Queen bees are not fed bee bread, so the development of their ovaries is not inhibited.  The adult female bee that emerges from a queen cell has a long abdomen and fully developed ovaries.  A few days later she will go on a mating flight where she will mate with several drones.  At the instant of copulation the queen bee will rip the entire reproductive tract from the drone, killing the drone instantly and causing a forceful contraction and ejaculation.  She hangs on to it and milks it for all of the semen she can get, which she stores in her oviduct.  Several drones will meet their gruesome fate with her, and then the queen will then return to the hive and she will never mate again.  She will start laying eggs a few days later.  When the queen lays an egg in a worker bee sized cell she has to contract her abdomen.  This causes the egg to pass the oviduct as it is laid and the egg is fertilized.  That egg will become a female bee.  Drone cells are much larger and when she lays an egg in a large cell it is not fertilized.  That egg is haploid, and becomes a male bee.  An older queen bee may become a drone layer when she depletes her supply of stored sperm.  </p>
<p>Worker bees have genes from their mother and one of the drones she mated with.  Those genes are a dead end, that combination will not get passed on since worker bees are sterile.  Male drones have one half of their mother's genes, they do not have a father but they do have a grandfather.   In the wild, a queen will have at most two or three fertile daughters that survive to become a queen bee.  Her drones are the primary way that she spreads her genes into the wider bee community.  Beekeepers who raise queens by grafting can of course select for the desired genes and raise many daughters from a queen.</p>
<p>Occasionally a worker bee will have ovaries that develop enough that she can lay eggs.  However she cannot lay a fertilized egg, it will become a drone.   Most of the eggs from a laying worker will not develop, but the ones that do can become a fully fertile male. Laying workers can doom a hive since they mess up the hive pheromones.  The colony will sometimes kill a laying worker, but sometimes it will get confused and kill its own queen.  Also sometimes a hive that has lost is queen and cannot replace her will develop several laying workers.  This is thought to be a last ditch effort to preserve the colony genetics through successful mating of those drones with the virgin queen of another colony.  This is the only way the worker bee genetics are not a dead end and it is rare.</p></div>		</li>

<p>so basically bees give hormone suppressors to their teens to make them sterile and ready to work to death during their adult life? something, something, hormone therapy lgbTq</p></div>		</li>
