			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I’ve been able to do that for my morning alarms. If it’s 8:30, I’m up at 8:20-8:25. </p>
<p>That feels very different from this feeling I’ve mentioned, (which happened to me this afternoon) where I felt like I was rudely awoken and then one second later  the alarm goes off. I’ve had it happen before (rarely) so I know it’s not a one time only thing. </p>
<p>My mind might be rearranging it as someone mentioned</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you use an actual alarm clock, or your phone? My android phone's default alarm app will pop up with a notification that says an alarm is about to go off ten minutes before the alarm is set. It makes no sound nor vibrates,  but it will light up the screen. That alone usually wakes me up since i sleep in near pitch darkness.</p></div>		</li>
