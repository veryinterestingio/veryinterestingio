			<div class="markdown"><p>Every time you recall a memory it slightly changes. So if two people recall something that happened a year ago, a person who replayed that moment every day has a less reliable snapshot than a person who only recalled it once. To use your analogy, if a memory is like a building in a city, when we come back to it, to do a tiny remodel every time we visit depending on our mood when we go there.
