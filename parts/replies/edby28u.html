<p>Ah yes, the devil’s interval as my old music teacher liked to call them (tongue in cheek of course, he named his business after them)</p>
<p>Edit: I was very aware the term is much older and not invented by my teacher. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, in order to get around this, B was referred to B-mi and Bb was referred to as B-fa as a way of differentiating between the two. iirc B-fa was more typical because of the way the modes were structured, and so the only accidental commonly in use was to raise it to B-mi (natural).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: you probably know that a note's pitch is its frequency (vibration rate), but also</p>
<ol>
<li>Each octive (A to A ...) doubles in frequency.</li>
<li>Each note's frequency is ^(12)√2 times the previous, because it doubles every 12 notes. The A above middle C is the tuning standard at 440Hz. (The next note, A#, would then vibrate at 440 * 1.059 = 466.16Hz)</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also there are different temperament systems. It turns out the reason a fifth sounds great is because it's very close to 1.5x the frequency of the original note. Some systems use exactly 3/2 for a fifth and figure out the rest of the notes based on that. This leads to some intervals sounding better than with the standard &quot;even temperament&quot;, but also has some intervals that sound bad. This system is called &quot;just temperament&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just temperament is tuning based purely on the harmonic series and isn't even really used, but what you've described would more likely be a meantone temperament. Also, tuning based purely on the perfect fifth is Pythagorean, which sounds pretty awful most of the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think when the words “tonics”, “scales” and “feels” / “modes” were used this stopped being ELI5 and became PWAUCN. :( Maybe too much music theory is needed to ELI5. But I’d like to understand this stuff so this question and  the attempt at an ELI5 is motivating to look at an idiots guide or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay so I’ll ELI5 some music theory...</p>
<p>Scales are a set of notes that belong together that follow a pattern. A scale will change depending on what note it started on. The note it started on is called the “tonic”. </p>
<p>Modes are a specific type of scale. They still have patterns, but the notes are all relative. So regardless of what note it started on, it’ll be the same. </p>
<p>All of the modes and scales have different emotions. There’s scales that feel sad or spooky, modes that feel like it’s a rock song. </p>
<p>So the very original explanation is basically this: “a piano originally only had white keys. Since black keys go in between white keys already named ABCDE... you now have to have a way to do A... A.5...B...B.5”</p>
<p>Renaming them wouldn’t work since it messes with a few thousand years of tradition and whatnot. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol yes there is if you don't have your head up your ass about how complicated music actually is and how brilliantly clever you are.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we used to only have the white keys on the piano in the middle ages. So no sharps or flats.</p>
<p>later on in the renaissance people started using notes between these notes. And they fit them around the already established names. We could change to just alphabetical order, but that would just be a different naming system. the notes are all the same, it's just what we call them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's literally just a question about naming conventions. There's a lot of people in this thread describing how a scale works or talking about tritones and other irrelevant bullshit which is absolutely textbook as soon as any music theory wankers get involved in a discussion. </p></div>		</li>
