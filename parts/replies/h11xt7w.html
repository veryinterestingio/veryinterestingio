<p>In our round of testing, they would give you 2 cards from a deck, and the administrator would have to figure out which 2 cards you had. (And you were encouraged to lie)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is so easy to fake, just mentally &quot;choose&quot; a new card. If you draw seven of hearts, in your head just imagine diamond three, answer honestly based on that one, and don't refer back to your original card. You'll answer confidently, which will throw the machine out of whack and confuse everyone when they see your card.</p>
<p>Downside: people will assume you're a sociopath and that lying comes naturally to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is awesome. We did a study in college about polygraphs and our team was actually selected to perform some small experiments to test our methodology. </p>
<p>We had 20 polygraph examiners participate. The premise was two fold, we asked them to review polygraph data from 10 separate polygraph sessions and interpret the results (they would rate their confidence in their assessment, no one self rated their assessment below 95%). Secondly they would be asked to perform an exam on a subject that was connected to their machine but seated in a different room with an intercom to speak to each other. </p>
<p>Round 1, they actually examined 5 actual polygraph exam data files, and five files of people hooked up to the machine while they were watching different types of films and not being asked any questions. The examiners were around 30-45% accurate on the actual data. And of the data for the movies group just under half of the examiners said they were lying. So less accurate than a coin flip. </p>
<p>The second round had worse results. </p>
<p>When presented with these findings the reason we heard most from the examiners was that these subjects were not under the stress of facing criminal consequences! Which is soooo ass backwards! Like guys, this is at best a coin toss and you think that it somehow is going to become more accurate when people are worried about jail time?!? Ugh</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sad reality is that this is a test we regularly apply to people who want to be police officers.</p>
<p>Guess what kinds of people easily pass this test? Sociopathic people who can easily bend their mind this way. You won't get stressed if you don't see the wrong things you do as wrong.</p>
<p>Those are bad traits in individuals who will hold public trust. Meanwhile we want more competent but compassionate human officers and we subject these people to an analysis (tests are accurate) that is biased against them.</p>
<p>Maybe it seems like something out of nothing but the person I know who wanted to be a cop and who I feel is honestly the most profoundly qualified to it on numerous levels washed out at this step. Then I see the news stories with the kinds of people that made it through, sexual assaults, shootings of unarmed people. it's disgusting.</p></div>		</li>
