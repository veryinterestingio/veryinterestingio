			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to think I was such a great philosopher/linguist because I made the connection you made regarding awe full... Along the same lines that awe some meaning only some (a bit) of awe. We need another word to represent lots of awe wherein awe-full fails that spectacularly. My suggestion was that we start saying ‚Äúawe lots‚Äù. I may or may not have been in my weed smoking phase with this winner of an idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's kind of like how pathetic means &quot;stupid&quot; now, when it means like you felt sorrow back in the day. </p>
<p>Like people use it to mean like &quot;you're such a fucking idiot&quot;, when it's actually supposed to mean &quot;I am sorry that you are in this situation&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
