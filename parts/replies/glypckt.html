			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been suggested that humans developed their taste buds for sourness and bitterness as part of their gradual inclusion of fermented fruit in their diet. Not all mammals can taste sour and bitter.
Incidentally the sour taste is a means to sense acidic compounds that form the basis of many vitamins crucial to the human diet.
It's also been suggested that these taste buds developed alongside a proclivity for naturally occurring alcohol.</p>
<p>Very interesting stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue that it is all about surviving, and that pleasure improves the odds of survival by means of increasing the desire to stay alive (to experience future pleasure), or making pain/discomfort relatively worse, or some other such mechanism.</p>
<p>I actually think the paradigm of pleasure being contrary to survival/responsibility is a harmful and pervasive mindset. In my opinion, it takes pleasure to mean &quot;excess short term pleasure&quot; which is actually negative long-term pleasure. But then people read it and think it means &quot;any pleasure.&quot;</p>
<p>It's good to feel good. It's just that it has limits, like (literally) everything else.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They have sex because they have a biological drive to procreate? Something tells me sex feels good.</p>

<p>They rub on things to mark their territory? Betcha they've got an itch, or something like it.</p>

<p>There are a lot more things like this, but these are the only two that are coming to mind right now...</p>

<p>The explanation I've heard is not that they enjoy it (although they might), but that alcohol is a strong indicator of sugar, and sugar is good source of calories, especially for non-meat eating creatures. Plus sugar tastes good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, and you need to relieve stress because your body can't repair itself when it's using the fight or flight system. </p>
<p>When we play, or cuddle people we love, or spend time in nature or doing things just because we enjoy them, we activate something called the soothing system (as opposed to the threat or drive systems). It's when this system is working our bodies take the time to look after themselves.</p>
<p>People who are always stressed and anxious tend to get ill more because their bodies aren't using the soothing system enough. </p>
<p>Interests and play do teach kids skills, but they are also vital for keeping adults healthy and well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely, watch kids play hide and seek or bulldog, then watch a documentary on how wolves or jackals hunt. The tactics and strategies used are exactly the same. Take a dozen kids away from their parents in infancy from all over the world, leave them on a desert island, they will learn to play the same games without somebody teaching them. These games are predatory instincts being trained and reinforced, they transcend cultural and social barriers, and they are baked so deeply into our genome that we intuitively understand how to hunt and kill even though the vast majority of modern people will never do that. </p>
<p>I spent some of my childhood in Malawi and the children would play hide and seek, with the caveat that more children sought than hid, they were more co-ordinated and had specific roles, and when the hiders were found they were beaten with sticks. I've got a chipped tooth and a scar on my chin from the first and only time I played with the local kids. For communities that do occasionally hunt for sustenance or sport it is not just a game, it is training and if you do it wrong in the real world it will get you killed. There are no do-overs in nature.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I often wondered if in such an experiment the children would also invent religion...</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not sure I believe that just because in an apocalypse, I'm not sure I'll be able to catch anything. When I go for walks in the forest, I see squirrels and birds and think I'd like to eat them if I was in the end of civilization and somehow survived, but they're so fast, i could never hunt one. I don't have an instinct how to do it. I think I might be able to trap one, but only because I've seen it on tv, and even then I think I might get it wrong. I don't know what the innate skills are I'm supposed to have, but I don't think I have them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, define passion? Passions are limited to what's available to us. No doubt there were many forms of passion ranging from hunting, cooking, art, caring, climbing, etc. Passions might have been heavily dependant on the aspect of survival, as opposed to today where survival (in the traditional sense) doesn't really have much of a say in what we can do.</p></div>		</li>
