			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't really mind fevers, but sore throats, coughing, and congested nasal passages are the worst. I'll take stuff to keep that at bay so I can sleep.</p>
<p>Only time I really mind a fever is when I get cold sweats. I had it really bad once where I had to change clothes multiple times in a night because I kept sweating a ton and then I'd wake up freezing. Though putting on warm dry clothes after that feels really nice.</p></div>		</li>

<p>you're adding days of discomfort by not taking the fever reducer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And for folks making the call on behalf of a kid, keep in mind that discomfort can become a medical issue if the kidâ€™s so miserable they refuse to drink. Keeping them hydrated is more important than weakening their germs with a couple degrees extra heat!</p></div>		</li>
