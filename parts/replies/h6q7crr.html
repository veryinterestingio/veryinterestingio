			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09982.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> that puts the total possible configurations of the naval model at  2×10^(145).  At that point even a billion-billion-fold increase in computing power is only going to put a small dent into that exponent.</p>
<p>The only reason we managed to crack it at all was a combination of procedural flaws, operator errors, and recovered key book.  (And it still took all the computing power we could throw at it at the time)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We also run into the problem where if we just brute force it, we will get several valid results, with no way of knowing what the actual message is. </p>
<p>Brute force is only good in that it can figure out what it's certainly not. But when the message is &quot;Change course to XXX degrees&quot;, it doesn't help if it spits out 360 different results for XXX.</p>
<p>However, if you know what direction the ship changed to, from the log book or something, you can use that to check other messages and calculate what the actual key was.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats only really relevant if you actually intend to brute force all the possible configurations. Thankfully it was translating a known language with known language rules and the task of brute forcing it becomes infinitely easier if you can get even just one or two characters correct. A modern laptop can do it reasonably quickly if you known the mechanics of the machine itself.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is not the case for the enigma. Roughly speaking the enigma had three types of settings. First you had to pick the order of the 3 (out of 5ish) rotors. (The U-boats also used 4 rotor enigmas). You then had to set the start position of each rotor. Then you had to figure out the wiring for the plugboard. In total there is something like 10^114 configurations. We could not brute force it with modern computers. This large number of configurations is why the Germans were confident in the code.</p>
<p>But there is a flaw that allows you to attack the setting independently. First you run through the 60ish combinations of rotors and find the setting with the best statistics. Then you attack the ~20,000 different rotor starting positions and find the settings with best statistics. And then you can attack each plugboard wire independently  (~1000 trials).  The attack is statistical and the best choice isn't always the correct choice. So in a realistic crack you might need to try the top 5-10 settings. That means to crack a message you have to try ~100,000 settings, which seems a lot, but it's a lot less than the 10^114 combinations. Testing 100,000 settings is trivial with modern computers. Also, since the attack is based on statistics it works best for longer messages. I suspect the last messages to be cracked where short, where the statistics break down. </p>
<p>Also, the flaw means that you don't really increase the combinatorial complexity anywhere near as much as you'd expect. The biggest gain is from adding a fourth or fifth rotor to the machine. But in practice, the complexity of the attack is on the order of 30^n where n is the number of rotors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A real problem with breaking codes with modern computers is that we can “crack” codes quite rapidly in the sense that we can obtain all possible combinations or iterations of a code quite fast. But then what? Now we have to sift through the millions or billions of combinations to find our what is actually language, then what language is being sent, and then what makes sense, then what the text actually is. Not to mention if the text is obfuscated (think turtle is a tank, bee is infantry, etc.) What’s even crazier is that depending on the number of combinations you can get multiple plain texts as possible combinations! </p>
<p>So in the literal sense we can “break” these codes rapidly….but picking out which broken code is correct is a whole other topic. </p>
<p>Language is fun kids!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lorenz cypher that Hitler used to communicate with his generals, and the tunny machine that created it was derived and cracked by Bill Tutte purely from receiving an encoded transmission. A feat even more impressive than Turing's.</p>
<p>So yes, Enigma could be cracked without an enigma machine, but as you say, it's not trivial. Bill Tutte was a once in a lifetime genius who was in exactly the right place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thrice in a lifetime - the Lorentz SZ40 &quot;Z-schreiber&quot; (Tunny) was also solved by two Swedish mathematicians (whose names escaped me att the moment) for the Swedish signals intelligence. Due to the small volume of SZ40 traffic collected by the Swedes however, their work had little consequnces in the end.</p>
<p>The T52 &quot;G-schreiber&quot; (Sturgeon), solved by Arne Beurling, was much more important to the Swedes, as it was used for landline traffic that passed through the country and could be easily tapped.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Beurling#World_War_II" target="_blank">Arne Beurling</a> is also an interesting character. The Germans requested access to land lines through Sweden after occupying Norway and Denmark - they had fancy encryption, so what could possibly go wrong? - and the Swedes said sure, go ahead, and immediately cracked the codes. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Swedes then read traffic in the system for three years, not only between Berlin and Oslo, but also between Germany and the German forces in Finland, and of course the German embassy in Stockholm. In total, the Swedes intercepted 500,000 German messages and decrypted 350,000.</p>
