			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I know we can't use any compost from treatment plants due to liability risk of contamination or heavy metal entrainment. What did the plants do with the material after biodegrading?</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you everyone for widening my view. There are treatment methods for contaminants and heavy metals can he precipitated out. I still don't have a good feel for how common or economical the methods are, but they exist and are practiced. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the quality of the wastestream you're receiving.  Many larger municipalities have upstream (eg in-industy) pretreatment that moves many contaminants that would be detrimental to the municipal wastewater plant and its 'bugs'.  The industry then disposes separately of the hazards.</p>
<p>If your biosolids are of a suitable quality (limited constituents like nitrogen and heavy metals for example) then they can be processed by raising temperature, pH, and dried to form a component of fertilizer, which can then be sold.  (See Class A Biosolids)</p>
<p>If they are of a suitable quality but processing to Class A is not effective due to monitary or environmental concerns they can either be land applied in measured amounts to non-food crops (like for silage) or sent to the landfill for disposal. Some plant actually sell their lower grade biosolids to landfills as it can be used to accelerate methane generation and thus power the landfill. (See Class B Biosolids)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least in Canada, you can make bio-solids into a class a compost, provided your composting facility is designed to do that.</p>
<p>This means the compost reached specific temprqture goals for specific lengths of time, and usually require forced air into it in order to a) ensure the right bacteria proliferate and b) help control the temprature.</p>
<p>It is still recommended that you don't spread class a compost containing bio-solids on a veggie garden, but this is more due to drugs than bacteria risk</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can verify that. My sister is an engineer for metro wastewater reclaimation and they end up selling it as fertilizer. And I’m here for it! </p>
<p>I believe they call it Metro Grow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As you can tell by the username, that's what I do for a living. Well, I design and build the presses.</p>
<p>When everything goes to a wastewater treatment plant, it gets homogenized along the way. A few thousand yards / meters of pipeline at about one yard per second of flow velocity tends to shred and mix almost everything that's not big pieces of kitchen waste, grease or flushable wipes. Grease tends to gradually coat even 60&quot; diameter mains and clog them, and wipes don't ever disintegrate. They frequently clog screens and pumps, requiring stuff to be torn apart and rebuilt, which is exactly as unpleasant as it sounds.</p>
<p>The homogenized mixture goes into a clarifier where it's concentrated by gravity settling, and then into some kind of biological treatment process where microbes, called 'bugs' eat everything they can. They eat the e. Coli, they eat the nutrients like nitrogen and ammonia, they eat anything undigested except tomato seeds and a few other cellulose-heavy things that are hard to break down.</p>
<p>Then the bugs are allowed to settle too in a big tank, and the 'sludge' that's between 0.5% to 5% bugs and the rest water gets either squeezed in a belt press, screw press (that's what I build) or other press, or spun in a centrifuge. That concentrates them to about 20-50% solids, depending on what equipment you use and how you grew the bugs. </p>
<p>At about 13-16%, it's approved for dumping into a landfill because if you put some onto a paper paint filter, it won't drip water through. Yes, that's really the test used. It's sort of like a freshly cooked brownie in appearance and texture, and because it's not actually poop anymore, it doesn't smell as bad as you think. More like a compost heap.</p>
<p>You can also put it on a drying bed, which is a big flat area with sand that it can drain through. That gets it really dry, around 50% solids, but also takes a long time so it needs a lot of space.</p>
<p>Once you're above 25% or so, it starts being economical to incinerate it at high temperatures to create energy and break down any biological material, leaving sterile ash. You can also use the digestion process with the bugs in an anaerobic digester to make methane, which gets turned into LNG. That's often called biogas and can be used to power the entire wastewater treatment plant with more left over. Considering that WWTPs are usually the biggest municipal consumers of electricity, that's not a bad use for poop!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those tomato seeds! For the second time in several years I have had a sewer overflow in my back yard. Old terra cotta pipes and a drought has the tree roots invading rampantly this year (three drill outs so far). The spill happened during the second drill out when the plumber opened a vent port. Area about 3mx3m sludged up. I generously sprinkled it with lime on several occasions, hosed that in, sprinkled more. Left it baking in the sun for 3 months. Pulled out the foot high grass that had grown on the patch (was winter here, rest of lawn hadn't needed mowing in months) and low and behold - up come the tomato plants. Same happened last time even after I physically removed all of the sludge (it was just before Xmas which I was hosting in my backyard, dressed myself in full emergency room protective gear and dug it out by hand on a 37 degree day, NOT fun). </p>
<p>Last event we threw out all of the tomatoes that grew. This time round the sludge now looks like soil, 4 full months passed before the tomato plants appeared and they are still seedlings</p>
<p>The question is: can these tomatoes be harvested? Have jokingly threatened to turn them into relish and send it to the family who comes to stay each year and breaks my sewers as an annual event. </p></div>		</li>

<p>does this mean &quot;let it sit for a while and then pour off the cleanish water off the top&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. I interpreted the question as referring to the implications of manufacturing TP. Hadn’t occurred to me to think of what happens after it’s flushed (I assumed it just sort of “broke down” in the septic tank). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It mostly does, even when you're flushing it down the sewer.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough (well, interesting if you're in my line of work), sludge presses in the United States are often able to get drier 'cake' when they squeeze the sludge that's collected in a wastewater treatment plant than the exact same press installed in a place like Japan. The amount of toilet paper can influence how much fiber is in the sludge, even after microbes have broken down all the actual poop.</p>
<p>More fiber = sticks together better = drier cake and better performing sludge presses!</p></div>		</li>
