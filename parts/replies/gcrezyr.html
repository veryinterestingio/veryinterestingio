			<div class="markdown"><p>Happens to me, like 10 years ago one night I thought it would be a cool idea to take a couple toots of nasal spray, little did I know that would turn into an addiction that lasted for years, quitting the stuff was crazy hard as well just because it worked so well and when you stop using it your nose is just clogged all the time, I'm nasal spray sober going on like 3 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Get off the amphetamine-based ones for sure, and avoid the corticosteroid sprays unless it's prescribed. If you want to go warm turkey, you can use saline spray to help clear out some junk and get the same feeling, but it's not going to stop the lining of your nose from rebounding and swelling up. Just have to push through it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Me neither. But I remember watching 'Unedited Footage of a Bear', where the main character is seemingly addicted to a nasal spray, and it's sort of a commentary about how over the counter stuff isn't always safe/a great idea. I thought it was weird or exaggerated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was &quot;addicted&quot; to Afrin when I was like 12. Stopped more or less cold turkey when the doctor told us to. Yeah, it'll be fine. I even still use Afrin when I'm majorly congested, but usually only at night and for no more than 5 nights. If it's bad enough that I have to use it all day, I'll stop at 3 nights, but that probably means I have a serious sinus infection that will require at least a steroid shot/pack if not antibiotics.</p>
<p>That's not to say the issues that drove me to using Afrin weren't still there. Allergies suck. I didn't see an allergist to start allergy shots for 25 more years like an idiot. That's helping some, but it's not a miracle. I've been getting fewer major infections, at least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually am currently recovering from septoplasty and a middle turbinate reduction which has so far fixed this issue for me. I used to have trouble breathing a lot even when sitting normally but it would get 10x worse when I laid down. I would become a mouth breather when I slept essentially.</p>
<p>I have to say its liberating being able to feel like I took a decongestant nasal spray while Im lying down when it's just how I normally breathe now!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the procedure I got was called a Septoplasty + A bilateral middle turbinate reduction. Essentially the septoplasty is where they realign a deviated septum (assuming that your breathing issues stem from that as well) to help it so that when your nasal cycle is on either side, one side isn't able to breathe better than the other.</p>
<p>A middle turbinate reduction is where they basically clear out a <a href="https://www.bergerhenryent.com/wp-content/uploads/turbinates-superior-middle-inferior.jpg" target="_blank">section of the sinuses</a> inside your nose. Mine were obstructing part of my airway and made it hard to breathe in certain positions.</p>
<p>If you talk to an ENT (Ear, Nose, Throat specialist) they will probably provide better detail than I can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If money is not a major issue for you (I'm in Canada so it was free thankfully), I would definitely recommend talking to an ENT about it if you have breathing issues in your nose.</p></div>		</li>
