			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't the norm for people, but I did discover that aspartame literally gives me seizures.</p>
<p>Went to the hospital/doctor a few times trying to figure out what was causing them and someone suggested looking at my diet. I eliminated one thing at a time until I discovered that I would have a seizure 30-60 minutes after having a drink that had aspartame.</p>
<p>I cut anything with it out and haven't had any since, but whenever I slip up and accidentally have a drink with it I have a seizure without fail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm honestly not sure, I haven't had many issues with it so I haven't found a doctor to look deeper into it yet, once I'm in a better finincial state I may go back and try to get some more tests done to make sure it isn't heriditary for my kids. Until then we just make sure we don't buy anything that has aspartame.</p>
<p>But important to note, acesulfame and stuff is fine, I just don't like the taste</p></div>		</li>

<p>Additionally, I only have 3 of the approximate 10 main symptoms for it during the time I had no diet control</p></div>		</li>
