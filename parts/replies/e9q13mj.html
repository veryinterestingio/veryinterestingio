			<div class="markdown"><p>And it varies pretty greatly even within fairly narrowly defined geographic regions. When I bought my house last year, it needed foundation work (the back half of the house was sinking).  </p>
<p>The foundation repair guys told me they weren't sure how far they'd have to dig down to find bedrock for the support columns and that it could vary anywhere from 5 feet to 100 feet in my neighborhood.  </p>
<p>I got lucky in that they only had to go an average of 26 feet for each of the 5 holes they dug (lucky because more than 40 was going to be WAY more expensive).  </p>
<p>For one house 2 blocks away, they had to go down 65 feet. For another house a few blocks away in the other direction, they only had to dig about 8 feet down.</p></div>		</li>

<p>He charged $33.00 per foot of drilled well; minimum of 30'. Better water is located closer to the surface. If he could drill 25 feet and hit a pocket of sand it would be great. Sometimes he'd need to go 125' and the water would smell like sulfur and taste like iron.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other thing is there are areas with several meters of organic soils (wetlands with deep peaty material), sometimes when I dig down I can't reach bottom. I've gone up to 6-7 m before by hand with a Dutch auger without ever hitting the mineral bottom. </p>
<p>The cool thing with soils like this is I've found straight up oil below the organics, and I've found old sea beds with shells in it. Areas like that are really creepy, because you can move your feet and it'll feel like you're standing on a waterbed.</p></div>		</li>
