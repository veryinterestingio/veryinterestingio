			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's not a long-term stable position, is there any really functional benefit to orthodontry in cases where the teeth are not so misaligned that daily life is affect?</p>
<p>I imagine that slightly irregular teeth might actually be better at chewing food than perfectly aligned ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well aligned teeth are definitely much easier to keep clean than crowded ones. They function more efficiently when chewing as there are minimal gaps between upper and lower teeth when closed. Being properly aligned can allow them to work together better and prevent excessive forces and wearing of a few teeth, instead spreading the forces equally over all of your teeth.</p>
<p>Edit: for mild malalignments, there is rarely an issue. Think of it as a continuum. The more aligned your teeth before orthodontics, the slighter the benefit. There are definitely lots of people who have mild enough alignment issues that it's not worth treatment</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We often recommend no treatment in cases where function and periodontal health is great and alignment is mildly out of position. Esthetic concerns from patients would be the driving factor towards treatment in these cases.</p></div>		</li>
