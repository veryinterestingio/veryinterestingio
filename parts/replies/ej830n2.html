			<div class="markdown"><p>In the situation with the mother, that usually happens when the mother is exposed to the Rh antigen through her first child if that child is Rh positive, then the antibody she produces could potentially cross the placenta and attack a second baby that is Rh positive, correct? So the first baby would be safe, but the second would be at risk. I think I remember that the mother can be given something while conceiving the second child to ensure that her antibodies do not attack the fetus? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the common scenario, but it's possible she could have a first pregnancy with an Rh positive fetus be miscarried after 20 weeks of gestation, and exposed that way, or she could be exposed to Rh positive blood through a blood transfusion. Those latter two scenarios are unlikely. Any exposure to Rh positive blood by an Rh positive patient can result in the production of &quot;anti-D&quot; (yes, you'd think it should be called &quot;anti-Rh&quot; but there's a lot of history getting in the way of logical nomenclature).</p>
<p>For Rh-negative mothers, they are given &quot;RhIg&quot; (standing for Rh Immunoglobulin), often incorrectly called &quot;RhoGAM&quot; in the U.S. because that is one of the most common brands used. RhIg is actually a low dose of the exact same antibody that the mother's body would produce after exposure; it's not yet fully understood why this stops the mother from producing Anti-D in the future.</p>
<p>As for the timing, RhIg is actually given to the mother during the first pregnancy (all her pregnancies, actually), and then after birth the baby's blood type is tested. If the baby is Rh negative, then nothing further is done, but if the baby is Rh positive, then additional testing is performed to estimate how much fetal blood got into the mother's system; for every 15 milliliters of fetal blood introduced to the mother, one dose of RhIg is called for. The vast majority of deliveries only need a single dose. Also, if during pregnancy (after 20 weeks of gestation), some traumatic event happens that would cause fetal blood to get into the mother's blood, we would follow the same procedure as for delivery.</p>
<p>And yes, you are correct that, as long as the mother was not exposed to Rh positive blood in some other way, her first child would be safe regardless of blood type, but without the RhIg applications, any future Rh positive babies would be at a very high risk of suffering hemolytic anemia while developing. Symptoms can range from mild anemia, through more severe conditions, to death of the fetus, which if I recall correctly is hydrops fetalis (rusty memory here), all depending on the reaction of the mother's immune system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>RhoGAM works this way: RhoGAM is an anti-D antibody.  If the mother is exposed to Rh positive blood, (cells with the D antigen on the surface) the anti-D antibody will attached to the D antigen on those cells and take them out of circulation. If Rh positive cells are not circulating, the mom does not produce anti-D (antibody).  The RhoGAM anti-D dissipates over a few weeks.   </p>
<p>I am also an ASCP certified MLS. I work in transfusion services so deal with this specific issue almost daily. </p></div>		</li>
