			<div class="markdown"><p>It is so common, humans are the weird ones who can sleep whole brain.  Many birds like ducks can turn off unihemispheric sleeping depending on how safe the environment is when they roost by ‘logging’ if they have a flock, in a line on a log, the flanking individuals will sleep half brain, and the inside animals closing both eyes will rotate turns every few hours so the group can get a deeper sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this: it’s also a very probable reason as to why people prefer the same hotel chains with the same room layouts.
It’s more familiar to them and they get a better night’s sleep because of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it's been documented that humans actually stay partially awake in new environments, which is why people often complain about sleeping poorly while traveling. Seems to be a slightly similar mechanism. We just have the ability to build secure nests, so we can shut off when we need to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really, it is simply a solution to maintenance when you have two of something and you need at least partial function even during the maintenance period. </p>
<p>In the nose, you have two nostrils, so one works while the other is down for maintenance and then it switches. Same thing with dolphins and their brains. Same thing with birds that stand on one alternating foot while they tuck in the other to keep it warm. Same thing as charging one battery for your cordless drill while you actively use another.</p>
<p>These phenomena are not evolved in parallel, it’s simply the convergence of multiple optimization problems onto a conceptually similar solution.</p></div>		</li>
