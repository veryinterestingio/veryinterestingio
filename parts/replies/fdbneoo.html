			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, really they want the pay to match the odds. 10:1 odds doesn’t mean they think it has a 10% chance of happening. It means they think 10% of the money will go to that option at those odds. </p>
<p>If you’re the house, you want the money to match the odds you are giving as closely as possible. The end result is that your personal result is effectively outcome agnostic. Your customers are betting against each other instead of against you, and you’re skimming a little off the top by giving slightly less than perfectly balanced odds.</p>
<p>The goal is that the payout you owe your customers for any possible outcome is less than what you take in from all of your losing customers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In sports betting, the bookie makes his money on the vig, which is short for vigorish.</p>
<p>As mentioned, a bookie will adjust odds and spreads so that he has equal money on both sides.  Then he/she makes their money on the vig i.e. a fee for accepting the gambler's bet.  You could call it a kind of &quot;service charge.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s effectively the same thing. A $10 bet with an 80% return is functionally equivalent to a $9 bet with a 100% return and a $1 additional fee.</p>
<p>Charging a fee just means you’re giving them a worse potential return on the total the customer is actually handing over to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yes, but why would they? Overall their net profit would not increase (probably decrease, as they would then start competing with students etc that have their own prediction software)</p>
<p>Also, if anyone knows that chance games do not earn the player money it would be the casino's themselves.</p>
<p>Lastly, by keeping the betting money evenly spread, the casino needs smaller reserves of liquid assets. As such, more money can be invested for profit, instead of having to stand by in reserve</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can make a living (or at least a nice side income) as a sports bettor if you can come up with a model that can somewhat accurate predict probabilities and use that to take advantage of inefficient lines (which 100% do exist because vegas isn't trying to predict outcomes but get 50/50 action).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AND if you can find an avenue to accept your bets in the sums and frequency required for profiting from such lines. Many times the betting sites will limit &quot;pro&quot; bettors, either in number of bets allowed or cap their action.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AND if you don't hit a bad luck streak.</p>
<p>I knew someone who lived pretty well as a sports bettor for \~15 years or so. Eventually, he ran into some bad luck and lost a lot of bets, started selling things from his house to make up for the losses, and ended up losing his car, his house, then his wife left him.</p>
<p>Not a good year for him, but haven't spoken to him again since.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yep, and here in the U.K. the online bookmakers don’t just limit such betters but actually refuse their custom outright.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah going off this - some guy came up with a more accurate statistical model (I think around ~80% accuracy) to predict games better than Vegas and made money by selling his picks to people (and probably betting his own money). Vegas tried to hire him but he took a job helping NFL teams. I can’t remember his name though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No way in hell it was anywhere close to 80% accuracy (not even sure what you’re judging to get that number). But if someone could beat the spread 80% of the time, they wouldn’t bother selling their picks or working for the NFL.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If someone can hit that kind of accuracy they NEED to sell their picks to make money, because guaranteed they're going to be blacklisted at every possible betting venue and website in pretty short order.</p>
<p>Dave Oancea or &quot;Vegas Dave&quot; is one of those guys. He's a professional sports bettor that was constantly being blacklisted by bookies. He sells packages of picks that range in price from a few hundred bucks to tens of thousands of dollars.</p></div>		</li>
