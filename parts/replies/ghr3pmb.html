			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a lot of factors that go into it. It’s more related to how many cells were damaged and how many tissue layers were damaged. But essentially if the cell is injured enough to die, whether that’s by a chemical, burn, trauma, etc the end result of a nonreversible cellular injury is cell death, and that process follows specific mechanisms that are essentially the same no matter what type of cell.  </p>
<p>The more cells that die, the more inflammation, the harder it is to heal.  There are a lot of complex signals, etc in the healing process and the more damage to repair the less effective it is.  So really it’s more about how many cells died and how many tissue layers were affected than the specific mode of injury.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To build on this, I was kicked so hard in the shin that my bruise left a scar. The tissue was essential crushed, and it formed a giant scab under my skin. After it came to the surface it looked just like any other scab.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. My thoughts, I feel like burns are especially unique. But honestly, I think we can feel when the wound is &quot;even&quot; like a burn or bruise.
Vs. An actual tear in the skin used with a weapon. </p>
<p>Versus, hitting your body on something.
Or just coming into content with a substance, which obviously the skin detects.
Like, steam burns feel different than oil burns which feels different than melted caramel. </p>
<p>I'd imagine too, that when there's different amount of blood, that represents a different kind of wound....comparing scratches or cuts.
I definitely agree that it's about layers. </p>
<p>I'm sure I'm not the only one that's gotten sliced on my hand but I grab it before I can look at it, but I can just tell how deep it is. </p>
<p>I wonder how close you have to be to the bone to sense it, if you can sense it, even if it doesn't technically hit the bone.
Just one line of cells?
IDK, luckily my job has never involved chopping with knives, never had a cut deep enough to know.</p>
<p>Edit: also, it's total bullshit that your body only rewards you for bad enough injuries, by blocking the pain and shit. Gotta hit a vein. But not outer layer the skin cells, not enough. :((</p>
<p>Also, we have a limited amount of cells, and they can only divide so many times. Save them!!! Hopefully science finds solutions for this inevitable future, but it's too late for us lol.
IDK, I find it interesting.</p></div>		</li>
