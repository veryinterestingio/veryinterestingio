			<div class="markdown"><p>Even your blood vessels get better. If you sit around too much, your capilleries get lazy. If you start walking or running after being a couch potato for too long, you'll notice your legs getting itchy. It's called runners itch, and it's effectively your capillaries expanding and waking up, yawning and stretching, which your brain interprets as itchiness for some bizarre reason. Its a temporary feeling but it DRIVES ME CRAZY.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Getting past that first 2 miles was never easy... even after I was doing 5Ks several times a week. The hardest part of running, for me, was the transition. I always felt this transition around the 1.5 to 2 mile mark. My body transitions from a couch potato into a more efficient machine. The transition is always the hardest part, for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You, keep going at it! ðŸ‘ŠðŸ’ª</p>
<p>From my experience, it will never go away, but the time it takes to get to the comfortable stage gets shorter, as long as you keep going consistently. Doing interval training once a week really helped for me as well!</p></div>		</li>
