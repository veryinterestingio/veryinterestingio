<p>You can only see one ray (at most) from a single raindrop, the one that happens to catch your eye, if any. And this ray will be of a single color because the colors spread out and only one will hit your eye. The red band of a rainbow consists of those raindrops that are precisely positioned to direct a red ray into your eye.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, a given raindrop scatters a red ray to you but may scatter a green ray to someone else?</p></div>		</li>
