			<div class="markdown"><p>The general definition of male and female in a biological sense is that, when creating an offspring, the male and female create different types of cell, each containing half the required nuclear genetic material, where, when they meet, the genetic material from the male gets incorporated into the whole cell produced by the female, and the remainder of the cell from the male is discarded.  Therefore everything outside of the cell nucleus in the offspring comes exclusively from the female, which includes all of the mitochondria.</p></div>		</li>
