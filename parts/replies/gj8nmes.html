			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, or at least any soil containing peat moss will. It starts composting eventually and after a year or two, leading to the salt balance of the soil and its ability to provide oxygen to the plant to deteriorate.</p>
<p>If it's straight up brown dirt, like top soil, then not likely no. Peat moss is still organically active, like a head of lettuce. That's the key.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Over a very long time (decades to centuries) it might become less fertile as the nutrients get used up by bacteria/fungi. But for a practical human time-scale, the soil should be fine for a long time. Once used (adding a plant), the length of time before needing more soil or fertilizer will depend on the species/size of the plant, and the climate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but bacteria and fungi spores are so ubiquitous on all the surfaces around us, and even floating in the air, that it’s pretty hard for any soil to become <em>permanently</em> unusable, in practice. As long as it contains organic matter, it will be colonized and a microbiome will eventually begin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's true bamboo then it's a true grass and they are generally pretty hardy. I have two different varieties in pots and bring them into my office during the winter. A general fertilizer is really all that's needed during the growing season and the occasional repotting.</p></div>		</li>
