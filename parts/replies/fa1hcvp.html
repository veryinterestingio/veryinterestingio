<p>30% mortality for <em>every instance</em> of food entering the lungs? Or 30% mortality for those instance which lead to infection?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The study I've read was more like this: For the studied hospital patients, when pneumonia was present and was associated with aspiration, the 30-day mortality rate was 25 - 30%. </p>
<p>For aspiration overall, the danger varies widely, mostly by the amount of aspiration. In an otherwise healthy person who accidentally inhales a little of their drink, there is no significant mortality rate, and they will be fine after the coughing fit. In a hospitalized person with no gag reflex, who pukes up all their dinner and proceeds to inhale all of it, the mortality may be to 70% even if staff immediately react and get the airway cleared.</p></div>		</li>
