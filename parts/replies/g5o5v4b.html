<p>There may be other forms of life, but there are numerous chemical reasons for predicating life on carbon and water. They are just special in ways that other chemicals/solvents aren't and that makes them uniquely good for complex life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like the extremophile argument and the &quot;life doesn't need to be carbon-based&quot; argument comes from a very cursory and incomplete read on how exactly life came to be on earth, the intricate chemical processes involved and lack of  basic understanding of chemistry (why carbon forms so many complex compounds and not any other element). Not all science fiction predicts reality folks.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It doesn't predict, but it inspires to explore the unknown, to transform the fiction into reality (however loosely this reality might be connected to the original idea). </p>
<p>Most of our biochemistry knowledge is less than 60 years old. We barely know the basics of how &quot;our&quot; form of life works, let alone what other possibilities might exist under other conditions. Our sample size for &quot;possible biochemical systems&quot; is 1, everything else is a good guess at best. I would bet that once we actually find anything resembling life somewhere, there will be a lot of &quot;wtf that's a thing&quot; type surprises.</p>
<p>Or, disregarding <em>all</em> of your biochemistry knowledge, how does &quot;we'll make a really long copolymer of amino acids, and make them speed up one very specific reaction a million times&quot; sound?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You may be correct for life on earth, but to assume the entire universe is made up of only the compounds found on this one tiny planet in our gigantic cosmos and to assume we are alone is not only impossible, but ridiculous. There is an expression &quot;life as we know it&quot; for a reason.</p></div>		</li>
