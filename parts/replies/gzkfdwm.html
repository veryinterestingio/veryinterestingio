<p>It takes rods several minutes to recover from one bright flash. </p>
<p>That's why cockpit lights and stargazer's flashlights are red.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more complicated than that. There's a level of light below which only rods are active, where you're considered to have &quot;scotopic&quot; vision, a level of light above which only cones are active, where you're considered to have &quot;photopic&quot; vision, and a range in between where you're considered to have &quot;mesoptic&quot; vision</p>
<p>But even in high light conditions, research does indicate that rods get used to provide contrast information</p>

<p>And their responsiveness to rapid changes, paired with their greater concentration at the edges of vision is absolutely why flicker sensitivity is greater in peripheral vision</p></div>		</li>

<p>You mean cones, right?</p></div>		</li>
