			<div class="markdown"><p>Finally an answer that makes sense. The other response assuming that every Chinese language uses the same pinyin system is absolute horse shit. It works for westernised dictionaries for mandarin speakers but that's the extent of its practicality. The pronunciations of words differ from one spoken language to another, but all Chinese languages use the same writing system, with the only difference being whether it be the traditional form of the character or its simplified form. In traditional dictionaries, characters are organised exactly as this comment said, by stroke starting from the main radical of the character. Newer simplified dictionaries will tend to index by pinyin instead.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hanyu pinyin <em>is</em> used for dialects. All you're doing is spelling out how the word is meant to be pronounced, for example, é£Ÿ can be both <em>shi2</em> and <em>sik6</em> depending on whether you're reading it in Mandarin or Cantonese.</p>

<p>Actually, it's more a country thing than a dialect thing. Taiwan and Hong Kong use traditional characters, China and the rest of Asia with ethnic Chinese use simplified characters. This is independent of the dialect. We are usually only taught one character set in school, so we use whatever we were taught regardless of whether we're writing in Mandarin or any of the dialects.</p></div>		</li>
