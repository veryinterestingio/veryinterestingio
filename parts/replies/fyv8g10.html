			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really interesting, and I don't know much about why the boundaries of the NRQZ are where they are exactly. It was basically centered on the spot between Green Bank and Sugar Grove (where there's a Naval facility). I'm going to take a look in a book for more about why those specific boundaries were chosen, and I'll get back to you. I would bet some of it was political -- Charlottesville, VA lies **just** outside of the NRQZ, for instance. </p>
<p>There's a similar quiet zone in South Africa to protect the MeerKAT array, but typically interferometers don't need the same level of RFI protection as single dishes. Because of how interferometers process their data, they effectively &quot;filter out&quot; most things that are coming from terrestrial sources.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The article I'm looking at is here: <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/130/3385/1307/tab-pdf" target="_blank"><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/130/3385/1307/tab-pdf" target="_blank">https://science.sciencemag.org/content/130/3385/1307/tab-pdf</a></a></p>
<p>The NRQZ is 100 miles wide and 120 miles tall. I'm not sure how those numbers were chosen, but it probably involved propagation studies of how radio broadcasts would interfere with the observatory (and Sugar Grove) from different directions/distances. The above article talks a lot about the development of the observatory, but it doesn't have many specifics about how the NRQZ was set up. Another good reference is the book &quot;But it was Fun: the first forty years of radio astronomy at Green Bank&quot;, which led me to the above article: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/But-Was-Fun-First-Astronomy/dp/0970041128" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/But-Was-Fun-First-Astronomy/dp/0970041128" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/But-Was-Fun-First-Astronomy/dp/0970041128</a></a>. A third reference is a new book called &quot;Open Skies: The National Radio Astronomy Observatory and Its Impact on US Radio Astronomy.&quot; There's a free PDF to that book at this link: <a href="https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783030323448" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783030323448" target="_blank">https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783030323448</a></a></p></div>		</li>
