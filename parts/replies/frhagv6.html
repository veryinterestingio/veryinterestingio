			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to the information on the Flight Data Recorder, the Cockpit Voice Recorders need to be analyzed, and to my knowledge this is all done manually by groups of people. </p>
<p>They listen to the recording which is split up into at least 3 channels, both pilots microphones, and an ambient noise <del>speaker</del> microphone in the cockpit. They will listen to every second of the recording, analyzing the words being said, and who said them, checking with company procedures for what typically should be said in certain situations, comparing to what was actually said, and double checking what they think each person said to make sure there is agreement even on words that may be whispered, stuttered, mispronounced or otherwise hard to hear. </p>
<p>They will also analyze the sounds from the voice recorder to listen to every sound that the microphone pics up, all the way to determining what sound each button, switch, and control the airplane makes and confirming with the audio recording what actions were taken. The recorders typically pick up noises from the engines, so that sound is analyzed for abnormalities. You will also be able to hear many abnormalities such as a bird hitting the airplane or even parts of the plane breaking. Sometimes other noises are picked up on the recorder like landing gear extending, or even sounds of passengers and cabin crew outside the cockpit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Electrical equipment too.</p>
<p>There's a different sound when the fan on a UPS is jammed or the blade is broken.  Both of those sound different from the inverter getting ready to crap out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The investigation is generally led by the transportation safety board (hereinafter “TSB”) of the country in which the crash occurs. Quite often, there will be representatives from any or all of the following: the TSB of the country in which the airline is headquartered (if different than the country of the crash), in which the aircraft was manufactured (if different), from which the flight departed (if different), to which the flight was headed (if different), of which an unusually large number of passengers were citizens, etc., plus representatives from the airline and aircraft manufacturer. And sometimes smaller countries may ask others to assist. These are all civil sphere. It is very rare that any criminal investigators are involved, but it does happen occasionally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Voice recorders are allowed to be recorded over. Data recorders have an option for abbreviated and more simple data to be downloaded every few days for bulk analysis. Mostly looking for flying trends that start to stray from the norm and finding issues that aren't reported.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically it just keeps recording. It has a certain length it records and it will go back and record over itself. Occasionally maintenance does a download and sends it off as a routine check or for fault tracking.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Video of what, though? A video of the cockpit would add relatively little that isn’t already covered by the audio recording. Seeing what the readouts say or what controls the crew are manipulating would be fairly pointless when all that data is recorded anyway. </p>
<p>A video of the outside of the plane would also be fairly useless - in rare cases it might show damage if there was a bird strike or a fire, but most of the time that will be obvious from the voice recorder anyway. </p>
<p>Most crashes occur because of pilot error, issues in the software within the plane, problems with relatively tiny components buried deep within the internals, or some other problem that a video is highly unlikely to show up. Video will add almost nothing that you can’t get from a voice recording and a recording of all inflight data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The CH124 (old helicopter used until recently by the RCAF) had a ‘FDR’ system, IPVMS, that was actually just a camera observing the instrument panel and recording the video on a cassette. This was much easier to implement than trying to retrofit a FDR to an aircraft that wasn’t designed to have one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could actually resurrect the pilot and first officer and have them recreate their last moments, and it's still not going to tell you what happened. Barring some dude twisting his mustache and laughing maniacally, all you will see is a couple of people looking suddenly very anxious and busy. You already knew what sequence they pressed the buttons in, knew how the plane responded and so on because the sensor data had all that. </p>
<p>In some very very rare cases like the Germanwings crash though there may be some use in seeing the last moments in the cockpit. Now that data storage is no longer an issue it seems like it will inevitably be added at some point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's like taking a video of a program on your computer crashing. Except for obvious causes like clicking on the wrong thing, the video will only show the crash itself and not <em>why</em> it crashed - that reason is buried in data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. </p>
<p>But modern storage is more than capable of putting down high quality footage from a camera onto a memory card.</p>
<p>£100 buys you a good dash-cam for your car, £30 buys a memory card good for twenty hours of storage - longer than any commercial flight.</p>
<p>Technology is more than capable of it.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes but storage space relative to storage weight has increased greatly, especially if you're only saving the last few hours of video.</p>
<p>Heck, after the Columbia crashed, they managed to recover sensor/test data on the experiments that had been performed previously.  From hard drives that had been sitting in the desert for X time after falling out of a re-entering spacecraft.  The weight and durability of your storage shouldn't be an issue, though your cameras might be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because its pointless, audio tells them enough, and instruments readings are the same thing, you hear &quot;SHIT GO AROUND&quot; on the voice recorder, and then see that throttle input was set to max power and then full back pressure was applied to the yoke you know that the pilots saw something in landing they didn't like, applied full power and climbed, video would just show them physically touching the yoke and the throttles. Its just another piece of data to worry about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it's not. </p>
<p>When human factor is involved (and most commonly is), video would make some investigations orders of magnitude easier. In data recordings, you see inputs, but you don't see by whom, why and how they were made. </p>
<p>When you hear a pilot say &quot;oh shit&quot;, you don't know whether they saw something outside, on the instrument panel or they just spilled their coffee.</p>
<p>What if they don't say anything? Are they incapacitated, is someone else (at all) at the controls, are they too busy solving the situation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, unless the pilots know precisely what went wrong and verbalized it before the crash, ya still need all that data to figure out what went wrong. If the pilot shouted &quot;We're going down, I think the Q-36 Illudium space modulator on on the 8th rib of the left wing (or whatever the hell) just broke!&quot; before impact, maybe they wouldn't need to decode so much.</p></div>		</li>
