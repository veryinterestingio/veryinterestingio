			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently only heard the 14 billion figure. I previous understood that radiometric dating places the earth at between 4 and 4.5 billion years old. The universe, due to the Big Bang and quick expansion is just a percentage older(1,100,1,000,000 years)</p>
<p>Which is it? Thanks in advance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Youâ€™ve got the age of the Earth about right. And, that the whole universe is estimated close to 14billion years old. So basically a whole lot of time (nearly 10 billion years) happened before our star the Sun, the Earth and the rest of the solar system formed. Crucially, we know in this time frame there must have been massive stars forming and dying in this region of space to produce the heavy elements we know find on Earth. The Big Bang only produced basic subatomic particles, which then forms hydrogen. It took the other 10 billion years to make all the other elements we see around us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Appreciate the reply, any thing you can recommend I read up on? How did they conceive the other elements came later? Is their an eon/era in the cosmos, similar to geological time where I could start?</p>
<p>I remember they dated one of the oldest known meteor craters and again came up with the 4-4.5.</p></div>		</li>
