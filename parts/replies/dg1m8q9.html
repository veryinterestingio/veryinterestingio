			<div class="markdown"><p>Just as another aside, dentists can be either a DDS (doctor of dental surgery) or DMD (doctor of medical dentistry).  Unlike MD vs DO where DO programs are generally considered inferior and less competitive (rightfully so or not), there is no stigma associated with either dental degree, both are respected (Harvard gives a DMD and Columbia a DDS).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on which day we're going back to, doctors also used to be barbers. (There was a physician profession that was separate from being a barber too, but the barber would be the one doing surgical procedures and blood-letting.) I'm not sureâ€‹ this is inconsistent with your explanation (perhaps the academic physicians eventually took over surgery but didn't want to take over dentistry), but it seems like you're leaving a little something out. </p></div>		</li>
