<p>Blood pooling can lead to blood clots  can travel up to your heart, get stuck in there, heart attack.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blood clots from veins (where the pooling occurs) will clot either in the vein itself or in your lung. You get heart attacks from coronary embolisms which cannot come from veins.</p>
<p>EDIT: Unless you have shunt between your right and left atrium (open foramen ovale) but that is rather rare.</p>
<p>EDIT2: The open foramen ovale itself is not rare (~25% of adults have it), but paradoxical embolisms (that are caused by the right-left shunt) are rare <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28450663/" target="_blank">(estimated at below 1%)</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a notice in one of the many Skyrim mods that the author lost their loved one to Deep Vein Thrombosis. DVT basically means your blood gets stuck and forms clots that can be fatal.</p>
<p>Taking a short standing break pretty much completely prevents it. This is also why they have those inflight exercise videos and instructions to get up once in a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lungs are like a giant net between the rest of your body and your heart. The heart is perfused through coronary arteries which emerge out of the aortic arch, which itself emerges from the left side of the heart (the side that pumps the blood to the rest of the body).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is spot on. I have a condition that makes my blood pool way more than it should. My veins are too elastic so they expand a bit to accommodate the blood pooling rather than sending it back up the body. So I get a very sped up version of this explanation. Standing for any decent length of time is not fun lol</p></div>		</li>
