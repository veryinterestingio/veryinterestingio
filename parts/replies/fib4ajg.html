			<div class="markdown"><p>A reference plane is used for defining the vectors that are used to describe these elements. The reference plane is typically the equator of whatever body is being orbited. For things like the semi-major axis and eccentricity, the reference point would be the gravitational center of the system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The inclination is basically the &quot;tilt&quot; of an orbit relative to the equator. For example, an orbit with 0 inclination would always be directly above a point on the equator, and an orbit with 90 degrees would pass over both the north and south poles. The other values are based off of the geometry of the orbit. The semimajor axis is the distance between the center of the ellipse made by the path of the orbit and the highest point of the orbit (in a circular orbit, it is the radius). Eccentricity is a value that describes how close to a circle the orbit is. 0 is perfectly circular and anything between 0 and 1 describes an ellipse, with values closer to 1 describing longer ellipses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, the reason eccentricity is from 0 to 1, is because the eccentricity formula is a fraction. The specific formula is e=(√(a^2 - b^2 )/a), where a is the long (major) axis of the ellipse and b is the short (minor) axis. As a increases, or b decreases, the numerator approaches a.</p>
<p>For a perfect circle, e=0 because a=b, leaving your simplified formula to be e=0/a.</p>
<p>For e≥1, this formula is impossible to balance, and as a result, e≥1 represents a parabolic(e=1) or hyperbolic (e&gt;1) trajectory with no possible major and minor axes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For earth it’s obviously the Earth’s equator. Additionally, the vernal equinox line is used as a reference for right ascension( longitude).</p>
<p>That’s the line drawn between the earth and the sun on the day of vernal equinox. If you measure on any other day of the year you just a simple coordinate transform to take the earths orbit and spin into account.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But how do you know what the equator is? For instance if i want drop a satellite around mars and describe its orbit that way. How is the equator defined, is it in relation to the sun or is it determined by observing its rotation and determining the location off the poles and from there determining position of its equator by placing a planin the exact centre cutting the planet in two halves.</p></div>		</li>
