<p>This is very true. The good news, though, is that cuttings of the old banana plant (<em>Gros Michel</em> or Big Mike) are available on Amazon. They're still grown in Jamaica, as well. It's supposed to taste a lot better than the Cavendish banana (the main type of commercial banana for the past ~75 years), which is also going extinct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is, at best, a sidebar comment for human-induced extinction, but I had to put it somewhere. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_T%C3%A9n%C3%A9r%C3%A9" target="_blank">The Tree of Ténéré</a> was a solitary acacia tree in the desert of Niger, the last survivor of a group of acacia near a well. The tree was so isolated, the only tree within a 400km radius, that local superstitions grew about why camels didn't eat its leaves and nomads didn't burn its wood. It was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_T%C3%A9n%C3%A9r%C3%A9#/media/File:Arbre-du-tenere-1961.jpg" target="_blank">only standing object visible</a> between the horizons on a flat sea of sand, and it was hit by a drunk driver in 1973.</p></div>		</li>
