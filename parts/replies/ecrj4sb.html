			<div class="markdown"><p>Whiskey is one of my favorite things, so I hope I can impart some helpful advice. </p>
<p>Many people struggle to enjoy whiskey for that very reason.  The alcohol dominates the flavor and prevents them from tasting the best parts.</p>
<p>What works for many who want to learn to appreciate whiskey is to find ways to &quot;prime&quot; your palate to pick out the flavors.  Here's a good trick: </p>
<ol>
<li>Start by dipping a finger into the whiskey, then rubbing it vigorously on the back of your other hand until you feel it heat up slightly from the friction. </li>
<li>Smell the back of of your hand.  You'll have burned off the alcohol and will be left with mostly just the smell of the &quot;barrel&quot; flavors. This is one of my favorite parts of trying a new whiskey. </li>
<li>Now smell the drink itself, but don't try to plunge your nose inside the glass right away. You don't want to &quot;burn&quot; your nostrils and temporarily lose their sensitivity.  Gently sniff a few inches above the rim while keeping your lips open.  If you keep them closed you'll prevent the smell from affecting your taste buds which is what we want to start doing here. </li>
<li>Finally, take a sip of the whiskey. Don't try to hold it on your tongue at first, just sip and after swallowing start looking for the flavors you started picking up in the earlier steps.  In time you'll start to be able to shift the alcohol to the background and better appreciate the flavors of the barrel.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope this was helpful!  Best of luck--I've found so much satisfaction in learning about whiskey and it makes me want to share it with others. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All great tips. </p>
<p>I’ll also add that it helps to add a splash of distilled water to the glass to help overcome the burn of the alcohol and bring the flavors of the whisky forward. </p>
<p>EDIT: I’ll also add this for OP: expensive does not always equal good. There are very few bottles worth more than $70 that I would buy twice. Not to say they weren’t good, but some of my favorite whiskeys have been well under that price. Johnnie Walker Blue ($200) is good, but I would much rather buy a bottle of Connemara 12 ($40). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I prefer cubes. They slowly open up the flavor while at the same time you are getting used to the burn. It gets better as you sip and there is nothing else like it. Just don't use more than a couple cubes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will add a tip that i learned on the Evan Williams experience tour i took today.
When smelling the liquor start the glass at chin level and slowly move the glass up to your nose while breathing in through both your mouth and nose simultaneously. Your mouth will pull off most of the alcohol vapor allowing you to smell the actual liquor flavor. </p></div>		</li>

<p>If the goal is to ignore the alcohol to savour the other flavours, it does make me wonder though ... why not savour the flavour of different brands of bottled water, or fruit juice (or to be less specific, something much cheaper and also doesn’t have alcohol in it?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could, but those flavors are not as complex because the process to make them is much more simple. A better comparison might be coffee, tea, chocolate, or fine tobacco.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The goal (at least for me) isn't to completely obfuscate the alcohol, but rather to not have it overwhelm. In many cases I find the kick and burn of the alcohol provides a nice backdrop for the barrel flavors.  And, as someone else mentioned, the flavors in many cases are rich, complicated and interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I prefer tea to whiskey. It's less complex but has more history (~200 AD) than does whiskey (1400s), and there are more parameters up for control (eg brew time, water ratio) on the consumer side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First tip, don’t force yourself, especially if you’re having negative health impacts like instant heartburn.</p>
<p>If you’re determined to find something you like though, then don’t worry about price points, instead, sample more.  There are plenty of excellent choices for well under $80 a bottle, but flavor is relative.  You need to figure out what you like first...then you can branch out from there.  It’ll be much much easier to find more you like after you find the first one...or...it just may not be your thing.</p>
<p>Also, find a bar that’s known for having skilled bartenders.  Try some of the classic mixed drinks.  Whiskey sour, old fashioned, etc.  Ask a knowledgeable bartender to recommend some choices of whiskey, as well as tips on the best way to enjoy it.</p>
<p>Some do better chilled, some on ice, some with just a drop of water, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, but cheaper whiskey (20 to 30 a bottle) and drink it with ice that's slightly melted or add soda water. You'll actually taste the liquor, not the alcohol, and enjoy the drink now. It took me until by 30s to get comfortable with a good whiskey and water if I want it straight.</p></div>		</li>
