			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the style of drawing is usually different from the background and the characters. That's why you can tell that an object is going to be picked up/moved even in digital cartoons (which don't have the celluloid problem).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The animated characters are also often one colour and bot shaded to not appear flickering. Its really hard to shade something consistently for thousands of frames.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It goes a step beyond that, too. In traditional animation, much of the background is often done with watercolors, while the foreground is done with ink on the cels. Color matching the two would be pretty well impossible. Moreover, adding the depth of color to so many frames of animation for moving objects would add a ton of time to the labor.</p>
<p>Some films play around with multiple cels and backgrounds layered to add parallax or depth to shots (A trademark look to Disney's classic films,) some also ink certain sections of cels and backgrounds with transparent ink to light them from behind and create a glowing effect without having to draw it in (Don Bluth pioneered this technique in Secret of NIMH.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha. I love that movie. It's actually the first one I remember seeing as a child. Led me to collecting stuff from it as an adult. I've got five cels from, a set of lobby cards and both variants of the original poster (theater and video store.)</p></div>		</li>
