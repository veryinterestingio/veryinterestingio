			<div class="markdown"><p>So if coke decided that each can was now 45 servings  (there are 44g sugar in a can) then they could call it sugar free?</p>
<p>Use this one weird trick to make all your products sugar free!</p>
<p>I should add that tic tacs are sugar free for this reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the us, the FDA regulates nutrition facts labeling, and so serving sizes. They define a serving size as “the amount of food customarily consumed (i.e., typically eaten) in one sitting for that food”.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tic Tacs are basically 100% sugar.  Each &quot;serving&quot; is 1 Tic Tac (0.49 grams), which contains less than 0.5 grams of sugar.  So they can legally claim to be &quot;sugar free&quot;.  It's a fucking racket.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coke can't arbitrarily decide the serving size. </p>
<p>But you know what you have in the US? &quot;Sugar free sweeteners&quot; that actually contain sugar, their little package just makes it so an entire serving is under the limit. Yes, these are products that exist in the US, sugar free sweeteners that are just sugar and filling. Patriotic, in a way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, the most complete answer is that sucrose and dextrose are both 100% fermentable to brewers yeast. So unless the alcohol content gets so high that the yeast dies, a decent brewery should be able to convert near 100% of that sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide. So therefore, it no longer actually contains sugar.</p>
<p>It's a pretty easy calculation to figure out the original sugar content if you know the alcohol by volume and the residual sugar amount. Plenty of online homebrew calculators can work it out for you, like brewersfriend.com for example.</p>
<p>If a serving size were 330 ml, and using 13g of sugar would yield 1.9% alcohol in the final drink. So more likely around 30g per serve was originally used.</p></div>		</li>
