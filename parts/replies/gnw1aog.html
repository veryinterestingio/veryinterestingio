			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US tomato sauce can mean a few things. Most commonly a can of tomato innards that has been processed to a relatively thin, even textured sauce that is thinner than ketchup, and not sweetened like our ketchup is.. or any storebought tomato based spaghetti sauce. </p>
<p>There's most certainly other meanings, but the US is so big, with so many dialects and local terms (we can't even agree on what cuts of meat are called) I wouldn't know them all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having lived all over the US, this is the correct answer, If it's anything other than tomato sauce it will most likely be labelled differently:
pasta sauce (tomato sauce + herbs and spices),
pizza sauce (tomato sauce + herbs and spices + sugar),
or marinara (tomato sauce + veggies + herbs and spices)</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is actually called &quot;<a href="https://www.recipetineats.com/what-is-tomato-passata/" target="_blank">passata</a>&quot; (literally strained tomatoes). Italians use it as the basis for many sauces which call for tomatoes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Marinara sauce, basically. The sort of thing you'd put on pasta dip a mozzarella stick in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whoa. Marinara in the States is a basic tomato sauce for spaghetti, no seafood involved. Tomatoes, garlic, oregano - that's about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LEGIT intrigued how spaghetti marinara is a seafood dish for you guys when even in Italy it is just a simple sauce and pasta.</p>
<p>In Italy and the US what you are describing is spaghetti or pasta alla pescatora, literally fishermans pasta.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's not a marinara. Essentially, Napolitana and marinara are the same recipe.   </p>
<p>What you describe is commonly known to Italians as pasta pescato, &quot;seafood&quot; or &quot;fisherman's pasta&quot;, depending on where you go.</p></div>		</li>
