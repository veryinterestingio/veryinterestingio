			<div class="markdown"><p>My workplace is 100 yards downwind from the ocean.  Stainless steel shows visible rust in six months.  Aluminum corrodes and starts to get white powder within a year.  Steel, pretty much starts rusting instantly unless it has a 1/4 inch thick coating of hot dipped galvanizing.  Wind blown salt spray and high humidity sucks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We use to have to test parts in a salt spray machine for the aerospace/military. We did pretreatments and painting. In the salt spray room they have all the different materials we use , at different stages of corrosion depending on what treatment was missed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in a steel foundry, and there was this &quot;shot blasting&quot; machine, not sure if that's the correct name but basicly a chamber you put the casting, and machine shoots it with thousands and thousands of small steel shots to remove all the dirt, sand and other stuff.</p>
<p>One time the finished product was delivered to a customer, and after a while they called back all confused because they had ordered a product from stainless steel, but now there was rust all over it. When it was investigated, our company found out that the shots used in the shot blasting machine was not stainless steel, and they have left a tiny layer of &quot;regular&quot; steel on the surface, which then rusted. Kinda obvious now that you think of it, but beforehand I had no clue that could happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was likely a shot peening machine. I can't speak for your particular foundry, maybe they were using it for some sort of elaborate cleaning, but the usual reason you would shot peen is to slightly deform the metal, which actually makes it slightly stronger in certain applications. </p>
<p>I've never seen a residue left behind while shot peening, but I'm not surprised to hear it does. If you or anyone else is interested this is a very basic rundown of the how's and why's of shot peening.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad used to work for the overhaul and repair section of a jet engine manufacturer.</p>
<p>They would use something similar, but it used crushed up walnut shells.</p>
<p>They went with this material because it was rough enough to remove dirt and stuff, but soft enough to avoid damaging the parts as they can be very thin/ductile/fragile.</p>
<p>I recently wondered though if that would be an issue for someone with nut allergies, but they would be allergic to the edible part of the shell, not the shell itself right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I visited a salt mine once. It was 800 meters beneath the ground, with more than 200 km of roads in total. Absolutely impressive. They had heavy machinery down there. Trucks, Bulldozers, Excavators, mobile drilling rigs and so on. They had carved domes in the salt that you could use for concerts. It was basically a factory underground. Everything that is made of metal they had brought down there was doomed. When maschines were retrieved because they couldn't be repaired anymore, they startet to turn to flakes the moment they left the mine. The salt creeps in every crack and every opening. You can't clean it enough. It just doesn't work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in a laboratory and have a pair of stainless steel scissors for opening plasticware and satchets containing chemicals. Always kept it clean and dry, snipped the edge of packets and tore the top off manually, so that the scissors never contacted any chemical buffers inside the satchets.</p>
<p>New colleague joined, started using my scissors. Half a year later it's all gummed up from chemical residues with rust spots all over.. Asked them about it and.. Yeah. They'd been cutting through those satchets entirely with the scissors..</p></div>		</li>
