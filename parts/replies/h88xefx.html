			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting, thank you.  This sounds like it would be effective for deep lung infections. It also seems to address the pathway of the immune system out of the blood stream the best.</p>
<p>What about other infection sites? Eyes, nose, are they protected by a mucus layer?</p>

<p>such as nasal sprays</p>

<p>Also, would an ACE2 receptor blocker nasal spray be able to block initial infections from happening in the respiratory system?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both the eyes and nose have mucus. As far as an ACE2 blocker, that is complicated. ACE2 has a biological function in regulating blood pressure. In fact, ACE2 blockers already exist to treat high blood pressure. So it would have to be closely studied for adverse effects. But vaccines already exist which directly neutralize the virus without significant side effects.</p></div>		</li>
