			<div class="markdown"><p>Also true. Lower than 45°, though, summer tires get much harder, flexing less on the road surface and lowering their ability to grip. The tread pattern is also less able to let water and slush escape and you end up with hockey puck wheels. </p>
<p>I drove a RWD car with summer tires last winter in Ohio and it suuuucked. FWD snow tires this year and it's a  night and day difference. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tread pattern doesn’t even matter when your tires turn to stone.</p>
<p>I kept the summer tires on one of my cars and drove it occasionally this winter, it’s tons of fun because I can slide around on cold days without much throttle even though the roads are dry.</p>
<p>But because the tires are incredibly stiff (you can even tell just by touching them) they wear out incredibly fast too, because the road becomes like a cheese grater on them (the powersliding probably doesn’t help)</p></div>		</li>
