<p>You can literally balance a dead flamingo on one leg</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but you have it backwards. The don't stand on one leg just because it is how there bodies are. The whole reason there bodies are built to stand on one foot is that there was an evolutionary advantage in being able to stand on one foot for longer times. So natural selection favored body types that could stand like this.</p>
<p>I am not a bird expert so I don't know what the advantage(s) are but the heat loss argument sounds plausible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought I read something about it dealing with balance. It's easier to balance a center of gravity on one point as opposed to two.</p></div>		</li>
