<p>If the steam plant was burning coal, that would likely be the reason.  Coal is radioactive.  Burn it, and you're sending radiation into the atmosphere.  But not all coal has the same level of radioactivity.  Some mines will produce coal that is hotter than others.  My <em>GUESS</em> is that they were supposed to keep tabs on how radioactive the coal they were burning was (and thus, what they were sending into the atmosphere).</p></div>		</li>
