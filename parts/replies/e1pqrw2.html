			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this idea  bit, in engineering, when you design structures, you can determine the stress/force required to cause failure, which can include stuff like the stress required to destroy bolts which would allow the sled to potentially warp/fail the track and fly off the rails.  During the design process, the engineer would adjust things like the number of supports, their angles relative to the track/expected forces due to sleds and material type and sizes and find a solution.  In this modeling, they will find one possible solution that meets the necessary criteria and then apply a safety factor, where they literally assume that they need to actually safely accommodate a load several times what is actually expected.  This results in using stronger or more material (thicker bolts can support more load, as can thicker supports or supports made of stronger material or adding more supports).  </p>
<p>In other words, the &quot;optimal&quot; solution where the cheapest material cost (ie the lightest/least possible material to support the expected load) is never used, but always one where more support is given than is strictly necessary.  From a structural standpoint, things like permanent roller coasters at amusement parks are some of the safest things around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are you trying to say?  Not a huge coaster enthusiast, so I am assuming you're referring to mid-ride brakes that slow the sled down?</p>
<p>From a design standpoint, there are other safety factors to consider besides the structural integrity of the ride.  Humans can only take so much punishment from being jerked around and G-Forces before injury can occur.  For example, there is the Euthanasia Coaster design that could kill any human rider by exerting 10Gs for 60s.</p>
<p>Things like brakes are there for the express purpose of ensuring safety.  Someone else mentioned how Space Mountain uses a computer system that weighs the sled before it goes to ensure it spaces out the sleds appropriately.</p></div>		</li>
