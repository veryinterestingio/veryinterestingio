			<div class="markdown"><p>The main issue with Antartica is that it's an ice shelf and really cold both on the ground and underwater. Would need to withstand that and moving ice and the cost is just too high (that's something, when the alternative is satellite) when compared to the benefits.</p>
<p>And the only piggyback possibilities would be some cable that runs from south Chile / Argentina to New Zealand / South Africa... which really doesn't provide much value either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also little known fact; the first time they put a wire across the ocean to connect America and Europe the gauge of wire that they used was too small so when they tried to send a signal through it the wire burnt up.  Big job to have to do twice.</p></div>		</li>
