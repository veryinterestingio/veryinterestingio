			<div class="markdown"><p>Nearly perfect is the best you can do.  You can get super close and I myself have been training my ears for 25 years but you’ll never have perfect pitch.  You can get really close!  But never the real thing as that is something you’re born with.</p>
<p>Sincerely not trying to take away from your accomplishment, I just relate perfect pitch as to being tall.</p>
<p>You can learn to be really good at basketball, but you can’t learn to be tall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For all we know it's possible to achieve perfect pitch as an adult. I study musicology and all my ear training teachers keep saying it's impossible, and claim that's what the science says... well, you can't really prove a negative. So it can't really be proven.</p>
<p>So why do I claim it's possible? Because me and a friend are actually making progress. Not too long ago he played a A-major in 2. inversion on piano. I immediately recognised it as Africa by Toto. I had no reference. I just felt it. The other day we were watching a movie when a piano sudden plays a D, and my friend called it instantly... Events like these have happened more and more often ever since we accepted that perfect pitch can be learned, it's just so incredibly subtle to learn the differences in character of the tones, that most people won't let it in to their hearts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a kid, I played music on piano pretty much constantly. I thought everyone could hear an A and identify it as such. Had no idea it was atypical. Now? I lost my perfect pitch nearly 30 years ago ! lol</p>
<p>I assume I lost it because I don't eat, breathe, and sleep piano practice anymore, but I really wonder...   I have to hum it and guess these days. Can't just hear it and know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it not also possible to be born with naturally good audiation? Aka 'pitch-perfect'. I normally like to be humble about it, but I've always felt that people around me like my family or classmates just didn't really get pitches or songs all that well. Every time in a school play that had a song in it, everyone would sing all off-key and off-beat and I'd be sitting there tearing my hair out thinking &quot;How are you this deaf????&quot; I feel as though I can sing and keep beat extremely well and can match pitches even better if I whistle them. It's been that way since I was very young and I haven't received any coaching or training of any kind. I can hear pitches and feel the beat perfectly in my head and even mentally correct the pitch of someone singing out-of-tune. Though as a result of not having any sort of training, I couldn't tell you whether a pitch was an A or a G or any of that stuff, only match it and keep beat with whatever's playing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been trying to remember what E sounds like a bit so I can tune my guitar by ear but it's so hard for me. I also can't match the pitch of the E string at the fifth fret to the open A string without a tuner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I wanted to see if I could do that out of nowhere. I have a music degree but I spent much more time in the theory side of things (I got a digital audio production degree). </p>
<p>And wouldn’t you know it, I got it within a few cents. I guess all the ear training and sight singing classes actually stuck. Haha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is so fascinating to me. I found this out myself because I started training my voice about 2 years ago. The type of discipline it requires ( breath and pitch control) is really helpful for my anxiety, but better audiation (I didn't know that word until you mentioned it) has definitely been a noticeable side effect. </p>
<p>Now when I hum songs and then I play them to listen, more often than not I'm humming them in the right pitch. Before voice training that didn't happen.</p>
<p>And once you start internalizing where on the scale is song is occurring, it also becomes easier to find harmonies and to improvise with the tune. These are things I really considered talents rather than skills before, but I've been pleasantly surprised.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a fun thought for you: talent is a myth, everything is a skill. From breathing to walking, anything you do is something that you can get better at with practice. Think of talent as a modifier, it makes your hard work more effective.</p></div>		</li>
