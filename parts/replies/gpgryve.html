<p>Donut/Toroid shaped planets are technically possible, if their centrifugal force can overcome the force of gravity</p>

<p>I'm not sure how &quot;Doughnut&quot; is a stable solution to this problem when you seem to be describing an explosion?</p>
<p>PS. Actually a serious question.  I don't think there would be any net force to compress material into a solid toroid.  If should just shred itself into rings / protoplanetary disc unless I'm missing something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope.  Even if a planet sized body were able to spin fast enough to overcome gravity, the object's centripetal force outward from it's acceleration would shear itself apart.  Until you scale up your celestial body to objects that are black hole sized, of course.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If its centripetal force is in equilibrium with its mass gravity, it should remain stable, but as I said, that's a pretty fragile stability, given outside influences.</p></div>		</li>
