			<div class="markdown"><p>They don’t have to be mutually exclusive.  The neurons on the hippocampus are connected to a lot of other places in the brain associated with specific concepts.  The memory itself isn’t like a self contained thing, the memory is the hippocampus triggering all the associations required to make that play by play experience in your head.  The same places in your brain that has interpreted visual signals as a human face will be active when you remember that face.  Neurons are all about connections and the brain is a big mess of associations.  Neurons that fire together wire together as the saying goes.</p></div>		</li>

<ul>
<li>Your  memories are not like computer files they are more like a series of  &quot;clues&quot;: your five senses and emotions factor into memories</li>
<li>A  theory about sleep and dreams is that (<em>among other things</em>) it's memory  consolidation.  Your brain organizes memories while you sleep - one  correlation is that people who learn new things in a classroom or formal  training report lots of dreams when they sleep.</li>
<li>Some  memories fade or become disjointed because they are not used.  That  person from your teen years that interacted with -a lot - is now &quot;the  dude with the shirt&quot; because the memories weren't used, or weren't used  that much.</li>
<li>You  can recover some of that, so when the &quot;the dude with the shirt&quot; send  you a FB request, your brain will try to get as much as it can - but  will fill in the blanks with new information.</li>
</ul>
<p>The  key takeaway is that memory isn't like a DVD or a photograph - it's a  living thing that can be replenished or &quot;die&quot; based on how it's used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually much more simple than you seem to think it is. It's all just 1's and 0's stored in a physical form. You shouldn't be impressed by the fact that electricity can be used to write information, you instead should be impressed by just how much information we can store onto modern hard drives. That's the really impressive part IMO.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really don't think that is so mind boggling.</p>
<p>Think of it as tiny rechargeable batteries, if they are empty they are a 0 and if they are charged it is a 1. So just add a bunch of them together and it is basically how computer storage works.</p>
<p>The concept is pretty straight forward and simple imo.</p>
<p>(It is still crazy just how many there are and how fast that information can be processed, but the concept is very basic. The execution is impressive.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the point is that that's basically always what it is. You can never truly perfectly recall a memory: every time you experience it, it's a unique chemical pattern that evolves and then forms new memories. How, and in what configuration, that's actually stored, I don't really know, however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's why using hypnotism and other methods to retrieve &quot;lost&quot; or &quot;repressed&quot; memories is so controversial. It's actually very easy to create false memories, which has even led to people thinking they were sexually abused by a parent when that never actually happened. It can ruin families and lives. </p>
<p>Also, every time you recall a memory, it can be changed a tiny bit. Your brain is basically playing a game of &quot;telephone&quot; with itself and the original memory can get distorted over time. That's also why witness testimony is also becoming less trusted by the legal system. Memories are often faulty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>*as far as we know.</p>
<p>Honestly, we can't really say exactly what a memory is, but we do observe the same neurons firing in succession when someone is recalling the same memory. (And so we may be able to identify parts of the brain that hold certain kinds of memories, or affinity for certain objects.)</p>
<p>There is a lot of chemicals(neurotransmitters) that are a part of this process as well.</p>
<p>This answers is too simplified, and in the next decade the answer to this question is highly likely to change as more discoveries are made.</p></div>		</li>
