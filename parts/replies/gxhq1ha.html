<p>Energy quantas are constantly fluctuating. Entropy means that they will statistically on average spread out evenly. But statistically there is always a probability that high concentrations occur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other answer, when we talk about temperature, we mean an average, the average of thermal kinetic energy within the material. But there are always outliers. There will be some (small) percentage of atoms that will be much hotter (more energetic) than the measured temperature. There will be others that have much less thermal energy. Those random above-average regions can then undergo a physical change that takes more energy than the bulk of the material has. </p>
<p>This is part of the reason water left well-below boiling point will still evaporate. Even at room temperature, there is some fraction of the water that is at boiling point for just long enough to escape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lead, gallium, and some other soft metals are known to creep at low temperature.  Alloys of cobalt, nickel, and iron aren't necessarily going to be ferromagnetic, but a dedicated materials scientist with too much time on their hands might be able to come up with a ferromagnetic alloy that creeps at low temperatures.</p>
<p>Even with iron, you might be able to cheat the question a little.  Heat up some iron or steel to just below the curie temperature to increase the creep rate.  Just be sure to keep the magnet cool enough to avoid exceeding its curie temperature, or you'll lose the magnet.</p></div>		</li>
