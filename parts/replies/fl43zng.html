			<div class="markdown"><p>The male voice change happens over a period of several months and the average spoken frequency drops almost an octave, whereas the female voice change happens over two to three years and the average spoken range drops between a second and a third. In other words, the male voice change is more dramatic and over a shorter period of time, meaning the function of the chords during this time period is far more unstable and the body isn’t able to adapt fast enough. The female change does affect the chords; their voices tend to get breathy and/or husky during this time period. But the chords change slowly enough to avoid dramatic cracking.</p></div>		</li>
