			<div class="markdown"><p>They do, it's just very low level. Most foreign bodies will elicit some kind of response. IIRC the inflammatory response helps break down the hormonal IUD's polymer to allow the release of the hormones themselves.</p></div>		</li>

But is the reaction itself a part of the contraceptive mechanism?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Arm implant did not do well. My body was rejecting it and I have a nice scar where it was removed. Naturally the obgyn had never removed one before. She pulled it out and it had a lot of tissue stuck to it and all around it. I was ovulating the entire time. Same for several oral birth control brands. I became pregnant while on those, and no I was not on antibiotics. </p>
<p>IUD hasn't given me a single issue. I only got a period after my vaccination for COVID-19 and then it was back to no periods again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An old friend hat a hormonal disorder, which I believe made her produce insane amounts of testosterone but also progesterone or something. She was infertile <em>until</em> she started taking the pill, because it gave her some kind of hormonal rhythm or something.</p></div>		</li>
