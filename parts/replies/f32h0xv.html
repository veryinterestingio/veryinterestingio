			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I know... but actual scale wasn’t really what I was after. Plus I did that on the tiny screen of a phone.  </p>
<p>More interested in showing that given relative position how the size of the object could have its parts both in front and behind you. </p>
<p>I could add a whole bunch more detail like the camera and it’s field of view - but was hoping to keep it minimal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>BTW. I fixed your diagram  <a href="https://i.imgur.com/7b1JPpc.png" target="_blank"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/7b1JPpc.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/7b1JPpc.png</a></a>   . That is what we call &quot;going to Space&quot; :D</p>
<p>*** but still, ISS is 45,000x bigger than it should be (it would be invisible otherwise)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>neat. can you do one with fixing the size/scale of the ISS relative to earth? would it basically be a pixel?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Each pixel = 100 m (the length of the ISS is 109 m)</p>
<p>This image is 10,000 x 10,000 pixels.</p>
<p>The ISS is centered inside the red box</p>
<p>The red box is 200 x 200 pixels, or, somewhere between the size of Rhode Island and Delaware</p></div>		</li>

<p>For the ISS to accurately be represented by a pixel, you'd have to make the Earth many times larger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ha. It’s wasn’t intended to be that accurate but only detailed enough to explain that orbit roughly keeps you “centered” - hence the Earth is technically “all around”, like if you stood in the center of a lake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends exactly on the viewing angle of your eye. A single human eye hash a field of view (full angle of) ~135 degrees. The formula linking the apparent half angle of a sphere from distance d to the surface of a sphere is <code>sin(angle) = R / (R + d)</code>. Punching in numbers says you'd need to be about 525 km above the surface of the earth.</p>
<p>You'd need to have a full angle FoV of 180 deg to do it right at the surface of the earth of course, but if you were standing on top of mount Everest you'd only need about 174 degrees already. At the height of the ISS the earth takes up ~140 degrees. So they're almost there already!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In other words, the earth is so big / takes up so much solid angle of view, that asking why the earth is in the background and also in the reflection is kind of like asking why the sky is in the background and also reflected in your sunglasses in an earthbound selfie.</p></div>		</li>
