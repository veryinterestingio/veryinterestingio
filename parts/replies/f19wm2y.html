			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for responding! The part from what you said that I'm unclear about though is this:</p>
<p>&quot;After all, if we already know that you need a statin, you spend your time and money and get dosed with radiation is pointless if at the end we are just going to start you on a statin no matter what.&quot;</p>
<p>Don't you want to have a baseline CAC score to see how well the treatment is working? Because what if the statin lowers LDL and other markers but the CAC score is going up? Wouldn't you need to know that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. We know how well treatment is working because of how it affects the cholesterol. CAC doesn’t play into it. </p>
<p>We have strong evidence that statins lower cholesterol and reduce cardiovascular events. We don’t have evidence that x treatment reduces CAC and reduces cardiovascular events.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gotcha. So is it because there is no specific evidence treatment with CAC that its done that way? That makes sense.</p></div>		</li>
