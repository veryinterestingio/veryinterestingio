			<div class="markdown"><p>I make a chilli with a lot of beans and I was interested in it’s nutritional properties. It literally fulfills the daily recommended allowance for every single nutrient listed on chronometer, every mineral, every vitamin, everything. You could probably eat nothing but this chilli for the rest of your Life and fulfill all nutritional needs. A single food item. </p>
<p>Potatoes + sweet potatoes + bell peppers + salt + olive oil is almost nutritionally complete as well, only thing missing is B12. My main concern with that would actually be consuming too much of certain vitamins. </p>
<p>It’s insane how few foods you actually need. You could probably survive on only eggs and potatoes (haven’t checked that one though)</p>
<p>Recipe: brown 2 onions and 250g ground beef in olive oul. Add tomato paste, a bell pepper, a few cloves of garlic and brown the tomato paste. Add in a 400g can of crushed tomatoes. Season with black pepper (a ton) and cumin, stock cubes and salt to taste. Simmer for 20 mins, add 2 400g cans of beans (with a portion of the starch water, I go for 100% but I like it thick) and a can of corn. Add dark chocolate to taste and let it simmer for a bit. </p>
<p>You can eat this as a Full on meal, it’s pretty high protein then, I also like with brown rice. This recipe makes 3 large meals. </p>
<p>This isn’t some kind of chef recipe, it’s probably not authentic at all, it’s quick, easy and cheap though and I like it.</p>
<p>Oh and I just checked: the chilly isn’t actually complete. It’s a bit low in vitamin e and k. It’s also only 70% for magnesium and manganese. It obviously has no vitamin d but you don’t need it on food if you’re outside enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do it pretty often. Coffee grounds as well. You can get pretty experimental with chili before ruining it, I definitely recommend trying random shit in your chili each time</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't really taste like chocolate in the chili. Like if you were to take some cocoa powder and just taste that it's not really &quot;chocolate &quot;. It just adds a kind of smokeyness kind of like a more aromatic sage. Also yes it's actually very common</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vitamin C is probably what you're going to be missing for eggs &amp; potatoes?</p>
<p>And maybe even in the chilli? Though I'm going to hazard a guess that the tomato and peppers probably have a reasonable amount?</p></div>		</li>
