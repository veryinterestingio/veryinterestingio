			<div class="markdown"><p>Norway has had a law since 2001 where all salaries are public and easily accessible from a website.</p>
<p>Prior to that tax records were always public anyway.</p>
<p>Anyone can look up anyone elses salary.</p>
<p>They did alter it slightly the website in 2014 where you are noitified if someone looks at yours (you can see thier email address) but otherwise there is no real limit.</p>
<p>I believe there are similar laws or systems in a few other countries.</p>
<p>Overall it builds more trust in pay being fair and helps a lot with things like pay equality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite sure I agree with the openess of this personally. It being open internally throughout a company is fine, but everyone's salary being available to the public is a bit too intrusive imo. Seems like that would paint an easy target on your back for the wrong people if this was implemented in a country like the UK or US.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in education (private school) and wages are posted on a public website that applies to all private schools, so if you ask someone what their category, level and sub-level are, you can know how much they make (as well as what duties the employee is expected to perform). This obviously isn't always correct, especially if the person has negotiated a better wage, but it provides a base from which to work upon.</p></div>		</li>
