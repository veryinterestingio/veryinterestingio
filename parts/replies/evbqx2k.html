			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your response. I was wondering if somehow snakes or animals, if certain criteria were met, would see the machine as they would see a plant or rock and just leave it alone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's easy to imagine how dogs interpret mechanical objects by looking at their behavior. If it's not moving, making sound, or smelling like a living animal, they ignore it. If it starts making sound and moving, they bark at it as they would a living thing that they haven't seen before (and therefore want to intimidate).</p>
<p>If they have enough exposure with the object and no negative consequences, they can learn to ignore it like they would with docile animals.</p>
<p>Impossible to know if they really classify something as inanimate or living, they probably just learn if it should be played with, defended against, or ignored.</p></div>		</li>
