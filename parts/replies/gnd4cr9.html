			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this ELI5, picture a long flat road on a very hot day. If you look straight down the middle of the road, the road will appear wavy and &quot;jump around&quot; a lot, but if you look to the side of the road at the grass, it will appear relatively normal. The black, coarse tar absorbs heat a lot easier than the grass, as this heat is radiated away it &quot;moves&quot; the light with it.</p>
<p>Follow up question: Why can roads sometimes &quot;reflect&quot; the light like a mirror on a hot day at a decent distance away?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a hot day, a layer of very hot air can get trapped near the road, being kept hot by the road surface. The extreme difference in density can result in a dramatic curvature of light, making the light that would have hit the road curve toward your eyes. The result is it looks like the road is reflecting the sky</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_internal_reflection" target="_blank">total internal reflection</a> where light gets completely reflected at a boundary with a less optically dense medium (hot air being less optically dense than cold air).</p>
<p>It's the same effect you see when you look up from underwater and you see light reflected at the boundary with the air above (<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Internal_reflection%2C_Anna.jpg" target="_blank">example</a>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add a cool example of this, this is why stars twinkle. The atmosphere is a swirling mess of different temperatures and pressures so light is being bent every which way. Stars are so far away that all their light can be bent in such away that we can't see it occasionally. Thus, we see a twinkle.</p>
<p>By contrast, planets don't twinkle. They are waaaayyyyyyyy closer and this means that some light is always getting through even when part of it is getting refracted in different directions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I beleive you meant &quot;Refraction&quot; and not &quot;Diffraction&quot;.
Also, refractive index isn't always dependent on density of the medium, but in this case, yes. It is true that hotter air does have smaller refractive index, as it is rarer.</p></div>		</li>
