			<div class="markdown"><p>They can't, that money is held in bonds with a fixed duration. They could stop buying bonds, but they're buying them for a reason - because they're a safe asset. If they were to somehow (this is probably impossible) interfere with the bond market enough that america had to default, they would suffer almost as much as america, as they're the ones who own us debt, and therefore wouldn't get paid.</p>

<p>like TSA and ATC, are &quot;essential&quot; which means they have to work even if their part of the government is shut down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But they usually do not get paid until the government ends its shut down. Source: SO works for DHS.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I put essential in quotes, reflecting that's is a government job attribute, not a subjective opinion.  </p>
<p>It is a super-bad thing that these &quot;essential&quot; people have to work, but they don't get paid.  Every time so far, Congress subsequently passed a special law granting them their back pay.  I hope some day they will make that a guarantee, making people work but not paying them is slavery.  I though we'd all agreed that slavery is bad.</p></div>		</li>
