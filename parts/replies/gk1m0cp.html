<p>There are other volatile molecules as well, but scfa are some of the most abundant in stool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But these are produced by bacteria.  I think I misunderstood your question... Poop is mostly composed of and created by bacteria, so I dont really know what poop would be in their absence.  </p>
<p>Germ free mice make pellets in the lab, but they eat chow diet... Not sure what a germ free human poop would look like.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>What is poop in its own? I actually have no idea what you mean. Poop is considered poop when it goes through the digestive system. So poop on its own has lots of VOCs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to swallowed air, babies also have an active intestinal flora and subsist on a diet of milk, the sugars of which the microbiota are happy to gobble up and make CO2 from. Their gut microflora community is new and not as stable as in an adult, coming from bacteria introduced from their environment and during child-birth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When laying down, swallowed air bubbles have as much tendency to rise toward the small intestine as they do to rise toward the mouth. Since babies spend so much time laying down they're as likely to expel swallowed air as farts rather than burps. After feeding a baby, we usually try to help with this by 'burping' them, but it's not as effective as just standing up and walking around.</p></div>		</li>
