			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe there is more to it than just the nucleation site. In mythbusters (which another person mentioned), I thibk I recall that regular coke had a far more mild reaction. If it were simply a matter of nucleation sites, you'd expect any carbonated beverage to have similar reactions, assuming the same amount of carbonation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Partially. There are also some ingredients in mentos that also react to carbonation. To test this, use rock salt, which is rich in nucleation sites. Mythbusters actually did a full episode on this phenomenon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually not for looks entirely. Its also primarily done for, believe it or not, taste. </p>
<p>When these little bubble travel up and pop they bring with it the smell of the drink so when you go to drink it, you get more of the aroma of the drink which enhances the drinking experience. This is done in particular with champagne glasses because they're so narrow they dont really offer much aroma to begin with, so the etching helps by sending more bubbles to the top which the aromatic molecules will stick to and ride to the top. Same with beers as well. </p>
<p>Also if you're drinking expensive rare champagnes, you'd want to use a regular wine glass and fill it half way. This would actually give you the most out of your champagne by not only giving you a wider surface area for the champagne to release that aroma, but also by half filling it you generate a nice pocket those aromas can sit in without being wafted away as easily.</p></div>		</li>
