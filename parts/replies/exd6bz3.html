			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, what you're describing is called the Past Hypotheses and it's the dirty little secret of the second law of thermodynamics.</p>
<p>The reason entropy increases over time is simply because there are more ways for the universe to become less organized and very few for it to become more organized. Unfortunately, that same logic works the other direction... Which is why we need a past hypothesis.</p>
<p>Lastly, there are ways for the universe or more accurately parts of it to become more organized. That we exist is an example of this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can you elaborate on this? I don't think I quite understand what you mean when it works in the other direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the amount of processes that &quot;organize&quot; vs causing entropy doesn't inherently entail that the universe used to be more orderly. If you 'track backwards' with only that factor you're gonna be missing a reason it was orderly in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I thought I might get a question about this, I was on my phone, so short explanation. No, there wasn't a typo. </p>
<p>Entropy increases with time, because there are more ways to be high entropy than low entropy, so entropy tends to be higher in the future. It's like shooting a basketball, there are many ways to miss and very few to make it, so you miss more than you make. </p>
<p>Now, technically speaking, there are more ways for entropy to be higher in the past as well (the other direction). It's ONLY if you decide that entropy must have been very low in the beginning that you have a reason that entropy wasn't higher in the past. But again, we don't actually know that entropy was very low in the beginning, it's just that if it wasn't, then what we see shouldn't be as it is... but it definitely is, so we hypothesize that entropy must have been low in the past - The Past Hypothesis. </p>
<p>We don't actually have any idea why entropy was lower in the past however. We can't recreate the conditions (even theoretically) that start our universe at a low entropy state, because just as before, there are FAR more ways to have a high VS a low entropy state, so how did we end up with a low entropy universe in the beginning? Scientists want to know!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a way, isn't that what life is? Spontaneously self-assembling matter, gathering energy from around it to reproduce itself using more matter? Assembling into higher orders of complexity along the way.</p>
<p>The entirety of the earth's biosphere is more complex than it'd have been if all that matter sat static and inert. Over a billion years, amino acids and ambient energy curves turned matter into highly complex human civilization.</p>
<p>That seems like the opposite of entropy to me. Life itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is! It's even got a name - negentropy. Life is an example of negentropy.- The process of becoming more orderly. </p>
<p>I could really go down a rabbit hole here, but work (in physics) happens on the boundaries. In thermodynamics work happens when you convert from a low to a high entropy state. In an engine you burn a highly ordered - low entropy fuel and you produce heat and pressure. You convert the pressure to work and you're left with heat... heat is very much the physical manifestation of high entropy. It doesn't get much more disordered than heat. When you apply the brakes on your car they slow the car and produce... heat! </p>
<p>The important take away is that work is happening when we convert to higher entropy states. We are literally the product of this work. You and I are in a very real way, the universe harnessing the laws of thermodynamics to build on itself. </p>
<p>This is highly simplified! Not all work is useful work for example...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No atoms (assuming protons do decay) are truly stable, they're just <em>mostly</em> stable. The half life might be on the order of trillions of years, but it still has a half-life. If protons don't decay that changes, and some atoms would be truly stable. </p>
<p>The classic example is Bismuth-209, which has the longest known half-life of any element. We're talking hundreds of millions of times longer than the universe has existed, stable, but still... &quot;all time&quot; is a long time. If we're talking about an unbounded future, then all non-zero probabilities will be realized, including the decay of otherwise stable elements like Bismuth-209. </p>
<p>The tendency of all matter though, will be to occupy the lowest possible energy state, through emission, fusion, fission, etc. I don't know what the math is on the time needed for the majority of atoms to be bound in stable nuclei, and I don't know the degree to which effects like quantum tunneling play a role in chemistry over time spans of 10^100 to 10^200 years would be. Presumably it would get pretty weird. Still, if protons decay they would do so before the time required for the matter in the universe to be bound as nickle and iron, but if not then who knows? </p>
<p>If protons don't decay, then for example hydrogen would be genuinely eternal, along with all or most of the elements up to iron. After that, we can guarantee they'll at least decay to one of the lighter-than-iron elements. </p>
<p>Remember we're talking about time scales that include the death of all stars, their transition to white dwarfs and black holes, and the evolution of those white dwarfs to black dwarfs, and the evaporation of those black holes. This is <em>long</em> time and a lot about what would happen isn't really known, just surmised.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Completely tangentially, the story of how we discovered Bismuth-209 was radioactive is pretty interesting.  It was long thought to be the heaviest stable element in the periodic table and it took over 50 years of testing before there was experimental proof that it actually does decay (Only in 2003!).  Since it has such a long half life, as you mentioned, on the order of 19 quintillion years, they had to really do some cool stuff to detect anything, as you can <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2003/04/bismuth-not-so-stable-after-all" target="_blank">read about here</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was taught that over long timescales everything lighter than iron will fuse into iron, and everything heavier than it will decay to it (by decaying into elements that eventually fuse into iron) and that quantum tunneling will turn anything above the Planck mass into a black hole, leaving the only remaining matter in the universe tiny iron dust particles.</p></div>		</li>
