			<div class="markdown"><p>That's much better. In Navy boot, not even a cool killer's branch, my RDC would tell us to &quot;look like we're bored with killing the enemy and it you just woke up for a piece of shit watch. Look like you're done feeling anything, you're a cold blooded machine.&quot;</p>
<p>Shit you not man, that stuck with me because the whole time he was saying/shouting that, I just kept thinking &quot;Dude, I'm just a DC...&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly right. DI's told us to pick a brick on the wall across the parade deck. This also helped you prepare for &quot;snapping in&quot; during marksmanship training. Where you literally sat in a field sighting and dry firing at a white barrel with targets painted on them...for hours. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was one of my favorite parts of boot camp cause you got to lay down and relax without anyone yelling at you for once. Snap-in week will always have a home in my heart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aside from holding those shooting positions for so long. Got old dead leg, then we'd go suffer in the sandpit. Good times. I seriously loved and miss Parris Island sometimes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was one of the worst parts of boot camp for me.  My arms and legs would get so numb I felt like I was getting nerve damage.   That and being in Medical Rehabilitation Platoon for 6 months. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I can totally understand that. Those drills were purposely designed to force muscle memory to ensure limited fatigue during real combat. I remember the dazed and confused brown bag lunches. I never thought a pb&amp;j sandwich could taste that good. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you look at something right in front of you, your eyes are closer together, approaching cross-eyed. If you look at something further away, your eyes are further apart. It's a very minor difference that is difficult to notice right away, but you can kinda tell when someone is looking at something close to them or far away, based on this. </p>
<p>It's a funny feeling when you're talking to someone and their eyes are looking &quot;far away&quot; right at you. The thousand yard stare is also a symptom of various injuries. It's a good thing to note in an emergency.</p></div>		</li>
