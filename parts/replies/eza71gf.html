			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, my dad is the same way. Eats all sorts of stuff like limburger cheese, sauerkraut, lots of spicy foods like curry and hot wings, raw hot peppers,  the madman even eats oranges without peeling them. Takes a lot to give him food poisoning or an upset stomach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Old dude here. 35 years ago, I ate fast food regularly and stayed thin. I told my family (healthier eaters) that I was able to do so because my body was used to it. This was just a dumbass college kid statement at the time but I really felt that there was a little truth in there. Maybe there was.
(Edit addition) now Iâ€™m older, wiser and healthier....and I struggle eating fast food.</p></div>		</li>
