			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats so cool!! So they solidify the air and water into wood. And that then would be how they get pollution out if the air. That is awesome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And, conversely, when you lose 1 kg of fat:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>complete oxidation of 1 kg of human fat requires 2.9 kg of inhaled oxygen producing 2.8 kg of CO2 and 1.1 kg of H2O</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fat isn't lost any other way.  You do not urinate any significant part of the carbon mass of a kg of fat when lost, although the H2O may be lost via sweat, breath, or probably most of the H2O is urinated.  The carbon is almost all oxidized and slowly exhaled as CO2</p></div>		</li>

<p>I know this is ELI5, but I’ve never thought that’s an acceptable excuse for wrong information </p>
<p>O2 and CO2 May only be an atom away from each other, but that doesn’t mean that atom is just added onto or taken off the other.</p>
<p>The CO2 that we breathe out comes from the food we break down, glucose has carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.  We take off the hydrogens to be used later, and release the oxygen and carbon as co2.</p>
<p>We breathe in oxygen as basically a place to put that hydrogen from earlier - releasing H2O.  It’s not CO2–&gt; O2, it’s C6H12O6–&gt;CO2, and O2–&gt;H2O</p>
<p>Likewise plants take in H2O and convert that to oxygen, again, saving the Hs for later and take in CO2 and convert that to glucose (or similar) so it’s H2O—&gt;O2 and CO2–&gt;CH2O</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of, but it is also a self-perpetuating device to condense air and water into wood. The water misting is more like exhaust.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically. Ever been in a greenhouse and it is super humid and possibly even water collecting on the glass despite it being warm? That is the water evaporated from the tree/plants.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not from the dirt! The vast majority of the mass which makes up plants including trees comes from the air and water.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is one of my favorite things in the world. And the converse that animals lose weight primarily by breathing it out. Amazing.</p></div>		</li>
