We all think its just have a pleasing voice and say a bunch of lines but in reality when they bring you in for recording, its usually just for a day or two and you're just recording all sorts of sounds and noises that the project might need so they don't have to call you back in. By the end of the day you've a very tired voice and often times you don't/can't even talk for days because you need to rest your vocal cords</p></div>		</li>
