			<div class="markdown"><p>But light is an important part of adjusting ones circadian rhythm. As is food as well and a lot of other factors but light is one of the most important factor. People who sleep in the day and work at night do sleep much worse then people with more standard sleep patterns. The exception to this is of course those who are able to fully control their light and therefore have full control over their circadian rhythm. However most people have a window in their bedroom and are not able to close the blinds fully so they do end up sleeping in a partially lit room when they sleep during the day.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Kind of, but not really. Yes, a person's circadian rhythm is generally unique, but it is a results of environmental indications being interpreted by the body.</p>

<p>No... not really. Once it get's set it pretty much sticks, and it takes a great change in order to change it. This is usually a developmental change, like hitting puberty. But it can also be caused by long term exposure to a different environment. By long term, i mean months or years, not days or weeks. Actual circadian rhythm sleep training is a very arduous process and is prone to failure.</p>
<p>I have suffered with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_sleep_phase_disorder" target="_blank">DSPD</a> my whole life... so I've gotten an unfortunate opportunity to learn about this kind of stuff.</p></div>		</li>
