			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow that's so cool! It reminds me of a book I used to read. I even think the character designs are the same. I wonder if it was made by the same people.</p>
<p>Movies like Osmosis Jones and books like the one I mentioned are what piqued my love for understanding how the human body works and by extension, the small things which make the world turn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting that it was actually well researched.</p>
<p>I stumbled upon on some videos on youtube of a doctor who watches and analyzes the said anime. Dr. Ed Hope was his name iirc.</p>
<p>He explains stuff like why the cells/bacterias/characters look the way they are in the anime, and some inside joke that you might only get if you're pretty familiar with the technical stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dr Hope's Sick Notes is a fantastic channel! I can't remember which show he was watching but he stops to explain the layers around the brain. The cauliflower wrapped in a bin bag was absolutely beautiful. </p>
<p>Edit: it was the episode where he watched the first episode of Grey's Anatomy and he's using it to explain a subarachnoid haemorrhage.</p></div>		</li>
