			<div class="markdown"><p>PAVE Way/Spike has been around since the late 60s Precision avionics vectoring equipment uses laser to paint the target a the ordinance goes down range using the laser on board and in some cases a asset on the ground to triangulate with another designator. </p>
<p>When enhanced GPS units were developed it removed the weather effects that made lasing a clear sky system. </p>
<p>A couple of things that are also available are using sneaky spy shit that the Company and Mossad use that makes it appear that the strikes from manned or unmanned platforms are super accurate. RF and GPS beacons physically placed on site or on vehicles.  Obviously risky but very effective in planned ops. Think meetings in a building or a vehicle frequently used. Vulnerable to countermeasures itâ€™s not as common anymore.</p></div>		</li>
