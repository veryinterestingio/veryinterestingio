			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly why.</p>
<p>Interesting case of a native English speaker who learned Spanish later in life. Guy has a motorcycle crash, damage to the language centers of the brain. Lost his ability to communicate in English, but could still communicate in Spanish. This suggests that later learned languages involve seperate areas of the brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personal anecdote, my ex moved with her family to the US at 9 years old.  Her sister was 11.  The sister spoke both her native language and English, but has a very noticable accent in English.  My ex spoke virtually none of her native language (although she understands it) and speaks English with a pitch-perfect Northern California accent.</p>
<p>I always found that so curious and the age range lines up perfect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh that is very interesting, I moved to the US when I was 10 and my sister was 7, neither of us got an accent when speaking in English (at least while I lived there). Both of us got an accent, though, in our original language but hers was much stronger. I have been back to my home country for ten years now ( I lived 11 years in the US) so my English accent in my original language is mostly all gone (it still comes out sometimes though) but now I have started to kinda get an accent in English that I did not have before just from contact with so many people here that do have it. It doesnt come out often but sometimes it does and my brain does a weird &quot;why did you pronounce it that way&quot; double take on me, but it is like my toungue got confused between switching back and forth on the different phonetics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, that used to be the past tense of &quot;go&quot; (well, &quot;gaed&quot; not &quot;goed&quot; but close enough). &quot;Went&quot; was the past tense of &quot;wend&quot;. It got repurposed into the past tense of &quot;go&quot; so now the past tense of &quot;wend&quot; is &quot;wended&quot;.</p>
<p>The original past tense has survived in Scots, where it's still &quot;gaed&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>An interesting (but sad) side study is feral children who never heard language during this stage, never really learn to competently speak a language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that something similar happens with some deaf babies and children as well! Unfortunately people think that its good to force spoken language like English to deaf children even though its not accessible to them (because they are deaf). As mentioned, there is a critical period of time that children need to know language, so if time is wasted on a language not accessible to these children, then they won't be able to learn languages properly in the future.</p>
<p>What needs to happen is that these Deaf children are exposed and taught their sign language to ensure they have a solid foundation of language while they grow up!</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I'm hearing but I want to make this issue more well known! Deaf children should be exposed sign language when they are very young to ensure they have a language to grow up into. They can then learn any other languages afterwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I absolutely agree! It's been shown that deaf children acquire language through ASL, and the info is stored in the same language centers of the brain just like any other child.</p></div>		</li>
