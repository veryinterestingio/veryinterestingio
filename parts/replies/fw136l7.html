			<div class="markdown"><p>you won't generate any extra carbon dioxide, you'll just move more air in and out of your lungs</p>
<p>but &quot;if i do things that make me generate more carbon dioxide will i start to lose weight?&quot;, that would be exercise - or just more general movement like a long walk - and &quot;yes&quot;, so long as that elevated respiration means you're outputting more than you take in through food</p></div>		</li>

<p>But breathing techniques can be an effective way to increase your metabolism. An extreme example of this is Tummo meditation (a meditation practiced mostly in very cold temperatures where breathing techniques alone are used to keep the body warm).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this.  Lets say your overweight and you’re gonna decide to lose weight.  Where do those pounds go?  You don’t excrete them out in waste, or sweat them out.  You breathe them out.  Little bits of carbon at a time, that were once lypids (fats, long carbon chains with other goodies) that release energy when broken down.  </p>
<p>Bonus - its not all carbon, and not all lost through breathing, but most is, and thats why its so hard.  Diet + exercise is the key, to limit the amount of excess calories added back into your body but ensuring you are keeping your necessary nutrients at good levels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Conversely, most of the mass of plants is the carbon they take in from CO2. Which is insane when you think about giant redwoods and such. They basically breathed in all of that mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never thought about this... that's insane.</p>
<p>So they take the C and the O from the CO2 from the surrounding air, and the H and O from water in the ground, and they turn it into the CH chains in the plant matter and expell the O2 right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hm this is very strange to think about. If I breathe more slowly I'm losing less?</p>
<p>Do we have a supply of carbon to breathe out or does breathing make us break apart molecules for energy? Like do you really consume more calories if you breathe more? Where would that energy go then?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Over the long-term, your breathing rate/volume is directly correlated to your metabolism. When your body is using more energy, you need more oxygen for respiration. When you exercise you need more energy so you breathe faster and deeper.</p>
<p>Breathing is a reaction to energy demand not a trigger. If you try holding your breath while running, you will soon be forced to stop running. Your body can create some energy in the short-term without enough oxygen, but that is another topic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your metabolism and energy consumption drive your respiration not the other way around.  Sitting around hyperventilating won’t force any additional caloric expenditure and vice versa for slow breathing.  And either way neither is really sustainable.  It’s actually how they measure caloric consumption during activity.  When you see estimates of running/biking/rowing etc. burns X number of calories that comes from experiments of people performing them with large breathing apparatuses on.  They measure O2 consumed and CO2 produced to determine caloric consumption.  This is known as indirect calorimetry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CO2 is a waste product of you body converting food and oxygen into energy. If you consume more calories, you'll breathe more as a consequence. </p>
<p>Just breathing more doesn't use a ton of energy, so it won't have the same metabolic consequence as actually increasing your energy use.</p></div>		</li>
