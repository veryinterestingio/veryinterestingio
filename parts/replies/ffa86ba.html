			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason you don't notice a delay is because your brain knows what's about to happen since it's sending the signal to flick your arm it's ready to immediately fire off the pain signal. Same as you can't tickle yourself since your brain knows what your about to do and ignores those signals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the reception of pain is literally slower because pain receptors are not turbo charged like regular nerve fibers are. (Turbocharged with fat) so there’s an even longer delay compared to neutral touch or positive/pleasure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt this delay has anything to do with what OP is asking. When I pinch myself, I feel the pain immediately, even though the delay is there. What OP is asking about may take seconds and most probably has to do with reaction to stress of high magnitude, adrenalin etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>20ms is .02 seconds. For perspective, a 0.1 second delay is generally perceived as instant by the brain. So basically the referenced 20ms delay, if true, is a pretty meaningless delay</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is precisely what causes the delay. To expound on this, the nerves responsible for transmitting pressure conduct much faster than the nerves transmitting pain signals. So we often feel pressure and then later, pain</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think you missed my point. I'm saying 20 ms delay is not the delay that OP meant. 20 ms is nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s more that the pressure receptors temporarily overload the pain receptors. Not really a delay in the signal travelling to the brain.  Which is why pressing something that hurts helps.</p></div>		</li>
