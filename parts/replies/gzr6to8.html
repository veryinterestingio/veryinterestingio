<li>I am a big fan of the Big Bang theory (the theory, not the show). Most simply stated, the Big Bang theory is the idea that in its early times, the universe was hotter, denser, and in some sense smaller than it is today. We arrived at that theory by observing that the cosmos is currently expanding and cooling, and therefore, if you just dial that back, you get a hotter/denser/smaller cosmos. We can be a bit more specific and say that this theory predicts that there was a time when the cosmos was entirely filled with hot dense plasma, because it had so much matter and energy compressed together. And in fact we have VERY DIRECT EVIDENCE of this, because when we look into the very distant cosmos, we SEE that hot plasma! When you look at distant objects, you're looking at them as they were in the past, because light takes time to travel, and so you can extend that to say that if you look far enough away, you can see the cosmos as it was when it was still ON FIRE (i.e., filled with hot plasma). And you can! The Cosmic Microwave Background is exactly that -- it's the light from the hot early universe. I just think it's wild that we can see that! I did a video with Minute Physics going a bit more into this, if you're curious: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cfg11qQwPzQ" target="_blank"><a href="https://youtu.be/Cfg11qQwPzQ" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/Cfg11qQwPzQ</a></a> Anyway. That's the most mind-blowing thing, to me.</li>
<li>I have a page of advice on my website for students who are specifically interested in astrophysics (<a href="http://www.astrokatie.com/solicited-advice" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.astrokatie.com/solicited-advice" target="_blank">http://www.astrokatie.com/solicited-advice</a></a>) but in general my advice would be to get good at math (which is to say, practice a lot, because you get better when you practice more) and also to explore what you're really excited about. And don't buy into the idea that you have to be a genius or a &quot;science person&quot; or a &quot;math person&quot; in order to be a scientist. It's WAY more important to be curious and to be willing to follow that curiosity and work hard to learn new things. The whole concept of &quot;genius&quot; is, in my opinion, misleading and overrated. So if you don't feel like a genius, don't worry about that. Follow your interest and your excitement and your curiosity and see where it leads you.</li>
