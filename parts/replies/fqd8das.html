			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason why silicon is often proposed as an alternate to carbon in a hypothetical alien chemistry of life is because silicon and carbon have the same electron valence, meaning they will combine chemically with the same other elements. For instance, both C-O2 (carbon dioxide) and Si-O2 (silica) are common in nature. HOWEVER, chemical bonds involving silicon are MUCH stronger than those involving carbon, which means that it takes a LOT more energy to breakdown these Si- bonds than C-bonds (Si-O2 is what quartz is made of). As a consequence, Si-based chemistry would not offer the chemical flexibility that C-based chemistry present, which would seem essential to enabling ANY biology. That said, who knows?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding was that carbon bonds are stronger than Si bonds, which means they are less likely to break apart allowing for life to evolve? Carbon bonds are in a lower energy orbital with electrons much closer to the nucleus, so I think they should be stronger bonds than Si bonds. Also, the strength of carbon carbon bonds allows for long chains to form, whereas weaker Si-Si bonds donâ€™t allow for long chains to form.</p></div>		</li>
