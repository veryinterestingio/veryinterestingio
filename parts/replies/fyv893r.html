Lots of times, telescope boxes will advertise that you can get &quot;Up to 20x magnification!&quot;, but that's just a factor of what lenses you put on the the telescope! The larger the diameter (or aperture), the more photons you can let in, and the fainter the objects you'll be able to see. Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes typically have a large aperture and are easy enough to tote around. That'll probably be the next telescope I buy. :)</p>
<p>That said, I was just looking at the NEOWISE comet with a 4&quot; diameter telescope my grandparents got me for my 7th birthday a few nights ago, and that was enough to see the comet clearly, make out the rings and storms on Saturn, see Jupiters moons, and make out a bunch of craters on the Moon. That's a &quot;Newtonian&quot; mount telescope.</p>
<p>There are also a bunch of binoculars on the market geared towards stargazers that you can get for \~around $100 or less. Again here, the larger the diameter, the better you'll be able to see faint objects.</p></div>		</li>
