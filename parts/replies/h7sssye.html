			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. We sold our house without an agent. Between the lawyer and title company it wasn’t difficult. The agent would cost 6% and, in a seller’s market, it wasn’t worth it since finding a buyer wasn’t difficult.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup</p>
<p>I straight put on the table the savings of buying from me, cash, or using a realtor and then cut a portion of the saving back to the seller in my offer. They like it. I like it. The only person who loses is &quot;the realtor&quot; who brings little to nothing to the table for basic real estate purchases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's awesome and thanks for the info but would you mind elaborating a bit? I'll be house hunting again within the year and I've always considered doing this but I worry I'd miss some sort of crucial step.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>first, I'd suggest a service like Redfin if you don't have any experience</p>
<p>secondly, just do some googling and reading about it on reddit</p>
<p>You need to do research on the market and specific homes you are interested in (likely you will do this anyway, online). Contact a real estate lawyer, if you can find one, in your area. Regular lawyer can help too, but not as useful. Negotiate that you pay by the hour. Do as much of the basic footwork yourself (you can likely chalk this up to hundreds if not thousands of dollars per hour you are saving vs. paying a realtor). It's easy to find reviews and recommendations for inspectors (ask people you know in the area who they used for service and/or inspections previously), and you can obviously search online. Setting up inspections is very easy. Just have to make sure the property is available and open. Make sure inspectors are licensed and bonded. </p>
<p>Call around some title companies for service rates, and check online reviews.</p>
<p>For buying a typical suburban house it's quite easy. </p>
<p>In a hot market where you might be forced to pay the entire realtor(s) fees, that could easily be 6 or 7% of the purchase price, so on a 500k home you are looking at saving $30,000 to $35,000 in shitty &quot;realtors fees&quot;, minus what you'd pay OVER a lawyer to look over the paperwork (which you usually have to pay for, in addition to the realtor's fees, anyway, <strong><em>because realtor's aren't lawyers and cannot legally give legal advice anyway</em></strong>, HEYOOOO).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Sold my condo myself. It was the easiest thing ever. I mean really the ONLY thing that a realtor does is negotiate the price. You still need to get all of the documents, coordinate with the lawyer, complete all of the signings. If you are comfortable with negotiating then it's no issue. And if it's a seller's market then there is absolutely no reason to use a realtor. If you have a set price in mind just stick to it and that's it. Don't fall into the trap of getting your price cut down. </p>
<p>When we bought our house, we used a realtor because as someone else said, the seller pays the realtors. Even when buying, we needed to get all of the documents together and coordinate things with the lawyer which took a significant amount of time. Our realtor likely spent less than 10 hours on everything including showing us the house. He made over 13k for that. </p>
<p>Back in the day realtors used to earn their wage by finding houses that met your criteria, driving you around, showing you houses. Now with the internet, you already know what you want to look at and they just open the door.</p>
<p>The system worked fine back then, but housing prices have climbed substantially while commission percentages have stayed the same. Not only that but the buying realtors have a huge conflict of interest. They literally get paid based on the price of the house you buy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When I bought my home, we didn't have to do any of that. The realtors, mine and the sellers, set all of that up for us and all we had to do was show up to sign the paperwork.</p></div>		</li>
