<p>I’m now thinking of Bonsai trees and how they live for so long but they are so closely cared for.. if any tree’s conditions were so closely monitored and cared for then they’d have a greater chance of living hundreds of years as well.</p>
<p>Edit: super fascinating when it happens naturally though, as you were explaining.. and the planet provides just the right conditions for the species to live peacefully. Amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking of bonsai, a lot of commercial plants you see are made from grafting. Grafting takes a branch from Plant A and “melds” it with Plant B (typically at the rootstock). The resulting plant has plant Bs roots, but Plant A for everything else. By doing this over and over, you could argue that Plant A lives forever. </p>
<p>Good examples of this are the Japanese Maple in your front yard, and every grape vine at the winery.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This was the good writeup that I was looking for so I don't have to do it myself. I do want to add that tree cells do have telomeres and telemerase (like all eukaryotes). Every time a cell divides, the telomeres of the DNA that divided are shortened. Once the majority of the telomeres are shortened enough, then the cell will either not divide (and eventually die) or it will attempt to divide, but then undergo apopotosis due to mutations. Telomerase is an enzyme that lengthens telomeres and increases the longevity of the cells (so they can divide more). </p>
<p>What we found out with plants, is that the stem cells of the plant's meristems have a higher concentration of telomerase than other cells. This allows them to divide multiple times, regenerate their telomeres, and then divide even more (as if they were young again). So this is one of the primary reasons for the longevity of plants and trees. </p>
<p>Another major factor is the lack of a nervous system (and other complex organ systems). In mammals, all the organ systems are so inter-dependent that if one fails, it can lead to a cascading effect, which leads to death. For example, kidney failure will lead to liver and spleen failure, in addition to other effects such as pH imbalance and hyper(hypo)tonicity. Those effects then damage other cells and organs until the organism is unable to function as a unit and declared dead. </p>
<p>With trees, they mainly have to manage water and nutrient uptake from the roots, distribution of water and nutrients to the living cells, response to temperature and light levels, and then gas exchange within the leaves. So there is much fewer potential life-threatening system failures to cause 'death' in the plant. </p>
<p>With all that said, I do argue that trees still do die of old age, because they do contain shortening telomeres, which is the primary cause of (apoptosis that we associate with) old age in organisms. It's just that trees rebuild their telomeres much better than most other organisms, and it takes a lot more cellular death in plant tissues to cause mass tissue death of the entire tree (usually this happens by fungal or viral pathogens that attack dead or dying tissue).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think we might disagree on what “old age” might mean for plants. Like I said in my parent comment it’s a pretty nuanced distinction, so again please don’t take this as antagonistic - buuuuut...</p>
<p>I think there’s a big difference between plants and animals as far as the role that meristematic/stem cell tissues play for each organism. In animals, stem cells necessarily play secondary roles, and cannot repair catastrophic damage to critical functional systems. For example, you can’t bring back a brain dead person by putting bone marrow in their head and hoping for the best. Plants, on the other hand, are DEPENDENT on their meristematic tissues. Telomeres are important in derived tissues like stem parenchyma, leaf mesophyll, and other tissues that require genetic material to function but are not so critical that they can’t be systematically replaced. Plants reinforce this non-critical aspect of their derived tissues by utterly destroying the genetic component of many kinds of cells -  xylem elements, phloem tissues, etc.</p>
<p>I think you’re getting at this with your other text about the interdependent versus independent nature of plant and animal sub-systems. But i don’t think this decentralization means that plants age slower, or more flexibly, but rather I think that aging is a <em>necessary consequence of a complex, centralized, and deterministic biology</em>.</p>
<p>Did I explain that well? It’s not that plants age slow because they’re decentralized, it’s that centralization necessitates aging. But again, it’s a nuanced point, I think you raise important points about telomeres and their relationship to cell senescence.</p>
<p>I also think your examples of catastrophic system failure can apply to plants! But a lot of my training has involved work with catastrophic xylem and phloem failure during drought stress, so maybe I’m biased.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Catastrophic system failure does happen in plants, but it just takes much more tissue damage to vulnerable areas than it would in more complex organisms. You can sheer off a vertical chunk of bark 3/4 of the circumference (cinnamon harvesting) and the trees still recover. But if you take a hatchet and sever the living tissue around the entire circumference, then most trees will die or start up a new stem.</p>
<p>As far as old age, my point was just that our concept of aging derives from telomere shortening, which causes cellular death due to cells not fit for mitosis. Since plants do have telomeres that can shorten and lead to apoptosis, then I say that is what we would call aging. Also, the cause of the apoptosis is usually a mutation that occurs during the cellular division and the cell fails the checks of the g2 phase. This is another reason plants are more resistant to large scale cell death, is they can divide with more mutations that higher organisms. Or rather, the mutations are much less deleterious to the life of the plant. So the combination of active stem cells, higher levels of telomerase, and less harmful mutations lessens the effects of “aging”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a solid answer, best one yet I think. I've been very curious about the &quot;rhizosphere&quot; for a while now, what do you think there is to learn about forest ecology in that sense? My layman's impression is we perhaps overstate the visible part (trees) and fail to understand the bigger picture that lies below. For example, I've read that especially boreal forests bind way more carbon in the root systems than their tropical counterparts, yet this isn't taken into account when clear cutting old growth in order to create &quot;carbon sinks&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your impression is absolutely correct - the rhizosphere is under-studied relative to above ground components. </p>
<p>You’re also correct that boreal forests can (maybe, system dependent) sequester a lot of carbon below-ground relative to e.g. tropical forests. BUT, this isn’t just because of trees - the higher soil temperatures in tropical forests enable soil bacteria and fungi to eat the <em>shit</em> out of soil carbon, whereas carbon in boreal peat lands gets saved by low winter temperatures. Standing water/melting permafrost in boreal regions prevents aerobic bacteria from efficiently burning carbon, which isn’t a problem in tropical forests that stay moist but generally don’t let water sit on top of soil for entire seasons.</p>
<p>You’re also correct that cutting forests doesn’t create a “carbon sink”... at least immediately. Douglas-fir forests in Oregon/Washington/BC are a carbon source for about 30-40 years post-clear cut and take about 100 years to reach net carbon-sink status, which is the system I can remember confidently off the top of my head.</p>
<p>The tl:dr is that soil ecology is a very complicated and very cutting edge part of forest ecology... but, that’s coming from an above-ground tree person!</p></div>		</li>
