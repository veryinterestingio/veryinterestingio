<li>Unless Zeus himself built you for the sole purpose to fight‚Ä¶. Don‚Äôt fuckin do it. There‚Äôs virtually zero money to be made unless you‚Äôre the cream of the crop. Most of the time you‚Äôre paying your own way to fight and losing money even when you‚Äôre winning. I‚Äôm still young and my body is bamboozled lol. It‚Äôs really not worth it unless it‚Äôs in your fuckin dna, which you‚Äôll know real quick if it is or not.
I do however recommend everyone take up jiu jitsu. Such a graceful fighting style, extremely rewarding mentally physically and spiritually. Don‚Äôt have to be a built athlete. Any size shape weight etc can work their way into the sport. Plus, if you are ever in a situation that you 100% cannot avoid a street fight ( do everything you can to avoid street fights ), knowing jiu jitsu will more times than not win you the fight, or put a stop to it since nearly 80% of street fights end up on the ground in 30 seconds.</li>

If you have ZERO fighting ability and find yourself in an unavoidable street fight situation ALWAYS go with plan B‚Ä¶ stare said person in the fuckin eye like he stole your pie, hunker down with absolute malice and aggressively shit your pants, maintaining direct eye contact the ENTIRE time. Not only will he swiftly leave the scene, you will have left a permanent scar on that fellas brain for LIFE.</h1></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>100% THIS. Retired muay Thai fighter, switched to bjj, I just love it, I can keep competing for years to come and with hardly any recovery time. My fights were always wars and it got so bad I would get a headache if I was even caught with a jab in sparring. Bjj is a lot more long term.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had no idea what muy thai was for the longest time, and then one day I stumbled upon a video of training for it. The trainer would ref the fights, while holding a wooden or bamboo rod and randomly smack the shins of the fighters. Is all I could think was how hitting your shin is one of the most painful feelings, for me anyways. I was amazed how tough those guys were.</p></div>		</li>
