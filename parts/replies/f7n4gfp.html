<p>That's entirely down to the transmission. But I guess you meant bigger engines <em>can</em> run at lower RPM than small weak ones and that's true. </p>
<p>That said, engines are most efficient at their peak power under a load, and as someone was explaining, if you require 50 horsepower to go down a highway at constant speed, a 1.4L with idk 75 hp that's near it's peak output will run much more efficiently than a big V8 that's barely making any power at near idle with stupid tall gears. The smaller engine will use less fuel to produce the 50 horsepower regardless of it doing it at high RPM. My old 1.4L civic still got 40 MPG screaming down the highway at 3700 RPM in 5th gear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I presume you mean &quot;more than same engine with <em>taller</em> gears&quot;.</p>
<p>Because it's the same engine. I was comparing &quot;high displacement low RPM&quot; to &quot;low displacement high RPM&quot;. If the engine is the same, it will logically use more fuel at higher RPM. Same goes for the tiny 1.4L, it will use even less fuel if you're just cruising at 70kph at 1800 RPM, and more fuel if you're flogging it near redline in 2nd on a twisty road.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The reason being that the engines were far more thermally efficient and powerful and the cars were lighter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bingo. American cars may have 2.8L I4 engines but their vehicles are motherfuckin tanks. You sure get the power and the driving momentum/feeling but mileage is utter shit, and no amount of highway driving is going to counter that. Which is fine since mpg ranks low on their priority list considering they get fuel at around $1/liter, which is chump change compared not only to EU countries but even developing SEA countries.</p>
<p>Basically, fuel is dirt cheap in the Americas and Middle East and everywhere else it's a rip-off. And that fact is beautifully reflected in the kind of vehicles which sell in those regions, vehicle ownership and penetration of public transport (which is inversely related to fuel cost).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the larger the combustion chamber the more efficient it is. There's certainly some reasons to go with big engines, especially for heavier vehicles.</p>
<p>But for the most part it's just that fuel is relatively cheap and abundant in America. It's even much cheaper than it is in Canada.</p>
<p>EDIT: Huge caveat here - smaller engines can achieve higher compression than larger ones which results in their being more efficient. Especially when turbocharged. There are trade offs to this though - reliability being one. At the same compression the larger combustion chamber will be more efficient than the smaller one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Larger combustion chamber is more efficient</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I definitely remember that being discussed in terms of chemical energy to mechanical energy per stroke, but I think that basically meant the engine was very efficient at turning gas into power (acceleration or towing).  Now its been awhile since I looked at the math, but I am not sure how well that holds when running lean (aka, not flooring it, holding a constant speed, or other typical commuter driving).</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure if large combustion chambers were more fuel efficient in terms of mpg and commuting, they would be way more popular in places with unsubsidized fuel and mpg efficiency standards.</p>
<p>Edit: I think I put words in u/wgriz's mouth, who has since clarified. As they said, I accidentally mixed ICE engineering terms with laymen terms and they mean different things.  It's a matter of looking at a single combustion chamber or the whole vehicle, along with other factors like city driving vs high driving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are mistaking terms here. There's a difference between efficiency and conservation. In design they are opposites. Without any other factors like forced induction, to produce the same power a larger engine will use less fuel than a smaller one. The air/fuel mixture burns more efficiently with more space to do it in.</p>
<p>The more you use the more efficient you are at using it. But, then you're not conserving it. The key to <em>conservation</em> is to have smaller cars so you need less power and can use smaller engines.</p>
<p>EDIT: To explain a bit more - an engine with larger combustion chambers (not overall displacement) will burn more efficiently than a smaller one and use less fuel to produce the same power. However, in practice they don't produce the same power. Bigger engines are used to produce more power in that application use more fuel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I addressed this in other comments.</p>
<p>There's a difference between *efficiency* - how well an engine converts chemical to mechanical energy - and *consumption* - the amount of fuel used.</p>
<p>A McDonald's produces food much more efficiently than you cooking in your kitchen. But, your kitchen also uses less resources in general so it's fine being less efficient.</p>
<p>And your home kitchen would fall apart at the seams trying to keep up with the demand of a McD's. Even if its possible, because you are overworking it and its less efficient it will take more resources to produce the same amount of food.</p>
<p>So, we don't put home kitchens in big restaurants nor do we put big kitchens in small homes. They are sized according to their application. If you aren't using much you don't need efficiency. The more resources you use the more it pays to be efficient with them.</p>
<p>EDIT: I realize this is ELI5, but efficiency is a tough one to grasp. Don't worry about it. I thought the McD's analogy might be better. The simple answer is that Americans have bigger cars, which need more power and the most straightforward way to achieving that is more displacement. This also results in a more reliable, quieter engine that has a longer lifespan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Canadian fuel prices are cheap compared to pretty much anywhere in Europe, and expensive compared to pretty much anywhere in the US.</p>
<p>For example, while gas where I am is sitting around 90 (Canadian) cents a litre, over in Manchester, it's recently down to only(!) 2.13 a litre (which is about 60 cents higher than the highest prices I've ever seen in Edmonton) </p>
<p>Milan is a bit higher yet - the equivalent of 2.29 a litre</p>
<p>Prague's pretty cheap (for Europe) - only 1.80 a litre.</p>
<p>And so on. Eastern Europe is about double what Alberta prices are, and Western Europe is about double what prices in most of Canada are.</p></div>		</li>
