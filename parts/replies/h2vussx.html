			<div class="markdown"><p>This comment reminded me of something I thought about a while ago regarding white dwarf stars. Doe they essentially just become planets after they completely cool off and no longer give any light/heat off anymore? I know they &quot;shine&quot; from residual heat for a long time, but I'm guessing these things are solid and thus once they cool just become dark &quot;planets&quot; right? Man what an exotic landscape that would be to see.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That got me thinking. Does that mean the surface of a magnetar is completely smooth?  Or maybe I am thinking of something else.  Hmm. I vaguely remember something about taking Mount Everest and putting on a magnetar would collapse it down to under an inch or something like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose that would be exotic in a way. Endless flat horizon on a homogeneous terrain material, all taking place in total darkness unless there's a decent enough star nearby. It would be like being out at sea, only on land. With the only indicator that your'e going anywhere being the change in the stars above (ignoring rotation, If they spin fast enough then the skies above would be pretty crazy too).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>White dwarfs are composed of degenerate matter with a density around a million times that of water. They are much more dense than any ordinary matter and their density is not strongly dependent on their temperature. It's quite hard to think about what one would feel like if you were somehow able to touch one (especially since the surface gravity would be hundreds of thousands of times that of earth). </p>
<p>The cooling timescales for white dwarfs (at the end of which they become cold &quot;black dwarfs&quot;) are not known with certainty but should be at a minumum tens/hundreds of thousands of times the current age of the universe, so you won't find any lying around at present.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're describing neutron stars.  <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/white-dwarf-star" target="_blank">White dwarfs</a> are composed of ordinary* matter. In the case of the sun, it's nuclear fusion end-state will be a mass of mostly carbon and oxygen, with shells of helium and hydrogen.</p>
<p>*They are supported by <em>electron</em> degeneracy pressure, but aren't 'degenerate' matter since elections, protons, and neutrons still exist and form distinct elements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very creepy mental image, that.</p>
<p>Does electron degenerate matter interact with regular matter? I mean, would there be a reaction aside from gravitational smooshing? Theoretically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure but... what about the atmosphere?</p>
<p>If the atmosphere is too thick, it can't be considered a terrestrial planet.  And a too-thick atmosphere would happen long before fusion would.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the planet accreted slowly over time, it would finish forming well after the excess gas had been blown out of the solar system. Terrestrial planets form later than gas giants, according to my planet formation professor. (Iâ€™m currently a graduate student in a related field)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar hypothetical I've wondered about: Suppose a planet such as earth had its atmosphere spontaneously and completely stolen away (I'm not sure if this would imply the oceans would immediately boil as they'd be exposed to a vaccum, but let's say they're gone as well). Would the rocky planet left behind slowly and spontaneously off-gas until an atmosphere is restored again? If this is the case, given enough time, would we expect the resulting atmosphere to roughly resemble the current one in composition?</p>
<p>I suppose the same question from another angle is if the Earth's atmosphere existing is more or less an inescapable property of its size, or if we are &quot;lucky&quot; that the various masses that consolidated into the earth also included a bunch of atmosphere starter pack material.</p></div>		</li>
