<p>While I'm sure physicists have no &quot;set answer&quot; for this, when reading the answers here, it seems, the current theory is no, there is nothing and probably never was.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two important concepts. There is the question of the shape and extent of the universe, and then there is the observable universe.</p>
<p>There is a spherical bubble of “universe” around the Earth that represents the distance away from us that light has had time to traverse since the Big Bang. This bubble expands over time.</p>
<p>Additionally, the fact that the expansion of the universe is a result of more space being created and not things moving through space means that the rate of expansion scales with distance and is not bounded by the speed of light (which is a limit on how fast massive objects can travel through space). This means that as things get farther away from us, they move away from us faster and faster and eventually they will be moving away from us fast enough that light from those objects will never reach us. Once something crosses this threshold, it forever leaves our observable universe and eliminates our potential to ever see it no matter how much time passes.</p>
<p>When we talk about the whole universe rewinding to a singular point that contained all the matter in the universe that then expanded to what we see today (the Bug Bang), what we really mean is that the extent of space covered by our observable universe was once a singular point. It may be that the universe was always infinite in extent but very, very dense and the singular point was part of a homogenous hot, dense infinite universe.</p>
<p>The Big Bang is then the process of the universe becoming less and less dense through the creation of additional space, and that small point is merely a sample of the overall universe that expanded into what is now our observable universe.</p>
<p>Realistically, though, we are likely never to know for sure what lies beyond the bounds of our observable universe and what the overall shape of the wider universe is really like because it is truly beyond the bounds of anything we can ever observe.</p>
<p>Eventually all structures in the universe that are not gravitationally bound to us in our galactic supercluster will recede beyond that cosmological horizon and the distant future will have an observable universe that is much darker and emptier than the one we observe today, no longer containing the evidence that would be required to formulate our current theories about the origin of the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the future, things will be further away due to the expansion and we will have to look deeper into space to continue observing them until they are so far that they will never be observable again. While at the same time, the deeper we look into space, the older the light is that we are seeing, thus looking back in time. And when we look deep enough, everything becomes one big blur of light, known as the event horizon, that is so dense, we cannot literally look past it.</p>
<p>Which means that the future will be the past and the past could very well be the future. Which means we have no real ability to intellectually perceive the reality of “time”. Which means f*ck it, stars are pretty and I’m happy to be alive. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We would love to have good answers for those questions. All we can do is try to make sense of what we can observe which does not really give us answers to everything. The current theory for the end of the universe say that it will end but only after an infinate length of time. Everything we know of will eventually decay. Everything have a half life. The only thing we have not found the half life to is protons but it is likely going to decay as well, just in a very long time. At the end of it all everything decays into pure energy. But as the universe expands even the energy gets dilluted and after an infinity there is no energy left. This is called the heat death of the universe. I know it sounds contradictiary to say that the universe ends but only after an eternity however that is very different from saying that the universe does not end or that it ends after a certain time. But again this is only what we are able to theorize based on what we are able to observe. We can not say anything about how and why the universe is expanding as we can not see any of that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do not even know if there is an edge or not to the universe. And even if there is we can not get there or see what is there. But the expansion of the universe we can observe is not at the edge, it is everywhere. We are just seeing new space popping up everywhere making the universe bigger. It is space itself which is expanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s no edge, there’s no outside. If the earth was inflating like a balloon the surface are would be expanding. If you asked what it was expanding into and where the edge of the surface is, there isn’t one because it’s continuous and it’s not expanding into anything from a surface perspective. The analogy does fall apart though when you notice that the earths size is expanding into space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, this metaphor is fatally flawed for a lot of reasons. Even if you could get to the &quot;edge&quot; of the universe and fire a bullet, the laws of physics would not ever allow the bullet to go faster than the cosmological expansion.</p>
<p>The universe doesn't expand &quot;into&quot; anything physical. It just expands. Like others have said, this is where dimensional aspects of time come into play.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wait, how does that work?  As far as I understand it, the rate of expansion over any small distance is negligible.  The only reason the edge of the universe moves away from us so quickly is because we are really far away, and the tiny increases across all that distance add up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The distance between them has increased, because the space between them expanded. But they didn't <em>move</em>, per se.</p>
<p>If you mark two points on a rubber band and stretch it, they are now farther apart - i.e., there is more rubber band between them. But they didn't move <em>on</em> the band.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok but in this case if all you know is the rubber band, then is there even more rubber band between them? Wouldn't the rubber band unit of measurement also be stretched and it would turn out to be the same distance? (ie also mark the units of measurement on the band before stretching)</p>
<p>In our universe are things expanding at different rates and this accounts for why more of our unit of measurement can fit between two galaxies? Also how are we measuring the relative motion of two galaxies and their distance apart from each other?</p>
<p>I remember the red/blue shift can give us some insight on relative motion, but I'm not so sure how we actually know distances in space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stretching is almost a tough metaphor, because like someone pointed out, if had a rubber ruler and wanted to move 12 inches, they are getting confused because even stretched, it still should “feel like” 12 inches since it stretched proportionally.</p>
<p>We know the universe is expanding.  The hardest thing to grasp is what is causing this and how it works.  I almost think it’s easier to picture it as points inside a water ballon.  We started close together, but space is the water and keeps entering and expanding the balloon.  The water is accelerating faster every moment and at some point you won’t see the point on the other side of the balloon if this balloon could never pop.</p></div>		</li>
