			<div class="markdown"><p>It also allows the cells that your body dispenses to swim around and patch things up without drying up and forming a scab, reducing the chance of scarring. I used to prefer letting it scab up rather than leaving it &quot;open&quot; as it is much less maintenance, but wounds actually heal much quicker when you don't let them scab up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use this on my dog and she gets the funniest face when I put it on. It's gotten to the point that she anticipates the feeling and starts making the face as soon as a pull it out of the closet. Truly it looks like shes wincing, but shes one to bolt if she doesn't like something and she passively just sits there, constipation grin ear to ear while I slather the sticky goo onto her dry neck skin. It makes her so soft and shes significantly less itchy so win win.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are quite a few peer reviewed studies in the medical literature agreeing with you that the antibiotic ointments are no more effective than straight petroleum jelly.</p>
<p>They suspect it's a combination of blocking out further contamination and keeping the wound sealed and moist to promote natural healing... Like a blister pack bandage.</p></div>		</li>
