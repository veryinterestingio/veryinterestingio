			<div class="markdown"><p>“They aren’t brightly colored as a warning sign”. True because frogs don’t choose to become colored. That’s not how evolution works. Bright colored frogs were more noticeable and readily identified as poisonous by predators. They then reproduced more and increased the proportion of brightly colored frogs. </p>
<p>The poison creating diet and the colors evolved together and in unison. If frogs stopped eating those bugs a million years ago, they would not be colorful any more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are of course also animals that take advantage of certain colouration being associated with poison or otherwise hazardous nature.  Everyone (including many animals) knows that yellow and black stripy flying insects can sting and are generally hazardous, so hover flies with yellow and black stripes are avoided by potential predators even though they are essentially harmless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true, just be careful saying that hover flies “take advantage” of the colors. The flies have no clue how colors work. They might not even see color. Evolution took advantage of the colors. The flies are just passengers on the ship.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or they still could be, if there was no disadvantage to keeping those colors</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure I believe that second part.  Its pretty easy to tell most fish from salmon just by how it cooks.  I think there are certain saltwater trout that are similar, but you can't just dye any fish red and pass it off as salmon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's spurious logic.  It doesn't matter that they don't produce the poison themselves so long as the end result is that they are poisonous.  They don't spontaneously develop camouflage if they don't eat poisonous insects but are brightly colored <em>because</em> they can expect to always have that available.  If they didn't, being brightly colored would become a major disadvantage (unless there were significant other colorful poisonous species in their environment to teach predators to avoid them, which there are).  But they don't, because they are a product of their environment.</p>
<p>Primates are similar in our inability to synthesize vitamin C.  Pretty much all mammals but primates and guinea pigs can.  Our ancestors lost the ability due to their fruit-based diet being abundant in vitamin C, and losing the genes to produce it wasn't fatal for them.  Now, if you remove us from an environment rich in it, we get scurvy, whereas goats and cows and pigs and wolves and everything else is fine.  Our ancestors were fine, because their environment provided what they needed.</p></div>		</li>
