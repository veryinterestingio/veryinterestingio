			<div class="markdown"><p>Also along with this, your brain will continue running iterations of the problems.
For instance long boarding.</p>
<p>First learning how to longboard can be really challenging especially for balance and such as you first start to learn. It might take a while to get the balance down or you might feel like you're doing worse than the day before, but the next day itll suddenly click and you'll be able to balance fine. </p>
<p>Your brain was continuing to work thru the problem as you slept, storing the info you gained and using it to build a better &quot;balancing&quot; algorithm, so to speak. </p>
<p>You can do the same thing with info for tests or important life decisions. Take a nap or go to bed right after studying and/or thinking thru the important decision.</p>
<p>Creds: None, just like to read random stuff and learn a little about a lot.</p></div>		</li>
