			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's not that common, I had my first one when I was 19 and I cracked my neck too fast, it was so painful I thought I had done permanent damage, and it burned like hell. I couldn't move my neck normally for a few minutes.</p>
<p>I've had the same happen 2 or 3 times more but not even close to the pain of the first one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me, I think it was a growing up thing. Turn my neck wrong to look at something, and intense pain up my neck and into my head, with burning. Not sure how to describe it really. </p>
<p>Happened regularly through my teens and early twenties, haven't had it happen in the last several year though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happened to me probably every six months when I was younger. I'm 31 now and reading this thread has made me realize it hasn't happened in at least a decade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's happened to me several times over the last few years. the pain is excruciating and makes me drop everything to stop it. it's really scary when it happens while you look over your shoulder when driving. the best way to explain it is that knee-jerk reaction to hitting your funny bone, but 10x worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me it feels like I’m being electrocuted along with heat and a tingling sensation that follows. It happens when I look down to the right and turn a little further. The initial shock jolts my head back to a normal position and my left arm flies upward (left medial delt contracting). Completely involuntary when it is triggered. Used to happen frequently, but now that I’ve gained 120lbs my traps and thicker neck slightly decreased the mobility of my head, so unless I deliberately try to trigger whatever this is it will never happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup.. mine feels like electricity and makes me lean my head left... all this while holding 3 fingers down on what I think is either a muscle or blood vessel/artery between my shoulder and base of my neck....</p>
<p>And I feel electric &quot;pulses&quot; with each and every breath so the harder I push down the better... </p>
<p>That's the best I could explain it.... it's been happening since I was 7 or 8 yrs old... ?</p></div>		</li>
