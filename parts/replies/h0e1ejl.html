To find the particle on the &quot;correct&quot; side of the table goes towards zero at the surface of the table. However if the barrier, the table thickness, is not infinitely high, the probability of finding the particle beyond the table surface drops exponentially. That's fast, but if the table is not too thick, then outside the barrier (meaning under the table) there is some possibility left. The hand does never get stuck inside. It passes and shows up on the other side or not. Inside the table the energy barrier is too high to exist for the particle.
Now here is the catch: this works for Buckminsterfullerene balls - 60 carbon atoms put together like a football. They don't get stuck in between. They literally just reappear under the table as if the table was not there.</p></div>		</li>
