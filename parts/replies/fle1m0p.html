<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Though, burn might be too strong a word. It's going to sting for a few minutes and then it'll be an annoyance in the back of your mind for a few more, but that's basically it. Still, if you do it quick there's no damage at all (and if you're a little more confident and know what to do you don't even need to wet your fingers).</p></div>		</li>
