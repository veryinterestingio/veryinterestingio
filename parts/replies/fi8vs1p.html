<p>We want to notify our community that on Friday, our team discovered and blocked suspicious activity on our network. In our investigation, we have found no evidence that encrypted user vault data was taken, nor that LastPass user accounts were accessed. The investigation has shown, however, that LastPass account email addresses, password reminders, server per user salts, and authentication hashes were compromised.</p>

<p>It is why I use LastPass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If that's your alternative, then, yes, that's better than using an online service.</p>
<p>Many people just find carrying around a thumb drive inconvenient. Password managers also have things like browser autofill integration to make logging in much quicker than opening a file, finding the right entry and copy-pasting.</p>
<p>Ultimately security isn't a matter of &quot;secure&quot; or &quot;not secure&quot;, there's varying levels of security and eventually there start being tradeoffs between security and convenience. </p>
<p>What you choose depends on how much convenience you prefer. An online service is still miles better than re-using passwords so if that's what it takes for the average person to start making better password choices I'm all for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Guess I'm not as digitally connected as many people. (No one wants to see my ugly face on IG or Tik Tok!) :)</p>
<p>There's only a few things I'd want to access on the go, so it's easy to remember just those two or three passwords (which have 2FA enabled). If I want to access an account that I don't have memorized, it will just have to wait until I get home. Like I mentioned, I'm far from an online influencer!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so if someone robs your house  they can get all your online passwords from that paper list or your usb drive? </p>
<p>What happens if you need one of those passwords and you are on a work computer with the USB disable for storage devices?</p>
<p>Password managers also allow you to put in your password without revealing it, your method is weak against shoulder surfers, unless you work from home making shoulder surfing a non issue for you.</p>
<p>Making a personal list may work for you depending on your situation but not for everyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nobody that is interested in your passwords is ever going to rob your house and nobody robbing your house is interested in your passwords. The absolute safest way is to do what this guy does and use unique passwords that you write down on a piece of paper. The flash drive makes it less secure if anything as a hacker could get to it. A password manager us more convenient though and a good compromise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) I think they would be too busy stealing the computers, big screen TVs, and jewelry to even notice the paper stuck in a shelf with office supplies. The same goes for the pile of USB drives in a drawer in a printer stand. Thieves don't want to spend one moment more than necessary when burglarizing a home. The average time spent inside the home during a burglary is 8-12 minutes.</p>
<p>2) I don't log into personal accounts at work. Just accessing webmail at work results in an immediate termination. So, needing a personal password at work isn't a problem that I have. Remembering passwords for accessing personal accounts on my phone <em>is</em>, however.</p>
<p>On a related note to that, doesn't it seem silly to have 2FA on an account, if someone steals your phone? The text message comes to the same phone.</p>
<p>3) The only person who would see me entering a password at home is my wife, and I work in a building where non-employees are not allowed, so yeah, peeping Toms aren't a concern for me.</p></div>		</li>
