But iirc both the moderna and Pfizer vaccines were reported to have &gt;90% effective, much more than flu vaccines tend to be. I'd get either one, it's likely that both are equally capable, and the minute difference in their results of their studies are the result of sampling size error or differences in the method of analysis.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oxford/AZ use a modified adenovirus. Adenoviruses tend to cause colds at most in humans, so they're relatively harmless. The Oxford/AZ vaccine uses a strain that is normally only found among chimpanzees, to ensure that humans don't have preexisting immunity to it.</p></div>		</li>
