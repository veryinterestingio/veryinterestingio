			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing I never understood about these time reversal symmetry breaking arguments is that it seems like they're not actually reversing time, but just selectively inverting the momenta of certain things, but not others. </p>
<p>People bring up magnetism but what about the force carriers? Saying it violates time reversal symmetry because you imagine the configuration doesn't change and therefore neither does the magnetic field seems strange to me. </p>
<p>I'm sure it's right since literally everyone and all the books research says it is right. But I've never heard a good answer to this question. Hopefully you can help me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Breaking&quot; time-reversal symmetry (or any symmetry really) is a statement about specific states of system. It's saying that the interactions between the particles favour a set of configurations (i.e. they have the lowest energy) that are not symmetric under some symmetry of the world. </p>
<p>E.g. the interactions between atoms favour crystals, which pick out a particular set of spacing between the atoms. There are an infinite number of ways to do this -- since space is isotropic I can set up the origin for my crystal anywhere (similarly it's orientation) -- the energy is the same.</p>
<p>If that's the case then if you lower the temperature enough (+ a few other technical caveats) then the system strongly prefers to be in one of those states, so much so that at some point even an infinitely small perturbation (a stray electric field, an imperfection in a container, etc, etc) will be enough to pick out one of those states. (that's the transition temperature).</p>
<p>At that point you might why isn't the system moving between these states? They cost the same energy (since they're related by symmetry), so it should be easy, right? While that's true, but these are states that involve the correlated behaviour of many many atoms -- for a solid this is like \~10\^23 atoms. So the probability of some random fluctuation or something act in such a way that it moves all the atoms coherently becomes vanishingly small. </p>
<p>So the system gets &quot;stuck&quot; (kinematically) in a state that isn't invariant under the original symmetries that we started with. This is what is called &quot;spontaneously broken symmetry&quot;. Technically it's a break down of ergodicity and leads to a (mild) breaking of statistical mechanics (due to the subtlety of taking the number of atoms to infinity).</p>
<p>The argument for time-reversal is the same; magnetic moments or whatever line up due to their mutual interactions. Time-reversal symmetry says there are at least two ways to do this -- e.g. say all &quot;spinning&quot; clockwise or anti-clockwise -- at the same energy. But if a macroscopic number of degrees of freedom are involved them it'll get stuck in one of those two states &quot;breaking&quot; the symmetry. </p>
<p>So now the physics inside that object effectively doesn't obey time-reversal -- if you lived in there you'd see everything around you spinning clockwise, but never anti-clockwise. You'd have to flip all those ordered spins at once  -- an exceedingly (like wait &gt;&gt; the lifetime of the universe) rare event.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never heard this parallel to non-ergodicity and tbh I don't quite get how it relates?</p>
<p>There are physical barriers that enforce non-ergodicity in materials (such as the energy barriers associated with the diffusive relaxation of the local material composition) -- and even then, what is it exactly about a system being non-ergodic that means it isn't time-reversal symmetric? It seems that this would imply that non-ergodic systems are somehow not energy-conserving. </p>
<p>But what I'm getting at in the magnetic field case is that presumably under time reversal symmetry, the force carriers for the magnetic force are also time-reversed, which seems to suggest to me that the magnetic field is also reversed. Typical explanations about the time-reversed particle trajectories being unphysical in the unchanged magentic field therefore seem a bit spurious unless I am labouring under some misapprehension. (Magnetism and quantum physics certainly isn't my area).</p></div>		</li>

<p>So, while it does depend on the arrangement of the atoms it's not &quot;from&quot; the arrangement of the atoms in any real sense. </p>

<p>Thank you a lot! I think this has been something I have misunderstood / misread the whole time.</p></div>		</li>
