			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like your example is a little strawmanny. If you're going for security by obscurity, you will use neither armed guards nor money bags... but it doesn't make a good case against security by obscurity when your example is basically &quot;you can fit x money in a briefcase, and how many people have briefcases?&quot; Though nowadays backpacks are a better example.</p>
<p>This doesn't disprove your point. Just something that irked me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe more to the point is the job doesn't lend itself to obscurity. I used to be a classified materials courier for the DoD. When not on military bases, we really did dress in casual civilian clothes and drive non-descript vans. But that's because most of the time we blended in well and uniforms would have only drawn unwanted attention.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a buddy that was an army ranger.  He said at one point when he was serving he did security for nuclear weapon transport.</p>
<p>As he described it to me you had this rig that looked like every other damned rig on the highway and a couple vehicles back was a nondescript SUV that looked like just any other SUV.... except it was full of Rangers who were armed to the teeth.</p>
<p>He said I have probably been near this crap but never known.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you go for security through obscurity you are gonna have an insurance problem - as in you won't get any.</p>
<p>Insurance companies are in the business of risk management.  They know what the risks are with armed cars - and those risks are pretty good.</p>
<p>Sometimes with thins you hit this sweet spot where you have achieved 'good enough'.  Armored cars are probably in that spot.  You can be like, 'I have this plan that is better then armored cars.' but there attitude is gonna be, 'Why??? It is going to cost us a lot of money to verify your plan and what can we possibly gain??  Armored cars are already pretty great - they are a known quantity.'.</p>
<p>Besides, transporting money with an obscurity plan sounds suspiciously like you are planning to steal the money.</p></div>		</li>
