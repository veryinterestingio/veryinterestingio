			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, magnets are easy. It’s an electric field that results from the fact that a moving electric charge experiences contracted space in the direction of travel due to relativity effects.</p>
<p>The real question is “Fucking electric fields! How do they work?”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this only apply in places where there is friction/resistance? Would the larger and smaller magnetic object accelerate at the same rate in a vacuum?</p>
<p>Edit: thanks, everyone, for the good replies! I forgot about inertia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. This is independent of friction/resistance. Very fundamentally, gravity and magnetism are different forces. </p>
<p>Mass and gravity are very interconnected at a deeper level. Very simplistically, where there is mass, there will be gravity and vice versa. </p>
<p>Magnetism (or more correctly electromagnetism) is related to charges and the movement of charged particles. Electromagnetism doesn't have the similar interconnectedness to mass compared to gravity.</p>
<p>I don't want to make it sound like a big mystery but it difficult to describe without a bit of background in physics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Friction doesn't apply; the force being exerted by the magnetic field <em>doesn't depend on the mass of the object experiencing the force</em>. Since F=ma, a=F/m, so the larger the mass, the slower the acceleration. True in vacuums and on Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, then inertia would play a role I imagine.</p>
<p>Inertia being the resistance to acceleration or deceleration an object has, either to stay in motion or to stay idle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is this saying essentially that since earth is massive, the mass of the object you drop is going to make a negligible difference to how quickly its pulled down?</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/phiwong" target="_blank">phiwong</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The force of gravity is proportional to the mass (both of the earth and the object). So if the mass doubles, the force doubles. It isn't about being negligible - it is that it is in direct proportion. Because acceleration * mass = force, then if force doubles when mass doubles, acceleration is constant.</p></div>		</li>
