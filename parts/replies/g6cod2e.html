			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard this &quot;you taste through your nose&quot; thing before. It was taught to us in high school. </p>
<p>But I can confidently say that it does not work for me. I can plug my nose and eat and I have the full flavor of whatever I'm eating, regardless. Where does this idea come from?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might have a really shitty sense of smell, it’s just a fact that we taste with olfactory senses and tastebuds. Next time you’re drinking something flavorful, try plugging your nose, taking a sip, swallowing, then unplugging your nose and blowing out your nose without opening your mouth. You’ll taste it in your nose.</p>
<p>Air can also travel from your mouth to your nose even with your nose plugged so just plugging your nose and eating normally isn’t a perfect way to test how sense of smell affects taste</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont think I have a bad sense of smell. Im sitting here with an iced tea and trying your example and I'm not experiencing any sensation you're talking about. I assume people who are upvoting also feel this way, so I don't think I'm abnormal.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to argue you, or the science. What's proven is proven. I just dont get it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe the odors are going up from inside your mouth, like you can laugh milk out your nose. A friend with cancer lost their sense of smell - had to force himself to eat.  Said nothing had any taste whatsoever so the texture became more important, but it was all like eating bland gray mush. He survived the cancer, but sense of smell didn’t come back. He was so sad about that - said you don’t realize how important it is to smell things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your olfactory receptors basically “tune out” familiar smells, as these are considered low yield. Your nose is basically always on the hunt for new smells that might signal danger or a food source etc, as this gives you a survival advantage evolutionarily.</p></div>		</li>
