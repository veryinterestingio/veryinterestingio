<p>Another consideration is how rabies can travel up (in reverse to nerve transmissions) the CNS to cause neurological damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>MS is a complicated disease and you're right that its generally considered an autoimmune disease (where your body attacks itself). In this case, your body attacks the protective coating around nerves called myelin. There is some <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41572-018-0041-4" target="_blank">evidence</a> showing that the BBB in MS has been compromised allowing more immune cells in that can cause inflammation and damage. But the cause and effect hasn't really been worked out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is one passive defense mechanism, but it is more to protect against threats from the blood than your own immune system.  Cells that are immune privileged can do things like camouflage themselves to not get identified by T-cells, or change their protein surface to make it harder for white blood cells to bind to them, etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Virus or other damage/mutation, but yeah, it's one of my worries with the pure anti autoimmune treatment approaches. Animal models of MS are induced autoimmune diseases. If there's an actual underlying problem that the immune system is attacking, it'd be really hard to determine, until years after an anti autoimmune treatment is applied, what the original issue is.</p>
<p>It makes sense in a way, why does MS cause   demyelination of sections at any time, rather than the entire CNS?</p></div>		</li>
