			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that they figured it out.  As I understand it, it's that later archeologists wondered why they had such strong, intact teeth (when they found their skeletons, etc).   And figured out it was from the limestone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might be a lucky side effect: they processed their corn by soaking and cooking in alkaline solutions (limewater).  This is called nixtamalization: it increases nutritional value of the corn and mycotoxins are reduced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty cool. I wonder if that is how corn-dependent cultures in that area were able to survive, since lime releases the bound vitamin B3 in corn. Without releasing it the b3 deficiency causes <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pellagra" target="_blank">pellagra</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard the same thing about the Mayans on trips to the Mexican Riviera (Yucatan).</p>
<p>But, the Mayan 600bc-700bce (at least) had advanced surgery and dental work.</p>
<p>Otherwise, two thoughts on limestone. First is that the grit left in grain may have scrubbed the teeth. Plus limestone is alkali, like baking soda, to counteract some of the acidic-food effects</p></div>		</li>

<p>Anyway, a common cause of death in early homo sapien people was actually infections in their teeth</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s partly why their expected life span was less than 40 years old</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Don't know about &quot;mostly&quot;... but that goes into some measurements.</p>
<p>Take a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy#Variation_over_time" target="_blank">this chart</a>.</p>
<p>Notice that they say on many entries &quot;Life expectancy at age 15&quot;.</p>
<p>They're correcting for infant and adolescent mortality rates and still coming up with pretty short numbers.</p>
<p>&quot;At birth&quot; does tend to be far lower, but it's still very low in the notes too, almost the same in some cases.</p></div>		</li>
