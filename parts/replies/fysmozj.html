			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  What is happening is the slow release of heat generated by the initial pressurization of all that mass during earth's formation (along with the radiogenic heat).  When you compress a fluid into a smaller volume, it heats up.  But then it gradually cools back down to ambient.  It gains no additional energy from staying compressed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, but the source of the pressure (gravity) did contribute a lot of the heat that is still in the core. As the earth formed , gravitational potential energy was converted to kinetic energy as matter coalesced, and that kinetic energy was converted into heat as matter collided.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So there was another question asked today; basically how can milometer thick clothing protect astronauts from the -200C of space?</p>
<p>And answer was the vacuum of space has no air molecules to conduct away the heat.</p>
<p>Does the planet work on the same principal?  If there's nothing to conduct away the heat in the vacuum of space, isn't that also an insulator?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there is a huge insulating effect of space on the Earth. No conduction or convection can occur. There is still radiative heat transfer (what you get from the Sun or the main thing you get if you're the correct distance from a fire - not what you get from a radiator!) but this tends to be pretty small at the sort of temperatures we're dealing with.</p>
<p>Conduction and convection both depend on the difference in temperature between the bodies, while radiation depends on the difference in the fourth power of temperature between the bodies.</p>
<p>Conduction/convection: Heat = M*(THot-TCold) (M is the heat transfer coefficient, it depends on a variety of conditions; it tends to be larger for convection than conduction)</p>
<p>Radiation: Heat = N*(THot^(4)-TCold^(4))</p>
<p>It sounds like radiation would be bigger, right? Well, M is much, MUCH larger than N. At low temperature differences, radiation is small. At high temperature differences, radiation is much bigger. That's why the Earth (~270 K) isn't cooling much by radiation but the Sun (~5800 K) is heating stuff A LOT the same way.</p>
<p>Edit: changed variable names from K and C to M and N because K and C are used for temperatures elsewhere in the post!</p></div>		</li>

<p>But it's worth noting the amount of radiation flux emitted by Earth is almost exactly matched by the amount of radiation flux the Earth absorbs from sunlight - otherwise the global temperature would be changing very quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, vacuum is a tremendously good insulator for relatively cool objects like people and planets. As others have said, of the three modes of heat transfer radiation still works over vacuum (just consider the sun!) but crucially radiative flux increases as the <em>fourth</em> power of temperature! So a spacewalker’s main problem is overheating from the sun and their own exertion, a few millimeters of relatively poor vacuum keep coffee hot for hours in a thermos, but at 5500K every square meter of the sun’s surface radiates energy away about five orders of magnitude more effectively than the astronaut and your beverage.</p>
<p>But isn’t Earth’s core about as hot as the surface of the sun? Indeed, and that’s where the insulating effect of the rest of the planet comes in. If the core would somehow be stripped bare, it would initially shine just as brightly as the sun per unit area, but unlike the sun would quickly (in astronomical terms) radiate its heat away and cool to more manageable temperatures even in the presence of radioactive heating. But the initial fast cooling rate would still slow down fairly rapidly due to the fourth-power relationship between temperature and flux.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heat does travels in vacuum. The method is called radiation. That being said, air can be used as an insulator. This is achieved by creating a thin enough layer of air called stagnant air to ensure negligible air flow. If not, then the heat is transferred by the way of convection (carried by air).</p></div>		</li>
