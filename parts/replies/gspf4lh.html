			<div class="markdown"><p>Always? No and no. But it is much more likely that they will. For that matter, most of the planets in our solar system even rotate the same way, except for Venus and Uranus.</p>
<p>The reason basically boils down to conservation of angular momentum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. If the planets were formed in the system (the alternative being rogue planets that get gravitationally captured, which AFAIK we have no direct evidence of) then they well orbit in the same direction.</p>
<p>The planets can then rotate wildly, because it is vastly easier to change the direction of a spin than an orbit due to the amount of energy needed.</p>
<p>The best way to think of it is like this: take two particles orbiting a star. They have some common direction of motion (the average vector of centripetal motion, or angular momentum) that they will move in if you were to stick them together. Three particles stuck together will also then be moving with their net angular momentum vector. Extend this to trillions of particles, starting out in a spherical distribution. They slowly come together over time, forming planets. If all the particles formed one planet, then that planet WILL move with the total angular momentum vector of the initial set. Instead if you were to form 8 planets, those will average out to the net, but since each was itself an average of a vast number of particles then they will also be pretty similar to each other.</p>
<p>The rotation has to do with the mechanics of particles in slightly different radii orbits and how orbital mechanics works, but it boils down to the assumption that planets will rotate the same direction (again within some margin of error) . Venus and uranus break this by a lot (180° and 90° off axis), but that's because off collisions post formation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a matter of possibility, because it's definitely possible.</p>
<p>It's always a matter of probability.<br />
In a spinning system, are most things going to form in the plane of the spin? More than likely!<br />
Does that mean you can't have things out of the plane? Of course not - it's just less likely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Stars in a galaxy can migrate in and out, and this effect does have correlations to the stellar mass (larger stars drift out and smaller stars drift in), but it would billions of years for stars like our sun (8.5 kPc from center) to migrate to the halo, and larger stars don't survive that long.</p>
<p>The stars in the halo formed there, just a really long time ago.</p>
<p>Here's a really cool paper with some pretty graphics about the topic of galactic migration <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2015/06/aa25612-15.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2015/06/aa25612-15.pdf</a></p></div>		</li>
