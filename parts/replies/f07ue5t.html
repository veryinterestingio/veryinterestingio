			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all accurate in principle, but as an electrophysiologist I feel i should mention that plenty of neurons rest around - 60 to - 55mv. And while the depolarization threshold varies a bit by channel types expressed, I've never seen it as low as - 55mv, -35mv or higher is more typical.</p></div>		</li>

Thanks for sharing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only short term memories and current processing is held in the form of actively spreading electrical activity.</p>
<p>Your long term memories and skills are stored in the form of more or fewer receptor proteins in the cell walls of synapses, which would persist even if all the electrical signals &quot;rebooted&quot;</p>
<p>(Also in the form of cell connections and other things that would also persist)</p>
<p>Computer analogies are dicey, but it's vaguely similar to RAM vs hard drive. If your computer loses power, you lose your unsaved current work, but not all your long term files</p>
<p>I'd be more concerned with immediate heart/breathing problems possibly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that why during TMS sessions your face can twitch sometimes? My eyebrow would raise with every pulse and towards the middle of ever session, my tongue would try to dart out of my mouth.</p>
<p>I don't understand what TMS really does to your brain and unfortunately it wasn't successful for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TMS forces your neurones to depolarise in order to force connection - similar process to long-term potentiation.</p>
<p>What you are describing has been documented before (although not the tongue), happens in few cases.</p></div>		</li>
