<p>”Under normal reproductive processes, a species has each chromosome pair separated, copied, and paired back with its counterpart. The desert grassland whiptail lizard, however, has chromosome triplets where each triplet is paired with its copy rather than its counterparts. This reproductive method enables the asexual desert grassland whiptail lizard to have a genetic diversity previously thought to have been unique to sexually reproductive species.” From Wikipedia </p>

<p>Okay, I’m an AP Biology teacher (previous bench histologist) but this doesn’t make sense to me. How does triploidy lead to genetic diversity? Particularly when the chromosomes match up with the sister chromatids and not the homologous chromosomes from the opposite sex during meiosis. </p>
<p>I’m hoping a geneticist or a more advanced scientist is out there who can answer these questions for me cause this is fascinating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I'm confused too.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, you're confused as to how having the chromosome copy 3 times instead of 2 could lead to extra genetic diversity, correct?</p>
<p>Edit: it says &quot;both lizards&quot; in the Wikipedia article before that quote...so maybe you need a second lizard for reproduction, where both lizards act as males and females? I guess?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that’s exactly why I’m confused. Is there a crossover event that occurs between the three pairs? Is there some sort of recombinant made during replication? I need more info! My curiosity is insatiable at this point haha.</p>
<p>Edit to respond to your edit: I have no idea haha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Article from the citation says that when they reproduce, recombination occurs between sister chromosomes instead of homologous chromosomes. It appears that the basic mechanism is that cells are able to start with way more chromosomes in meiosis, which leads to a greater degree of recombination and a greater level of diversity in the end cells. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone else cited this article in another comment. I’m pouring over it rn, it’s a cool read, thank you for sharing. But the recombinant thing is what I was thinking too. Increase n, allow them to pair with sisters instead of homologues, more chances for various recombinations, various recombinations along offspring generations leads to heterogeneity. It’s just… such a <em>crazy</em> concept.</p></div>		</li>

<ul>
<li>Lutes, et al 2011 <em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3116429/" target="_blank">Laboratory synthesis of an independently reproducing vertebrate species</a></em></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/asexual-lizards/" target="_blank">article that the text you quoted from the wiki page referenced</a> may be more clear than the wiki page itself was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the researchers found that these species could maintain the diversity by never pairing their homologous chromosomes (as sexual species do by taking one set of chromosomes from each parent) but rather by combining their sister chromosomes instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That <em>Scientific American</em> article is, in turn, referencing the following paper which is where the details should be found:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These are all <em>fantastic</em> sources! Thank you for sharing. I particularly enjoyed the first publication where they discussed how these species evolved in the first place.  As always, Scientific American nails it as well. What an endlessly fascinating topic, thank you for expanding my understanding.</p></div>		</li>
