<p>Sligthtly inacurate or misleading. There can be new observations that require a radical change of model, but the new model will still need to explain all that the old model explained and then some. We would still need to explain all the facts u/Astrokiwi listed that led to the conclusion of the big bang.</p>
<p>And astronomy is a rather mature science. When the science is relatively new, like we have with psychology or sociology, new discoveries can lead to dramatic paradigm shifts where the new model is barely recognizable from the old one, but with sciences that are more mature, where plenty of facts have already been established and recorded, the variation from one model to another, while very impactful, are rarely resulting into something radically different. For example, while relativity made a huge difference in how we understood the universe, Newtonian mechanics is still very much taught because it's still accurate enough and much simpler.</p></div>		</li>
