<p>Theoretically possible, but that’s not actually planned, is it? Using the expendable Space Launch System to send people to the ISS seems like a huge waste of resources.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. Orion on SLS would be a &quot;last resort&quot; ISS crew transport, and I'm not sure if it's even officially under consideration any more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked on Orion for 3 years starting when we still had plans to go to the ISS up until last year when we no longer did. At the moment no Orion missions have plans to rendezvous with the ISS but it does have that capability. Likely any SLS launch to the ISS would carry both Orion and cargo because SLS has such a heavy lift capability.</p>
<p>The way it is designed is for SLS to get Orion into Earth orbit and Orion’s service module gets us to lunar orbit. That is why Orion is different from other capsules because we have a robust in-space propulsion system whereas dragon, Soyuz and starliner do not match it. SLS is a bit overkill if only launching Orion without cargo and we toyed with the idea of launching it via Delta IV heavy in case SLS was going to be seriously delayed but in short things weren’t going to fit right etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would freeze-dry all the interior, so RIP all the biology experiments, and the wet chemistry and material-science work. Some of the soft furnishings would also likely be too brittle to recover if left for too long.</p>
<p>ISS is a leaky tub, so with nobody around to switch in new air bottles it would <em>very gradually</em> leak all the way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are electronics that are air air cooled that would need to be shut down. Any water systems would likely freeze or leak away. It would be a bit of work to get the bathroom and kitchen back to working order.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would probably be much harder to fix, because if all air empties from the inside, you need to send people with pressurized suits to fix it instead of just having someone onboard put a piece of tape over the hole</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it was the kind of leak that could normally be filled by a person with a piece of tape, couldn't they let the leak happen, then just before a new crew came re-pressurize the ISS?</p>
<p>I assume that they have enough compressed air to re-pressurize? Or is all air recycled?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest fear I had back then was, the moment it's without crew it stops being impossible to get rid of.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh we'll spend a billion dollars next year...&quot; Next year... Next year...</p>
<p>Until it's no longer valuable, or deorbits.</p>
<p>But as long as there's butts in spacesuits it's mandatory... And it should be mandatory</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's going to be interesting once space travel becomes more accessible. Do the same salvage rights existing now go forward? Who will own the Apollo 11 site and remains? Can you just swipe non-functioning satellites to recycle? If a large mass is moved to a Lagrange point to mine and is abandoned whose responsibility is it? I just hope I will be alive when these questions are pertinent.</p></div>		</li>
