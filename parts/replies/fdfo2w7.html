			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to the sweetness and natural vanilla flavor of bourbon - at least in OP's given context - is the temperature of the substance being consumed (milkshake). There's been some evidence that consuming foods at colder temperatures affects the intensity of their flavor. The coldness of the milkshake is likely dulling the intensity of the bourbon, so what is perceived more is the vanilla rather than the bitter wood tannins.</p>

<p>This is also very much at play in the great Ice in Whisk(e)y Debate, but that's a whole other kettle of fish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's awesome, I'd never heard of this phenomenon. I just dug up a great article explaining the chemical reactions involved with charred oak and whisky, check this out  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-34204-1" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-34204-1" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-34204-1</a></a> . All this bourbon talk just made me go pour two fingers of Jefferson's Reserve. Cheers!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to look this up, because I would have sworn there is some sugar in it... but you're right, in a way, there are no sugars or carbohydrates in distilled alcohol. That's interesting. However, I'd imagine that bourbon does contain undigestible sugars extruded from the oak's polysaccharides, but polysaccarides are often flavorless. Reading further into it, it seems the charring of wood breaks down the polysaccharides and allows the penetration of sugars into the distillate. Super fascinating chemical science behind a practice that's almost 200 years old. Here's an awesome science article describing the practice <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-34204-1" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-34204-1" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-34204-1</a></a></p></div>		</li>
