			<div class="markdown"><p>This is entirely it. There's a lot of languages going around my in laws at any given moment and just being around them I picked up a lot more Spanish and Ukrainian. I can HEAR conversations, pick out key words, use context to figure some out, but I can not speak very well in either language. </p>
<p>I can't speak well in my first language so maybe not the best example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean I feel like a huge part you touched on which is so true is our brain. Our brains are little cheaters when it comes to things. It does a great job when reading or listening at just identify parts of things and guessing the rest. When you hear someone say something and you think that’s not right and ask them to clarify and they say it again but it makes sense. That was your brain taking a bad guess. So if you are listening to someone talk in a foreign language and you only know 5 of the 10 words your brain is already used to filling in the rest so it makes sense. </p>
<p>Compared to actively speaking where your brain has to translate each word ahead of time</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This so much. I have traveled to a few Spanish speaking countries and I barely speak any Spanish at all. I get by, though.</p>
<p>I can understand it reasonably well, to the point that when someone talks to me, I can basically understand what they're telling me — I'll miss some words, but I get the message and understand how much something costs or whatever. Basics. When it comes to actually responding, though, I'm basically an infant piecing words together. I can't conjugate for shit, I only speak in the present tense like a caveman. </p>
<p>My brain has enough pieces of the language that I can fill in most of the gaps, but since I can't fill in enough of those gaps, I can't communicate very much to anyone else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is especially true when it comes to different conjugations, tenses, and other grammar concepts. I can listen to a sentence and pick up the gist of it by knowing many of the words, and maybe in one word I catch what tense the verb is in, so I can understand the story is in past tense, but if I’m the one speaking, I feel pressure to conjugate each word properly, get subject/verb agreement and plurality all correct, and be prepared to handle exceptions to grammar rules, all in addition to pronunciation challenges.  </p>
<p>I also found it hard to learn to speak other languages as a native English speaker, even when I’m in the country where that is the native language, because there are so many people who speak English and they either want to help out by speaking your language, or there is social value put on being fluent in English so they want to show they are fluent or get their own practice, or sometimes they’re just not wanting to wait while you stumble through it (especially in transactional interactions like shopping). Learning to understand and read other languages, especially in immersion situations, is so much easier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m somewhat conversational in Spanish but not fluent. I understand more than I understand, especially if it’s the dialect I’ve been exposed to the most. I’ve had a conversation with a Spanish speaker who’s English was about as good as my Spanish. We just spoke back and forth in our native language and we had no communication issues. Much easier to get the gist of a sentence than to speak although I will say trying to speak helps. I learn a lot just by being corrected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My brother can understand polish almost fluently, but has never been able to speak it. His mom would usually communicate to him in polish because she wanted him to know it, but he never picked up speaking it. Same way a buddy of mine can completely understand Spanish but can't speak it for shit, he's basically a running joke in his Puerto Rican family because he can't speak Spanish nor can he dance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned 4 languages, my native English,  then Spanish, French, and Arabic.
I learned more from screwing up languages and being corrected than any other way. (Funny thing though no matter what I ALWAYS swear in English.)
Humans learn best by screwing up.  Having to fix the screw up is the best way I've found.
I've been laughed at for saying something wrong, or sounding like a 5 yr old. But usually the native speakers find it endearing that an American has taken the time to at least try to learn their language. And are happy to correct.
It helps that I don't give a shit if I sound stupid. I just want to learn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes - partly - but also because you don't actually have to &quot;know&quot; much of a language to understand the gist of it.  Your brain can fill in blanks if you know important things as long as you understand the context of the situation - which is one of the reasons people find it difficult to listen to the radio in a language they dont really understand well but can follow a film quite easily.</p>
<p>By contrast - when you speak, you're not actually able to make intelligible sense unless you know and understand the grammatical rules of the language (or you speak caveman style - &quot;me eat&quot; &quot;me hunger&quot; etc).  You dont need those rules to guess what is going on - you might get it wrong on occasion  but youre social context brain SHOULD be able to let you guess largely what is happening.</p></div>		</li>
