			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. It's okay to fall asleep but outside of a doctor inducing it, unconsciousness is generally a bad thing. For instance a person who drinks too much and &quot;passes out&quot; is a very different thing from a person that takes a blow to the head and loses consciousness, even aside from the possible physical damage. </p>
<p>Outside of anesthesia, there are not many opportunities where loss of consciousness is not pointing to a serious, even life threatening, problem.</p>
<p>To put it another way, if a person becomes unconscious and can't be roused, someone should call for medical help pdq.</p></div>		</li>
