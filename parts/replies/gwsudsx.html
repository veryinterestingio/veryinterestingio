			<div class="markdown"><p>I am no expert, but what I found is that many media sites divvy up the video in slices of 10 to 20 seconds and stream them via different servers or addresses  in order to make the pirating of the videos harder.</p>
<p>The player in the front end handles the stream from multiple CDNs and stiches the video snippets back together seamlessly, so the user experience is not affected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I miss when YouTube sent you the whole video, as I could then load the whole video up and show or watch it offline.</p>
<p>Or if you've got bad internet you could load it all and then not worry about loading</p></div>		</li>
