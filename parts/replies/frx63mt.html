			<div class="markdown"><p>The immune system is a really complex system of interactions that can behave unpredictably.  It is constantly trying to distinguish ‚Äúself‚Äù cells/proteins/bacteria from ‚Äúnot self.‚Äù  Occasionally it gets riled up like a mob roaming the streets with torches and pitchforks and decides that this ‚Äúone thing‚Äù is what it hates most regardless of that thing‚Äôs innocence.  </p>
<p>For instance, there‚Äôs a species of tick in the US called the Lone Star Tick native native to the southeast.  For a few people, after being bitten by this tick they develop sometimes dangerous allergies to red meat due to the bodies reaction and how it then reacts to the proteins/sugars in red meat from then on.  You could spend your whole life eating steak and hamburgers, go on a nature hike, find a tick on you, and then be allergic forever.</p>
<p>The complexity of the system itself is what makes autoimmune disorders so beastly to treat and manage.  The body is attacking itself as if it were foreign.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought this might also happen when you get stung by a bee, like not the red meat part but I have heard that if you get stung once you might not have an allergic reaction but that afterwards if you get stung again your far more likely to have a deadly reaction to it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs going on.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a little like when you are insulted by a person and you can‚Äôt think of a witty comeback at the time, so in your head you spend the next two weeks coming up with hundreds of different ones, but then when you see that person again you try and say them all at once.  Even though it sounded great in your head, you mix them up and look like a bigger idiot than before.  </p>
<p>Allergic reactions are the body doing that, except with things that cause itchiness and swelling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Body is constantly changing and some information gets lost in the mix up. Think building a building and renovating it every day to be the exact same, at some point you're gonna miss something. You are also doing new things, so something that you didn't come in contact enough as a child to notice an allergy you could have been allergic to all along, but, never noticed because lets say you didn't like fish as a kid and now your alright with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah thank you. Makes sense as most of the things I have serious allergies to are things I never would have eaten as a kid - mushrooms, arugula, coconut oil. I have a gluten allergy too that came out of the blue when I was in college but the other stuff makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd love to know this too. Yesterday I went into anaphylaxis for the first time in my 31 years. No idea what it was in reaction to, so now I've got a snazzy new epipen to carry with my everywhere from now on üôÉ</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Be well friend!  I experienced a severe anaphylactic reaction last year (apparently after 39 years, my body now hates buckwheat!).  I felt really weird about it for a long time after that experience--like I was this ticking time bomb.  I don't know what your situation is, but do make an appointment with an allergist if you haven't already so they can help sort out what you reacted to (so you can avoid it!).  Take care of yourself!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thankyou, I know what you mean feeling like a ticking timebomb, especially because I don't know what caused it. </p>
<p>But I'll be making a gp appointment for a checkup and referral to an allergist today sometime. Hope you're doing well too! :)</p></div>		</li>
