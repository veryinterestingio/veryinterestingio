			<div class="markdown"><p>Concur re hive strength being a key. Ants can really vex a hive once they get in and get a reward. Beekeepers may then have to take measures (moats around hive feet or axle grease on hivestand) to keep ants out.  Hi5 fellow beeks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not terribly hard, bees are pretty much self-sustaining. You're looking at maybe a couple of hours a week of maintenance and monitoring. </p>
<p>As an inexperienced beekeeper though, there are warning signs you might miss. Just gotta do your research, maybe find a local beekeeper that would be willing to let you come along for hive inspections, watch YouTube videos, that kind of thing. </p>
<p>Also don't get discouraged if you lose a hive. It happens, and that's just more experience under your belt, so you know what to look for next time.</p></div>		</li>
