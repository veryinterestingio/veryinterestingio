			<div class="markdown"><p>What's the difference in something like chicken pox then?
Once you get it, you will never get it again.
But it's been around for a long time and was a common childhood illness to get, so wouldn't it have different variations and strains by now?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once you get chicken pox, you have it for life. It lies dormant in neurons where the immune system cannot reach it.</p>
<p>Chicken pox is a virus from the herpes family. The others also permanently infect humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So chicken pox has a DNA genome where influenza and SARS-Cov2 are single stranded RNA viruses. RNA is much more susceptible to mutations than DNA, so that's why we see all of these variants with influenza and SARS-COV2 and not chicken pox.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The influenza viruses are actually some of the most unstable viruses and they mutate constantly, but that is more an exception instead of a rule.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only do influenza viruses mutate, but the influenza genome is made up eight separate pieces of RNA.</p>
<p>This allows the pieces to get shuffled into different combinations should an organism get infected with more than one virus.</p>
<p>It is for this reason why we get so concerned about flu in birds and pigs - because of the risk of a shuffled virus emerging that is particularly deadly.</p>
<p>For example, influenza viruses associated with birds tend to be highly pathogenic when they get into the human population. But, they don't spread very well from person to person. But if a virus that's good a spreading from person to person and a highly pathogenic bird flu virus both get into a pig, there's a risk of a shuffled virus emerging that's both highly pathogenic AND good at spreading between people.</p></div>		</li>
