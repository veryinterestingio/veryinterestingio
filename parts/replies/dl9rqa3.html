			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not. As someone else already eluded, stroke and/or excessive clotting (deep vein thrombosis) and general cardiac complications are more likely. Increased RBC count has no known biologic link to cancer. Now, an increased WBC count <em>could</em> indicate that an infection or growth (malignant or benign) may be present. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably more to do with the fact that your body has to deal with the increased breakdown of RBCs older than 120 days, and the liver is put through more stress trying to process the bilirubin. </p></div>		</li>

<li>He admitted to using EPO (erythropoietin or Procrit)</li>
<li>Erythropoietin causes increased production of red blood cells. It's a GROWTH FACTOR. It enhances tumor angiogenesis &amp; affects the receptor sites &amp; can cause cancer where those receptor sites are found. Brain &amp; Nut, (and cervical....good post for another time(??)for those following along. Even just simply transfusing in extra red blood cells can bring along this nifty hormone produced by the kidney. </li>
<li>Yes ~ thicker blood leads to big time blood clot &amp; stoke problems, but I thought it rather obvious that we were talking about Lance Armstrong. ?</li>
<li>It's in my nursing textbook.</li>
<li>
<p>If your not in the medical field, and don't know why they no longer use Procrit like they used to, or can't be bothered to google the interview where Lance straight up told Oprah he used EPO (Procrit), the NIH has awesome articles on it at - doi:  10.3389/fimmu.2014.00563</p>
<p>Bring a dictionary when you read it, it's got big words. </p>
