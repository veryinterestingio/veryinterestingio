The first round petered out because it was too aggressive and killed people within a few weeks. The second round was the syphilis we know and love today that slowly turns your brain to mush after a few decades.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Unfortunately, his work is heavily based on Gun Germs and Steel, which is not held in any high regard by actual historical professionals. The author is often accused of cherry-picking his data</p>
<p>If you wanna dive deeper into the rabbit hole, AskHistorians has several long posts like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2xjnwr/how_much_of_guns_germs_and_steel_is_historically/cp0q9jn/" target="_blank">this one</a> about it</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The short of it is that its just complicated, and there's competing theories why there were less diseases available to jump back to Europe and the honest answer is that we don't truly know. Denser population hubs probably contributed. But accusing livestock for all of it it is oversimplifying to the point of just being wrong.</p>
<p>The second linked post goes through many diseases, their origins and also touches on this issue. It notes that after european arrival and the Aztec collapse due to the first epidemic and civil war they were ravaged by a second disease called cocoliztli, which we think was native (though this is also uncertain). It seemingly never made it to europe.</p>
<p>Why? where Europeans perhaps immune, or maybe since they were the one sailing, all the ill patients dying on the long journey preventing it from ever making landfall, or perhaps disease required a climate that just didn't allow it to migrate. We don't know, its complicated.</p>
<p>this is essentially the fun thing about Guns germs and steel, and its ultimate downfall. It presents another way of thinking about history for a lot of people than just &quot;Leader Y did X&quot; (Also known as great man history) but presents its ideas as actual answers, not as one of many factors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You left out the most important part: because of living next to all this livestock, Europeans developed andibodies against these diseases while the Native Americans didn't (because of lack of exposure). So any Europeans could easily transmit the diseases they carried with them to the Native Americans without getting sick themselves.</p></div>		</li>
