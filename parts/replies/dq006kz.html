			<div class="markdown"><p>Alright and I would like to provide the ELI10 expansion of this discussion:</p>
<p>In the world of atoms, electrons are shared and traded to satisfy the preferences of each atom when making a molecule. Their preferences are called &quot;electronegativity&quot;, and hydrogen atoms tend to be givers of electrons while oxygen is very prone to taking them (we would call oxygen electronegative). </p>
<p>Water is a very stable molecule because it is just oxygen, a taker, bound to 2 hydrogens, the givers. But in H2O2 the two oxygens have a bond together, meaning they are both having to lend the other an electron. Two electronegative atoms aren't very happy because it is a constant tug of war for those electrons. So at the earliest opportunity, one or both of the oxygens will break away and form a new bond with a better giver atom to form a different, stable molecule.</p>
<p>So H2O2 (and this is a trait of all peroxides, where oxygens are bonded together) is a highly reactive species, and will react as the commentor above described.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Atoms in a molecule are like legos. You put legos together to make a lot of different stuff, right? Even though they're the same legos, depending on the way you put 'em together, you get completely different things. In this case, you've not only got extra legos, but you've also put them together in a special way. Let's say 'water' is like putting the legos together into a triangle. You can't really do anything with the triangle, it's just a triangle. But hydrogen peroxide is like making the legos into a set of wings. Now you can put that pair of wings onto anything, and make it a flying thing. And then it attaches to all your cells. Your cells fly away to heaven and that's why it's dangerous. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not specifically oxygen that they bind to.  A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox" target="_blank">redox reaction</a> is the usual way that people learn about this in school.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Oxidation</strong> is the loss of electrons or an increase in oxidation state by a molecule, atom, or ion. <strong>Reduction</strong> is the gain of electrons or a decrease in oxidation state by a molecule, atom, or ion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Antioxidants basically mitigate the free radicals that are caused by electron states and configurations that lead to reactive and potentially damaging chemical reactions. It does not explicitly have anything to do with oxygen, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, kinda. But there is only very limited evidence that any antioxidants you eat or drink (basically anything strongly colored fits the bill here) have an effect in the body. So the whole superfood rich in antioxidants thing should be taken with a pinch of salt. A small one, as sodium will kill you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For another fun example of the same principle, have a look at how acids work.</p>
<p>They have excess protons (H+ ions) that they can give off when they come into contact with other compounds. This can break apart chemical bonds in the receiving molecules. This can cause drastic changes in the the function of the affected molecule and even create new compounds with functions of their own.</p></div>		</li>
