			<div class="markdown"><p>Minor blood vessels don't need to be fixed; there is enough blood flow from other small vessels nearby (&quot;[collateral circulation] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_circulation" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_circulation</a>)&quot;). The healing tissue in the area will also release hormones that cause <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis" target="_blank">new blood vessels to grow</a>.</p>
<p>Major blood vessels may clamped in a non-destructive way so that they can just be released when the surgery is done (e.g. the aorta may be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_cross-clamp" target="_blank">clamped</a> briefly during certain types of heart surgery, and then unclamped to allow blood to flow again), or, if they must be cut through (e.g. due to trauma or an organ transplant), they can be reconnected with very tiny sutures (a procedure called <a href="https://www.mercy.com/health-care-services/heart-vascular/treatments/vascular-anastomosis" target="_blank">vascular anastomosis</a>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  Another example is for kidney cancers.   You clamp the main artery coming into the kidney.   You have about 20min to cut the sucker out and close the hole so it doesn’t bleed or leak.  Unclamp and prey.l to your deity of choice.    Generally no long term permanent damage if you can get it under 20min.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is only sort of half true. Anesthesia, if you mean the drugs themselves, don’t slow bleeding but Anesthesia, the team of doctors that control the drugs that chemically immobilize you for surgery can absolutely lower your blood pressure and that slows bleeding. </p>
<p>In the surgeries I’m in they aim for a MAP of 80, if possible, to prevent excessive bleeding but not be in danger of an arrest or poor profusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lights are no joke. </p>
<p>When I was giving birth in a labor and delivery suite, I felt like I was on fire when we got to the pushing stage and they brought out the super bright light. For one of the births my husband was deployed so I thought it would be nice to have the grandmothers in the room so they could experience the moment, since it was already impossible to have that privately with my husband. I was so hot during pushing that I threw my gown across the room and gave birth completely naked in front of my judgemental mother in law. </p>
<p>I would have appreciated the temps of an OR.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have minor medical training, but anesthesia might slightly lower the blood pressure (less pressure means less flow), but I wouldn't think that it's super significant. </p>
<p>The truth is that surgery is a little bloody, but the surgeons use a mixed of staples and heat to prevent major bleeding.</p>
<p>Also a 180lbs adult male can lose around 2 liters of blood and live (your experience may vary).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anesthesia providers are constantly balancing the blood pressure. Depending on the surgery the surgeon will sometimes even ask them to reduce the BP to the lowest safe level to reduce bleeding. That number of course can be subjective to the patient and requires close monitoring. There are several medications that will directly increase and decrease the BP. </p>
<p>The anesthesia providers that are more practiced will avoid going too far on decreasing the BP and then having to compensate with the opposite medication. You can always give more of a medication but once you've given it there is no taking it back. I'd even go so far as to call it an art to having such a deep understanding of the dosages and impact on the patient versus their age, gender and medical history and applying it well.</p></div>		</li>
