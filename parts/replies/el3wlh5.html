			<div class="markdown"><p>This sort of thing is incentivized by the way import taxes work too. You want to import parts, not finished goods. Plenty of books get printed overseas, but you better do the binding here. It's all a dumb game.</p>
<p>edit: side note--the &quot;made in the usa&quot; thing is so shortsighted it's laughable. It's just not a thing that really exists at all. We live in a globalized economy. You can hardly make <em>anything</em> without foreign goods or tools. Especially if you're trying to compete with international prices. </p>
<p>I understand some of the sentiment--employ your neighbors. But it's so out of touch that it's essentially just old men yelling at clouds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imported pickup trucks and vans in the US are done that way to get around steep import taxes. The Ford Transit Connect is shipped to the US as a passenger van then they rip the rear seats out once it gets here to sell it as a cargo van and avoid the taxes. Toyota used to do most of the building on Tacomas in Japan, then send the mostly assembled trucks to the US for final assembly also dodging the tax.</p></div>		</li>
