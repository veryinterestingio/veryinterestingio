			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't need anywhere near the space and depth that Google uses to index files on a regular user's system. The freeware program &quot;Everything&quot; can do it for you on Windows, today. You can have instant searches of all your files like magic.</p>
<p>The real question is &quot;why don't they program that feature into Windows&quot;, and the answer is basically that it's too hard for them. It would require doing so much work it's cheaper just to let everyone complain.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Does Everything search file contents?
Yes, &quot;Everything&quot; can search file content with the content: search function.</p>
<p>File content is not indexed, searching content is slow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everything is not actually building an index of file contents. It is only doing an index of basic file metadata. If you're trying to search for a file that contains specific keywords inside of it, it will be incredibly slow. </p>
<p>The only major difference is that Windows only indexes directories where it expects users to store data (The Libraries directories, such as Documents, Pictures, etc). Doing a search outside of that takes longer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A fresh install of Windows 10 (about 120,000 files) will use about 14 MB of ram and less than 9 MB of disk space.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is built in, but they really restrict which files get indexed due to storage and performance hits from performing indexing operations. If you open the search settings you can see which folders are indexed and which ones are excluded. By default it looks like it only indexes the library folders and the desktop.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The third party program &quot;Everything&quot; can find you all files on the drive instantly while you type without having to lose space for indexing</p></div>		</li>
