			<div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s one of the simplest fermented beverages to make. The only required ingredients are honey, water and yeast. It needs to age for 6-12 months after fermenting in order for it to actually taste decent though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally, you don't even need to add yeast as there will be natural yeast within the honey already (just dormant, as it can't grow in those conditions).</p>
<p>This is a proof of how antiseptic honey is - it is full of microorganisms and doesn't rot. It's also why you shouldn't feed honey to babies; there can be botulism spores in there that activate when they're in the more dilute environment of the baby's gut.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually meadmaking involves heating the water/honey mixture to boiling for 30 minutes to an hour to kill the microorganisms present, to ensure that <em>only</em> yeast grows in the wort, and to help dissolve the sugars into the water. Pitching a specific strain also helps with quality control. You could just add warm water and hope for the best, but you wont have much control over the final product, and your mead could succumb to a bacterial infection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah yes, that sounds preferable. I guess that the first ever batches of mead were probably discovered my way, then subsequently refined to yours. Imagine the conversation:</p>
<p>Caveman 1: this stuff is like the most delicious stuff I've ever tasted!</p>
<p>Caveman 2: wait until you see what happens if you mix it with water and wait a week. Tastes okay but makes you feel brilliant... Until the next day!</p></div>		</li>
