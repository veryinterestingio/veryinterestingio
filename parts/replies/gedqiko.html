			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember right, DoD is also limited by the 80/20 rule:<br />
You can't obligate more than 20% of your appropriated funds within the last two months of the fiscal year.<br />
This promotes healthier budgeting, because purchases must be started earlier in the fiscal year.<br />
Too much too early and you won't have enough for the end.<br />
Too much too late and you forfeit that money.</p>
<p>Still promotes some level of frivolous spending, but no big (unplanned) end-of-year purchases.</p>
<p>That being said, the military hasn't been successfully audited (by GAAP) in... decades?  </p>
<p>That's not to say they've received a qualified audit (bad audit*), but that they can't even be audited because their paperwork is never in order.</p>
<p>Edit * &quot;bad&quot; as in they found discrepancies</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The last 2 months of the fiscal year makes up 17% of the fiscal year. You would be pretty close to the 20% limit even if you were level loaded.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like an easy fix for the whole process would be to classify spending, and build a projection to figure out what you're likely to spend, and then add 10% or so. Take that info to whoever distributes the budget and say &quot;this is what we spent this year, of that X dollars are mandatory monthly operating costs, X dollars were for equipment/large expenditures. Next year we won't have those big expenses again BUT we will have these other large expenses in this area&quot;.</p>
<p>Communication, people. Get on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds right until you consider that this isn't just furniture we're talking about. We're also talking about frivolously and unnecessarily spending billions upon billions of tax-payer dollars on ridiculous bullshit projects the military DOES NOT NEED. Source: I work for a DoD contractor. I am on the receiving end of these dollars.</p></div>		</li>
