			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, many chemicals can act as oxidisers. A good example of an elemental oxidiser other than oxygen is fluorine, which is in fact a much better oxidiser than even oxygen itself, due to having the highest electronegativity of any element. Combustion (burning) is simply rapid exothermic oxidation, what the oxidiser is doesn't matter.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want elements or compounds, there isn't one, as far as I know. Oxygen is the second strongest oxidiser after fluorine. However, if you accept things other than elements or compounds, I can give you a treat.</p>
<p>IUPAC defines oxidation as &quot;the complete net removal of one or more electrons from a molecular entity.&quot; Usually, that refers to a different molecular entity tearing it away. But what about complete annihilation of an electron by an <em>anti-electron</em>? I am, of course, talking about the mighty <strong>positron</strong>. If you do some fancy physics math (or read how it's been done <a href="https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/102502/what-is-the-strongest-oxidising-agent" target="_blank">here</a> (seriously, read it)), you'll see that the effective reduction potential of a positron is +2166413 V, a bit over 773000 times stronger than fluorine. That's the strongest currently existing oxidising agent, stronger than any known stripped superheavy atom, and maybe the strongest one possible. A stripped atom of unsepttrium (element 173) would be stronger though, and that element may very well be synthesisable in the (very, <em>very</em> far) future</p></div>		</li>
