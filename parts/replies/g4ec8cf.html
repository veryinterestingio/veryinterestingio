			<div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s a lot more than simply guessing based on wind speed. For instance, burned grass will lay down/curl in the direction the fire approached from. So you can follow where the grass is pointing like an arrow, to see where the fire came from.</p>
<p>Investigators need to have a huge amount of knowledge on how well/fast certain materials burn. They need to know how those materials will burn, so they can make reasonable estimations. Many things will burn or warp predictably when exposed to flame, so you have to use that to your advantage when tracking down the origin of a fire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best answer so far. You track likely source locations based on the history of the fire, then search for evidence of what started the burn. Unlike in a well-managed campfire where all you have is ash, most forest fires leave a lot behind. The grass and small sticks are dead char, but they aren't atomized. You can see the direction of the fire's movements based on the ways they bent as they burned. No one piece will tell you, but a consensus can be made. Once you find a likely center you look for evidence of what caused, and also evidence against. </p>
<p>Fabric and glass/metal containers use to accelerate the start of a burn don't fully incinerate, even fabric won't completely burn off. </p>
<p>Lightning leaves distinctive patterns in trees when it strikes. While that may burn off, it's likely/possible that the fire wasn't hot enough at the start in order to completely burn it all off. </p>
<p>Chemical traces remain in the soil and debris. Not enough for a human, but a lab can look to identify any evidence of abnormal chemicals at the estimated source.</p>
<p>Weather helps as well. The main causes of forest fires are lightning, people, freak accidents (spontaneous ignition of decomposing matter never happens unless it does), and more people. Weather is tracked and monitored worldwide. While you can't get the precise location lightning landed, you can learn if a storm produced lightning. As you say, a lot of this is deduction logic and removal of possibilities so that works to remove a likely option. </p>
<p>Location, location. location. If a forest fire is set off by a person, they likely didn't do it to die. This means that the start will be nearby (within a fairly short distance at least) a road. If it's a dirt road, and most fire roads and backcountry access roads are, then there may be evidence of recent tire tracks. If it's close to a paved road then the maybe some evidence of a car pulling off the road, or making a turn that had tires off the road. Not all human-caused fires are malicious, if the location is near a camp, maintained, or popular backpacking, there may be evidence of a smaller human-controlled fire that reignited later. In this case, there will be evidence of humans nearby, stakes left in the ground, buried poop, moved debris, clearing out sections of ground for a tent, and so on.</p>
<p>Thermal imagery can help as well. If you dig down a few inches you can see evidence of heat slowly working into the ground from the fire. Using that you can work out any changes in temperature over time to get an idea of where some abnormally cool areas are. Most fires only burn an area once and get hotter as they move. So an abnormally cool spot near the center can point you in the right direction.</p>
<p>That's all I know, hope it helps. If you make a fire while camping, especially if there's no fire pit, make sure to clear out all flammable bits on the ground within around 15 feet of the fire, and before you say it's out you should be able to stick your hand into the ashes without pain or feeling hot.  Pouring water on the fire until the steam stops isn't enough. I've personally seen ashes and cinders re-ignite the next afternoon when a strong wind blew over the coals and pushed the ash off the top.</p></div>		</li>
