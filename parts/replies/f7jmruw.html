			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly enough the Navy still uses this in a sense to determine how long someone can stand watch in an engine room. We use one of two (but probably more, I’ve just use two) meters, RSS-220 and questemp 48, to determine a WBGT which is a wet bulb global temperature. It takes into account the wet bulb(evaporative cooling, global temp (radiant heating), and dry bulb (temp off a normal thermometer), and puts them in a ratio to get the WBGT.</p>
<p>This only works for heat and not for cold as far as the US Navy is concerned. For more reading look up OPNAV 5100.19 and search the PDF for “heat stress”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was fascinated the first time I saw this on my first deployment. There were three thermometers, one dry, one wet, and one in shade. There was even a little chart on the kit that explained how to make the measurements. I thought it was one of more awesome things I saw.</p>
<p>Also, I'm a huge science nerd. Advanced weapons and explosives, nah... let me see your wetbulb kit... uuuunnnnf!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We had 12 to 18 watch stations that took 10-20 minutes each for the meter to stabilize, so it was pretty much continuous readings. Also our stay times(cool down time per hour) were ignored.</p>
<p>Edit: I’m curious how the water intake calculations work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wet bulb cannot be a higher temperature than dry bulb. If the temperatures are equal, than the relative humidity is 100%. Air cannot physically hold more than 100% humidity. That is why wet bulb temperature can only be less than or equal to dry bulb temperature. </p>
<p>A psychometric chart may cause you to go cross eyed while looking at it, but it’s worth looking up if you want to understand latent heat transfer/psychometrics/meteorology basics.</p></div>		</li>
