			<div class="markdown"><p>That is indeed a big issue in the field but it's not that simple, precisely because it would be easy. Even if they're not a scam, most startups fail, so investors tend to have all kinds of metrics and mechanics to evaluate their activities. </p>
<p>Of course at the end of the day, you never know for sure and you always have to take some degree of a leap of faith. You would think they learned the lesson during the dot com bubble, but to this day, there's been plenty of multi-million and sometimes billion dollar deals that go nowhere because of an overconfident (or straight up lying) entrepreneur being able to swindle investors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Investors don’t have to be outside ones (VC, angel, etc.). A startup can also be bootstrapped—funded by the founders.</p>
<p>The line between a bootstrapped startup and a small business can be fuzzy. I work for an online travel booking site that started with a unique and novel idea that was fairly disruptive to one segment of the travel industry. It operated at a loss for the first several years but has seen significant growth over the last several years (not anything on the level of Airbnb or Uber, unfortunately). I would say that it started out as a bootstrapped startup that has become a healthy, profitable small business (calling it a small business feels weird, though, because even though there are only 15 employees, we serve several hundred thousand customers a month).</p></div>		</li>
