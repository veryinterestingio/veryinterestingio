			<div class="markdown"><p>The other great example of mammalian convergent-but-divergent cell specialization is melanocytes in skin forming from the same population that would become dopamine-producing neurons. Thus many of those dopaminergic cells exist in the brain’s <em>substantia negra</em>, where melanin is produced as a byproduct of dopamine.</p>
<p>I don’t know that I’ve chosen good terms to describe these interesting cell-line relationships.</p></div>		</li>
