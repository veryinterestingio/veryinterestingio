			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add, the primary EAS station for a lot of areas is an AM radio station, so right from the start, there's going to be some quality issues. </p>
<p>Also, the message typically isn't recorded and then played back. The EAS equipment, once it receives the digital copy of the alert and determines it's included in it, takes over the broadcast and airs whatever's on the primary station, until it hears an End of Message signal. This means it can be a generated message, or a live press conference from an official.</p>
<p>This works great....  until somebody uses the data bursts and attention tones in a commercial on the primary station. And every TV and radio station in the area immediately begins rebroadcasting that station, until it hears the End of Message signal. Which never comes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely nothing at all. There is no reason this wouldn't work as you described. In fact, it's happened twice, just not with EAS tones. Look up the Max Headroom broadcast signal intrusion incident, and the Captain Midnight broadcast signal intrusion incident. </p>
<p>All you gotta do is turn it off before FCC inspectors start driving around to find you.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>There's nothing <em>preventing</em> someone from doing that (and, in fact, there have been many occurrences of someone 'hijacking' a TV broadcast as a prank or a social/religious/political stunt -- see  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_signal_intrusion" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast\_signal\_intrusion" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast\_signal\_intrusion</a></a> ); the only real technological restriction is that the equipment has to be powerful enough to override the broadcast signal, and equipment with that kind of power is not particularly easy to obtain, unless you already know what you're looking for.</p>
<p>And, of course, like GNUr000t said, you need to turn it off before the FCC starts looking for you -- equipment that's powerful enough to override a television transmitter usually creates an sizable signal footprint that anyone with the right hardware can follow back to the source.  That's one of the reasons that most broadcast intrusions only stay online for a minute or so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a live rebroadcast, there's a machine called an ENDEC that monitors the EAS origination stations. When message tones are received, it begins recording until end of message tones are heard. It can only rebroadcast once those end tones are received. Maximum message length is a little over two minutes.</p>
<p>I ran the board at a primary entry point station for over 8 years and sent hundreds of EAS Alerts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if I recorded a message I wanted played and inserted the correct tones at the beginning and end, would I have to get a primary entry point to catch it and pass it on or could I send it to any point and it would get passed on?</p>
<p>In other words, is there a technological restriction where other stations know who the primary is and won't pass on signals not originating from there?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The important factor is why they use AM though.</p>
<p>Here's sort of a eli5 explanation</p>
<p>The intrinsic properties of FM stations verse AM stations relies on their frequency ranges. AM around 1000Khz and FM around 90 Mhz in america means the AM is a lower frequency. Lower frequencies can bounce and travel further than higher ones, and can even be reflected off of atmospheric layers to send the signal further easier than higher ones. higher frequencies are more prone to being blocked by barriers, and not just &quot;physical&quot; ones, but also atmospheric in nature like humidity and weather conditions can also effect range and clarity. The clarity of a AM signal will be rougher, but clarity with an FM signal means the signal jumps in an out and stutters instead of being &quot;harder to understand&quot; leaving bits and pieces out of the communications </p>
<p>As a safety measure, an AM signal is a more reliable long distance communication signal. Might not sound clear, but its functional further distances out them FM, and is more reliable to getting the signal out.</p>
<p>When FM stations play a emergency warning, its just a recorded/repeated AM signal typically </p>
<p>Alot of emergency comms in the marines in the infantry were low frequency for all of these reasons.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you can still find a sound system with a decent receiver and an AM antenna, and you tune in at night, you will be amazed at how many of the clear-channel stations you can get on AM (note: not Clear Channel, the company, but clear channel, as in nobody else on the same frequency for a long, long way). I used to pick up stations that were over 700 miles away without trouble. A little scratchy, but certainly listenable, and that was with a dinky little antenna. If you had a good one, it would have been clear as day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, so what I'm picking up here (and my understanding in general) is that various broadcast stations all listen to each other and this alert propagates out basically by having these stations all automatically rebroadcast these alerts, right?</p>
<p>I also understand that this signal is not sent through any kind of secondary channel; it's broadcast out over the analog airwaves and other stations pick it up and automatically rebroadcast it to be picked up by even more stations and so on. The digital sounding signal indicates to which areas the alert applies so the automated equipment know whether or not to rebroadcast it.</p>
<p>Is there any authentication for this?</p>
<p>In my area, there's a super powerful Class A licensed AM station owned by IHeartMedia. If I were to figure out what frequencies this station is listening to for EAS notifications, how hard would it be for me to generate an EAS alert and, using directional radio broadcast equipment, trick this station into automatically rebroadcasting it and causing a mass panic about, say, a false incoming nuclear threat?</p>
<p>This shit has to have authentication, right? The alerts are sent out over analog broadcast on AM, FM, and weather bands.</p>
<p>(I guarantee you that this isn't only illegal, but is likely a whole pile of felonies, with jail time in excess of ten years... but that won't stop a terrorist...)</p>
<p>Please settle my fears a bit, yeah?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also very illegal and extremely costly for an EAS broadcast station to send out a false signal. There’s a Wikipedia page on EAS and a section that lists fines. I believe I read some station got fined upwards of millions of dollars since their signal was propagated falsely onto all the stations under them and was sent out to millions of listeners</p>

<p>During the October 24, 2014 episode of Bobby Bones' nationally-syndicated radio show, Bones played audio from the 2011 national test as part of a rant about a genuine test from Nashville's Fox affiliate, WZTV, that interrupted Game 2 of the 2014 World Series on October 22. The errant Emergency Action Notification was relayed to some broadcasters and cable systems—particularly those not configured to reject EAN messages that did not match the current date. On May 19, 2015, iHeartMedia (who distributes the show and owns its flagship station, WSIX-FM) was fined $1 million for the incident, and was ordered to implement a three-year compliance plan and remove all EAS tones or similar-sounding noises from its audio production libraries in order to avoid any further incidents.[73][74]</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never been a fan of all the attention given to these stories about asteroids coming very close to earth soon. Astronomically they're interesting, sure. In actuality though they are pretty boring. The average one flying &quot;close&quot; past the earth is like the size of a school bus and three times further away than the moon. They make for a good headline and nothing else. I've always assumed it would be more of a <em>Deep Impact</em> type of deal if a huge one was spotted coming this way and couldn't be dealt with. No reason to tell people immediately if pretty much everyone is going to die anyway.</p></div>		</li>
