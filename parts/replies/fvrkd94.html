<p>Still funny that one of you even tried the wrong key in either car haha did it work in the doors and the ignition?</p></div>		</li>

Started it up and noticed a snow globe on the dash. I didn't have a snow globe. Got out and got into mine which was parked right next to it and drove away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, even if there are only 1,000 possible combinations on the common brands of Yale key (the kind that most of us probably have for our front doors), that's up to 999 missed attempts that it would take for someone to unlock your door if they had every possible key.  Nobody trying to break into your house is going to potentially spend an hour at your front door risking being caught; they're going to pick or bump the lock.  Or break the door or a window, if they want to be less subtle.  The key doesn't stop anyone who <em>really</em> wants to get into your house, it just makes it hard enough that not anyone can just wander in.</p>
<p>And for the record, I don't know the number, but it's likely significantly more than 1,000 possible keys.  The odds that a person nearby will have the exact same key is minuscule, though certainly not impossible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neat, thanks!  So certainly an order of magnitude higher than my estimation, which would absolutely give anyone a teeny weeny chance of matching the key - or a super long process of trying to find the right key for the right lock.</p>
<p>In any case, nobody's breaking into a house with a convenient matching key.  They're picking the lock, breaking something, or finding a door/window that was left unlocked to get in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the lucky 1 in 1000 has no idea that heâ€™s the special one.... or which door is his match.  And since we tend to call the cops on people who randomly try their keys on doors, thereâ€™s a big incentive not to try to see if youâ€™ll win the jackpot.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s no real foolproof way to keep people outside of your home without large amounts of money invested, so all that a key can do is dissuade anyone who isnâ€™t willing to resort to more extreme measures.</p></div>		</li>
