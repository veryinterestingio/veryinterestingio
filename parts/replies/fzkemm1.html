			<div class="markdown"><p>I did an internship at JPL's Planetary Protection group about 20 years ago. My job was to categorize the organisms in the Spacecraft Assembly Room. Pretty basic microbiology stuff. My fellow intern was taking paint chips and rubbing different disinfectants on them to grade the cleanliness and paint degradation. Had to make sure we could classify and kill the organisms without damaging the paint layer or electronics. I have some weird stories of my time there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is a very important mission, technically, it seems very unrealistic that any contamination would survive in most cases.</p>
<p>Mars' surface, for example, is bathed in radiation, cold, no oxygen, no moisture, and almost no atmosphere.  You'd expect it to quickly sterilize anything, or at the very least bacteria/fungi could never live and reproduce, but since we really can't know, this is an abundance of caution.</p>
<p>Other places, like some of Jupiter's moons, could plausibly support life.  It still seems unlikely anything from Earth could live there, but we can't know that</p></div>		</li>

<p>Might make you rethink the whole “Nothing will survive those conditions” thing.</p>
<p>Plus the Israeli space program already contaminated the Moon with them.</p>

<p>Even dead bacteria will throw analysis off.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This only means that if microbes exist there, they evolve to thrive under extreme conditions. We even have a name for organisms that do this, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremophile" target="_blank">extremophiles</a>.</p></div>		</li>
