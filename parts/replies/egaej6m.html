			<div class="markdown"><p>Silicon and heavier elements are produced in the last day of a star's life.  The heaviest element produced by stellar synthesis is iron (actually nickel-56 which decays to iron-56).  Beyond this, fusion requires energy, rather than releases it, as 56 is the most stable number of nucleons.</p>
<p>Elements heavier than iron are exclusively produced during supernovae explosions.  Platinum, gold, etc. are rare primarily because they are among the heaviest stable elements that exist (atomic numbers 78 and 79, respectively.  The highest is lead, with 82 protons, which is slightly more common since most everything heavier than lead eventually decays to it).</p>
<p>Also interesting to note is that even-numbered elements are typically more common than odd-numbered ones, since most elements are formed by alpha particle capture (alpha particles are basically helium nucleii, with two protons and two neutrons).</p>

<p>I mean, sure, but bismuth 209's half life is in the order of 10,000,000,000,000,000,000 years.  It's not going anywhere soon.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it doesn’t have to be a supernova, but yes. A large star will end with a super nova, which will inturn create a black hole or neutron star. But don’t rely on me too much. I’m just stating what I remember.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nickel fusion is the heaviest fusion to happen in a what can be considered a star, and lasts less than an hour (around 8 minutes I think). This is because Nickel fusion requires more energy than it releases, leading directly to the resulting supernova. What elements are produced in the supernova and how are the subject of active research, but we have a pretty good idea (I just don't remember at the moment). </p>
<p>Its worth noting (for a more complete answer) that this only happens in heavier stars; our sun will never fuse nickel, or become a supernova.</p>
<p>Edit: a lot of people are discussing iron being the last element that leads to the core collapse. I'm speaking from memory here (no textbooks handy, and its been a few years), but I know stars fuse some nickel before going supernova. So iron isn't enough to cause stars to die &quot;instantly&quot;, but honestly all of the iron nickel fusion takes less than half an hour so I might be misrepresenting something a bit, and I apologize if that's the case. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the earliest stars with massive and lived very short lives, think firecrackers.   They seeded the area around them with heavier metals, and then they lived longer (because the universe was less dense), but again they blew their guts..   The sun is at least third generation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeap so a star will only have a stabilized fusion process up until iron. Then once it collapses and goes supernova (for massive enough stars) the energy created in the supernova will briefly create fusion into heavier elements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some elements are suspected to only be able to be produced when the mass of a collapsing supernova rebounds off the collapsed core and strikes matter blown off before the collapse, at not insignificant speeds.  </p>
<p>Fusion via shockwave, so possibly instantaneous as the wave passes through. </p>
<p>It takes (hundredths?) of a second to fuse iron, and it kills the star.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes the elements that can be produced in a supernova are fascinating (part of a class of elements referred to as &quot;rapid neutron capture process&quot;, meaning they need many neutrons to hit their nuclei in a short time in order to form, conditions probably present in a supernova). </p>
<p>Iron is still fused in the star though. Before the supernova. Its only fused for a brief time, you can count it in minutes. But it is made in the star. It is of course also made in the supernova, possibly even more of it I can't remember. But its important to draw the distinction.</p></div>		</li>
