			<div class="markdown"><p>Having worked in both. Business companies pays 3x more than any studio will. It's a trade off thou, one is an exciting environment while the other is just business. The companies know this and take advantage of peoples passion for their games.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is such fucking bullshit. You can’t paint it with such a broad brush. I work at a game studio with developers that make between 100-200k a year and there is no way they could get a job making 3 times that with their experience. Sure, some software companies might pay 3 times that but those are incredibly rare and require a ton of experience, and even still most don’t pay that much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Low pay: yes, in general game developers make less than what they could be making elsewhere. Programmers may make more than designers, but that same programmer could take their same skill set and make like 50% more money anywhere else.</p>
<p>Passionate: definitely. </p>
<p>Blackballed: Yes, if you're caught leaking your career is over.</p>
<p>This part though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many times, especially secret assets and plans are also individually distinguished, so they would be able to tell who leaked it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've seen this a few times in this topic and it's just 100% wrong. Game development is all about collaborating with each other discipline and compartmentalization is not a thing. Game development just wouldn't work if it were. If you're working on a game, no matter how low you are, you have (or at least have access to) all knowledge on that game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This!<br />
I’ve worked on a number of confidential projects at Big Tech companies.  It’s awesome to work on something that you’re friends and family will use. </p>
<p>The thing is, the risk of being banned or not being able to be a part of something great is greater than the small thrill of leaking.  It’s just not worth it.</p></div>		</li>
