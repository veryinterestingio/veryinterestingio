			<div class="markdown"><p>I can not improve on this answer with information, because it is pretty spot on.  But I can offer a very simple TLDR version:</p>
<p>Perfect weather = whole sky is available for all air traffic</p>
<p>Not perfect weather = less sky available for the same amount of air traffic</p>
<p>Bad weather = Small area (if any) of sky available for same amount of air traffic</p>
<p>The type and severity of the weather affects how much sky is available and how much air traffic can safely operate within that area.  Bad weather causes a bottleneck, and reducing the amount of air traffic (canceling 10%, 25%, etc) can eliminate or reduce delays.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are other, location-specific factors. For example, San Francisco (SFO) has two runways which enable parallel landings. However, these two runways are relatively close together. This causes a problem when the SF Bay fog rolls in. Airplanes can still land in thick fog using ILS, but SFO's runways are too close together to allow for parallel landings on ILS. Hence, whenever SFO has thick fog, the airport's landing capacity is cut in half. The bottleneck results in delays and cancellations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some planes can safely operate in worse weather than other planes. Those that can't get cancelled and whats left on the board are the planes that better deal with weather.  </p>
<p>Some airports can safely operate at full speed in bad weather. Other airports have to slow everything down to be safe.  If they slow everything down and dont have the time to fit all the flights in, some will get cut from the board and cancelled, whats left on the board are just what time will allow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if stong winds hit an obstacle, say a cliff or mountain, the air is pushed up and over, but the wind doesn't just settle back to steady blowing like it was before the obstacle.
There's a 'wake', like what you might see behind a boat, but after passing a vertical obstacle like a mountain, the wake is kinda like wind rolling over an invisible barrell, there are updrafts and downdrafts and sometimes pressure changes in there for some distance after the mountain while the wake dissipates. If you plan on flying through an area of mountain waves you'd want to know about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't even have to be full on mountains - one time when flying into Newark on a small turbo prop plane (always a bumpy landing), I was told that even the wind up and over strip malls and larger buildings generate this type of wave pattern which is more impactful to smaller planes closer to the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took a glider flight once and the pilot was psyched about the mountain wave that was happening. He hated to land when the flight was over. Every wave caused an up draft so we could gain altitude indefinitely. Very cool sensation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a flight dispatcher having worked in multiple airlines, the TLDR and ELI5: not all airlines are as <em>willing</em> as the other. Notwithstanding all of the hard limits of an aircraft, if there's a strong chance you will divert to another airport, some airlines are still willing to try it out (then divert if you don't get in) while some prefer not to try it and save on money (diverting is expensive). When you see only a portion of flights being cancelled, that's generally what happens.</p></div>		</li>
