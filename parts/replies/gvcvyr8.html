			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Also, during different times of year you will see somewhat different colors. The green that you see on the horizon at dawn in the wintertime (from North America) is only present during that time because tilt of the Earth affects it, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tangential answer but sorta related; when I lived in California I remember the sunsets always seemed the most intense and beautiful during and after the wildfires on “clear” nights, and then after it rained they would go back to how they usually were. It was all the soot and ash hanging around. I imagine that’s why there are so many pictures of intense sunsets over/around/in large cities; all the pollution/smog from the cars</p>
<p>Edit: large cities where the air is still clear enough to actually see the sky, obviously</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probs. Very cold, DRY air in Siberia, but actually somewhere like Houston, TX is a better ‘opposite’ than the Sahara; hot, HUMID air constantly coming in from the gulf.</p></div>		</li>

Some topics I have no idea about, others I have some idea so I want a more detailed explanation.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there also an element of refraction via the atmosphere, with the morning light being bent to emphasise the blue end of the spectrum and the evening light bending to emphasise the red/orange end? Or is it essentially being bent exactly the same in both instances</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I made my answer ELI5 cuz that's about the best I can do lol, but my best answer here is that the only differences in refraction are due to the stuff in the air, rather than anything specific to morning/evening refracting light differently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah i thought angle of incidence and ambient air temperature would have a more pronounced impact on refraction, but im not going to claim to be an expert...was just something that made sense in my head canon lol</p></div>		</li>
