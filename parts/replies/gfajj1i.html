<p>the funny part is that the life-time of the proton is believed to be around 10^(31) years</p>

<p>Experimentally the proton lifetime is &gt;10^34 Years.  Any theory with a lifetime of 10^31 years is ruled out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 10^34 years limits only apply to specific decay modes. Plausible decay modes, but they are not covering everything.</p>
<p>The most general experiments (proton/neutron disappearance) only set limits of a few times 10^29 years: <a href="https://pdglive.lbl.gov/DataBlock.action?node=S016T&home=BXXX005" target="_blank">https://pdglive.lbl.gov/DataBlock.action?node=S016T&home=BXXX005</a></p>
<p>If a proton would mainly decay e.g. to e- mu+ mu+ then our lower limits are only <a href="https://pdglive.lbl.gov/BranchingRatio.action?desig=46&amp;parCode=S016&amp;home=BXXX005" target="_blank">6*10^30 years</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, I had assumed that any decay would have similar on-shell characteristics as it can't violate charge conservation.</p>
<p>In a proton decay, you must be left with a high energy position, and unstable muons.</p>
<p>What does disappearance mean, in this context?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you mean by &quot;experimentally&quot;? If the universe is only 10^10 years old and proton decay has not yet been observed, how can we have an experimentally verified value of &gt;10^34 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The term &quot;lifetime&quot; is actually a bit of a misnomer since it suggests that there is some exact time after which a particle will decay, which is a mischaracterization of the decay process in quantum mechanics.  The truth is that particles are not very smart in the sense that they have no memory; whether they decay or not is a choice they make independently at every moment in time with no knowledge of how long it has been that they have not decayed.  Because of this, the probability of decaying after a given time is characterized by an exponential distribution, which can be characterized entirely by a single parameter: the &quot;half-life&quot;, which is the time after which there is a 50% chance of the particle decaying.  (*)  If you have a lot of particles, then they will all be making these decisions independently so because you have more of them there is a greater chance that you will see one of them decay.  Thus, if you gather a whole bunch of them together and watch them for a while and don't see anything, you gain information about how likely it is that they are to decay over time and in particular can place a lower bound on what the half-life is.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_decay#Experimental_evidence" target="_blank">Several experiments that have done this are listed in Wikipedia.</a></p>
<p>(*) Again, particles are stupid, so if you come back five minutes later and the particle hasn't decayed then that doesn't mean that the half-life has gone down by five minutes because the particle doesn't know that it's been five minutes so the half-life remains the same; the counter is essentially constantly resetting.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The Super-Kamiokande experiment in Japan has the longest track record in  the search for proton decay, and its researchers have now published a new lower bound on the proton lifetime that is 2.5 times greater than  their previous bound.   </p>
<p>...  </p>
<p>From this, they conclude that the proton lifetime for this SUSY-inspired decay pathway is greater than  5.9Ã—1033 years. </p>
