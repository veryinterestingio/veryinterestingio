<p>If you allow short positions to be opened when the shares to cover them don't exist, you provide a perverse incentive for anyone with a short position to do whatever they can to try to find a way to end that company as a going concern. That's the GME situation in a nutshell, a short interest over 100% (over an extended period of time, not just due to reporting fluctuations) indicates that some subset of short positions were taken with the assumption that the price would go to 0 <em>or even lower</em>.</p>
<p>That's not price discovery at work; prices for equities don't go below zero. It's a scam.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How?</p>
<p>Seriously, think that one through. If &quot;ending that company as a going concern&quot; was a feasible option, would their competition already be trying to do that? They've already got an incentive, and better tools for doing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simple, you depress a company's stock price long enough that it either defaults on its loans, is de-listed from the exchange, or one leads to the other. </p>
<p>In the case of GME, both were very likely scenarios prior to January. In 2020 it was trading at around $4 a share and at serious risk of de-listing from the NYSE. Actions were taken by the company to prevent that, namely a share buyback to stabilize the price, but they weren't a guarantee; if GME had been de-listed, or just remained at $4 a share for the last 6 months, they were almost guaranteed to default on bonds coming to maturity in 2021.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, you could just read the first paragraph on the topic at <a href="https://investopedia.com" target="_blank">investopedia.com</a> here: </p>
<p>What Is Naked Shorting  </p>
<p>Naked shorting is the illegal practice of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp" target="_blank">short selling</a>  shares that have not been affirmatively determined to exist.  Ordinarily, traders must borrow a stock or determine that it can be  borrowed before they sell it short. So naked shorting refers to short  pressure on a stock that may be larger than the tradable shares in the  market. </p>
<p>Despite being made illegal after the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp" target="_blank">2008â€“09 financial crisis,</a>  naked shorting continues to happen because of loopholes in rules and  discrepancies between paper and electronic trading systems.</p></div>		</li>
