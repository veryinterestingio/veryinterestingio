			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned a useful tip when being trained (for a recruitment event) to be better at being personable and friendly in situations where I was to be meeting people. </p>
<p>When you’re left standing and feeling awkward because something else is going on (someone else is speaking) but you know others are watching you, too, but you don’t have anything to do with your hands/posture:</p>
<p>Simply place your palms on the front of your thighs. Not firmly or like really putting your arm/hands too much “in front” of you. Just put your palm gently against your thighs. Its comfortable and gets rid of the weird “arms just dangling” feeling of when you’ve been told to keep your arms at your sides. It’s not aggressive, but it feels and looks a bit more intentional than just standing there with your arms limp, and prevents you from mindlessly fidgeting</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, that’s exactly it and man; after a long day of standing with you chest out in beating Florida heat sometimes all you need to do is widen your stance and put your hands behind your back. Parade rest FTW.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just imagined fidgeting with one of my hands more and more vigorously until it gets really noticeable and when people start really looking at what I'm doing I get even more into it until they start to back away</p></div>		</li>
