			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm from the US and have never seen a house with a cold water tank in the attic. What is the reason for it? Is it to increase water pressure? </p>
<p>US water pressure is usually 60 psi or higher and some times a regulator is added to lower the pressure if it is too high coming in from the municipality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, a tank feeding down one floor from attic to bathroom will have far lower pressure than the rising main.</p>
<p>I think the reasoning was partially so that if, for any reason, the water supply from outside was interrupted, water was still available for washing and flushing the toilet.</p>
<p>Also, standard fitment in UK bathrooms in those years was a bath, not a shower, and typically water tanks were sized to provide roughly the amount of water as needed for the bathtub.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had an old house with a cold water tank ontl the roof, this was to provide hot water pressure from gravity. Such systems were common before hot water heaters could handle mains pressure , or they'd invented valves to do the same thing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in an appartment complex in Europe.<br />
My experience is actually that bathroom tap water (one-floor flat) feels fresh, and is always purely odorless and tasteless.<br />
Kitchen tap water, on the other hand, oftentimes has a faint odor/aftertaste, sometimes more, sometimes less. I emphasize faint, because my parents I live with don't seem to notice a big difference.<br />
This persists if I let the water run for a while before &quot;collecting it&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
