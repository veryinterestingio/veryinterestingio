			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a post some time ago stating how likely it would be for us to detect a solar system exactly like ours. Now I don't remember the exact numbers but both Mercury, Earth and Venus were below 10% chance and anything further than Saturn was below 5%</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And by detect a system like ours, you mean get all eight planets, right?  So while we might be able to find Jupiter on a good day, getting the other seven is extraordinarily unlikely, or do I have that wrong? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does that make it likely that the other stars weve found with multiple planets around them have even more planets that wr just couldn't detect? Effectively meaning solar systems similar to ours would actually be quite common?</p>
<p>As others have pointed out, its easier to find Jupiter sized planets than Earth/Mercury etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the orbital plane was, say, 90° off from ours, how bright would things have to be to be able to see the light reflecting off the &quot;day&quot; side of an orbiting planet?</p>
<p>I could think of a few possible scenarios:</p>
<p>a) The star would have to be super bright, however this would likely obscure our vision of any planets in relatively close orbits due to glare.</p>
<p>b) The planet would have to have a very tight orbit to be able to reflect enough light, which either has the same glare problem as (a) or would be unstable for being so close. A giant planet in Mercury's orbit doesn't sound sustainable long term.</p>
<p>c) The surface of the planet would have to be unusually shiny (high albedo), which is probably unlikely for an entire planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be direct imaging with reflected light. It's one of the next big frontiers of exoplanet discovery! You're absolutely right, the brightness of the star is overwhelming, so you need to be able to block that out to achieve a high contrast sensitivity (we're talking about things that are more than a billion times fainter than the star). There are instruments that can help us do this, such as a coronagraph.</p>
<p>WFIRST is an upcoming mission that will have some of this capability. There are other proposed future missions (LUVOIR and HabEx) that would go much further. I know with HabEx they predict they could see 12 Earth analogs! </p>
<p>So hopefully in the next 20-30 years this will be achievable!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We could detect Jupiter and Saturn reasonably easily via their perturbation of the Sun.</p>
<p>We could really detect a lot of the planets because of that, but it would depend both on how far away we were and on the angle we were viewing the solar system from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I answered this below. But with our current technology and available techniques we'd have to look for a really long time to confirm Jupiter and maybe Saturn with some luck. Just imagine we'd have to be looking exclusively at the sun for TWELVE YEARS to see Jupiter make a dent in the sun's brightness ONCE. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All the evidence is pointing toward just about every star having multiple planets. There's a wide diversity out there, and we have a whole host of unanswered questions about how exactly planets form and how planetary systems evolve, but in general there are way more planets than stars.</p>
<p>As to why we haven't detected systems like our own Solar System, that's largely been answered by others. Most of our detection methods are best at short period, large planets which don't exist in our own Solar System. We have to use statistics and extrapolation to come up with the numbers about how many planets each star might <em>actually</em> have.</p>
<p><a href="https://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/senitivity_regions.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> is a plot showing the general sensitivity of our searches. Our own Solar System planets (and the Moon and a representative moon of Jupiter and Saturn) are shown for context. Everything we've done up til now has been in the red box. You can see that our own Earth and Venus are right on the edge of the red region, meaning they're right on the edge of detectability up til now. The blue region and blue dots are a simulation of an upcoming telescope called WFIRST that could help us understand how common planets are in the outer reaches of other stars a whole lot better. So be on the lookout for data from that and ask this question again in 10 years when we have WFIRST data.</p></div>		</li>
