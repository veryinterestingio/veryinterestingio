			<div class="markdown"><p>This actually totally makes sense when you consider other ways the body does this. For instance, washing one’s hair or skin (especially face) too frequently or with harsh, stripping shampoos/soaps can actually cause the body to produce MORE oil to try to restore the balance caused by the dehydration. It’s often much better for people with oily scalp or face to treat it as though it’s dehydrated to get things back to normal. </p>
