			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the detailed explanation! It's really interesting how the the hemispheres would different in terms of consequences for terrestrial life. I’m really curious to know how marine life would be affected. I know the rising water temperatures in some regions are forcing populations to colder waters and was wondering if desalnation would have any similar effect</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my lay understanding I think the biggest effects would be felt on the changing water
Current channels. Some mass migrations of fish near The horn of South Africa have already seen massive changes in population, health, mating season timing, etc. these I think will be the more challenging issues to water dwelling animals in the immediate aftermath of climate change. There may also be changes in the amount of soluble minerals that could have rippling effects on the health of the population. But many salt water animals survive in brackish mixed waters for periods of time without major hindrance so I think it would take a really immense change in the amount of liquid water vs ice to make a substantial change in salinity in the world’s oceans</p></div>		</li>
