			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really just matter of nomenclature. I (and others)  think of the Cooper pairs as pairs of free electrons that are weakly bound to one-another through a weak interaction with the ion lattice, forming composite bosons. The ground state of this boson gas is called a condensate, and it can flow at low speeds through the ion lattice without friction because of the finite energy E required to excite Cooper pairs out of their ground state, with E larger than the energy released in a low velocity collision with the ion lattice.</p></div>		</li>
