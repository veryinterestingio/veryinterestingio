			<div class="markdown"><p>My son used to ride on the lawnmower with me mowing when he was about 3 or 4. Would always fall asleep soon into mowing process, which would make it difficult for me to mow with his body flopping around like sack of potatoes.  So I would drive near house, turn off mower to bring him inside, and as soon as the engine turned off he would immediately awake and demand to keep mowing.  I would tell him he was sleeping and i'm bringing him into house for a nap. He would refuse to believe he feel asleep and insist we keep mowing. And keep falling asleep!  And this was a very loud zero turn mower.</p></div>		</li>
