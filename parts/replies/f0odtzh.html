			<div class="markdown"><p>Children have a solid conception of death by three (if not earlier), and depending on the age have quite a lot of death anxiety too. A lot of young children talk about how they can't die because only old people die and they'll never get old. And then they realize around adolescence that they will in fact get old. So you're very normal!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In all seriousness, late night existential dread is super common. Most of us learn how to self-sooth in order to get to sleep but it pops up every once in a great while. I have to put a comedy on tv to take my mind off of it. </p>
<p>And for what it’s worth, kids definitely experience existential dread. I just found the terms used in the OP to be funny for a five year old to use.</p></div>		</li>

I still have those thoughts every once in awhile though and this whole thread just brought it all back.
