			<div class="markdown"><p>Caldera collapse is exactly what happened in Hawaii. That resulted in an actual lava river that flowed for over a month straight! This posed more complications than just a normal eruption. As volcanic gasses were emitted the entire time, it slowly destroyed more and more of the island transformed one of the vents into a new active volcano.</p>
<p>So in someways... a caldera collapse could be worse. A lot worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I must point out that a caldera collapse of a shield volcano isn't the same as one from a stratovolcano or even rhyolithic volcano - basaltic volcanoes like in Hawaii do summit caldera collapses frequently, and in this case it was due to magma finding its way through an alternate path, relieving pressure towards new north-east fissures and thus the pressure-less lava lake and caldera floor collapsing.</p>
<p>A stratovolcano collapsing is worse because its magma doesn't want to come out entirely voluntarily in the first place but when it does, it can't seem to want to stop! Those kind of forces produce a LOT of tephra!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kilauea had some phreatic explosions that caused some ashfall downwind of the lava lake. We know someone who lives in Volcano. They got 1/4-1/2&quot; of ash a couple of times, and earthquakes up to M5.6 were felt. None of these, or other effects such as vog, were anywhere near as extreme as in a stratovolcanic explosive eruption.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So so far we've seen an initial depressurizing, right?</p>
<p>And is there a chance that the dome of the magma chamber could collapse in the nearish future, which includes the lake?  if this happens, we get the steam explosion and the caldera collapse?</p>
<p>Cataclysmic indeed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was wondering how much worse this could be because of the lake. Could end up with another <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_Without_a_Summer" target="_blank">&quot;Year Without a Summer&quot;</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the actual scale of the eruption - how much tephra is ejected and how high into the atmosphere - even if it was to eject 100kT volcanic ash, if this ash just came out over time and fell across the Phillippines and the Pacific, nobody would notice. However if a large-scale explosion occurs including the collapse of a very large magma chamber (which I don't know if Taal even has) things would be different. Granted, Taal doesn't have a large volcanic mountain atm, so that is actually weakening his potential, not just with lahaars and flank collapses, but also with the energy that can be released by a caldera collapse.</p>
<p>Tambora, for reference, was about 4.2km high before 1815. The entire volume of that peak is now below the caldera floor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, tephra alone doesn't have the world wide effects on climate, it's more about the SOÂ² released from the ground into the stratosphere. The amount of gas released depends on the type of eruption.</p>
<p>A good <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3832744/" target="_blank">report</a> on the volcano if you're interested.</p></div>		</li>
