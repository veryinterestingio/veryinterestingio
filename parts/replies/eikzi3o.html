			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s only one of the reasons they can form. Another common cause it that the soil under the pavement isn’t as packed and will cause a soft spot to appear which over time will cause the pavement to sink and crack and get chipped away</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In cases where a pothole is forming in an area where it doesn’t freeze, there are two main problems that can occur and they both relate to problems below the surface.</p>
<p>Problem #1: Tack failure. Asphalt is generally done in 2 lifts. The base layer is placed on compacted gravel, or dirt (depending on where you live.) That layer is compacted, and sprayed with an asphalt glue known as tack. It’s hot, sticky, and it stinks. It helps the top layer, which is placed second, stick to the base layer. Tack can fail and then the two layers don’t stick. Dirt/dust can get on the surface, water from rain can disturb the surface, and one of the biggest issues, leaking oil/fuel from the equipment. If the two layers don’t stick, the top will wear faster, and this forms those small depth potholes that you barely notice. The repeated force of vehicles dropping into the pothole makes it deeper and causes the base layer to fail, making the deep potholes.</p>
<p>Problem #2: Compaction. If the base layer isn’t compacted, surface water flow gets into the base material and disturbs it. This causes the road to have small indentations, and then micro cracks form. Those micro cracks let it more water, and over time it makes a big enough of an indentation that you get a pothole.</p>

<p>And before anyone brings up the &quot;but CA has so many more cars/miles of road/etc&quot;, yes and both the tax revenue and the wear rates of the roads scale pretty much proportionally.</p></div>		</li>
