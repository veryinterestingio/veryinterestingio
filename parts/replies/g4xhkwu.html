			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, they’re experimental aircraft flying test missions. There hasn’t been any “in service” aircraft faster than the SR-71</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not accurate. Hypersonics, as you indicate, are an active area of research, especially by the US, Russia, and China. Hypersonics open up a lot of military options.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Much faster response times for strikes (especially with limited timeframes) and a higher probability of getting past enemy defenses. Research is focusing both on hypersonic aircraft and weapons systems (see boost glide vehicles like the already-deployed Russian Avangard).</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>On average, each SR-71 could fly once per week due to the extended turnaround required after mission recovery. A total of 32 aircraft were built; 12 were lost in accidents with none lost to enemy action.</p>
