			<div class="markdown"><p>When they talk about making up sleep, they don't mean in terms of how tired you feel. They mean in terms of the repairs and processes that go on internally.</p>
<p>You might feel fine energy-wise, but the damage to your neurological pathways may have gotten more of a duct tape treatment than soldering, you know?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course it works! You wont die but sleep does so much for the body we cant even imagine it! Lets take immune system, if you dont get enough sleep the immune system wont be as effective, let say it runs at 80% on weekdays, might be the difference between getting sick or not. You cant really compensate on weekends, can you make it run on 140% and kill everything you caught on weekdays?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Repairing the damage from sleep deprivation is not just about restoring your energy levels. When they talk about not being to catch up, they're referring to all the repairing that needs to happen to your damaged neurological pathways. This is the crucial part of the matter.</p></div>		</li>
