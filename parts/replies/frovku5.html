			<div class="markdown"><p>There are there several ways to physically achieve this. Part of the ghrelin secretion process involves physical stimulation of the vagus nerves that are present in your stomach.</p>
<p>This is why when the stomach is contracted &quot;or empty&quot; then the nerves are stimulated to trigger the production of ghrelin. When you eat food, the stomach expands and the vagus nerves are stimulated again, calling for the reduction in the secretion of ghrelin, which makes you feel less hungry (or the sensation of feeling full).</p>
<p>Of course, I am over simplifying a lot complex processes. But this one is particularly interesting because of the physical stimulation involved. It has paved the way for neuromodulation techniques to induce weight loss/weight gain. For instance there are devices like the <a href="http://www.ucihealth.org/medical-services/bariatric-surgery/surgery-options/maestro-vbloc-therapy" target="_blank">VBLOC</a>, which is a pacemaker type device that has electrodes placed near the vagus nerves. This allows the nerves to be triggered through electrical impulses meaning you can artificially control the secretion of ghrelin. It is FDA approved (albeit with less efficacy than other established methods of bariatric surgery) and has a decent amount of literature available if you are interested to learn more about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being sleep deprived also causes an imbalance between this hormone, the ghrelin, and its arch nemesis, leptin. </p>
<p>Leptin inhibits hunger, and when well rested properly interacts with ghrelin to maintain a healthier and more balanced appetite.</p></div>		</li>
