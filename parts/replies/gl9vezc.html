			<div class="markdown"><p>Because I came in from work, realised there wasn't much in the fridge to eat or what was there I didn't want and all my meat is frozen ?</p>
<p>I work late sometimes, not predictably, my husband works shifts and I'm often not feeding more than me on a regular basis. </p>
<p>I can look meat out to defrost and then I get home at 8 pm instead of 6 or 7, have a shower and think fuck this I'm exhausted and I've got an hour and half until I need to go bed I cannot be fucked to cook dinner now. </p>
<p>Defrosted meat is now on the clock. Either i HAVE to cook it the following day or chuck it. </p>
<p>Maybe the next day my husband is home - now we don't have enough meat. Or its Saturday and I'm at my parents for dinner and don't need it. </p>
<p>Not every body works repetitive planable schedules where they can always guarantee and plan far enough in advance to defrost food. </p>
<p>When I can I do, and it's always preferable to defrost meat for cooking reasons as well as hygiene but it's also useful to know how to do it last minute if need be.</p></div>		</li>
