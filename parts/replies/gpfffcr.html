			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds suspiciously like professional folklore. It's exactly the kind of thing that someone offers as a conjectural answer (or just an offhand mention of a potential benefit that wasn't intended as a causal explanation) and ends up repeated as fact within a profession.</p>
<p>Photopigment bleaching is absolutely a real thing (although definitely not the only or even necessarily main part of color adaptation), but the idea that color adaptation would cause problems in a surgical environment, that could be ameliorated by having green scrubs to look at, is definitely eyebrow-raising.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the other hand, I can absolutely imagine a surgeon coming out of a 12 hour surgery and having a breakdown like &quot;I am so sick of looking at red, grey, tan, white, please for the love of god let me see some plants or the sky&quot; and someone being like &quot;ok ok, calm down, we'll get you some green to look at&quot;.</p>
<p>...point  being, even if the exact physiological effect isn't recognized, it can still have a psychological impact, like increased levels of stress.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That first source literally says in the first paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although it is hard to confirm whether green scrubs became popular for this reason</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is <em>exactly</em> what I'm talking about with how conjecture gets turned into fact.</p>
<p>Those are also not multiple sources. Did you actually read those articles? They both reference the same source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea so many people here talking about shit they don’t know or they just googled. I haven’t seen a single physician or surgeon respond (lots of techs and nurses though). I’m about to graduate med school so for what it’s worth, green and blue cover up blood. White scrubs don’t make sense, black scrubs give death vibes, red scrubs look like you’re covered in blood and give bad vibes to patients, and purple and yellow are obnoxious in a full outfit. Blue and green just make sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A similar justification is actually used in Russian aircraft design, at least until more recent years. If you look at older MiGs and Sukhois the cockpits have a bright teal colour, supposedly to assist with eyestrain.</p></div>		</li>
