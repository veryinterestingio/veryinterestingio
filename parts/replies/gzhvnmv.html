			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been doing a lot of research and experimentation with diets, and this summarizes my findings.  As blood sugar drops, you feel hungry.  If you ride it out, you'll stop feeling hungry and be able to work off your fat reserves.  Conversely, eating high sugar foods will spike your sugar, and then drop it very quickly, making you feel constantly hungry.  You can mitigate this by avoiding high sugar foods and eat slow releasing carbohydrates instead so there's less of a spike and plummet of blood sugar, or you can tough it out until the hunger goes away by itself and wait until you're really hungry to eat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for these comments. I know the body well but sugar, insulin, and different types if diabetes have always been a struggle for me to completely understand. Often I can eat a lot and go to bed but wake up extremely hungry. Probably due to the quick digested sugars &amp; carbs of an easy tired meal. I try to focus on whole carbs but I get sick hungry so anything filling is eaten.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like, so hungry you get sick?</p>
<p>Try starting the day with a large portion of oatmeal, potatoes, beans, something like that.  Then when you get hungry throughout the day, have heavy portions of meats and vegetables.  If you're hungry before bed, have more meats and vegetables, but make sure not to have any carbs for a long time before you sleep.  When you wake up, you shouldn't feel hungry, and can probably go a long time without food.</p>
<p>This should only work if you have fat stores.  You should feel fatigued if you try this without them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reading this actually made me wonder then what about the people that take drugs like X/Molly/Adderall etc.  Is their body getting what they need off fat reserves or does the drug make their body believe they don’t need to switch to their reserves?</p>
<p>I’ve seen some people take these drugs for days at a time often without eating. Was always curious how they managed to still have energy without eating</p></div>		</li>
