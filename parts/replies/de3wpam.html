<p>Emulsification with a polymeric system is also a pretty large workhorse.  <a href="http://imgur.com/a/H5fUx" target="_blank">Carbopol</a> is a pretty good example.  Another thing to mention is label claims in cosmetics.  The type of wording and what you are putting on the label is huge in marketing.  You can have a product that only has 0.05% Polyquat and make a conditioning claim.  The same thing goes with &quot;WITH ALOE, VIT A/E&quot;.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That link sends me to a login page, but it looks like /u/fortyninecents is talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyacrylic_acid" target="_blank">polyacrylic acid</a>. The Wikipedia page isn't a great read, unfortunately.</p>
<p>I have no expertise here, but it seems like it works by absorbing water and swelling up around the chemicals you want (ie, shampoo and conditioner) like those black ball guns in the Incredibles. They can then hold the two chemicals in the same solvent, while still letting the chemicals out to do their thing when in your hair.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Due to my job I once got a look at some of the projects a food company was working on, but the names were straight out of Willy Wonka.  They guard that shit like you wouldn't believe.  A lesser person might have tried to sell them out and never work again.  Ah vetting.</p></div>		</li>
