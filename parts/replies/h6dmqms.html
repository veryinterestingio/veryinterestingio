			<div class="markdown"><p>It's still there. It was only planned to be a speed skating oval for the Olympics, but the structure always had a long term plan. Speed skating ovals are huge. The facility now contains two ice hockey rinks 10 basketball courts and a bunch of other things.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy shit. I've never appreciated how large a speed skating rink is compared to a regular hockey rink.<br />
I guess the speeds they're skating at make the rink seem small, just like the dashed lines on a highway are a lot longer than people realise because they're normally driving at high speeds.</p></div>		</li>
