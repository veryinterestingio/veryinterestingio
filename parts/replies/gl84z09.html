			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting...thank you for sharing your experience. Neurotypical people are often unaware of, or rather, are rarely <em>forced</em> to notice, the subconscious social cues we look for and follow that are deemed “normal”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I honestly think I'm better at noticing small details about people because I have to work so hard at it. I am constantly running experiments on people around me. I am also very aware of small things about people I spend a lot of time around. I am usually the first (or only) person to notice when something is wrong with a coworker or family member. I just wish it didn't take so much of my mental energy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude. I thought I was a sociopath for a long time. I have several overlapping traits. Autism didn't become a wide spectrum until I was an adult. I also have some key traits that make me very much not a sociopath.</p></div>		</li>
