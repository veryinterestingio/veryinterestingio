			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing to iTunes. We did unholy things in the kernel. Basically we needed to be able to execute our interrupt handler on the <em>real</em> primary hardware interrupt, not what Apple said was the primary interrupt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having done similar things, my guess is just &quot;bizarre compression&quot;..  You're dealing with tons of data in video footage, and you start to really push what you can get away with as far as resolution, compression, etc.  You just run out of memory.  I only had to look as good as industrial uses required, so I could just drop the resolution, and compress away.  I can't imagine keeping it high quality.</p>
<p>It's why video has such a lower resolution on like, digital cameras, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm guessing you have an iPhone. If you also have a Windows PC, you're in luck. There's a program called <a href="https://www.copytrans.net/" target="_blank">CopyTrans Manager</a> that does exactly that.</p>
<p>If you have an Android phone, just copy songs over to the Music folder like it's a flash drive. Easy peasy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel ya. I've been screwed over by itunes repeatedly, and have tried other solutions, but I still use it as my primary way of ripping and listening to my CDs. Well, that and YouTube to get things that you just can't get on CD. It also throws an absolute fit when I try and change what audio driver I'm using.</p>
<p>Despite the needless &quot;upgrades&quot; to the base format of the program, and the incompatibilities with other programmes, when it works, it works great.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haven't used it in a while, but one feature I loved from ITunes that I wish Spotify would add is the ability to start typing the song name, and it would jump the highlight to the closest match. Not while in the actual search bar, but just whenever you want. Saved so much time compared to using the regular search function.</p></div>		</li>
