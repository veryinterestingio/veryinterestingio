			<div class="markdown"><p>Numberfile videos about AI are also great. Beware they’re a rabbit hole tho. I started with one video, they started talking about stuff from another video cause it was important. 9 hours later, were all gonna die to an AI</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s helped me in my studies too! I’m doing a research project as part of my Masters in physics, doing simulations of a particular quantum system in which there are two incommensurate crystal lattices — meaning the spacing of one is an irrational multiple of the other, such that the lattices never coincide. I noticed the authors of a paper on that topic chose the golden ratio as this multiple — and thanks to this video I knew it was because it’s the most irrational number.</p></div>		</li>
