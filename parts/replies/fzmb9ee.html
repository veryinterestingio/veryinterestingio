			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why you also like to choose safe solvent molecules for your application, when possible and note the purity of whatever youre using... if meant for use in/on an animal, consider your solventâ€™s SDS.  Well, always read the SDS actually, but since you said edible, the best choice is ethanol, even if we are only talking about trace quantities.  </p>
<p>A step further would be to ID the types of molecules in the herbal extract.  It is possible in a complex suspension that you dissolve some, but not all molecules and that the solidified product is changed by this or it simple phase separates on drying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! Considering the 96% I used is for human consumption, and the amount dried is about 150ml, I shouldn't expect worrying amounts of toxic traces, right? I will also test the extract at a lab to check the concentration and composition of polyphenols</p></div>		</li>
