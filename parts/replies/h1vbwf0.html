			<div class="markdown"><p>If a person with fast metabolism needs more calories, what is this &quot;above average&quot; energy consumption needed for in their body? Does e.g. digesting food use up more calories for them, do their hearts pump harder, do their livers work harder ... and therefore they need more calories than a regular person?</p></div>		</li>

<p>It also takes a base load of energy to keep tissue (muscle, etc.) alive...even two people with exactly the same organs (which doesn't happen in practice) can have different muscle mass, and hence different calorie requirements. A bulked up body-builder, even if they're not expending any energy doing exercise, needs a lot more calories just to keep all that muscle alive.</p>
<p>Some people may have more or less effective digestive tracts &amp; gut biomes, so the amount of calories they absorb may differ (they might eat the same amount of calories but a different amount is available to their bodies so they need to eat more/less to get the same calories absorbed).</p>
<p>And healing and other variable processes take energy...are you recovering from illness? Repairing an injury? Battling a chronic condition? That all takes energy. </p>
<p>Pumping blood takes energy, and how hard your heart has to work depends on your blood pressure, constrictions in your arteries, heart health &amp; size, etc. That varies for every person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there are also behavioral and environmental aspects - being excited, stressed or cold, or solving puzzles also consumes (a bit) more calories. You would be surprised how much a day of cleaning would consume. </p>
<p>also walking. running or walking the same distance consumes the same amount of calories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot; metabolism are misnomers.   There are several factors that determine caloric intake and weight gain:</p>
<p>1) people are absolutely awful at estimating caloric intake</p>
<p>2) physical activity throughout the day is difficult to estimate, especially micro movements </p>
<p>3) metabolic disorders are rare but significantly impact weight gain</p>
<p>There are many more factors but it seems to come down mostly to people being really bad at guessing.  </p>
<p>Someone the same weight, height and sex as you will have a similar metabolic rate and have a similar caloric requirement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>to add onto 1 some people are almost cartoonishly bad at estimating calories and overall how much they consume in a day and part of it isn't their fault.</p>
<p>Let's say you get a quarter pounder w cheese and a small fries at mcdonalds (which I would argue really isn't an excessive amount of food, in fact it would probably be a 'light lunch' to most people) you are at 740 calories (more than 1/3 of your daily intake) <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/about-our-food/nutrition-calculator.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/about-our-food/nutrition-calculator.html" target="_blank">https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/about-our-food/nutrition-calculator.html</a></a></p>
<p>sure we can argue that mcdonalds is unhealthy (because it is)</p>
<p>so what about pizza? 250 per slice.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>ok so that is unfair I'm picking intentionally unhealthy things...what about uh subway let's be healthy and use boring bread (which no one does) oven roasted chicken with no cheese or dressing 640 for a footlong (<a href="https://fastfoodnutrition.org/subway/oven-roasted-chicken/footlong" target="_blank"><a href="https://fastfoodnutrition.org/subway/oven-roasted-chicken/footlong" target="_blank">https://fastfoodnutrition.org/subway/oven-roasted-chicken/footlong</a></a>) this can easily go up past 800.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Or let's do my order at chipotle shall we? (a double wrapped steak burrito, white rice, cheese, and hot salsa)...1140 calories. And this is somewhere people generally consider as 'healthy'</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>So, cheeky jab aside, none of your calorie estimates seem surprising at all. A meal at a fast food place is probably going to be sized so that it's a bit on the bigger side for sedentary people, but not impossible to fit in your daily calorie budget.</p>
<p>Also, keep in mind that your 2000 kcal/day recommended intake is for <del>people</del> men with sedentary lifestyles. It's not hard to burn a lot more than that if you live a reasonably active life.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You cannot be healthy if the charts say that you are obese. If you are very muscular, you might be in the overweight category on the charts, but not obese. You are in denial about how much fat you are carrying.</p></div>		</li>
