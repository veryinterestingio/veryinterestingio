			<div class="markdown"><p>I have very <em>boring</em> auditory hallucinations due to severe damage in my ear from constant infections in child and early adulthood. Basically my mind tries to interpret any white noise or background sounds into music, so, like, I will hear the noise of a fan or dishwasher as musical notes. Sometimes it is a song I know, and other times a song I’ve never heard, but it isn’t ever a set of discordant notes, always a polished composition.  </p>
<p>It’s the least sexy of the hallucinations - just slightly annoying when you wouldn’t otherwise be listening to a Zeppelin cover by your air conditioner. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got very scared about this because of a bullying teacher (I told her I was listening to the pretty music the trees were making I was 8) and my family doctor said it's basically an extension of pattern seeking behaviour.  The brain's trying to make sense of a lot of nonsense input.  A commonality of successful composers is hearing music in extraneous auditory input (This is your brain on music).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly that. Personally my ears were so damaged that they <em>already</em> spent a lot of time discerning meaning from any kind of sound. If I stopped hearing music in fans and dryers spinning, I’d also stop being able to fake it through conversations with folks who mumble or speak too quietly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m glad I’m not alone. I’ll often be like CAN YOU HEAR THAT SONG!? Or DO YOU HEAR THAT VOICE? It’s always the same response; no. It’s actually infuriating and blocks out my ability to pay attention to what I wish to focus on. Thanks for sharing!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this comment, seriously. I am in my late 20’s and my wife is a nurse, I remember her telling me once that in males schizophrenia can onset in mid to late 20’s. </p>
<p>I have always had auditory illusions. Mostly at night as I am getting ready to go asleep. Sometimes I’ll here what I perceive as my name, but not my inner voice, or my wife’s voice.  99% of the time I can recognize it’s false right away. Occasionally if it happens right as I’m drifting off it can be in nerving for a moment, I also get what someone above linked know as head explosions right as I’m falling asleep, not often, once every month or two I would say, similar with the “voices.” </p>
<p>I have never perceived any of this as “real” or suggestive, but I was still always nervous to tell anyone. </p>
<p>This makes me feel better. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might make you feel better or worse depending on how you take it, but hallucinations (of all types) are associated with a lot of different disorders, including major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, substance abuse disorders (obviously), and sleep disorders (AFAIK because of sleep deprivation).   </p>
<p>Also they sometimes just happen and aren't associated with any disorder. Hence why it's never the sole diagnostic criterion for anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to be a Debbie downer, but that is how my schizophrenia started. But if you're going to bed exhausted it's probably that. Get checked anyway, therapy never hurt anybody.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hypnagogic hallucinations are actually almost universal. It's just part of falling asleep in certain ways. It's no cause for alarm whatsoever or an indicator of an underlying issue, it's just one of the weird things the brain does before sleep.</p>
<p>I actually <em>am</em> schizophrenic, and even though my symptoms have subsided for a few years now, I'll regularly experience these. It's actually comforting, because with these I can tell they're not real. Also, it means that I'm about to finally pass out since it usually takes me quite a bit to actually go to sleep.</p>
<p>The only real problem they ever caused is that a few times my wife actually <em>was</em> calling my name and I didn't respond because I thought it was one of these. Whoopsie.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My therapist explained it like this when I was being tested: psychosis symptoms are on a scale. When healthy people are sleepy, sometimes they see shadows or hear things. Stress can cause it as well. Then it can be caused by a fever, or extreme stress. Then more psychosis level symptoms. I have schizophrenia + STPD, and I don't have delusions (currently) but I have hallucinations all the time and they no longer bother me. Negative symptoms and crawling out of bed in the morning is real shit. Also, regular ol depressed people can have psychosis but I'm not sure if it's less intense or what. </p></div>		</li>
