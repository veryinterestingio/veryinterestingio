			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, this is missing from most of the top comments. The offense decides how long occurs between each play, so they can switch out any personnel they want between any play they want. The defense has to be ready for the next play to start whenever the offense snaps the ball, so they can't swap out personnel between plays as often because it would allow the offense to catch them unready (or with an extra player on the field, which is a penalty).</p></div>		</li>
