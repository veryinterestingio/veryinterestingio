<p>Almost any tree can be a bonsai tree. It's a way of growing trees rather than a type of tree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To add: Almost is the key word. A lot of people think &quot;all&quot; trees can be bonsai (pronounced bohn-sigh) but that would be  incorrect. The term <em>bonsai</em> simply means &quot;tree in pot,&quot; so by those standards, yes the &quot;all trees&quot; statement is true. Good bonsai are trees that in miniature form, can show a sense of age and scale. To do this, they rely on creating characteristics like large trunks with wide radial roots (nebari) and a nice taper and movement going up the tree. Foliage is also developed to be tight and manicured in a way that shows the tree off the best of it's intended style (formal upright, informal upright, cascade, etc.). </p>
<p>The problem with the statement that any tree can be bonsai, is that not all leaves can reduce size with training. With those species, you may have a trunk and branch structure that look OK in miniature form, yet their leaves will be far larger than they should be if in scale with the wood. This would not be GOOD bonsai.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way they plant them stunts their growth. Rocky soil and adverse, but survivable conditions. Basically the roots don't have room to spread out.</p>
<p>Many bonsai start by finding very old, but small trees growing in adverse conditions like a swamp or on the side of a cliff. They bring them home with some of the soil they they grew in and replant them.</p>
<p>The then train them with wire.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is specifically referred to as yamadori, as opposed to a regular bonsai grown from a seedling or other means.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind these trees are not stunted as in deformed, they are perfectly healthy trees. They start as tiny twigs but good bonsai resemble a full grown tree just scaled down. They are totally healthy trees, but they require constant care because the small root base means the tree doesn’t store energy much and cannot quickly absorb water</p></div>		</li>
