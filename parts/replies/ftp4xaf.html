<p>Our bodies don't actually feel a temperature, it feels a sense of heat gain or heat loss. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amusing corollary:  Our bodies don't directly sense heat gain or loss, but rather temperature.</p>
<p>However, it's roughly set up as <skin> - <temperature sensing nerves> - <fleshy bits> - <blood>.  The blood is more or less at constant temperature, which means that the temperature of the sensing nerves is directly proportional to the heat transfer through the fleshy bits separating them from the constant-temperature blood.</p>
<p>This is also part of why there is a time lag between temperature exposure, and feeling it.  If you put a thermal impulse into the outside of the skin, it takes time to travel through the skin, before reaching the nerves.  (Then also time for the neural impulses to travel).  This is why, when testing a surface, you want to quickly tap it, then wait a moment to see if it <em>was</em> hot -- you only find out that information significantly after you're not touching it any more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think my statement holds true then unless you define your thermodynamic system to just be the nerve itself. Your always looking at a difference between the temperature of your blood and the outside environment which means your measuring a flow of energy, either in or out.  </p>
<p>On a side note: does anyone know how temperature sensing nerves measure temperature? You can't measure temperature directly and I am curious how they work mechanically to figure out what the temperature is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's fair.  I'm mostly just amused that it's an A causes B causes A sort of situation.</p>
<p>As for how they work -- amusingly it's not entirely understood.  There are a few potential mechanisms; more than one is probably used.</p>
<ul>
<li>A competing balance of two charge-movement mechanisms with different temperature responses</li>
<li>Reaction rates usually increase with temperature, so ions will be moved faster at higher temperature</li>
<li>TRP channels, which modulate how quickly ions can go through them, as a function of various things (temperature, pain, pressure, etc).</li>
<li>Proteins which undergo a conformational change as a function of temperature</li>
</ul>
<p>We <em>do</em> know that one of these mechanisms causes the neuronal potential to get out of balance, which fires the neuron.  The greater/lower the temperature, the faster that happens, so the more often neurons fire (producing a greater sensation).</p></div>		</li>
