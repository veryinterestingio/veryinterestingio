			<div class="markdown"><p>You can end up awkward or get way too into routine or not communicate properly because of upbringing but autism is completely different. It has more unique disorders that can be eased by training if the person is higher functioning. It's definitely genetics though, if people could be taught to be autistic there'd be a lot more &quot;autists&quot; out there trying to get on social benefits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do not think they meant learnt as in it was taught to them.  Most likely they meant a conditional phasing.  Which I do believe can be a factor along side the genetic aspects.  Trauma (especially in the form of tyranny) is a tangent culprit in society.  </p>
<p>It can require a rigorously delicate environment in order to steer clear of this downward spiral.  And I thoroughly believe it is not the individuals fault, at all!  But rather the misunderstanding from others going on around them.  Some people just do not comprehend the fact that communication can make our (those affected by autism) current perspective literally appear to be sideways/diagonal.  Our world most certainly can benefit from harnessing a freer loving aspiration.  Instead of the forced experiences that seem to be thrown about so recklessly all the time; or even half the time, for any matter.  </p>
<p>Socializing is not meant to be easy; but it most certainly is not meant to be made insanely difficult on another being either.  The world is not perfect, we can all fall prone to such mistakes.  But it is learning from our own mistakes that makes the difference, not repeating what we have always known simply because that seems safe enough as is.  </p>
<p>Most times out of any, stepping outside the box is what makes the difference to me.  But when another being comes along at random to seem to take that away from me, is when discouragement becomes their idol hands.  It is why I either leave the topic alone (the best I can), or allow the approach to change until whatever communication is made clearer.  Life does go on though; and when things become too monotonous to us, we grow agitated, seek change perhaps.  Teaching yourself is where it is at!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of ways that trauma can present (especially in kids) that are similar to autism (e.g. anxiety, difficulty in new/unfamiliar situations, struggles with attachment or emotional regulation, etc.). So some of the symptoms can be &quot;learned&quot; based on your experiences, but that's not the same thing as having Autism (iirc the diagnosis requires symptoms to be present from a certain age because it's considered a developmental disorder)</p>
<p>There's a lot we still don't understand about the brain and how/when/why different disorders develop. However Autism is generally accepted as having a strong neurological component (e.g. differences in sensory processing). We do know the process of neural pruning tends to be delayed (more connections are preserved) in young children with autism, which some people theorize is why stimuli that are neutral for neurotypical people provoke more of a reaction in people with autism. </p>
<p>All that said, autism is primarily diagnosed based on behaviors and symptoms, so there's room for error. It's like if we diagnosed kidney issues based only on how much you pee - some people might have developed kidney disease, others might have been born with Type 1 diabetes, others might not be drinking the correct amount of water. Those are all different things with different causes and treatments, but they might present similarly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your dad is dead wrong. The chances of you developing Autism exist at birth. You can inherit it or it can be because a mutation or injury to the DNA or in utero changes. It is a fundamental difference in the physical structure of the brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since we dont know where it comes from or why causes it, isnt it reasonable to say it's possible that its learnt and not simply genetic?</p>
<p>I agree it seems like a genetic thing but can you actually prove it is?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did research for an autism expert and we looked into antioxidant mechanisms of the brain that may go haywire. No conclusive answer.
I do think that traumatic or guidance experiences can move people one direction or another along the autism spectrum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s conclusive that it ISN’T entirely genetic. If one of a pair of identical twin boys is autistic, the other has about a 75% chance of also being autistic (50% for identical twin girls). Identical twins have identical genes- if it were entirely genetic, you would expect that number to be closer to 100%. There is a significant genetic component, but that’s not the whole picture.</p></div>		</li>
