			<div class="markdown"><p>While I'm sure the ad servers know a lot about us and do have some very clever algorithms, I was hoping someone would bring this up.
Flip the argument round and think of all the random things you mention during the day that are NOT showing up in ads. Coincidence is a powerful thing.
Also, if the as servers are so clever then YouTube would know by now that I have zero interest in getting a Wix site and Amazon would know that I already bought those headphones! Seriously Amazon, I mean, I bought them from you??</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is right.</p>
<p>When creating an advert it's possible to filter so that the ad will not be shown to the whole world (because that would be expensive). You can create filters on age group, gender, location, key words in the content which are on the page etc.</p>
<p>But you probably see hundreds of ads daily and the one you talked about will really stick out.</p>
<p>So the answers saying complicated things like pattern analysis are probably wrong.</p></div>		</li>
