			<div class="markdown"><p>Well we are not really designed for bipedal locomotion. We short of adapted somewhat to it but the vertebrae is more like a rope hanging between two anchor points so what we call “correct posture” is a bunch of recent (evolutionarily speaking) adaptations that tend to work for humans with a lifespan of 50 years (maybe) that sleep on the ground and walk all day. And even then archeological evidence shows that they had severe back problem. </p>
<p>And then came the chair. Oh the chair. It’s so so bad</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, typically those non-muscle using positions are instead leveraging resting on something else in your body.</p>
<p>For example, when you slouch, your muscles are relaxed, but you're putting uneven pressure on the disks in your spine.</p>
<p>That adds up over time to damage.</p></div>		</li>
