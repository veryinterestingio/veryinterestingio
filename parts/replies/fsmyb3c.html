			<div class="markdown"><p>You brought up some interesting cases, such as gold and copper. But one alloy that comes to mind for me is steel. Steel is a combination of carbon and iron, but it is more than that. When these two elements come together you get a whole different animal. steel is made up of components called phases. Some are hard and some are malleable, together you get a material that is tough, meaning that it is strong and can handle impact well.  Most materials don't have this combination of properties at the same time. So, steel is one choice.   </p>
<p>There are also some materials that when you add one ingredient things completely change. Iron rusts. Steel (iron and carbon) rusts. When you add a bit of chromium to steel, it doesn't rust. You get stainless steel. That is pretty amazing to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exposure of aluminum to gallium is an interesting case.  Aluminum baseball bats are hard and resilient.  Gallium is a soft, low melting metal.  But expose the baseball bat to gallium and it becomes a brittle mess, easily crumbled by hand.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXs_pbZyaFg" target="_blank">Here's a video</a>.</p></div>		</li>
