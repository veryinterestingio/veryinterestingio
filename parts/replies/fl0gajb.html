<p>Signing this while washing and don't stop until this verse is done. That's the proper amount of time:</p>

<p>Signing this and washing your hand at the same time would seem pretty hard even if I knew sign language.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not to a lessor extent.  Stay away from people unless absolutely necessary.  Your children <strong><em>should not</em></strong> be having playdates with the neighborhood kids.  You <strong><em>should not</em></strong> be having family over for dinner.  You <strong><em>should not</em></strong> be going to church/gym/movie theaters/bars/etc.</p>
<p>I really don't understand how people still aren't getting this. It's not &quot;avoid people when it's convenient&quot;, it's &quot;avoid people unless you absolutely cannot&quot;.  There's really no grey area here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate to be the akshuallyyyy guy, and I know you’re joking, but lots of peeps do have this mentality, not realizing how practically impossible it is to be completely isolated, and people get dumb in crowds (even online). It’s how trump and Johnson got elected. </p>
<p>Social distancing is the 2nd best method, but only works when you’re also washing.</p></div>		</li>
