			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't this support the idea some creationists have of carbon dating being completely inaccurate about dinosaurs?</p>
<p>Edit: downvoters this comment is relevant to the discussion. It isn't supporting creationism but getting the argument against them (using one of their common lines) spelled out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it absolutely supports the idea that carbon dating is inaccurate for dinosaurs. What creationists don’t know is that scientists don’t use carbon dating for dinosaurs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how are dinosaurs dated? I always heard it as carbon dating.</p>
<p>Edit: I have realized my confusion, I've always heard dinosaurs as being studied using radiometric dating - of which carbon dating is a form of but not the only. They use other isotopes. I mixed them up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be good enough for &quot;older than 10000 years&quot;, of course, but something like &quot;80 +-5 million years&quot; is a much more interesting result from other dating methods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This comes about largely because mainstream reporting on paleontology isn’t good at distinguishing between the dating methods used (and/or paleontologists aren’t good at telling reporters that). “Radiocarbon dating” becomes kind of the generic term, leading to lots of confusion all around. I’m not terribly familiar with the dating methods that <em>are</em> used, so I’ll let someone else speak to that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems to explain the difference between carbon dating and radiometric dating (I got them mixed up) and if I understand correctly they are not measuring the fossils but rather the rock layer in which the fossil is found?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you explain to me how these methods are accurate without knowing the initial amount of a given radioactive material in any given specimen? You may have to ELI3 lol and perhaps I'm mistaken but the method uses the known half life of a given radioactive element to determine the age of a given specimen based on the remaining amount of radioactive element. </p>
<p>The flaw in my simple minded laymen's brain is that without knowledge of the &quot;original&quot; quantity of that radioactive element in the specimen then there can be no way to accurately calculate the specimens age. Obviously when you get to say the level of perhaps grams you could argue that those amounts of radioactive material would be infeasible in a given specimen but that also involves a lot of speculation. I.e. you get to a number of X kilograms (by working backwards using an element's half life) in a dinosaur but we also dont have any realistic understanding of dinosaur biological responses to know that that much radioactive material would have been survivable by a dinosaur, it's similar to how we use mice or other animals to develop human medicines but that's because we've studied mice extensively and can make accurate scale ups from mice trials. We dont have that data on dinosaurs, or do we?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't even the only game-ending issue with carbon-dating fossils. The major issue is that fossils don't tend have any fucking carbon in them. Or, more accurately, they don't tend to have carbon that was being exchanged with the atmosphere when the animal that they came from was alive. That's why we use other dating methods. There was an incident years ago when some creationist sent a fossil off to be carbon dated and it came back as like 8 thousand years old - what they didn't realise is that this is a fossil that was dug up 8,000 years ago and made into something else. When the lab received it, they carbon dated the only bit of it that they could carbon date, which was a bit of ash (I think? Might have been something else) on the surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most fossils aren't dated with C-14 anyway.  Other isotopic systems are used on rocks that are associated with the fossils.  Whether carbon is present or not is therefore irrelevant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, we have multiple methods of dating things. Each of these methods are good for some things and bad for others. For example, Carbon-14 dating is only good for dating formerly living things within certain date ranges. Attempts to use it to measure other things and you'll get bizarre answers.</p>
<p>Those aren't problems because it's not supposed to be used for measuring those things anyway. You wouldn't use a teaspoon to measure out a gallon of something and you wouldn't use a gallon jug to measure out a teaspoon of something. Doesn't mean those tools are inherently inaccurate or bad, just that they have a scope within which they are accurate.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these different dating methods overlap. For example, Carbon Dating overlaps with Dendrochronology (counting tree rings). Where different dating methods overlap, we can use them the validate each other. If either or both are wrong in some way, we would expect significant disagreement. If they both agree on the dates of things within their appropriate ranges, this gives us confidence that they're both right as the alternative (they're both wrong but coincidentally give the same readings) is highly unlikely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason for that is mathematical:</p>
<p>C14 has a half-life of 5730 years. 50000 years is roughly 9 half-lifes which means your sample contains 0.5^9 = 1/512 of the original amount of C14. As C14 itself is the rarest of the 3 isotopes at 10^-9 % at the start. After 50000 years there is simply not much left in there to accurately measure an age.</p></div>		</li>
