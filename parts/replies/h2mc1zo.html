			<div class="markdown"><p>This, I think, is how it’s manifesting in me. Nobody noticed in school because, when there’s an external structure around me telling me what to do, I do ok. But when there isn’t…when <strong>I</strong> need to self-motivate, make my own intentions and follow through, I’m paralyzed. I don’t start. </p>
<p>Part of it is because the future often doesn’t quite “exist” to someone with ADHD. It’s always “now.” That foresight to continually work towards a future goal can be extremely difficult because it feels so nebulous. It always gets put off because doing what feels good now is more important. In other words, you’re very near sighted when it comes to time. </p>
<p>You know what you should do, but you don’t, because it is very hard to do what you intend to do, because like trying to use your bicycle indoors in a Pokémon game, there’s a part of your brain that says “it’s not time for that right now.”</p>
<p>It’s very poorly named; it’s more like Executive Function Disorder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth noting it isn't JUST being able to maintain focus, but can also include the inability to remove focus from a task. If I am reading and you start talking to me, 90% I am NOT hearing you. I'm not ignoring you intentionally, but my ADHD brain doesn't register that the new stimulus (you talking) is something I should pay attention to... So I don't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is so super recognizable, I (am going) went through the same process and it just kept me from living the life I wanted to live. It is a constant struggle, but there is something that works for me</p>
<p>Automization</p>
<p>I have been trying to minimize the mental steps I need to take every day, since trying to get me to do something is extremely difficult. For example, I eat the same breakfast every day, with small variations (oatmeal with yoghurt and a choice of raisins/almonds/coconutflakes/cacoa nibs/other nuts/ etc. and mix it up), I wear almost the same outfit to work every day, my morning routine is identical everyday and I can move it with 30 minutes to fit the day, etc. etc. etc. The more you can do on autopilot, the more mental energy you have left to deal with the other things that are hard during the day. </p>
<p>This works negatively as well, since bad habits are super super hard to break. They are your distraction that needs to be minimized. I try to not let them sneak into my daily life and if it does, I need to purposefully change my day/surroundings to not be tempted to do that habit (like blocking Reddit from your laptop/phone/etc.)</p>
<p>Oh and sleep for 8-9 hours, as often as possible, works wonders. Also automatize your sleep routine and set a standard time to go to bed and a standard time to get up. </p>
<p>Here, hope you are happy with advice you never asked for, good day</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This must be why my checklist in work helps me keep my day flowing but when I'm at home I can't start on my own to do list. I need to build some good routines... Building them is the hard part though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The standard bed time and getting up time for me are key. Without it my entire day just dissolves. I end up with the lowest attention span if I don't get up around the same time every morning. I think the biggest thing that has helped me is meditation. </p>
<p>I try to do at least 5-10 minutes a day. This helps to reset my brain as i find so much of my day is just concentrating on concentrating. Taking a few minutes just to slow down purposefully helps me to recollect my thoughts and focus on what I should.</p></div>		</li>
