			<div class="markdown"><p>Another way to help you think of this is the effort to blow up a balloon at the start, vs. How much easier it is a couple breaths later. The recoil in the balloon is much higher when it isn't half filled, requiring greater force to open it. </p>
<p>As an interesting aside, another factor is surfactant. This is a liquid your lungs produce to reduce the surface tension of your lungs. Most babies don't produce this before 36 weeks, and can go into respiratory depression and die if born before that. Luckily some genius created a synthetic kind and babies can breathe</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, I misspoke. I should have said that premature babies are at higher risk of respiratory distress because they might not have produced enough surfactant, not that they don't produce any. And with increased gestational age the risk of not having enough surfactant significantly decreases, especially at term/37 weeks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer. Forced reduction in residual volume leading to a change in the balance of elastic recoil of lung parenchyma. </p>
<p>Big nerves innervate the diaphragm which lie deep in the chest. Minor chest trauma isn’t going to touch them to cause “diaphragm spasm.” But the idea of muscle spasm is more relatable to the layperson than fairy complex pulmonary mechanics so the diaphragm spasm explanation has propagated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If this was the case, shouldn’t increased diaphragmatic contraction overcome this?  Patients are contracting with full force, but still unable to ventilate.  Why would the passage of time overcome a surface tension issue?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a collapsed alveolus as a single loop in a strip of Velcro. Alveoli collapse intermittently all the time in parts of the lung not being well ventilated, and a single alveolus is quite easy to force back open, overcoming a tiny amount of surface tension to do so. But if you suddenly collapse millions of alveoli because your lung volume has been suddenly forced significantly below residual volume, you’ve just had two large sheets of Velcro stuck together. Unsticking it in the lung means simultaneous re-recruitment is millions of alveolar units with a significant cumulative surface tension. Pulling these velcro sheets apart en-mass would take enormous force. So instead, we start pulling the Velcro at one end, and it becomes easier and easier as we go - initial efforts at breathing re-recruits a small number of alveoli, then more and more, taking a bit of time. Additionally, surfactant will work to re-open alveoli from a chemical surface tension reduction perspective, which also takes a bit of time.</p>
<p>The other consideration here is that this isn’t exactly a hotbed of pulmonary research. This is a phenomenon we all experience, usually as children, and is self-limited and of no long-term consequence. So it is not extremely well studied. For those of us who do pulmonary physiology, the physical inability to ventilate after a sudden decrease in lung volume fits best with the above. Hard to envision why a blow like this would lead to diaphragm spasm - uncontrolled contraction. Further, contraction of the diaphragm moves it down and leads to air going into the lungs; if we hooked an electrode up to your diaphragm and lit it up, you’d breath in, not be locked up and unable to breath. Could something like vocal cord dysfunction be happening in some cases? Sure, I suppose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I second taebeck1's question. I had a terrifying experience when I was a kid : fell off my bike, handle bars whipped around and hit me dead on the solar plexus and I couldn't draw breath for what felt like forever. Thought I was going to die, but I slowly regained my ability to to breathe. I always thought that the diaphragm nerves were stunned, but what you're saying sounds more mechanical?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like those little thin balloons that you make balloon animals from.  If you already have a bit of it blown up, it's relatively easy to inflate the rest. But when none of it is blown up yet, you have to blow much harder to get that initial portion to expand. </p>
<p>Imagine it like that in your lungs except more able to revert to a pre-inflated/stretched state. You usually keep that initial portion inflated/stretched all the time so it is easy to inflate and deflate the rest of the balloon. But if something causes that initial volume to be completely deflated then suddenly you are left with a completely uninflated balloon that you have to try much harder to get the initial inflation going again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless there's something seriously wrong, they should overcome the period of low residual volume very quickly on their own with a few spontaneous breaths. Which is why the feeling of being winded only lasts for like 10 seconds. If they are injured enough that they can't at least muster a few measly spontaneous breaths to restore some residual volume, there are much bigger problems on hand and they probably do need rescue breaths, CPR, and so on.</p></div>		</li>
