			<div class="markdown"><p>They're stitched back together with very fine suture. Unfortunately that doesn't stop the downstream axons from dying, it primarily functions to leave a tract of support cells for the neurons to use as they slowly regrow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if one gets their limb/finger chopped off and then reattached by surgeons, there will be some irreversible damage and paresis, no matter the circumstances? Is it possible for a limb to work perfectly fine after surgery and recovery just like before?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a big difference between an arm and a finger. It takes a year or more for nerves to grow back down an arm to their endings, and some motor and sensory impairments may be permanent, but the main goal is the quality of function. I’ve seen some failures where the surgeon realised later that amputation (or non-reattachment) and a prosthesis would have given the patient better function, with less surgery and more rapid rehabilitation, but that’s difficult to predict at the time of injury. Their training is to try to save the limb. The trouble is that later no one will ever allow the amputation of a non-functioning arm to get a good prosthesis.</p></div>		</li>
