			<div class="markdown"><p>Ianadr but I can tell you from my own research bc of my immune disorder.<br />
Although it depends on the person, on average immunoglobulin (IGG) used by the body to fight off viral and bacterial infections begins to slowly drop starting at about age 30.<br />
(Usually)The older you get the more your IGG drops, making you more susceptible to virus and bacteria. Your body contains a small amount of pneumonia already (as well as other naturally occurring bacteria) which a healthy immune system keeps in check.<br />
Without a proper functioning immune system, the body is overrun and cannot fight off virus or infection.<br />
The covid19 causes a respiratory flu that develops into a pneumonia (which can be either viral or bacterial). At this point the lungs are swollen and taking on fluid and cannot move oxygen into the blood stream. It’s possible older ppl could have a primary viral pneumonia and a secondary bacterial pneumonia. They literally suffocate because their lungs can’t move oxygen in.<br />
This is why the high need for ventilators. It is also why Italy has stopped giving ventilators to ppl over 60. Younger ppl have a higher chance of recovering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do, it's called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracorporeal_membrane_oxygenation" target="_blank">ECMO or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation</a>. It's super invasive — you need to put pretty big tubes into major veins and arteries and pump a lot of blood through the machine —  so it's pretty risky. But it <em>is</em> used for COVID-19 patients if their lungs completely stop working.</p>
<p>I don't have a source handy, but I've read that it has about a 50% survival rate for COVID-19. Of course, you don't get put on ECMO unless you're already in a pretty bad state.</p></div>		</li>
