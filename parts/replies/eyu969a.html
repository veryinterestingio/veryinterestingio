			<div class="markdown"><p>They're used today in amputations. Even the best surgical techniques will take some living tissue with the dead whereas maggots will only eat the dead tissue. They're bred in labs in sanitary conditions, it's not like hospitals are just rooting around in dumpsters to find maggots.</p>
<p>Surgeons leave a flap of skin to be folded over the stump when they amputate a limb. If necrosis is a concern they'll seal a few maggots in there under the flap and remove them later.</p></div>		</li>

Honey bandages are also a big thing in vet med.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How did somebody think of that? Did they try putting random stuff to wounds to see what helps until of all the things they tried bread that's going bad?</p></div>		</li>

<p>“Maggots? Why the hell do you keep pushing that one? Let’s go back to that bread idea. No, no, not that one. I just got that this morning. Look in the back. There is a half loaf of pumpernickel I was going to toss anyways.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall reading a book about a Civil War prison—I think Andersonville, but I could easily be wrong—where the Confederate soldiers were given lint to keep away the maggots, while the Union soldiers were left to rot.  Eventually, it was impossible not to notice that the Union soldiers were doing better in their recoveries.  </p>
<p>I could easily have the wrong prison, because for some reason I think it was the Union prisoners who got the lint and the Confederates who didn’t, which would not have been the case at Andersonville.  But regardless, a similar scenario would have played out countless times throughout history.</p></div>		</li>
