			<div class="markdown"><p>This perspective on USPS finances and the 2006 law is partly true and partly misleading. It's true that the law made things worse, but even before the situation was not great. For more detail please see this:</p>

<p>none of that is accurate. Firstly, the USPS has 50 years to cover their health retirement fund, so it's disingenuous to frame it as if they had to put 100 billion down. </p>
<p>They had a front-loading plan and had to pay ~5bill/year for the 2006-2016 decade, but they defaulted on half of those payments, so at the end of the day when you don't make a payment you can't blame the payment you never made for being short on cash. After 2016, they are only required to make discretionary amortization payments. Last year for example, they were supposed to contribute ~$800mil towards the fund, but they defaulted on the contribution and didn't pay a dime. So without even losing any operating budget, they still incurred a $8billion loss. Even worse, last year they even defaulted on the current payments for retiree health benefits, meaning that what the mandate sought to prevent from happening 75 years into the future is already happening (employees being unable to claim benefits they are owed and for which they worked for).</p>
<p>And secondly, they absolutely <strong>are not</strong> paying retirement for employees who aren't even born yet. They are only required to cover the <strong>past and current</strong> promises they made to their employees.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So that means they haven't defaulted on half of those payments? If you think that law did not add significant and unnecessary financial stress on the USPS I don't know what to tell you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why would it mean that? I can't see how you're reading it to mean that...And I'm not sure why you'd even challenge something so easy to google, it was all over the news each time it happened and the USPS even includes this information in their yearly financial statements. </p>

<p>I'm responding to &quot;<em>If not for that, there would be no money troubles with the post office whatsoever.</em>&quot; When a company looses $8 billion, you can't blame it on a payment of $800million which they haven't even made. The math simply doesn't add up. </p>
<p>As for the financial stress being unnecessary, please explain to me why the financial stress in this situation should instead be on the employee's shoulders. If your employer is paying you deferred compensation, you shouldn't have to worry about whether the payment you're working hard for now will be there when you're old, unable to work and need it.</p></div>		</li>
