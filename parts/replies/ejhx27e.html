<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The researchers have a long way to go to demonstrate that the oriental wasp is solar-powered, says Parker. The team hasnâ€™t shown that xanthopterin is linked to production of ATP, the energy-storing molecule of cells. And any number of pigments might eke out some electricity if stuck in a dye-sensitized solar cell. -Rachel Ehrenberg &quot;Molecule&quot;</p>

<p>This evolution is certainly fascinating but likely has more to do with the heat requirements insects have for activity in temperate regions, and not any lack of chemical energy.</p>
