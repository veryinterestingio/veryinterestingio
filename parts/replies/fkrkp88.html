<p>Essentially it depends on how much the liquid is attracted to itself (liquid molecule to liquid molecule) vs the molecules on the surface.</p>
<p>If it has a high amount of attraction to the surface and low attraction to itself, it can have a very low contact angle, or perfect wetting.  <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Surface_tension.svg/700px-Surface_tension.svg.png" target="_blank">Example: Image to the right is perfect wetting</a></p></div>		</li>
