Could it be possible in the future to &quot;isolate&quot; the loose screws or have screwdrivers that are so precise that they only target the intended screws?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if the drug is perfect for one person, people are not consistent, and someone else might have a very different reaction. </p>
<p>Or it might work differently based on what you ate last night(for example, blood thinners and foods with vitamin k). </p>
<p>To make a drug work perfectly, you'd basically have to give it a brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely possible with implants in the future. However, implants are difficult to keep in the body and hard to test. Your body tends to treat any foreign substance as a threat so the implant has to be made of specific materials. These materials also break down over time.</p>
<p>It's also difficult to test implants which need to stay in the body for years. How can you say something is safe for the body for years without waiting that many years? Your company would probably run out of money before the test finishes. Many implants may be tested for a few years and be okay-ed for wide-spread use only to have terrible side effects later on (early hip implants).</p>
<p>Definitely an interest but very hard challenge.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some antibody drugs are extremely specific, but also tend to have some insane prices.</p></div>		</li>
