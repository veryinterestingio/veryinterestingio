			<div class="markdown"><p>The decent insulater is actually the near vacuum of space here that only allows the loss of heat over radiation. </p>
<p>No core can lose &quot;a lot of&quot; heat over radiation directly as long as the planet has a solid shell.</p>
<p>Technically the crust radiates more heat into space than the surface covered with water as water directly blocks heat radiation (its a much better insulator then the &quot;naked&quot; crust)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right about the radiation.</p>
<p>However, it's still the crust that prevents most of the direct (non-radiant) heat transfer before the vacuum of space comes into play very much. Otherwise, we'd all burn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the non-radiant heat transfer wouldn't leave the planet though, it would heat up the athmosphere which is funny because air is a very good insulater for that, but then air would transfer heat back to the crust as it connot transfer heat to vacuum of space. At least I'm not aware if our air is able to radiate heat.</p></div>		</li>
