<p>So say tomorrow you set a toxic waste barrel on the seafloor in the subduction trench off the coast of Japan. 100 years from now, it's exactly where you put it, absolutely nothing's changed. 1000 years from now, it's moved a few paces away, having survived a colossal earthquake or two. 10,000 years from now, after countless earthquakes, it's maybe a few feet down in the mud. 100,000 years from now, it's pretty deeply buried. ...</p>

<p>Thousands to millions of years in which nothing happens is pretty much ideal for waste disposal. At the end of that time, all you've got is a lode of depleted-uranium ore, spiced with various stable isotopes that used to be fission products.</p>
<p>Though &quot;setting it on the seafloor&quot; isn't right; you'd want to drop sturdy, pointed canisters with enough speed to embed themselves in the sediment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point being, though that a subduction zone is no better than any other random bit of seafloor, and in fact worse because of earthquakes.</p>
<p>There are other problems with seafloor waste storage (corrosion etc) that apply regardless.</p></div>		</li>
