			<div class="markdown"><p>Rather than a drug which increases metabolism (or decreases appetite) could you not instead somehow retard digestion or calorie absorption such that a proportion of the calories you eat come straight out as a massive shit instead of heat?</p>
<p>That way you'd still feel hungry as normal, still be able to eat as normal, and your body would burn the calories it <em>does</em> absorb as normal. You'd just pass much of the calories straight through without absorbing them.</p>
<hr />
<p>EDIT: Or something that simply slows down digestion so you eat less because you feel full for longer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is my area of research at work. There are plenty of options to achieve this, each with their own set of drawbacks. </p>
<p>The golden standard are the 4 surgeries that one can have. Most of them involve suturing parts of your stomach to half it’s volume, bypassing your duodenum (reroute stomach contents directly to a lower part of the intestines, skipping some areas like the duodenum to encourage malabsorption...etc). These procedures however have a lot of adverse effects and are difficult to reverse. They can cause serious issues for some people and are only recommended/performed if you meet very specific conditions. </p>
<p>There are plenty of upcoming technologies that limit these adverse effects albeit have a much lower efficacy for total weight loss. These include things like temporary balloons placed in your stomach, having a device that stimulates muscle contraction(to recreate the sensation of feeling full), surgically ablating (burning) parts of your lower intestines so nothing gets absorbed there, etc.</p>
<p>All these procedures involve quite a bit of risk and are usually not performed unless you have documented history of trying lifestyle interventions with no success, obese BMI etc.</p>
<p>Edit: Since there are more people interested in this, a bit more information on the current standard of care. The general approach to these surgeries follow the following order. The patient will first have to have documented lifestyle interventions that didn't work. Then they will be switched to a pharmaceutical option. If none of these work, they will be evaluated for surgical intervention. The problem is that most bariatric surgery patients have co-mormobities like hypertension, Type 2 Diabetes etc, making surgeries even more riskier. Even if they are still candidates for surgeries, the difficult part of US healthcare is insurance. Most insurances in the US list bariatric surgery as a cosmetic option, thereby not allowing it to be reimbursed. Its only if your condition is &quot;dangerous&quot; and there is no alternative option, can you be eligible for a reimbursement. This is a dangerous precedence to set because some patients who could do well with a surgery when their BMI is around 30-35 will be denied payments and will have to wait till they have a more serious issue, to become eligible for reimbursement, making the procedure even more riskier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2,4 - DNP is one hell of a scary drug. How it works is that it disrupts your body's ability to create ATP - our fuel source. In our mitochondria, there is a process called the electron transport chain where hydrogen ions are shuttled to one side of a membrane creating a potential gradient. Because of the higher concentration of hydrogen ions on one side, they have potential and 'want' to move back to the other side to create equilibrium.  They move back to the other side of the membrane via an ATP synthase protein. This ATP synthase spins like a propeller when hydrogen atoms flow through it and converts ADP (spent energy) to ATP (new energy). Without this ADP to ATP conversation, life isn't possible. Now, this 2,4- DNP molecule messes this up by transporting the hydrogen ions back to their initial side without going through the ATP synthase so there isn't a potential gradient anymore and ADP cannot be converted back to ATP. </p>
<p>To break this down more, imaging a dam with a high water level on one side and a low water level on the other. The water is going to flow from the high to low side until the two water levels are equal (equilibrium). Now imagine the dam has a propeller that spins when the water flows through which makes energy (converting ADP to ATP). Now imaging the dam has a hole in it so the water flows to the lower part of the dam without going through the propeller (the hole is 2,4 - DNP). Without the water going through the propeller, you don't get any energy and the system being powered by this dam is going to shut down depending on how large this hole is (how much 2,4-DNP is in your body). </p>
<p>2,4-DNP is scary stuff because it can 100% shut down your body and there isn't really anything that can be done about it to reverse the effects while the drug is in your system. When it first came out and was advertised as a weight loss supplement, people died from taking too much or had permanent damage because it literally starves your body and prevents it from functioning. Definitely do not recommend no matter how desperate you are to lose weight. It's not worth your life or terrible lifelong side effects.</p>
<p>Source: my current PhD work is on ionophore behavior in lipid membranes. Ionophores are small biomolecules that transport ions from one side of a membrane to the other. 2,4-DNP is an ionophore that transports hydrogen ions.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding was that one of the major risk factors and why it can never ever be an OTC drug is that its effects have a slow ramp-up time and will persist for a week or more after you take it; there's no &quot;oh wait, use drug X if you're starting to over-heat&quot; solution to it.</p>
<p>One fact that always blew my mind is that on a normal day we produce ATP approximately equal to our body weight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coincidently, I actually work with sodium cyanide in my lab and conduct all the training to work with it so I am well versed in cyanide poisoning as well. Cyanide binds to ferric ions within cytochrome oxidase three which is one of the proteins in the electron transport chain responsible for pumping the hydrogen ions to the other side of the membrane creating the hydrogen potential gradient. Cytochrome oxidase three undergoes <a href="https://files.mtstatic.com/site_4334/127703/0?Expires=1609104384&amp;Signature=ogepiTpBA0nQsYGMISiw90iqA3~QoTsRwRcGnN6cMZutyDy7B8j2WsqaitljFDtgt8NmlKiv4MrfGyR3LZifFkM4NZbCYAdkJQSNQ8Ep0SwPoJ3mjSnu-e9tT9Jcsfsz~KcwI0z2AwqP8VAamrrH7G4UbtDO~34nJJUB2uIeElk_&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJ5Y6AV4GI7A555NA" target="_blank">this oxygen reduction reaction</a> combining hydrogen and oxygen ions to make water with two extra hydrogen ions that are transported to the opposite side of the membrane. By binding to the ferric ions, cyanide prevents the oxygen reduction reaction from happening resulting in less hydrogen ions in the potential gradient, resulting in slower/reduced ATP production.</p>
<p>It's very similar to DNP in that it disrupts the electron transport chain and ATP production, but it just prevents the proper formation of the hydrogen gradient in the first place instead of undoing the work of the electron transport chain like DNP does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea that's probably an accurate summary. They both essentially cause toxicity and cell damage due to a lack of sufficient ATP, although  DNP also causes damage due to excesive heat released.</p>
<p>DNP causes a lack of ATP by decreasing the proton motive force, so ADP cannot be phosphorylated into ATP, essentially decoupling ATP synthesis from oxidation. Oxidation still occurs and creates energy, but that energy isn't converted into the chemical energy of the last phosphate bond of ATP as it should be, so instead it gets released as heat. </p>
<p>Cyanide instead inhibits a key enzyme needed by the electron transport chain, which is the process whereby a number of redox reactions occur, resulting in the oxidation of oxygen molecules to water. This oxidation provides the energy to drive protons out of the inner mitochondrial membrane against an electrochemical gradient, essentially transferring the energy of reaction (oxygen to water) to a potential energy stored in the protons, with that energy finally being transfered to chemical bond energy in ATP by powering the enzyme ATP synthase. </p>
<p>So the main difference is, with DNP, oxidation still proceeds normally through the end, but DNP allows the protons driven outside the membrane to immediately fall back down their gradient, so the potential energy from oxidation is released as heat rather then powering ATP synthase. Cyanide stops cellular oxidation before it finishes, so there isn't enough energy present at any time to force a proton gradient to form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>lisdexamphetamine (most people know as vyvanse) is actually approved for treatment of binge eating disorder.
I take it for ADHD which is what it was invented for but the scientists must have noticed how effective it is at cutting appetite and expanded the usage. Obviously most stimulants reduce your appetite but let me tell you-- vyvanse literally eliminates it. I've taken adderal, ritalin, focalin and pure generic d-amphetamine and they all made me less hungry but vyvanse straight up knocked out the urge to eat.
Lost 1/3 of my body weight in 4 months when i started taking it and then i had to be more mindful to eat more dense/nutritious foods. </p>
<p>I know doctors would never put overweight people on stims purely for weight loss but damn it would be effective</p></div>		</li>
