			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really... the center of mass of the Earth-Sun system is closer to the Sun (the heaviest object), but the L1 point is closer to Earth. A halo orbit is orbiting L1 close to Earth, not the barycenter close to the Sun.</p>
<p>What you're describing would make sense if the other planets did not exist, and you had a satellite very, very far away from the Sun, so that the Earth-Sun distance is negligible with respect to the satellite's orbital radius. At this point I would agree, the satellite would be orbiting the Sun-Earth center of mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it wouldn’t be an Earth orbit, I just mentioned it for the sake of completeness. Orbiting Earth while staying in Earth’s shadow is impossible pretty much by definition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically it’s orbiting L2. When we put a spacecraft at a Lagrange point it’s actually orbiting that point as if there were another body there.</p></div>		</li>
