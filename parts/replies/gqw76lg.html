			<div class="markdown"><p>And they can't see or smell much. They spend a long time cleaning the smoke from their bodies.<br />
As said elsewhere, they also respond to smoke by forging and hoarding, as if in a forest fire. They go docile because their evolutionary experience has taught them that fire also removes predators.<br />
Edit: gorging, not forging. You guys are too quick for me today.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In general, the keeper knows how to handle them, how to not trigger their defenses</p>

<p>I've also heard beekeepers can sense the mood of the hive (some days they are more aggressive, other days more calm) so they can wait until a day when they are more calm to handle them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When they get really annoyed they start to release an attack pheromone that makes them more aggressive and it has a very distinctive fake-banana kind of smell. I'm sure there are other more subtle indicators too but I don't have that much experience with them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, definitely. Each hive also has some kind of distinctive personality. Some are more defensive than others, for example. </p>
<p>I have one particular hive that just goes wild if anything moves close to it when it's sunny, but will be pretty chill during overcast days.</p></div>		</li>
