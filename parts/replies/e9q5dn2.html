			<div class="markdown"><p>It does indeed vary. I had a sleep study done (I have RLS and PLMD) and it takes me hours to get into REM, where it should take an hour max.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can probably vary by person, but also I’ve heard/read your behavior before sleep can affect it too. Looking at screens, eating, exercising right before bed, or things like caffeine can all make it harder to sleep I’d imagine.</p>
<p>I have developed a habit of falling asleep with the tv on. I enjoy it, but I also recognize I probably have less productive sleep cycles than I otherwise could</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree 100%, any duration nap leaves me feeling awful. A 20 minute nap would result in me being slightly more tired than before but waking up with my heart racing and my eyelids 5x heavier. I envy people who can nap and feel good, takes me a solid full night's sleep to stop feeling tired.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Reminder that caffeine totally fucked up some people. Naps totally fuck up others. Others still pretty much can never take a short nap because they won't fall asleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sadly, neither works for me. Caffeine triggers my anxiety and naps only gets me waaaay more tired than before, makes me moody and gives me headaches. Not worth it!</p></div>		</li>
