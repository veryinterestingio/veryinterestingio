			<div class="markdown"><p>It appears to genuinely be a carryover from Jenner’s initial testing back at the end of the 1700s. This is an interesting study (albeit with a minuscule sample size) suggesting the inner arm might actually be a better location: </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve read a couple of reasons.<br />
1.) the smallpox vaccine was eventually made compulsory in many parts of the world and the scar acted as proof of having been vaccinated.  Apparently other areas were considered but the arm was ultimately decided to be the most socially acceptable place for a scar you might be asked to show someone.<br />
2.) when you receive the vaccine you can accidentally spread it by scratching the vaccination site then scratching other areas of the body which will cause inflammation and scarring in other areas (apparently the face and especially the eyes were a great concern) and they found less complications of this when putting the vaccine on the arm as opposed to other areas of the body.</p>
<p>[edit] as a note, many people were apparently against vaccinations from the very start, hence the need for proof of having been vaccinated.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Which is why the inside of the arm would be a worse choice because it rubs against your body?</p></div>		</li>
