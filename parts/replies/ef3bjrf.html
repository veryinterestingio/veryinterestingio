<p>The &quot;official nomenclature&quot; is usually Zero but it's a common colloquialism to refer to scoring nothing as going home with a goose egg. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>New Zealand. A duck is a cricket term, it means going out for 0 runs (or points) which in cricket is pretty embarrassing. A golden duck is going out on the first ball faced, which would be like the first pitch in baseball. The difference being that the batsmen generally stay in for as long as possible. They only stop by going out or at the end of the match.</p>
<p>Anyone who casually follows cricket would know what it means. Cricket has a lot of jargon like that.</p></div>		</li>
