			<div class="markdown"><p>Also for super small animals, they can develop a set of equation based on environment and predators, so they can measure the population of the whole chain without actually counting all the species while retaining a decent accuracy.</p>
<p>If the anteater's population increase, the ant population most likely increased too</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Biologist here, we can also do mark-recapture studies where we go, catch all the animals in an area, mark them with paint or something, and then come back later and count to see how many of the animals in the later time are marked. if there are a high amount of marked animals, the population is pretty small, but if the number is low, the population is larger. (There are of course limitations to this though!)</p></div>		</li>
