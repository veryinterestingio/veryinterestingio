			<div class="markdown"><p>This is me, it started from my health anxiety back in December 2018. Turned into a death anxiety after my Grandfather died in January last year, and shortly after turned into existential anxiety. Honestly 2019 felt so long because I really hate it when it’s already night time because that means I will have to sleep again and it’s the time when my anxiety peaks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've found that doing multiplication tables backwards is really helpful.
I'm no maths whiz or anything, so instead of ruminating on issues- the brain power gets used up on the next number.
It's a silly thing  but it works really well for me.</p></div>		</li>
