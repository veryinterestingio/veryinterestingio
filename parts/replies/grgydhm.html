			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great question. I think that approaches like adaptive therapy have great promise for turning cancer from an acute disease to a chronic disease. Adaptive therapy was pioneered by Robert Gatenby at Moffitt Cancer Center, and the idea of it is to treat advanced cancer in a way that maintains it as a stable size rather than treating it to eradicate it. This avoids the evolution of drug resistance, which makes it possible to keep treating the tumor with the same drug for the long term. It has been successful in mouse models and in clinical trials with prostate cancer. Here's a link to the paper about the clinical trial if you want to learn more:  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01968-5" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01968-5" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01968-5</a></a></p></div>		</li>
