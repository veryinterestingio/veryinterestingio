<blockquote>
<p>The women of this project align themselves as bearded ladies in a metaphorical sense: a long history of women accused of possessing too many “masculine” traits such as an education, a desire for independence, and the pursuit of nonheteronormative gender roles. While these women do not experience the material realities of hirsutism or hypertrichosis, they do exercise the types of gender disruptions that have followed the bearded lady as metaphor and lived reality in Western cultures for centuries.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for sharing the info on the webpage. The Bearded Lady Project started as a joke between friends trying to establish themselves in male-dominated careers (paleontology and filmmaking). Lexi Jamieson Marsh and I were having dinner and venting a bit about how much harder things are for us than for our male colleagues, and I made the crack, &quot;At the next faculty meeting, I should just go in wearing a beard and then people will listen to my ideas.&quot; Lexi ran with that idea, thinking that we should have me do this in the field, and we could make a short YouTube Video. That spiraled into recruiting other female paleontologists, and all of a sudden we became an international movement and produced a documentary film and traveling photography exhibit. For those of you in southwestern Ohio, come check us out on Thursday night at Miami University!</p>
<p>Psychologist Amanda Diekman wrote a fabulous essay for our exhibition booklet, and I'd like to share an excerpt with you:</p>
<p>&quot;The Bearded Lady Project challenges conscious and nonconscious expectations about who paleontologists are, what field work entails, and what science is. These portraits highlight how difficult it can be to fit to implicit and explicit demands of a particular role. The beard on a field site is a symbol of how long you’ve been out there, how much time away from civilization and immersed in science you have spent. It signifies to the self, colleagues, and the world that you belong in this role – that you have the ruggedness, the fortitude, and the physical and psychological strength to persist.</p>
<p>The beard explicitly and overtly marks who belongs and who does not, and it is a marker that is generally not available or accepted for women to display. Other markers of belonging are not so explicit nor so easily visually recognized. This project guides us to ask what these other subtle and overt cues to belonging might be. The question for those who want to open the doors to science is how institutional policies and norms, and interpersonal practices, both uphold and challenge beliefs about who belongs in science. These beliefs are important in piquing interest in science, in helping people persist despite challenges, and in advancing people to the heights of the profession.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you have a link to that event?  Not sure if I can make it, but I'm in Dayton, so not too far away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mentioned this to my statistics PhD friend just now, and she said she disagrees with it wholeheartedly, because it's giving in to the notion that science is <em>in fact</em> a masculine field. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I invite everyone to go online, read more about our project, and also check out our images: <a href="http://thebeardedladyproject.com/portraits/" target="_blank">http://thebeardedladyproject.com/portraits/</a>. What is your reaction?</p>
<p>One of the fabulous things about collaborating with artists is that it starts conversations like the one we're having right now. Photographer Kelsey Vance created these beautifully provocative images that invite you to think, challenge biases and stereotypes, and talk about your opinions with others. There are so many different ways to interpret our project, and we love hearing about them! I've been floored by the very thoughtful and insightful analyses I've heard at our various events.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What does she disagree with? STEM fields <em>are</em> masculine in that they are largely male-dominated (see the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2018/nsb20181/figures" target="_blank">2018 NSF science and engineering indicators</a>, if I'm interpreting the figures correctly). Isn't that what the project is challenging (as opposed to the idea that STEM is inherently masculine)? </p>

<p>The Bearded Lady Project seeks to empower women in traditionally male-dominated fields as well as the hyperfeminized standard of beauty still portrayed in the media.</p>
