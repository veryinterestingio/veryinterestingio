			<div class="markdown"><p>On a bit of a similar note, my childhood dentist would pinch and wiggle the cheek back and forth during the numbing shots. After having to go to a horrible dentist, it's the only place in town that took Medicare, I realized just how much that little trick works!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! I’m sure distraction is helpful, too. Thankfully as my daughter gets older, she handles it better. But she used to need to be held down and would scream bloody murder. We had to bribe her with toys, too. Enter Buzzy (and sometimes child life specialists), and now they are a breeze. We still let her shop for a toy afterward since no kid should have to deal with what she does. She’s a tough cookie. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dentist would do that too. It definitely helped. </p>
<p>He also injected SLOWLY. He believed that the fast injection was also a cause of pain so sometimes I'd be sitting in the chair for minutes with the entire length of the needle in my gums as he's wiggling my cheek and bit by bit pressing down on the plunger. It's such an odd and long sensation that I would almost rather have the 5 seconds of pain. </p>
<p>He was also very thorough and would use at least 3 syringes to numb me and would give me injections throughout the procedure if I had any reaction to anything he'd do. Part of me was thankful but that shit would last the rest of the day and I wouldn't be able to eat or drink without it falling out of my mouth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ask your dentist for the numb stuff - no idea what it's called though. It's just a gel they rub on so you don't feel the needle. My dentist doesn't use it by default, but I won't sit my arse in his chair until he pulls it out of the drawer =P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick explanation on why it works: Vibrations activate the nerve endings, and the stronger vibration impulses take priority over the ever so slight sting of the needle, so the pain &quot;drowns&quot; in all the other information being sent through the sensory receptors.  </p>
<p>It's like talking over someones whisper. The sound is still there, but your brain can't hone in on it due to the louder more pressing noise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an example, if you smash your finger, bump your elbow, etc. you generally rub whatever is sore- this activates multiple nerve endings in a similar way and you feel less pained</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some diseases are congenital and not related to lifestyle. I have Alport's Syndrome, which means the base membrane of my kidneys (the part that filters the waste from your blood) didn't develop properly and it overtasked the kidneys until they were pretty useless. I was diagnosed at 8 years old, went on dialysis at 24, and got a transplant this year at 29. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately my daughter had a malformation in both of her ureters and her kidneys were damaged before she was even born. My son, born 5 years later, had the same malformation. So apparently it’s genetic for us. In most cases, the issue resolved itself with no long-term repercussions, but my daughter’s was so severe that it permanently damaged her kidneys. My son luckily had full resolution. But they expected him to have the same prognosis as my daughter. Definitely sucks, but they are amazing kids and I’m lucky to be their mom!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this! I have experience with most of these and was really surprised to not see others talking about it. I’m a bit surprised this isn’t upvoted more already. I asked for the cold numbing spray all the time when I would do my weekly IV’s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait. You can request that? Because they end up poking me searching for a place for the IV at least 3 times each visit. They never give me numbing stuff or a buzzy bee! I go in for infusion treatments every 2 months.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you’re a hard stick the cold can make your veins harder to locate. My old infusion nurse used to give me a lidocaine shot and that worked, but the cold spray has never led to a successful IV in my experience. The lidocaine still required a shot so it was more a personal preference for her so she could take her time without worrying about me.</p>
<p>Full disclosure: I’m a notoriously hard stick. I’m dehydrated due to my disease and apparently I’m “valvy”. Plus weeks as an inpatient with multiple daily blood draws caused scar tissue to form in the normal IV places so I’m not your average patient. Normal people are probably good to go with the spray.</p>
<p>High five, fellow infusion buddy!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Mind you, I had a nurse talk to me about some super esoteric stuff before giving me a shot. I was so perplexed that I completely forgot the needle. I also find that if you breath in when the needle goes in it seems to hurt a little less.</p></div>		</li>

Ever since, I've laughed in the face of needles. Hell, I can tell you where you'll have the best luck getting a cooperative vein.</p></div>		</li>
