			<div class="markdown"><p>No. They are considered a class b combustible and require a specific use case. Airplanes also use these for most smaller aircraft in case of depressurization. International flights still have oxygen tanks because of the size, but ICAO and FAA regulations differ slightly with regard to O2 per Passenger per minute requirements. Typically it's 30 minutes for airlines per Passenger, activated by pulling the core on your face mask which starts a &quot;flare-like&quot; ignition for the candle burning. Smells awful, but it's better than suffocating at 30k feet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most flights don't have tanks for passenger oxygen, they use oxygen candles. A few flights do have to carry oxygen bottles for emergency depressurization use, but they're limited to flights that go over the Himalayas, since they can't descend to a safe altitude within 30 minutes of a depressurization event.</p>
<p>Captain Joe on Youtube actually just did a great video that covers the emergency oxygen system on most aircraft: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XESkuyWomqc" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XESkuyWomqc</a></p></div>		</li>
