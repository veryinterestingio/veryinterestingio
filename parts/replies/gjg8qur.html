			<div class="markdown"><p>plastics engineering technology.  I went through a 2+2 program, so ended up with an associates degree and a bachelor's degree.  The program I went through was more unique in that they actually had manufacturing equipment in their lab.  220 ton injection molding machines, extruders, blowmolders, etx.  Its a hands on program with a very high job placement.  There are a few schools that offer the hands on degree and there are others that are more into theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PET grad here as well. When people hear where I went to school they're all surprised as it's not big at all and had a lab outfitted like its own little processing plant. Great field if you can find a school with a program!</p></div>		</li>
