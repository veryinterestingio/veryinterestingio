			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question without a straightforward answer. Personally, I think it is important to collect data on racial inequality in order to figure out the causes of this inequality and perhaps intervene in it. For instance, know that a business is paying equally qualified black employees less money, or is less likely to hire said employees, is necessary for companies who claim to want to practice merit. But data on race can often be interpreted in ways that are aimed at increasing or justifying inequalities (see the history of &quot;intelligence&quot; testing). On balance, I tend towards the idea that knowing is better than not. The problem with the &quot;superpredator&quot; discussion isn't the data, it is how that data was (and is) framed to perpetuate stereotypical ideas and support mass incarceration instead of helpful social programs.</p></div>		</li>
