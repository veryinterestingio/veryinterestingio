			<div class="markdown"><p>I did some more research, and I had some mistakes in my answer: It's not that it's high pitched, it's that it's particularly loud within the frequency that humans mostly talk in. Our brains and ears are really tuned in to this frequency so it overloads a bit. I would imagine chewing gum falls a bit in here too. I also found that a large part is psychological - if you played the same sounds labeled as &quot;music&quot; vs &quot;sound&quot; - music is generally more accepted than sound (even if its identical).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can relate to this one. My sister uses braces, so she can't eat with her mouse closed, then she makes noise, but the others in the house, don't get annoyed by the noise. It truly makes me cringe and sends shivers down my spine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm I don't think so. The experience OP indicates, such as nails on a chalkboard, is not the same as when hearing a loud sound, whether it be high-pitched or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I would after with your solution, the aspect that's missing is the frisson, it whatever the opposite of frisson is. That visceral revulsion that is more than simple ear pain.</p></div>		</li>
