If you burn it on a scale you'll see it get heavier as it burns. As a part of science history, specifically to get acquainted with antiquated theories and the scientific methods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's closer to &quot;opposite of (free) Oxygen&quot;.</p>
<p>Phlogiston is released during combustion, as opposed to Oxygen being absorbed. Dephlogisticated air is air with the Oxygen removed. Plants absorb phlogiston, as opposed to releasing Oxygen. </p>
<p>All this is very loose, though, when you get down to the details of how Oxygen reacts and try to explain what you see in terms of phlogiston, your explanations start to make no sense. </p>
