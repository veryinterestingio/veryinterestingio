<p>Almost every &quot;young&quot; rock is green. You'd get the same results of Trinitite looking stuff if you took a big blowtorch, lightning strike... Anything hot enough to melt desert will create a green rock/mineral.</p>
<p>Trinitite is just a specific name for making green rocks with nukes.</p>
<p>Nothing to do with nuclear, all to do with impurities and mineral composition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Typical modern glass has very few impurities and appears clear in normal use, but if you increase the amount of glass you’re looking through, or put two mirrors facing each other, you can see the slight colour tint caused by the impurities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool info, but regardless this could still be a reason that people associate radiation/plutonium with green, even though it’s the iron that was in the sand that’s mostly responsible for the green color. This was around the time when humanity was being introduced to thermonuclear technology and they had green radioactive rocks in their jewelry wether the populous knew it was green from the iron or not. </p>
<p>I don’t quite understand how it being “young” has anything to do with the green color though, just the actual composition (iron in this case). Are you just saying that because it’s very likely to have iron in sand?</p></div>		</li>
