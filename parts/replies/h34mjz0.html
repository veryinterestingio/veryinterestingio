			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't believe so, probably not any DNA samples to recover. DNA has a half life of about 600 years, so theoretically under perfect conditions we could sequence DNA from something 6-7m years old.</p>
<p>There's a nice world map here: <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/enigmatic-skull-may-be-oldest-modern-human-out-of-africa" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/enigmatic-skull-may-be-oldest-modern-human-out-of-africa" target="_blank">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/enigmatic-skull-may-be-oldest-modern-human-out-of-africa</a></a> which shows those discoveries, and others around the world that have been categorised as Denisovan, or Homo Sapiens connected, but not the older remains found in South &amp; East Asia.</p></div>		</li>
