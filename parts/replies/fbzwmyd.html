			<div class="markdown"><p>Some would argue Intel's push was too aggressive, hence the delays in 10Ã±m. But yes &quot;node names&quot; mean nothing, especially with FinFETs, where transistor pitch is another variable. I can only imagine how confusing GAAFET will be.</p>
<p>TDP infuriates me because it is a directly important metric, which affects the cooling solution used in a computer, and yet, Intel and AMD have completely different definitions. WHY?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, too aggressive in the sense that it lead to a cascading series of failures which lost them process node and performance leadership in almost every market segment because of how slowly it all came together, sure, but they stuck with it and didnt compromise their goals and isnt integrity what <em>really</em> matters? </p>
<p>The worst part about TDP is how they can (and both do) adjust the ambient temps used to calculate it based on SKU to make hotter parts seem cooler.</p></div>		</li>
