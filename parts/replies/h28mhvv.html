			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to this a lot of people are forgetting that local surface winds are generally dominated most of the time by convection, land is hotter than sea. Air over the land heats up and rises causing a suction that draws air in from over the water, meaning that the majority of the wind at the shore is in the on-shore direction.  And thus the waves are also driven in that direction by the wind. </p>
<p>Lots of locations known for their wind are driven by these types of features.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do waves ever go out to see like during a hurricane?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah sort of.  The size and shape of waves are dependent on a lot of factors including the directions of the wind and water and the depth of the water.</p>
<p>In the middle of the ocean where the water is effectively 'infinite deep' from the wave's perspective they will generally be blown into large, long rolling waves with sides of relatively shallow angles.  As they approach the beach they get pushed up from the bottom and become the much more steep and eventually breaking waves you normally see on the beach.</p>
<p>But out in the open ocean those waves will have lots of momentum, and if the wind does a 180, the waves will keep rolling in the 'wrong' direction for a long time due to momentum.  When this happens the waves will become steeper on the windward side as the wind pushes into the on-coming wave and this can eventually cause them to become breaking waves even when they are still out in the open.</p>
<p>So if you have a strong off-shore breeze it will generally just cause the waves coming in to become steeper.  If that breeze stays for a few days you may see the water become very flat as the momentum dies out and the waves start building up in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>But you will never see large waves rolling away from the beach because you are always at the start of the wave building process there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason wind causes waves is that wind pushes harder on the peaks of waves than the troughs. That is, any small difference in water height gets amplified by the wind, making the wave larger.</p></div>		</li>
