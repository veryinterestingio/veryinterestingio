			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, UV-C LEDs are certainly a thing. They are currently not very efficient (external quantum efficiency of a few percent), but major optoelectronics manufacturers such as Panasonic, LG, Osram and Nichia are developing this technology for water purification/sterilization purposes. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I'm a curious person and pretty interested in all things technical with an interaction with the human body. Taking in account; Anatomy, physiology, psychology end applying this knowledge to create a proper interaction with technology. </p>
<p>So the post wasn't wrong? Am I right, the technology is available, but not for normal consumers and is still in trial en error? For this purpose?</p>
<p>I would love to learn a bit more about the progression of the current technology, because I can imagine that when we will produce efficient UV-C LEDs the medical purposes could be enormous. Hence the normal production for LEDs has been polished up &quot;a bit&quot; in the last few decades. Going from the huge diode to the current micro-LED technologies. If we can combine those we could do some amazing things with that aspecialy for developing countries where there isn't enough clean water or for medical purposes. </p>
<p>Thinking from, High production=lower price.
Sterilising medical tool's from &quot;whitin&quot; due to micro-LED, I guess it would mostly be used in a laboratory in this hypothesis. Cleaning tubes and such before or after usage whithin the machine.</p>
<p>A paper or something like that would satisfy my personal need for an answer if you don't feel like revealing your whole PhD paper on Redit as I can imagine as you're still working on it. This was my personal interpretation from the posts and intrigued me apparently so much that I needed to write this down. </p>
<p>Thanks for your time and be well,</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, sterilization with UV radiation is usually done with high-pressure mercury discharge lamps, but can be done just as well with UV-C LEDs, provided they have enough output power. The advantage of LEDs is that they offer a much more compact form factor and ruggedness, operate on low voltage (e.g. provided by a solar panel) as opposed to high-voltage PSUs for discharge lamps and can be modulated at high speeds (i.e. don't need any pre-heating or cooling time).</p>
<p>For water and air purification, as well as surface sterilization, you would not necessarily favor microLEDs, as UV LEDs have quite a high power density to be dissipated. For this (and other reasons), you would probably use regular-sized LED chips, which are some 100 µm in dimension (this is still big for LEDs).</p>
<p>If you want to know more about the general topic (applications, manufacturing and physics of UV LEDs), I can warmly recommend the excellent book &quot;III-Nitride Ultraviolet Emitters: Technology and Applications&quot; edited by Michael Kneissl and Jens Rass. If your university has access to Springer Link, you can download it free of charge. If not, just shoot me a PM.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, this is totally correct.  Another important caveat is that these “germicidal” mercury UV lamps often produce ozone (a pollutant harmful to human health) as a byproduct, so when using them make sure it is in a well ventilated space</p>
<p>EDIT: just adding in for clarity that you can have UV lamps like those for seasonal effectiveness disorder that only put out Mostly UVA and a little UVB.  These don’t generate the low wavelengths needed for it to be “germicidal” UV which are generally on the more expensive side and require care due to O3 generation.</p></div>		</li>
