			<div class="markdown"><p>What about improper breathing? In the past with my own anxiety I often found myself not always breathing properly  and having to take deep breaths to restore a normal breathing pattern for a while. I always thought this is what caused the light headedness, although I imagine this could be related to the blood flow part.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely can confirm this. When I quit taking Xanax (prescribed, few years plus) the first two months I was literally choking on air, and constantly clenching my abdomin/diaphragm and jaw without realizing it. I always felt my breath was... Shakey, and like I could not just take a deep breath for the life of me. Like I was consitently taking millisecond long breaths that resulted in a lack of oxygen and bloodflow is what I figured. As my limbs would go numb a lot, too.</p>
<p>Been a little longer now, but I still suffer with feeling like I cannot breath. I have gotten almost every test known to man. And my doctor swears I am healthy as a horse. Guess it is definitely just mental.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could also possible be because you’re hyperventilating which can also cause dizziness. I always think I can’t breathe when I panic so I try to breathe more which makes me hyperventilate and makes me dizzy and then I think I don’t get enough oxygen and I need more air so I breathe even more and so on...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably both.  When your body is concerned with survival, it doesn't want you to worry about things like pooping, eating, or hyperventilating.  It sort of takes over and controls everything.  As mentioned before, diverting blood to the systems that get you tf out of there fast is key.  I imagine the blood flow diverting and then returning to normal plays a bit factor in the wooziness.  Breathing regulation is HUGELY affective in regards to calming the nervous system down so you'll get relief on a couple levels if you can get your breathing in check.</p></div>		</li>
