			<div class="markdown"><p>Wage stagnation is the correct answer.  Between 1948 and 1973, the productivity of the typical US worker increased 95.7%, and their wages increased 90.9%, rough parity as one would expect.  In the years since, through 2017 (all numbers inflation-adjusted), productivity has increased a further 77.0% while wages have increased only 12.4%.</p>
<p>If the value of that productivity isn't going to the workers, where is it going?  Shareholders, the wealthy, etc.</p>
<p>Here's the source for the numbers quoted:   <a href="https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/" target="_blank">https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/</a>  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget: That same janitor was buying a lot more stuff in the 50's than he would buying now, since he had so much more income. So that money isn't going to local businesses, who can't hire their own janitors, workers, what have you. </p>
<p>Instead, that money is going to other rich people, who are spending some of that money on services or goods that are provided by the working and middle classes, but the Lions share is staying in the higher income brackets.</p>
<p>This in turn is making the economy slower (since wealth isn't moving as quickly, goods aren't being produced as much, etc), less stable (as wealth is concentrated in smaller sectors, many of which are less consistent/more prone to speculation bubbles), and less advanced (since fewer people have the time or funds necessary to invent new goods and services).</p>
<p>In short, not only is that janitor getting less money, but literally everyone else is living in a poorer, more unstable, less advanced society, because of income inequality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this isn’t entirely true. Middle and even low income earners buy more stuff in general—think of how many poor people still have nice TVs, nice phones, etc. I think the main difference is people are far more dependent on credit. So, large companies can effectively double dip by loaning money to buy all this shit and then charging interest, while more goods are sold in general.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't it entirely possible that there are too many people in the work force? Remember, since the '60s women have joined the workforce, decreasing demand for workers and thus decreasing wages.Wage stagnation is also a very good reason, but I also think there are too many people in the workforce. There are a ton of jobs out there where people do almost nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only is there significantly more people in the workforce, there is significantly less demand for unskilled labor. The jobs that exist today are the jobs that literally require a person to be there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a <em>non sequitur</em> argument. There are lots of jobs that need doing that have direct positive impact on society which do produce tangible capital and so are not being done. The hoarding of wealth by the rich is a large reason for this. If they were taxed higher, there would be money for these jobs to be done and insentive for people to pursue these careers.</p>
<p>Just a few examples to whet your appetite: social work, environmental restoration, public space cleaning, creating more public space from overgrown city land, pot hole fixing, financial education, no higher education tuition, and life skills classes.</p>
<p>These things effect many people's well-being, but they don't generate wealth for the rich, they are accomplished by ciphoning their wealth, and so are not done/pay shit/incentivized against/can't be done. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aren't the super wealthy already cheating the system by giving themselves a $1/year salary and reinvesting profits so they don't have to pay taxes? They're literally cheating the system and raising taxes isn't going to affect them much since they already don't pay. We're nearing the point where mass riots and civil unrest will convince them to change their ways. We're one economic collapse away from a total dissolution of the current way of life. I agree with what you're saying, but the rich are already 2-3 steps ahead of us. If it gets really bad, most of them have remote 'vacation' homes to escape to.</p></div>		</li>
