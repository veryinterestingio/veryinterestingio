			<div class="markdown"><p>That's more of a pay to win scenario that deals with how much a person earns instead of the color of their skin. I get the spirit of what you were trying to say, most African Americans can't afford the good lawyer because of the systematic racism that affected their life, but it's not an example of systematic racism in the court system. A better example might be a poor white man and a poor black man with similar charges and the same lawyer get different sentences for the same crime.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Pay to win scenarios are <em>de facto</em> racist because black people are statistically poorer than whites. There's nothing <em>inherently</em> racist about pay-to-win, but it becomes racist in practice when it exists in parallel with racially biased wealth.  </p>
<p>That's what &quot;systemic racism&quot; IS, mostly: a bunch of systems that on paper don't look racist at all, but <em>in practice</em> are. Putting harsh legal penalties on a specific illegal drug? Not inherently racist. Putting harsh legal penalties on a specific illegal drug <em>that's common in black communities but not white communities?</em> That's racist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe some of systemic racism in the US is unintentional. But the school system is not. Redlining and other laws preventing African Americans from buying houses in the new suburbs. ‘Race riots’ happened regularly from the end of the civil war until the early 20th century. White people would destroy or take a whole African American community’s resources and kill several people in the process. Law enforcement would act only if a white person was killed in defense. Then black men would hang for it. These two very deliberate forms of systemic racism pushed African Americans back into the poverty they found themselves when they were emancipated from slavery with nothing but the clothes on their backs. Also, black and brown people get arrested more despite committing crime at the same rate as white people. They are given a longer sentence. They are less often given parole or bail. Having your breadwinner in jail depresses a family’s standard of living. Also sexism plus racism means Black women make $.61 for every dollar that white men earn for the same job. Unequal funding of schools has been addressed by many states supreme courts and the state legislatures still haven’t change it. Partly it’s a resistance from the white people in wealthier school districts who don’t want dollars taken away from their kids schools. Also there’s resistance to more money going to poor schools. So we push former slaves and their descendants into poverty and then resist measures to alleviate poverty. You can’t think that racism doesn’t play a part in that. It’s not just an unintentional consequence.</p></div>		</li>
