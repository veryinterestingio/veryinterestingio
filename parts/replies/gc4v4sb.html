			<div class="markdown"><p>Very informative. Let's just add that particularly <em>cruise ships</em> are but a tiny part of the world's shipping fleet and the vast majority of bunker fuel is burned by cargo ships... banning cruise ships would hardly make a dent in the environmental impact of global transport.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different pollutants, shipping emits about 10% of global transport related CO2 emissions, road passenger transport about 45%, road freight transport about 30%. </p>
<p>At the moment, if you were doing triage on the multiple problems that patient Earth has, then you would be tackling carbon emissions before sulpher dioxide emissions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s because the 10x number is cherry picking a specific pollutant that cars don’t emit. In reality cars are way worse than cruise ships when you’re worried about CO2 for greenhouse gasses and NOx in built up areas for neurological harm.</p>
<p>There is a very strong case for banning cruise ships from city centres, or at least making them connect to the grid for electricity when they’re there in numbers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ships account for just 3% of the world's carbon footprint, and cruise ships are just a small fraction of that percentage. They account for just 0.2% of worldwide carbon emissions. Land transportation, on the other hand, is responsible for 28% of emissions. Personal vehicles account for 11% of that figure.</p>
<p>So what's the deal here? Well, we have to go back to the original statistic. And even we do that we see cruise ships emit 10 times as much <em>sulphur dioxide</em> as all of Europe's cars. And that's technically true. Cars mostly emit <em>carbon dioxide</em>, not <em>sulphur dioxide</em>. That's like saying the beef industry is kinder to animals than the poultry industry because they kill fewer chickens. Yeah, that statistic may technically be true, but that isn't telling the whole story.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it is a valid question, even though I don’t agree with the OP’s assumption. A good answer would explain why it is a bad idea, and what is wrong with the assumptions. A bad answer is using profanities and far-fetched comparisons to attack the poster personally, without giving any new insights.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Current legalisation is slowly nudging the shipping industry in the right direction, regardindgthe emission of sulpher oxide. The limit of Sulpher in fuel is leagally required to be less and less and scrubberes are being installed on pretty much every ship that use bunkerfuel. These scrubberes scrub the smoke from the engines, with water spray and remove most of the Sulpher Oxides from the smoke, So that the current legalisation is being followed. The scrubbing water is then stored in tanks and pump ashore when the ship is alongside.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ocean acidification is a real problem that potentially will wipe out 99% of ocean life in a few decades (already destroyed the coral reefs). The fact you say acid rain has no affect on the ocean makes me question the validity of  everything else you said here, which I admit sounded convincing until I hit that point.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also you don't need to burn something just because you don't know what to do with it...what kind of rationality is that when you know for a fact that burning it is harmful?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>open loop scrubbers are fairly useless except in a legal sense, that much is true. However the idea with closed loop scrubbers (which this article seems to miss) is that the waste is not (normally) dumped into the water. Instead it is normally put ashore where it can be handled in a cleaner manner.</p></div>		</li>
