<p>Also, keep in mind that the average age of first child in the US is about 27. Many people don't get drawn into anti-vaccine beliefs until they're making parenting decisions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Could this be the key? Maybe a lack of support for first-time parents in the US could be driving some of this movement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally, I believe this is what is happening, especially with “mommy” groups. It used to be, new mothers were supported by a large network of family and friends who would help shoulder the burden of taking care of the newborn, allowing Mom (and by extension Dad) a community to interact with, people to trust, and support for the hardships of motherhood. </p>
<p>However, we have grown towards a much more transient society, and oftentimes we are living far away from said family or support networks as we work in cities, hop cities to find better work, and in general attempt to stay ahead of the debt curve with two-worker households. </p>
<p>This was an ongoing trend even around the 80s and 90s, but the conspiracy theories didn’t kick off until the 00s with the advent of the internet, because suddenly you had Mom blogs connecting with each other. New and returning moms looking for support are plugged into these groups, and even those with a good science understanding start to doubt their reasoning when the entirety of their community echo chamber repeats the same misinformation over and over. And who is shouting over them, if at all? They’re underground enclaves, like roots digging unseen underground until your foundations start to collapse. </p>
<p>Heck— I have almost fallen prey to it living around a large group of general conspiracy theorists, and I am college educated with a biology degree. I sometimes have to double check my thinking, because that’s how strong peer pressure can be.</p></div>		</li>
