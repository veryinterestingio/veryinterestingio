			<div class="markdown"><p>E\^2=(mc\^2)\^2+(pc)\^2 for those not already familiar, which explains how a solar sail or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crookes_radiometer" target="_blank">Crookes radiometer</a> works: light has no mass but does have p a.k.a. momentum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't have to feel cheated.
Even as an engineer you don't use the full formula.
You calculate with easy to measure units and then add a safety factor.
Everything else is just to much effort for a small increase in accuracy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I noticed this too. I struggled a ton with it in high school and then tutored my younger brother in it after taking Calc in college and everything made perfect sense. Understanding Calc is tough but once you do it helps make a lot of other subjects more intuitive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hated geometry. We took algebra the year before and it was like learning an entire world of math that I fell in love with. It was all problem solving and creative.</p>
<p>Geometry was memorizing formulas without context or expansion of skills. It was just applying the skills we learned in algebra.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny you should mention the gas law.  The Navier-Stokes full equation can take up the width + change of an entire chalkboard, and the first time most students see it in full in fluid dynamics, you can just see the fear on their faces.</p>
<p>But once you start making assumptions for the various terms (temperature, compressibility, atmospheric pressure, density, friction, mass, momentum, etc.) the equation really simplifies down.  Most of the terms go to either 1 or 0, leaving behind a very, very short equation.</p>
<p>It only starts to become complex again once compressibility is added back in, when you start looking at behavior close to surfaces, or when you examine multiple fluids interacting.</p>
<p>(Note: I'm glad I don't have to do the long-hand calculations anymore, and just let my simulations do the work for me üòâ.)</p></div>		</li>
