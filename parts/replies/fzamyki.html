<p>Given the quantity of nuclear waste, its half-life, and the sheer volume of the Earth's mantle, I can't imagine this would result in radioactive lava in anything more than the sense that a banana is radioactive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this, right here </p>
<p>uranium isn't that active, there's an inverse relationship between radiation intensity and half-life because what causes radiation is decay of atoms.  if the isotope decays fast it's very radioactive but doesn't last long, if it lasts a long time it's not very radioactive.  this only applies to subcritical masses of course, because once the neutron dance starts things get crazy.</p>
<p>the &quot;worst&quot; isotopes in waste (and fallout) have a half-life under 20 years, so they become fairly safe within a human lifespan and decay entirely in under 150 years.</p></div>		</li>
