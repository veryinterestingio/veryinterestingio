			<div class="markdown"><p>To go a bit more general, electricity is the <em>net movement of charged particles</em>. If you have particles but they aren't charged (e.g. pure water), you don't have electrical current.  Metals have free electrons so conduct electricity even though the atoms themselves are fixed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>wait... so if you dillute salt in water the Na and Cl break apart and then you evaporate all the water the Na and Cl recombine?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>NaCl is formed when a Na atom physically donates an electron to a Cl atom, and the two then join together through the resulting difference in electromagnetic charges, known as an &quot;ionic bond&quot;.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, H2O is the result of O and H actively <em>sharing</em> electrons between them, known as a &quot;covalent bond&quot;.  Because electrons are being shared between the atoms in such bonds, they are much stronger than simpler ionic bonds and take much more effort to break apart.</p>
<p>Also, because of how the oxygen and hydrogen atoms are arranged, a water molecule is dipolar, meaning that it has opposite charges at it's ends (specifically a negative charge near the oxygen atom and positive charges near the hydrogen atoms).  These charges are enough to actually attract the Na and Cl <em>away</em> from each other when dissolved in water. (this dipolar arrangement is also why water expands when it freezes, unlike every other liquid, and why snowflakes are hexagonal in nature)</p>
<p>As the water evaporates, or is boiled away, there is less water to attract the Na and Cl away from each other, and so salt starts to reform again, until all of the water is finally gone, and the Na and Cl atoms have nothing left to be attracted to but each other again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does that mean that by drinking seawater means you're consuming chlorine and sodium? Or do their ionic forms mean they're substantially different to their normal form? </p>
<p>What makes it taste salty if there's no actual salt?</p></div>		</li>
