			<div class="markdown"><p>Aside from popular sites like Stonehenge and Egypt, the vast majority of things that archaeologists find are the “garbage” or detritus of previous cultures. Chips of rock from scraping to make tools, broken pottery so it is never anything quite titillating enough like “The lost treasure of xyz”  to interest the public but things that provide insight into human history and how they lived. Unfortunately, there really is no profit from such things so it doesn’t get funding thus exposure. Most digs are done out of necessity for construction. </p>
<p>Indiana Jones was technically the worst archaeologist bc he just grabbed artifacts out of their original sites rendering their context pointless and you cannot derive any further information from it. </p>
<p>Urban archaeology has the chance to be of popular interest although the brief time frame isnt that revelatory. For instance, Manhattan island had many different layouts and uses prior to becoming a concrete slab with skyscrapers.</p></div>		</li>
