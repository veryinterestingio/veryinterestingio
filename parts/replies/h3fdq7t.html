<p>Another thing some people here are kinda missing is that not every product sells at the same price ( as in for the same product)</p>
<p>Another poster used water bottles as an example. If there’s one seller they probably only sell at one price, but if there are multiple sellers it probably sells at multiple prices. The 7/11 may sell it for a dollar, but the local non chain ship may go for 1.50 and an upscale place maybe two dollars.</p>
<p>With lots of bottles sold at different prices it forms something of a price spectrum, bottles sold at many different prices. Now let’s say, as you asked, the supply gets cut so the stores have less bottles. One thing you can be sure of is the store wants to make money. If there are less bottles instead of taking away equal bottles from each price point (1, 1.5, 2 as the example above) the stores will “remove” the lowest end of the spectrum so the higher price remains as the market price.</p>
<p>For some numbers to go with our example. Let’s say each of the three stores sells 20 bottles. The average price is 1.5 dollars but it’s one third being sold at each 1, 1.5, 2 dollars. Now the supply gets cut by let’s say 20 bottles. There are still 40 consumers willing to pay 1.5 or 2 dollars, so the stores will try to sell to those people rather than the ones who previously bought at $1.</p>
<p>Sellers want the highest price that they can get and still sell all of their goods. If there are less goods, they’ll sell to the people willing to pay more.</p></div>		</li>
