			<div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer is to look up a &quot;satiety index&quot; which will tell you how quickly a given foodstuff fills you up relative to other foods. That way you don't need to worry about the complex biochemical and biomechanical signaling mechanisms that underlie the feeling of satiety.</p></div>		</li>

Because satiety always reminds me of this: <a href="https://www.ispot.tv/ad/AYEj/yoplait-greek-100-satiety-featuring-dominic-purcell" target="_blank">https://www.ispot.tv/ad/AYEj/yoplait-greek-100-satiety-featuring-dominic-purcell</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You knew that really, didn't you? :-)</p>
<p>Bodies are very clever. In the wild, a human may not find any food for several days, and it would be very distracting to feel hungry for the whole time.</p>
<p>Equally, when a wild human finds food, they need to be able to make the most of it, so it would be inefficient to feel quickly full once you had eaten enough. It's better to overeat and store the spare as fat for those days of hunger.</p>
<p>The <del>problem nowadays</del> <em>reason this system no longer works</em> is that food is abundant all the time, with no days of famine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats why starvation diets dont really work.  It brings back the instincts of olde where when you get a little food your body stores as much as possible because it knows itll need to draw off it within hours.  Eating small portions but often teaches the body there is plenty and it will stop storing nearly as much because it doesnt need to draw off reserves due to another deposit being made in just a few hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Volume of food is what your body can judge very quickly. It takes a while for the nutrients to enter the blood stream, where the body can then measure blood sugar levels etc.<br />
So, if you are hungry and have food with a high calory density (think sweets, white bread, meat), it is very easy to eat more than you actually need.<br />
If you want to lose weight, It could be a good idea, to start your meal with something that has a lot of volume but not so many calories, like vegetables.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. The diet system that is used when running controlled trials which need people to lose weight use a system of mass as a primary way if doing so. Don't reach for the raisins, reach for the grapes. The more water content something has, the more mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For lunch yesterday I made fried rice. Except it was like a few broccoli stems, a few carrots, several mushrooms, etc. The actual calorically dense parts were a cup of cooked rice and 2 eggs. I struggled to eat the whole thing but it was maybe 500 calories.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Eat when hungry: gain weight. Eat tiny amount of healthy food every 2 hours every day, never hungry except after intense exercise. Actual freaking magic!</p></div>		</li>
