This means that in the photograph even though the atom is almost motionless it still appears many orders of magnitude larger than it is in reality. This wasn't really what you asked OP but I feel like it's good to know regardless.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you mean when looking by eye or with a telescope? If you mean with a telescope, the angular size of all the stars in an exposure should be the same and is related to the aperture size of the telescope (i.e inversely proportional to the diameter of the primary mirror). You're right though, it's all point sources. It's crazy to think about how much we can know about a star and even the planets around it when it's really just a pinpoint of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, I was wondering about that because the article says the electrodes are 2mm apart and there is no way an atom is anywhere near the size of that little dot if that gap is 2mm! I thought maybe most of the dot was actually a sort of glow/halo effect from the light but now it makes much more sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've got to add to this too. The resolving power of your eye or any imaging device is proportional to the size of the lens based on a quantity called the numerical aperture. So even if the atom was perfectly still, you'd need a nearly infinitely sized lens to resolve the atom to it's actual size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually do research using an ion trap similar to the one shown here, with a fancy camera and lens system set up very close to the ions so we can watch things like reactions happening in real time. I'd just like to add to this comment that the size of the atom/ion in a photo like this is typically limited by the resolving power of the imaging optics.</p>
<p>For example, in our trap, a single atom is confined with (time varying) electric fields to a space of ~100 nm, which is much larger than the atom itself, which is a fraction of a nm large. So it is really a tiny ball bouncing around very quickly in a space about 100 times larger than it. So if we had a really great imaging system, we could take a picture that would look like a 100 nm large ball, since the exposure time needed to collect enough light for a picture (a fraction of a second) is much longer than the time it takes for the atom to bounce around in that 100 nm space (~1 microsecond). Our imaging system, however can only resolve sizes as small as about 1 micron (1000 nm), so our pictures make the atoms look like they are ~1 micron large, more than 1000x larger than he actual atom. This is ok for us though, since our atoms are spaced by about 10 microns, so we can easily see each individual atom. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are probably some experiments that excite with at 2-photon and collect the emitted light, but it is much more common to excite the atom using a laser tuned precisely to the transition energy and collect the photons of the same wavelength that are emitted by the atoms. For applications like microscopy, where your sample is typically on something that would also reflect light, this would lead to an enormous amount of background scattered light. For applications like ion trapping, however, the atoms are levitated in vacuum by the electric fields, and so one can typically shine a laser at it and hit the atom without hitting any walls or anything, meaning that the background scattered light is much lower. </p>
<p>If background light is still an issue, there are other ways to get around it which are similar to 2-photon microscopy in that you collect light at a different wavelength than the laser you use to excite the transition. This can be done for atoms that don't always emit light and return to the original state. Often times, if you excite an atom from its ground state to an excited state, it can decay back to the ground state, emitting a photon of the same wavelength as the laser, or it can decay to another state, emitting a photon of a different wavelength. One can use an optical band pass filter at this different wavelength to collect light emitted by the atom without collecting light from the laser.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, that would be too far for a chemical reaction to occur. The reactions we're looking at are with the trapped ions and a neutral gas which we can introduce into the chamber. These atoms sometimes collide with the trapped ions. If they react, it will form a different ion and a different atom. The ion is still trapped by the electric field of our ion trap, and the atom flies away. Since the ion is now not the one we're illuminating with a laser, it will not emit light, so we'll see a dark spot where an ion should be. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a laser pointed at it. When hit with light of the correct frequency, atoms can absorb the light and their internal energy will increase, and then they will emit light and go back to their original state. This is happening continuously, so enough light is emitted over a long exposure.  </p>
<p>Not sure why we don't see the laser--maybe either a narrow blocking filter or the laser isn't emitting light in wavelengths the camera is sensitive to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the laser is pointing diagonally through the 'blades of the trap' and not at the camera.  the blue light that comes off of the trapping electrodes is the little bit of laser light that reflects off. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What's neat is that the laser light (422 nm) is keeping the ion cool enough to say in the trap.  if you turned it off the ion would start moving around and heat up enough so that it'd likely fall out of the trap. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a typical atomic transition like the one used here for fluorescence, the linewidth of the transition is on the order of 10 MHz. This also means that the most photons/s the atom will spontaneously emit is on the order of 10 million/s. These are emitted in all directions, and a typical imaging system for an ion trap like this one may only end up detecting 0.1% to 1% of these photons, after considering the solid angle covered by the imaging lens and the quantum efficiency of the camera.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not at all what it means. The &quot;linewidth&quot; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(signal_processing\)" target="_blank">bandwidth</a>) is a measure of the spread of the possible emission values, not how many are being emitted in a second. In other words there's a probability that a photon will be emitted at a central frequency plus or minus a certain amount. The rate or intensity of the emission is a separate measure.</p></div>		</li>
