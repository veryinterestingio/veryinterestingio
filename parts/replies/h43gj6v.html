			<div class="markdown"><p>Since there is varying reaponses I'll add on to tbe pile: if you're doing instense exercise, you will need to breathe through your mouth. Anything above around 120-140bpm, is my guess. However, 120bpm is prime fat burning zone so if youre trying to do some light steady state cardio (fast-walking or a very slow jog) you should be able to breathe solely through your nose</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don‚Äôt need to breath through your mouth at 140+ bpm. I run and my heart rate gets up to 180 sometimes and I breath through my nose. The key for me is focusing on my breathing from the start and taking slow deep breaths fully contracting my diaphragm and letting my abdomen expand on the inhale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had this problem before. I didn't breath much in the beginning of an exercise, but at the end I was panting like a dog. So I decided to keep an even breathing pace throughout my entire exercise, which meant I had to start breathing heavily right at the start of the exercise, taking really deep breaths through my nose, breathing out from my mouth. It really helps me get the air I need to sustain myself throughout the exercise.</p>
<p>Imagine how you breathe at the end of the exercise. Breathe like that right from the start. Deep breaths, not shallow or you might pass out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I breathe through my nose while exercising, including doing cardio, and slowly build up my workout until I can't get enough air through my nose and need to pant. Then I ramp is back down. That's my set point. I hold my pace or pose or weight or whatever just at the maximum point where I can still breathe through my nose for the rest of the time. At the very end, I push it (sprint or hold a position) until I'm panting, but only for a minute or two. Then I'm done. Listening to my breath has helped me have workouts that push my limits without leaving me exhausted the rest of the day or so sore I can barely move the next day, which has been a real problem for me in the past. Breath is key.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is my thing, too. Breathe through the nose as long as possible. When it's finally too hard to maintain nose breathing, I switch to mouth (though still controlled). I can usually sustain 10-15 minutes of mouth breathing before I'm panting. Then I go one more minute (which is always the worst minute of my entire day) and stop. And then I feel really good about myself for the rest of the day.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How does breathing through your nose ‚Äúpressurize‚Äù the air?</p>
<p>This sounds like pseudoscience.</p>
<p>Edit: To anyone else reading this line and thinking &quot;bullshit!&quot;, there is a better explanation <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/oduop7/eli5_if_they_are_connected_why_are_we_told_to/h447n4l?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">in this comment</a> by u/CourtneyRae92:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Focusing on the exhalation increases your intrathoracic pressure which also increases the surface area of your lungs and essentially forces more oxygen over the AC membrane that I mentioned earlier. The prolonged exhale also facilitates removal of CO2 from the lungs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assuming they're right, and it sounds plausible, it's not related to breathing in through the nose at all, it's all about controlling how you're exhaling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right! The reason we have you breathe in through your nose is that it warms and humidifies the air, maximizes the amount of air you take in, which facilitates the exhalation portion of the exercise. üòä</p></div>		</li>
