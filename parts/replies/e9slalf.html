			<div class="markdown"><p>You have some great info here. I just want to add that there actually are pulses of organic carbon that reach the deep sea, a lot of times originating from large phytoplankton blooms. Deep sea sediment traps have captured this flux at 4k meters. The deep sea has been described as going through stages of &quot;feast and famine&quot; (Jorgenson et al. 2007). The type of phytoplankton blooming at the surface can also determine the amount of carbon export to the deep sea. Diatoms for instance can aggregate and sink pretty quickly while decomposing slowly, maybe because of their silica shells but no one has really tested that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true! A lot of productive upwelling zones (as I'm sure you know) are on coasts that border the deep ocean (which contains the cool, nitrate-rich water that diatoms love). </p>
<p>The Arabian Sea is also an interesting situation, as pulses of labile organic matter are large enough to cause deoxygenation at the seabed, though this is usually in shallower continental slope areas.</p>
<p>Much of this is due to the influence of the Indian monsoon and wind patterns.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It also happens in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, particularly in the area off Costa Rica. You probably know that already, since you used the phrase &quot;labile organic matter&quot; and people who know about the Arabian Sea oxygen minimum zone are usually aware of the other big one, but I thought I'd mention it for the sake of completeness. </p>
<p>Also, just as an aside, you sound like someone who studies OMZs for a living. If so, I'd like to say &quot;Hello&quot; since it's a reasonably small field and it's always nice to meet someone else who studies roughly the same things you study. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure about bottom waters as their temperature is kind of regulated by pressure (water is most dense at around 4 degrees) so my guess is that it's always been that way. I'm a lowly  biological, not physical oceanographer though; I'm sure someone else can provide a more comprehensive answer. Salinity modifies the specific heat capacity of water so perhaps changes due freshwater processes might impact it that way?</p>
<p>Heat is a complex topic in oceanography as it's interlinked with mixing, density and buoyancy, and lots of regional, localised and seasonal phenomena separate from longer climate trends. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right now?  Good measurements are sparse, and good timeseries sparser, but we know that the ocean generally is heating and some of that is going into the deep water. (admittedly, not my area of expertise)</p>
<p>On geological timescales?  Yes the deep ocean temperature changes.  See the famous <a href="http://lorraine-lisiecki.com/LisieckiRaymo2005.pdf" target="_blank">deep sea stack</a>, a record of temperatures derived from deep ocean sediments that is one of the key pieces of information for Pleistocene climate science.</p>
<p>Summary: for the past million years the deep ocean has oscillated within a stable range of temperatures on a roughly 100ka timescale (because ice ages), with no long-term trend beyond that.</p></div>		</li>
