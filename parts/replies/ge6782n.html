			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, not really. Muscles can only contract or release, they can't <em>actively</em> expand, that requires an antagonistic muscle or another outside force. For instance, your biceps can pull your forearm up at the elbow, but can't push it back. Instead, we have the antagonistic triceps that pulls the arm back down.</p>
<p>The heart doesn't have any antagonistic muscles. It can contract to push blood around, but it can only relax and wait for blood to push its way back in. That's why your veins are pressurized, the diastolic pressure forces blood back into the atria. The ventricles contract one at a time, which forces blood into the opposing atrium, through the valve, which expands the ventricle as it's refilled with blood.</p>
<p>Arteries are at a much higher pressure, so we have the pulmonary and aortic valves to prevent the higher pressure blood from flowing backwards into the ventricle.</p>
<p>It's a very neat system. Much more complicated than you'd expect, but kind of a beautiful design.</p></div>		</li>
