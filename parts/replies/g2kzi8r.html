			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah ADH passes through the bloodstream to the kidneys to reduce loss of water by urine, this creates more concentrated urine but saves water. That's roughly it I believe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it's more or less like this. You are still thirsty and drink and save more water until concentration reaches normal point. At that moment you will start losing both water and sodium until the amount nomalises (this process is connected with blood pressure).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Normally sodium concentrations don't get high when the water stores of the body are normal because water shifts from the interstitial compartement into the vascular compartment due to the higher osmolarity and causes hypervolemia that is sensed by barorecpetors. This leads to an inhibition of the Renine-angiotensin-aldosteron system and release of atrial natriuretic peptide which in turn leads to a secretion of the excess sodium in the urine.  If the sodium stores are so high that they cause hypernatremia even with the water shift cells in the kidney detect the excess sodium and inhibit renine even more, leading to secretion of even more sodium.</p>
<p>ADH is also influenced by baroreceptors (to a lesser degree than chemoreceptors) and is secereted so that we don't lose excess water when trying to get rid of that excess sodium. If the sodium stores are so high that they cause hypernatremia even with the water shift, osmoreceptors are activated and an even more concentrated urine is produced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a legit question, but actually no! Blood osmolarity depends on small molecules (the most important are sodium - Na+ - glucose and urea).
So when I'm talking about concentration is not purely just how thick the blood is or how many molecules in general are in the blood, but rather these molecules I've mentioned that make it go up in osmolar power (being osmolarity just a matter of ions + other molecules capable of passively* crossing celular membranes and water balance).</p>
<p>EDIT: generally passive membrane crossing, but also involved in active movements*</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This an answer to someone asking about dialysis patients and high protein diets. Before you remove this, I think you should <strong>actually</strong> take a look at the albums I posted. Here I'll post one study referenced in those 2 chapters directly. You can look at the albums if you want to see all the studies referenced, since the author is fairly thorough.<br />
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9927128/" target="_blank">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9927128/</a>  </p>
<p>There's a chapter in Stopping Kidney Disease that talks specifically about protein:<br />
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/CJ8nliu" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/a/CJ8nliu</a>  </p>
<p>There's another really important chapter that talks about albumin itself:<br />
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/It8TEg0" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/a/It8TEg0</a></p>
<hr />
<p>In general, dialysis patients tend to have hypoalbuminemia in the first place because leaking albumin in the urine is a sign of kidney damage, which may be seen as bubbles in the urine. Well yes dialysis patients do need to eat protein because the machine removes some portion of it but also because albumin has several very important functions, hence why it's correlated with mortality.  </p>
<p>Also, I wouldn't necessarily say high protein is best. It's best to give them exactly the amount of protein they need, which by USDA standards is 0.8 grams per kilogram of weight. That's because protein comes with waste, and that ends up as urea in the blood. The alternative is to take keto acids, which don't come with the nitrogen waste. The downside is that keto acids mean taking big pills along with phosphate binders (I already take 6 renvela per day, which are big pills).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d like to ask about this finding that I’ve seen before on this topic —</p>
<p>In testing subjects by preventing them from drinking anything for 24 hours, they drank around 65% of their day’s need when the fast was done. They reported a decreased sense of thirst almost immediately, well before their blood had significantly changed. This would suggest that the sense of thirst is at least somewhat psychogenic and not entirely tied to the amount of water or sodium in blood. It’s suggested that the brain will signal thirst in response to a number of less direct physiological signs (dry mouth, full stomach, etc.). </p>
<p>I’ve seen studies that similarly find people will report effects of inebriation long before alcohol reaches their blood as well.</p>
<p>How much of an effect does this expectation or conditioning have on our sense of thirst, or senses in general?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very interesting question and probably there's not an answer for it. In humans as in biology in general, there will always be things we can't fully explain (specially when it comes to psychological factors) And these results prove it!
In my opinion, probably these psychogenic influences play a role at a smaller level, which is subjective, also paired with the physiological mechanism explained by a couple comments here. Ultimately, people won't probably be able to maintain this pattern of thirst regulation and when it comes to surviving, intact physiological roles will be the main ones, regardless of the psychological stimuli.</p>
<p>Note that this is just my opinion based in no scientific data!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s certainly psychogenic. But people also have osmolarity sensors in the portal circulation. Those will detect the dilute blood coming from the GI tract and signal as such, before there’s been much of a change in systemic blood. This is the same reason a salty meal can make you very thirsty even before there’s been much digestion at all.</p>
<p>At least I’m pretty sure this is true.</p></div>		</li>
