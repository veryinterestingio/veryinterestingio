			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent explanation! I wanted to add that visceral fat is correlated with many diseases and poorer health outcomes.</p>
<p>Also, while men and women tend to deposit fat in different places, where fat deposits form seems to be determined by hormones. So, while broadly men and women deposit fat in different places (because broadly men's and women's hormones are at different levels) changes in hormone levels can change where fat is deposited. Say: menopause or glandular diseases or even stress or lack of sleep or other medications.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And to add to this further, the reason visceral (or “hard”) fat is generally “worse for you” is that it contributes to the production and secretion of hormones, as opposed to subcutaneous fat (the soft, flabby stuff) which is much more inert, meaning it’s mostly just there to store energy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yep! all newly gained fat goes where it's &quot;supposed&quot; to according to your new hormones. additionally, i believe fat from your previous hormones will be the first to go in weight loss.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also why you see cis people with hormonal issues have a different fat distribution. For example, cis women with PCOS tend to have more of an apple body shape than a pear body shape when they have extra fat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! It’s one of the things that affects your appearance the most. A decent amount of how your face looks is the fat distribution in it, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a woman who holds weight around my belly and doesn't have a lot of hips but my hormones are absolutely fine. You could always ask your Dr to test your hormone levels but unless you also have hair in places most woman don't and irregular cycles you're probably in the clear. There is a lot of variation in body types based solely on genetics, incluindg where one tends to accumulate fat. Look at your mother and female relatives, do they tend to gain weight the same way you do? If so then that's likely the cause.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not an expert, but my understanding is that there are variety of different hormones that affect fat distribution other than just testosterone/estrogen, so it could be other hormones or a combination of hormones.</p>
<p>Sorry, not sure! But from what I've read, it can be pretty complicated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>^^^ any workout/diet program that promises fat loss in a specific area is a scam.</p>
<p>There’s evidence that, since working a specific area will increase blood flow to that area, you will ~probably~ burn a <em>tiny</em> bit more fat in that area due to just more traffic going in and out of the area.</p>
<p>But it’s such an incredibly minor difference that, it practically amounts to nothing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also some evidence that since hormones like cortisol can influence where fat is deposited, reducing stress could reduce belly fat.</p>
<p>As to the blood flow theory, it's not like your abs would consume a significant number of calories anyway. It seems more relevant for larger body masses, like the legs.</p>
<p>So as we say, the key to losing belly fat is to lose fat.</p></div>		</li>
