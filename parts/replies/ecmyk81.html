			<div class="markdown"><p>They sell some oil, or gas, or timber, or labor for call centers, or anything else in exchange for dollars. Then they swap dollars for groceries and petrol, and anything else they want to buy.  US Dollars are just paper the the USA government says is legal tender for all debts. The Zimbabwe government just decrees, &quot;yah- what they said.&quot; Someone in Japan or Saudi Arbaia or anyplace else can also use US dollars just like someone in the USA can use Yen.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even in North Korea a US dollar buys a week of rice for a family.</p>
<p>I am not an economist, but generally faith in a currency is all that matters. Zimbabwe can just print 20 trillion dollars making it worthless, but a U.S. dollar is a U.S. dollar, the control of it is much more stable depending on the country(No idea what would happen if a country counterfeited another countries currency).</p>
<p>Interesting tidbit, when my ship(navy) went to Cambodia, after a couple days the U.S. Embassy sent us an e-mail saying we were spending too much money on stuff, which could destabilize the local economy, and gave us local pricing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cambodia does it.  Their ATMs spit out US $20s.  When you go shopping, their register shows you the price in US dollars or Cambodians currency.  Here comes the weird part.  It's about 1,000 Cambodian to $0.25 US dollar.  So, your change from a purchase is $2.50.  They will hand you 2, $1 US dollar bills, and a 2,000 Cambodian bill.</p></div>		</li>
