			<div class="markdown"><p>We do have that, but we have different sunscreens than the ones that are popular in Germany. Yours are better. In fact, there's a big market here for European and Japanese sunscreens because they offer a wider spectrum of protection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all sunscreen is translucent. The physical ones tend to leave a bit of a white cast behind, which is why a lot of people prefer using the chemical ones which do tend to be translucent. But you can get physical sunscreens to be more translucent, which is what OP here means.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The smaller particle size also means it is more likely to be absorbed in the bloodstream. They also affect reefs, so the &quot;safest&quot; sunscreen is non-nano zinc oxide or titanium dioxide sunscreens. And unfortunately they are the worst aesthetically.</p></div>		</li>
