It is so they can hear the music that they are singing to, without it being picked up by the microphone they are singing into.  </p>
<p>Some audio can bleed from the headset to the mic, but good studios will minimise or eliminate this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer. They play the music through their headphones instead of speakers so that their microphone only picks up their voice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. They do this so they can hear the music they're singing to without the microphone picking it up. Playing both at the same time would cause the microphone to pick up both.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a musician here, but isn't a second purpose for them wearing headphones in the studio, or an earpiece on stage, so that they can hear themselves also?  I was told by someone once that musicians will usually listen to their own voice, slightly delayed, like just a few tens or hundreds of milliseconds, so they can be sure they are in key and hitting the right notes?  It is hard to know if you are on key if you cannot hear yourself, especially live.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean ideally latency is 0 but in truth there are some barest ms of latency but nothing perceptible. And yeah it allows you to make small adjustments on the mic and everything. But delayed intentionally, no.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could be entirely wrong about this but it also has a kind of &quot;double down&quot; effect.</p>
<p>It is much easier for singers, to &quot;sing a long&quot; with something than it is to sing acapella. So they get feedback that they are not in the correct key, but also if they are in the right key it's easier for them to stay in key because they are singing along to a song that's in key.</p>
<p>That's a bit paradoxical I know but if you changed the track so that they were listening to someone else sing the song in key, the recording of their voice would be more in key. When it's your own voice it's feedback on your singing+this effect.</p>
<p>It's also the reason acapella is so hard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Acapella isn't that hard, you're making it sound like it's some great challenge to sing acapella in tune, it's not. You do have to be able to listen to yourself and harmonize with your fellow singers, but most decent singers are capable of that. What's hard is staying in tune when you've got loudspeakers drowning out your voice so you can't hear yourself. I did that once as a little kid (around 10 I think) in a musical. </p>
<p>We hadn't practiced with all of the equipment before showtime, it was my first solo in front of a big crowd, and I had no idea this was a thing. I get up there, music is going, I hit my cue and immediate start panicking because I have no idea what sounds are coming out of my mouth. To this day I don't have a clue if I was on key or not. I suspect it was not so good, because I don't remember getting the &quot;oh you did so great&quot; treatment afterwords. But it couldn't have been that bad because nobody made fun of me for it at school either. </p>
<p>And that's why musicians wear ear pieces in concerts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do they feed the singer's voice back into the headphones?  I've tried doing recordings with headphones without having my own voice fed back into the headset and I find it pretty distracting/disorienting when I can't hear it.</p>
<p>I'm also curious how this works on gaming PCs + headphones, since PCs are well known for introducing random latency into mike inputs, which is even worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the singer's voice is fed back into the headphones. This helps a great deal with the performance, giving the singer feedback on how their interaction with the microphone is effecting the recording (breath sounds, distance from the mic, accidental jostling, etc). Sometimes the recording engineer will add effects (reverb is common) to the vocal monitoring as well, not to be applied to the recording, which will usually be raw and unaltered (edited later in post), but just for the performer, to help them hear what they need to hear in order to get the best possible performance.</p>
<p>Latency for soundcards and recording interfaces used in recording studios (both professional and home studios) is very tightly controlled and consistent, so the latency issues you mention aren't really a problem in a recording studio environment. Typically the latency is much too small to notice when performing.</p></div>		</li>
