			<div class="markdown"><p>Brain cells are constantly firing. The information is in how fast or slow they are firing. Because of the random firing of brain cells close together, sometimes this will cause you to twitch (if it is in the motor cortex). Sometimes it causes you to say 'irregardless' instead of 'irrespective' or 'regardless'.</p>
<p>I would also use the visual metaphor or a large, 3D spiderweb rather than a filing cabinet. Sometimes the random firing causes you to go left in the network when you should have gone up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I donâ€™t know if this is allowed,</p>

<p>From the sidebar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>E is for Explain, and LI5 means friendly, simplified and layperson-accessible explanations - not responses aimed at literal five-year-olds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So i would say, yeah, it's allowed, as long as you explain the context of why you used the word, which you did.</p></div>		</li>
