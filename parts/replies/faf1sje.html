<p>I would have posted this sooner, but I got sucked into all 1:14:00 of it. Great doc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Producer here: doubling vocals is still a pretty common practice today.  In fact, because we're in a stereo world, a lot of things are doubled to sound fuller, guitars in particular (doubled and then each is hard panned to the left and right, respectively).  I'll also note that recording to tape will sound different than digital, which certainly contributes to OP's question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a musician but not a producer, could i ask you why is it more effective doubling a track and using  each duplicate in different channels, rather than using only one track without panning, leaving it stereo?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doubling is nice because there are slight timing and pitch discrepancies which result in a more textured sound. A guitar with a chorus pedal somewhat emulates this but it's not an identical affect. </p>
<p>The thing is, you cant just copy and paste the track and get that doubled effect. Try it if you get the chance but most likely the only difference after you mix a single mono track and 2 copied tracks hard panned is the latter sounds &quot;wider&quot; in your headset. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, youre leveraging those itsy bitsy differences in each take to add more color to the part and hard panning certain instruments to create a wider sounding mix. There's a lot of nuance in this technique that doesn't require hard panning but thats the gist from my knowledge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exact same track &quot;panned&quot; left and right is the same as mono track. When you put the same thing in both ears, it will sound like one thing coming from the center.</p>
<p>Each note in different take is a little different and has a little different timing enough for your brain to recognize them as different sounds, making hard pan left and right sound exactly like that - wide sound coming at both of your ears.</p>
<p><a href="https://files.catbox.moe/atdtos.mp4" target="_blank">Here's a quick demonstration (audio and video are completely out of sync, but you get the idea)</a> using slowed down playback. When you slow down the playback, you can hear more clearly that the wide sound consists of different takes for left and right. <strong>The top stereo track is original, the bottom tracks for left and right are duplicate of just one channel, hence it will sound mono</strong>.</p>
<p>For the bottom tracks, I also demonstrate how phase shift creates a kind of stereo effect. However, it sounds like a room effect with still just single source of sound, which is kind of what a real room does - different reflections come at your ears at slightly different times, but if you play one instrument, then it sounds like one instrument.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don’t just copy paste the track, you slightly modify the left and right tracks so that your ear can pick up the discrepancies.  You can double a chord and detune both in slightly different ways, then pan left and right for a very full sound since your ear will interpret the chords as different sounds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you say tape sounds different, you mean noise, and soft clipping/compression, right? I have to say, there’s something human about liking that kind of distortion or colour to the sound</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Guitars may even be doubled per side and even blend the panning (so some are hard some are 10%). On top of that you can run out to multiple stacks or cabs and blend those together.</p></div>		</li>
