Both places are geologically active, but neither seems to have cataclysmic events.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It all depends on the size and speed of rifting along with how long it can go on for. Not all flood basalts are equal, but they generally are rather impactful on the environment. I believe the gas content of the rifting eruptions is extremely relevant here in that regard.</p>
<p>Fwiw, some of the largest explosive eruptions are believed to have occurred during the initial phases of the afar rift event in what is now yemen. These eruptions were much larger than Toba or the Yellowstone eruptions , but there is very limited info on them.</p>
<p>As for Iceland, it just isn't active enough relative to other flood basalt zones. Basically, unless a flood basalt is adding co2 faster than the atmosphere can remove it for a very long time period, it likely won't cause problems for the global environment. Iceland just doesn't add enough co2 to be an issue right now since it's quieter relative to some of the ancient flood basalts. The Siberian traps on the other hand really overwhelmed the co2 levels, and it's believed to have hit a very large coal seam which made things even worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well Iceland is an island formed on an already activate rift system. The rifting in East Africa is on the continent, and so potentially could - in millions of years - become a Large Igneous Province with enough eruption to cause extinction like the Siberian traps did for the end Permian. There's a long way to go until that happens though, and no guarantee it will continue that long: the Atlantic Ocean originally rifted up through Europe, IIRC that's why you have things like the North Sea. For some reason it stopped and rifting moved over to it's current position.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The p/t extinction resulting from the Siberian traps was quick, yet the flood basalt event was a million year long event. Continental breakups can absolutely cause extinction events provided that they're associated with large enough flood basalt eruptions (which frequently occur during Continental breakups). After that, it all depends how much the flood basalt could wreck the ecosystem and environment.</p>
<p>Climate systems tend to be a series of negative feedback loops. So they can endure a lot of stress, but when something powerful enough can push them past those points of stress, the entire system can break down rather quick. From my knowledge of the Siberian traps event, that's kind of how it occurred.</p>
<p>So when you think of million year long events, keep th above in mind. Also keep in mind the fact that during these events, there were periods of greatly heightened eruptive volumes and climatic impacts, likely within a short time span.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which ones specifically? Many theropod dinosaurs survived the K-T extinction event and their descendants evolved into birds. Given that many species have an average lifespan of about a million years then this could be a rather meaningless statement based upon the dinosaurs that we know <strong>survived</strong> the end-Cretaceous, rather than any which were staggering around for a million years. </p>
<p>That mass extinction in particular is known to have an instantaneous factor involved - the Chixulub impactor. That doesnâ€™t mean that all the exctinctions occurred instantly of course, but high-resolution radiometric dating of volcanic ashbeds in Montana and Haiti (located near geological evidence of the asteroid impact that killed the dinosaurs) suggests that mass extinction took place <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/339/6120/684" target="_blank">within 32,000 years.</a></p>
<p>In general, extinction events are not thought to take millions of years, but up to hundreds of thousands years at most. The causes that result in the extinction event may take longer to stress the ecosystem sufficiently, and the recovery of biodiversity may take several millions of years, but these are slightly different things.</p></div>		</li>
