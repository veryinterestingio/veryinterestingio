			<div class="markdown"><p>Birds with bird flu exhibit strange behavior, diahrrea, head swelling, and sometimes discharge from the eyes</p>
<p>Human flu is comparatively very tame. Some asymptomatic birds have been observed to still die spontaneously after contracting bird flu (likely stroke or blood clot)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its critical in this discussion to realize that the same virus affects different species in very different ways. </p>
<p>Humans have a special relationship with chickens, in that we have a protein receptor in our respiratory system that has a large number of similarities to one found in a chickens digestive system.</p>
<p>This means that chickens can have a virus, usually an influenza strain, that has anywhere from minimal, to deadly results on them. And that virus only has to undergo a small mutation to begin to infect and spread in humans. </p>
<p>But the symptoms are totally different, as can be the results. Because in chickens its in their digestive system, but humans our respiratory. So chickens might get the the shits while humans get pneumonia.</p></div>		</li>
