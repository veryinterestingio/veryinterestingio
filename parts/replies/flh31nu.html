			<div class="markdown"><p>Language and culture have a reciprocal relationship, so in general the fact that the Hawaiian language makes these distinctions means that the age difference is important culturally (or was at some point in time). Essentially what I mean by this is that there is no real limit to the complexity or specificity that familial terms can take, other than the specificity still being culturally important.</p>
<p>Think about the role of Godparents for example, culturally they are/were important (if something should happen to the parents Godparents step in) so they get a specific appellation, despite not necessarily being related by blood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And, to elaborate on your point about godparents: the term is connected to baptisms and the role of Christianity in family life, so as society has moved away from religion as the dominant social force, the term has seen less frequent use. I know very few people today who have godparents, and it may eventually fall out of use entirely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on - in Hindi, the term for Father’s Older Brother is distinct from Father’s younger brother, while there is no distinction between Father’s Sisters, and no distinction age-wise on Mother’s siblings. Hindi-speaking societies were strongly patrilineal and patriarchal, so this is reflected in the language as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is/was this distinction made because if something happens to Father, Father's Older Brother was to step in and support the family?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Check out Korean kinship terms. Here's a good blog post about it: <a href="https://thetalkingcupboard.com/2013/05/11/korean-family-and-kinship-terms/" target="_blank">https://thetalkingcupboard.com/2013/05/11/korean-family-and-kinship-terms/</a></p>
