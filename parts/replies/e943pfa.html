			<div class="markdown"><p>and the reason for this is dynamic pressure, essentially, as you increase your velocity the dynamic pressure of the air you're traveling through increases at a rate of (1/2)*(density)(velocity)\^2</p>
<p>Essentially, you have a &quot;stagnation pressure&quot; which is equal to static pressure+dynamic pressure. Stagnation pressure remains constant under the speed of sound, so this relationship allows a lot of valuable aerodynamic equations to be created.</p>
<p>Dynamic pressure is one of the most important concepts for flight, aerodynamics, and fuel efficiency.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Beat me too it. On the Alex Roy run across America I know (modified BMW M5) they were looking at averaging around 120 MPH as it was the sweet spot between speed and fuel mileage to do it on 3 stops instead of 4. As the most upvoted comment says - depends on way to many variables.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The sweet spot of my M4 with 450hp is at between 120km/h-140km/h (75-86mph) anything over that would just start draining too much fuel.</p>
<p>At 120mph an M4/M5 would have 15 miles per gallon, maybe less. Maybe the measurement was made taking into account the price of gas in the US. Here in Europe we would be fucked because it's so expensive.</p></div>		</li>

It's about a guy who broke the Canonball Run record that Alex Roy previously held, and it's a fantastic article. The best part is if you read the comments, there's someone that used to have the Canonball record bitching about how Alex Roy doesn't actually have the record, and then Alex Roy actually responds to him, and it's just a hilarious mess of nit picky drama; wrapped up in an amazing story about cars, racing, and doing things for the hell of it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect. 55mph / 90km/h  is the most fuel efficient speed for most 1970's-era cars. The national 55 mph speed limit (in the US) was implemented as a gas-saving measure in the 70's during the energy crisis.  in 1970, 55 mph was pretty close to the optimal speed to maximize gas mileage for most of the cars on the road at that time.  As others have tried to point out, current-day transmissions and engines, and aerodynamics, have changed this significantly.  edit.  Someone pointed out that , because of the 55 mph speed limit, manufacturers optimize their engine/ transmission/ aerodynamic for 55-65 mph.  Which makes sense.  But I'm sure that I've seen some research done (in an audi I think) which found it did best around 80/85.  Cant fine it tho </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It all depends on the car. For example, my 2016 Mazda6 I can get 50mpg at 60mph in the right conditions, however at 80mph I get lower 30s. My 2014 Chrysler 300C on the other hand would get about 35mpg at 80mph and gets better gas mileage on average at those speeds due to the 8 speed transmission even though it's much heavier and build like a box lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To run the engine most efficiently, you need to look at the brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc) at that speed and power. That is the fuel required to produce a given power, often expressed as grams of fuel per kilowatt of power per hour. The engine may be more efficient at another speed and power. For overall efficiency of the system, it's best to run the engine at it's most efficient bsfc. New engines can target where their bsfc will be the best (lower is better) based on overall system optimization. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends. First off engines have an optimal RPM where they are most efficient at converting fuel into power.  At idle speed you are going to be outside optimal engine efficiency which could override the savings due to reduced drag and rolling resistance. It depends on the gearing of the vehicle though. </p>
<p>Also, idle speed is basically the lowest RPM you can safely run the engine without risking it stalling. At that speed there's a higher percentage of the power being lost as parasitic drag to the engine and its accessories too. So for every turn of the engine you spend more energy on sustaining itself and relatively less on moving the vehicle. As you increase RPM the the internal friction increases but a higher percentage of the power gets put to use moving the vehicle. At some point these two factors cross over and you'll be at your optimum engine speed. </p>
<p>My car idles at 700rpm but I see the best steady state fuel economy at about 1500 rpm cruising in top gear although as they say... your mileage may vary. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, at lot of engines are near to their max efficiently and full throttle.  That is to say, you get the most mechanical energy per unit of fuel burned.  So, in some cars, the most fuel efficient way to drive is to floor it up to somewhere between 60 and 80 mph where, depending on the aerodynamics of that particular car, you start to run into issues with drag.  Then you turn off the engine (yes, I know that would make it hard to steer, etc.. but we are looking for &quot;most efficient&quot;) then coast down to 15-20 mph, where rolling resistance becomes and issue; then do it again.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How could that be, though? Put another way, in a given gear, the faster I want the engine to turn the more gas I have to give it. At idle speeds, I’m giving the engine the least amount of gas possible while still having it run. To go any faster, I have to increase the fuel flow. It seems like it should be impossible to increase the mileage that way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer is the most fuel efficient speed for your engine would be the lowest speed the engine can run while at the lowest gear. In my car that is 6th gear and 1.5kRPM. That equates to around 45-50 mph. Some cars can go even higher than that before hitting their lowest gear, and after around 50mph the air resistance starts to really matter. </p></div>		</li>
