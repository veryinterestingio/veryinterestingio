<p>Of course, at a redshift of z=0.28, we're seeing the galaxies as they were about 3 billion years ago, so they should be merged by now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>don't we measure &quot;now&quot; by when we see them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a just linguistic convention so that we don't have to say &quot;5 years ago plus the light delay time&quot; every single sentence.</p>
<p>In special relativity, there is a time interval between when the light was emitted and when it got here. The light took time to get here, and any valid frame of reference would agree that we are seeing the past.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say that depends on your definition of &quot;now&quot;.</p>
<p>Is it &quot;13.8 billion years after the big bang&quot;? Or &quot;casually connected to the observer's now&quot;?</p></div>		</li>
