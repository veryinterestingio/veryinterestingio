			<div class="markdown"><p>The history of the Cascadia subduction zone is fascinating to me. Especially how precisely the last earthquake and tsunami has been dated, down to the time of day, in a region where the people were pre-literate...thanks to native stories, dendrochronology, and Japanese tsunami records.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Japan has better written records than the PNW.   Geologists and historians have actually correlated tsunamis that are well documented in Japan with local legend from native peoples in the PNW.   It's one way we know the frequency of the cascadia fault slips.   ~300 years.   Even though white people have only lived near for ~170 years</p></div>		</li>
