			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, the <em>home</em> delivery method has always been slowly improving. Even though film contained the quality we're now discovering, they certainly weren't getting that via vhs or broadcast on CRT tv's. I'm even gonna question the ability of in-theater projectors of the era to convey the quality of the imagery contained on film (someone feel free to prove me wrong here, I'm just guessing). If that's actually the case then we really aren't catching up, we're just tapping into the undiscovered potential that film has had all along.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We've already reached the peak resolution for most films. Traditional 35mm film yields about 2K to 3K in resolvable resolution. So those 1080p Blu-rays are already pretty close to 35mm's max resolution. You'll only get a little more detail on the 4K Blu-ray if the film had especially good lenses and film stock. 70mm films like 2001 or The Sound of Music probably have 5K-6K in resolvable detail but there's not many of those.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. 35mm can scan well up to 6K resolution.</p>
<p>70mm is more like 12K, and 70mm IMAX is around 18K.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe in overly optimistic scientific tests. I've personally run resolution tests against 4K Blu-rays and 35mm sources rarely go over 3K in detail.</p>
<p>2001 also barely hits 4K in detail. I bet most 70mm films are going to land in the 5K area. The optics of the 60s area are far more limited than most people assume.</p></div>		</li>
