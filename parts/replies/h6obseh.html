			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth pointing out that electric cars require you to obtain the metals and minerals for the battery only once, for the initial manufacture. Petroleum cars require you to obtain oil on an ongoing basis, for every gallon of fuel consumed.</p>
<p>Also, presumably petroleum cars require more parts replacements over their lifetime (spark plugs, exhausts, gaskets, fan belts etc.). I'm guessing the number of replacement parts for an EV will be much smaller.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As an EV owner (motorcycle), yes, very much so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, but they are already building plants to recycle the batteries, and if not they are storing them for when the tech is ready. So yeah, still better than ICEs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We've learned a lot since the first generation of EVs. Modern cars with liquid cooled batteries degrade far far slower than passive air cooled batteries. Car software is also better able to manage charging and discharging to reduce degradation.</p>
<p>To say they need 'regular' replacements is just plain wrong. In most cases the battery can outlive the rest of the car if looked after properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s no contest. Yes, the electricity generated to power an electric car CAN come from a polluting source, but a.) it doesn’t have to, and b.) it creates far less pollution to generate than it does to produce, transport, and burn gasoline (70% of the energy in gasoline is wasted as heat in internal combustion engines, for one).
The Union of Concerned Scientists have a good short video on the matter, making it clear that there’s no comparison:

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the study in question usually handles the often discussed scenario of &quot;keep driving my old petrol car is better than switching to new electric one&quot;.</p>
<p>And they almost never include into calculations the cost/impact of actually transporting fuel from refineries/depots to your local petrol stations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you were to &quot;junk&quot; an old car that could be driven for 10 more years, and switch to an EV, that would not be greener.  But if you sell your old car to someone else, who will drive it for those 10 years, then they are probably getting a newer, more efficient, more &quot;green&quot;, gasoline car, and you are getting an EV, so that is greener for both of you.</p></div>		</li>
