<p>Edit: I mean the keeping track part</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. And no.
While yes, at higher speeds the damage done by even small things rapidly increases.</p>
<p>The spaces involved are so large and so empty tbe chance of hitting something is even lower.
Unless you get to something close to light speed.</p>
<p>And if your going in one direction, you can expect to only be hit at the front/back. (If you have to slow down too.)
And if you were to put your water or waste tanks there they would take most of the hit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the chance of getting hit by a &quot;rock&quot; (something the size of a fist or larger) on your way to mars are close to 0, and yes the keeping track part would be more difficult but would still be done, (I'd assume both from the spaceship and from earth)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well not entirely, you can rely on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whipple_shield" target="_blank">spaced armour</a> a fair bit. And yes that is &quot;spaced&quot; armour in every sense of the word haha.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yea, forgot they had that. Though space walks should still fall under the pray category.
Unless they are armored as well.</p></div>		</li>
