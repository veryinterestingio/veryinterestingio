			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a scientist, but based on what Iâ€™ve seen when my Fitbit tracks my sleep, we bounce back and forth between light sleep, REM, and deep sleep, which I believe correspond to stages 2, 3, and obviously, REM. There never seemed to be any order in my sleep. Most people typically spend around an hour awake at night as well, cumulatively. Itâ€™s just in 1-2 sometimes 5 minute segments at a time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also not a scientist but from what I've researched trying to fix my own garbage sleep, yes, you go through multiple sleep cycles. Typically each cycle lasts a bit longer than the previous one, but they start at about 40 minutes. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Sleep_Hypnogram.svg/1200px-Sleep_Hypnogram.svg.png" target="_blank">Here is a visualization.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to wear a Fitbit (granted, it was years ago so technology may have changed) but when I looked at my sleep, I was in deep sleep the entire night. Maybe 1 or 2 light blue lines. I dream a lot and can recall almost every detail. I wonder what that means! Maybe Iâ€™m just a super deep sleeper? Itâ€™s all so fascinating!! Thank you for your insight!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I often start dreaming within minutes of falling asleep, sometimes it's even seemed like it's been before I'm &quot;asleep&quot; and still aware of my surroundings to an extent. I've even gotten up, grabbed some water, laid back down and within a minute or two pick up exactly where the dream left off. Staying asleep however is a luxury i don't often know. I've had a few damn long nights where I've only slept in 20 minute chunks with about 5 minutes awake between but continued the same hella vivid dream each time I get back to sleep.</p>
<p>Edit: I've never been tested for any sleep disorders, seriously considering looking into it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it goes 01234-234-234-234 in 45 minute increments. </p>
<p>You only remember dreams of the last 4 segment before waking because the other dreams were replaced. Your brain may have even been making a whole story, and you only remember near the end, which is why people have weird dreams that make no sense. The outlines that make the story make sense were in previous dreams.</p>
<p>You sort of wake up after the REM (4) stage every time to reposition yourself if youâ€™re uncomfortable, and if youâ€™re comfy, you donâ€™t stay awake long. Thatâ€™s why it can be easy and hard to wake people; theyâ€™re in different stages of the cycle. Waking someone in 2 is harder than waking someone in 4.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a phenomenon that occurs for me, which is during the 5-10 minute phase (meaning, if a noise occurs, I immediately become conscious that I was falling asleep). During this time, and when I've been unexpectedly awoken, I often realize I was already dreaming. I definitely would not be in REM state when this occurs. The dreams are often fleeting as well, meaning I can't recall them after a minute if I haven't made a note of them somehow.</p>
<p>Does science say there is dreaming also outside of REM?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, yes. It's called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnagogia" target="_blank">&quot;hypnagogia&quot;</a> and you will experience dreams or hallucinations without being in REM sleep. </p>
<p>Very common and nothing to worry about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While the lucidity is neat I wish it didn't happen every other night and I could get some satisfying sleep...</p>
<p>I often find that I get into a hypnogogic state and then am suddenly very awake and can't get back to sleep for an hour or two. Case in point, here I lay exhausted after starting to dream while only half asleep but can't get settled down again, before I resorted to perusing Twitter after trying to roll over for the tenth time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dream a lot in those conditions too. I used to also &quot;dream&quot; a lot when I did heroin and would nod out and it would feel so much like I was somewhere completely different like a dream but I was awake, just heavily under the influence of opiates. Or like if you wake up in the morning and try to get a little more rest but not go back to sleep fully I dream a lot then too</p></div>		</li>
