			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good answer. Yes, the suspension compression can have some effect, but even in a vehicle with little or no suspension, when your deceleration (negative acceleration) abruptly hits zero, your back muscles yank you backwards since they were tensed in compensation for the deceleration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Way late, but that got me thinking. In karting if you come to a stop quickly to avoid an accident or something you do get that backward motion as you said. If what you said is correct your muscles are still acting like the springs in a car. What happens to a theoretically completely rigid block that comes to a stop after a consistent deceleration?</p></div>		</li>
