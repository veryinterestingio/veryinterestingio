So I didn't go into that detail.</p>
<p>Controlled inflation is not for consumer level spending. That will happen regardless. Inflation serves two purposes that increase currency liquidity. </p>
<p>A. It encourages corporate spending and money reuse from the top down. The amount of money reuse in an economy is so important to stability and prosperity that it's called the economic velocity.</p>
<p>B. It devalues old debt, which prevents the economy from going into debt based stagnation as the value of old unpaid debts exceeds the real value of the economy.</p>
<p>In the past different economies have had different engines that grant value to currency, but this is the engine of our current economy. Spending. It's not perfect.
But compared to the gold standard that saw, sometimes 500 year periods of nearly total global stagnation and deflation, and concentrated wealth to such an extent that arguably the industrial revolution wouldn't have happened if not for new discoveries of gold and the investment that inflation encouraged.</p>
<p>Other systems that have done a good job of solving this problem have used other methods, wealth tax, lenient bankruptcy laws, limited corporate debt liability and direct intervention.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't it more so be that money is &quot;created&quot; through interest rates?  Everything that involves interest payments contributes to the majority of inflation. For a simplified example, if there's $100 controlled by a central bank, and they loan you $50 with a lump sum of $10 owed in interest... Where would that extra $10 come from? The interest involved in that loan now puts the total amount of money into the equation as $110.  It didn't exist until they added interest onto the loan. This happening on a much more complex and grander scale makes it so that it is impossible to reach a global 0 in debt. Money is constantly being devalued, and we expect inflation regardless of the state of the economy because it's a mathematical fallacy.</p></div>		</li>
