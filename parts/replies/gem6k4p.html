<p>Two full doses resulted in ~60%.</p>
<p>One initial <em>half</em> dose, followed by the second being a full dose increased it to ~95%</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two major differences with the Oxford vaccine results:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Oxford vaccination protocol regularly tested its patients for covid-19, whereas the Pfizer and Moderna protocols relied on symptomatic cases.  The Oxford numbers therefore include asymptomatic cases, whereas Pfizer/Moderna exclude them; if the vaccine decreases the intensity of disease then this could account for some of the efficacy difference.</li>
<li>The half-full Oxford protocol was an accidental error, not a deliberate test.  As a result of that happenstance, that group was both smaller and demographically nonrepresentative of the other groups (preferentially younger); the 90% number might not generalize.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Oxford vaccine is a viral-vector based vaccine, a lower initial dose may lower the risk of mounting an effective secondary response against the vector, increasing the efficacy of the second dose, but this is entirely speculation. Sub-clinical infections are really important, if the role of the virus is to be protecting the population, rather than individuals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The AstraZeneca &quot;1.5&quot; dose results are very weak statistically as they assume that less than 30 people in the vaccinated group were exposed to the virus and hence have very wide confidence interval bounds - the true efficacy of the &quot;half&quot; followed by full dose could be as low as 70%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of the vaccines, so far, require 2 doses. Further studies will be done on whether one dose is sufficient, but right now, we can't afford to approach vaccination conservatively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't realize they all need 2 doses. Thanks! Not sure what your second comment means. It comes down to tolerability at the end. As long as it's safe and gets a desired response - they'll pack in as much as they can now. Maybe that's what you meant?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He’s saying that maybe right now we don’t have much evidence whether or not two doses of the vaccine are really necessary. Yeah two doses is better than one, but maybe later we will learn that the second dose is unnecessary. The goal right now is just to show that it’s safe and to get the at-risk people vaccinated ASAP.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read a similar article today that said it's looking like the vaccine is good for 3 months... is that because we know for certain it lasts only that long or just because that's the longest we've seen so far? (As in, we need to keep watching for the next year or so).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Limitations of current data.</p>
<p>The first people in any phase 2/3 trial for COVID19 got their first injection on July 27th. With 3 weeks between first dose and booster, that's... End of August for them to be qualifyingly vaccinated with full dose. Only 4mo has even passed since then, and the difference between 3 and 4 months is easily eaten up by needing to have enough patients hit milestones, plus clinical follow-up and non-instantaneous data analysis.</p>
<p>I have not seen anything yet that actually suggests non-dutable or waning efficacy any time too soon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if you're talking about vaccine stability or usefulness with humans.</p>
<p>For stability - companies are allowed to claim based on available data and push to get vials on stability as quickly as possible so they understand their edge cases (i.e. RT, 2-8C, -80C, and accelerated conditions of 40C/60%RH).</p>
<p>I'd assume that they cannot claim efficacy past a certain point and will continue to monitor titers as well in phase 4 continued studies.</p></div>		</li>
