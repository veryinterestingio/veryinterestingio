<p>Immunity only works if the virus is the same over the course a person may be infected by it. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn’t quite right.  Even if the virus changes dramatically, you can still get boosting to the parts that don’t change. Antibodies only really care about the shape of a small part of their target protein, maybe ten or so critical amino acids, so there’s plenty of ways for a virus to mutate and even to lose some of the antibody response, while some of the antibodies still persist and get boosted. </p>
<p>In the case of influenza (and as I always point out, influenza is unique, and rules that apply to influenza don’t apply to other viruses) this backfires for humans, because you end up boosting antibodies that aren’t very helpful for protection, because influenza can mutate the regions that are required for antibody neutralization. </p>
<p>Other viruses can’t do that, which is why vaccines against things like measles, mumps, yellow fever, rubella, polio, etc have remained effective for fifty years and more.  </p>
<p>In the case of SARS-CoV-2, we know that antibodies against the receptor-binding region are neutralizing and (almost certainly) protective. There may be other places that also lead to protective antibodies. The RBS is pretty fine-tuned, and it will be hard for the virus to make the 5-10 mutations it needs to avoid previous antibodies. Again, this is different from influenza, because everything is different from influenza. </p>
<p>So even though there are some cases where a changed virus won’t boost immunity, in the case of COVID-19, it’s very likely that repeat exposure to the virus (after you’re solidly immune) <em>will</em> boost immunity. </p>
<p>Couple caveats - if you’re re-exposed when your immunity is really high, you may well eliminate the repeat exposure so fast and completely that there’s no booster effect. If you’re re-exposed when your immunity is low (maybe after ten years - or maybe if you’re immune suppressed for some reason) you may get the booster effect, but still feel sick for a bit before you eliminate the reinfection.</p>
<p>This is all super simplified, of course. Some researchers are trying to take advantage of the focused booster effect to make a better influenza vaccine, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>HIV is complicated. The body certainly makes antibodies against it, but they’re not protective as a rule. There’s better protection against HIV from T cells, but because T cells tend to be more sensitive to single amino acid mutations it’s easier for HIV to escape from them (though often at the cost of being much less efficient at replicating - so the T cell response does protect, but not completely). </p>
<p>There are a few individuals who have successfully made antibodies that protect against a wide range of HIV viruses. Those antibodies are reasonably well understood, but it’s been very difficult to make vaccines that consistently elicit that class of antibodies.</p></div>		</li>
