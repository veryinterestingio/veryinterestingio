			<div class="markdown"><p>This is in line with what I've been hearing from various people--the telecoms companies don't have any incentive to care, so they don't. </p>
<p>Is there really no other way to address this though? Maybe something like a custom DNS service for phone numbers? Or are we stuck waiting for politicians to put in some effort to <em>motivate</em> corporations?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, there is a solution, called [STIR/SHAKEN](<a href="https://www.bandwidth.com/regulations/stir-shaken/" target="_blank">https://www.bandwidth.com/regulations/stir-shaken/</a> ), developed by the telephone companies.  This allows the phone company to know if the caller ID is the actual dialing number, and which phone company (if any) actually has a subscriber for the call.  There is a June 30, 2021 requirement for all exchange operators to have it deployed.  [FCC Rules](<a href="https://www.fcc.gov/call-authentication" target="_blank">https://www.fcc.gov/call-authentication</a> )</p>
<p>What to do with this information?  In the US, most telcos are using it to put &quot;SPAM RISK&quot; in the caller ID.  You want to be able to get your telco to &quot;send those calls directly to voice-mail without ringing the phone&quot;, but that's not currently allowed in the regulations.  You don't want the telco choosing who can call you, they might decide not to let Democratic Party fundraisers call you, or a Republican get-out-the-vote campaign.  As a result, the laws are pretty clear, <strong>all calls must go through</strong>.</p>
<p>If you don't like that, talk to your legislators.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just wanted to add that there are valid times when companies would want to spoof numbers. Suppose a company tech is calling you about a support issue. They might not want the number to be the tech's desk phone. You wouldn't recognize that and might not pick up. However, if the number displayed is their main line, you might pick up the phone.</p>
<p>Also, if the tech's desk line is displayed, you might keep calling him directly, even if your ticket was moved to another department or closed. Plus, if you had a future issue, you might try calling that poor tech directly rather than going through the main line. Spoofing allows them to mask the techs' lines and direct everyone through the main line.</p>
<p>Of course, these solutions take this into account by recognizing that these numbers belong to the company and so they're allowed to spoof them. However, Random Scammer wouldn't own the number he's trying to spoof so he wouldn't be allowed to show that number.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can get apps to filter those spam risk calls from ringing, on a smart phone. Most major carriers even have their own. Cut my spam that actually gets through down to maybe 10% of what it was before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in the EU and I've had robocalls but it's extremely rare. Like the last one was probably a few years ago.</p>
<p>When I had a company phone I got a couple of pointless sales calls a week but since I got a private phone and added myself to the no call list the sales calls have pretty much gone away as well. I get some call-and-hang-ups from like Tunisia or similar a couple of times per year but that's it.</p>
<p>Sales/robocalls are absolutely possible to handle with legislation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It's profitable for the callers. Making a thousand &quot;your car's extended warranty&quot; robocalls doesn't cost much. If you get ten suckers to continue on and send you money, then you've made a profit. As long as there's profit to be made, they'll keep doing this.</p>
</li>
<li>In addition, many of these are outright scams looking to bilk people out of thousands of dollars. Again, they might call a thousand people before getting a sucker hooked, but if that sucker sends them $10,000, they've made a profit.</li>

<p>Most of these calls originate from overseas.  The US has zero jurisdiction to police these calls, so the Do Not Call list does nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a legal sense you are absolutely right.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>...now Biden could tell Modi to do something about it or the US won't give them aid anymore (as the LARGE majority of them originate from India) somehow I'm sure a few cops with sticks will be on the hunt</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but then it would be Modi who was policing it, not the US.  </p>
<p>I doubt he would, though.  As much as he would be loathe to admit it, those scammy call centers are a source of employment for India.  No one wants to be the PM that killed thousands of jobs.</p></div>		</li>
