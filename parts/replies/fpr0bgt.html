			<div class="markdown"><p>What does it mean for a point to be rotating faster than c? Rotation is measured in radians/s or rpm or whatever, and c is in m/s. In order to convert radians/sec to m/s you need a radius... but a singularity has no radius.</p>
<p>Or is this related to how some equations allow for a ring-shaped singularity, which would have radius but no thickness?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hope it doesn’t violate the rules here to say that “ringularity” is the sort of thing that makes me love science and scientists.  It’s both a perfect description and such dry humor.  The other one in this area is “spaghettification,” which is both grimly funny and a pretty apt description of tidal forces in at least some forms of singularity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The user was talking about points at the event horizon, outside the singularity. For these points you can derive the circumference and divide it by the duration of a rotation (&quot;circumference&quot; and &quot;duration&quot; have a slightly different meaning in respect to the usual definition but that's not important).</p>
<p>The usual equations provide nonsense results at the singularity, so you are correct in that there is no definition of speed there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They would appear to be moving, just like far away galaxies APPEAR to be accelerating away from us. But in reality what is accelerating is the expansion of space, so the actual acceleration is null. Same goes for the question of OP. If space itself is dragged, the objects within that space are not actually moving and thus there is no limit of how fast they (or the space they are in) could be dragged along. It's an excellent question and I am looking forward to the actual answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Consider the following thought experiment. A spaceship leaves from a planet 4 light years away, travelling to earth. It arrives after 5 years, so it travelled slower than light. But the light of the spaceship taking off took 4 years to travel to earth, so you see the spaceship leave in year 4, and then see it arrive in year 5. From your perspective, it looks like the spaceship travelled 4 light years in 1 year, but if you do the math, you realize it actually didn't. Similar, but more complicated, illusions can occur near black holes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't get it. The spaceship took off from Earth, so why would its light take 4 years to get to Earth?</p></div>		</li>
