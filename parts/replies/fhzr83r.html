<p>Maybe also a colossal artificial magnetic field to deflect solar winds.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Basically, mine the moon and Mars for massive amounts of useful metals, then ship it via space elevators, build a ship capable of keeping a billion humans and then we can do cool stuff! Certainly better than just hoping some giant shades that might have to be absolutely gigantic will protect us.</p></div>		</li>
