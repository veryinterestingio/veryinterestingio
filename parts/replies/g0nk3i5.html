			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. In this case assuming the earth is an inertial frame is a good approximation, but is ever so slightly incorrect. Assuming the earth is inertial leads to the exact same drop time for heavier objects. Assuming the earth is not inertial and accommodating for that will lead to different drop times for heavier and lighter objects. This is of course neglecting relativity.</p></div>		</li>
