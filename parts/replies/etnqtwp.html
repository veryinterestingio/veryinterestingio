			<div class="markdown"><p>The wax melts and soaks into the wick, where it is slowly vaporized by the heat of the flame. The vapor is a hydrocarbon, so it burns immediately. The wick isn't what is burning; the vaporizing wax keeps it cooler than the ignition point of the material. The end of the wick only burns when the wax can't make it there before being completely vaporized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A flame does definitly not convert atoms (wax) to heat/light (energy). It's not an antimatter reactor.
The heat / light is created by a simple exothermic chemical reaction that converts the complex molecules in the wax to simpler gasous molecules like CO2, CO and a couple others that have lesser bonds than those complex molecules and therefor lesser total energy.</p></div>		</li>
