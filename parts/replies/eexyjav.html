			<div class="markdown"><p>I took hgh shots as a kid because I was deficient and not growing. There are limits to how much you can take each day because of the side effects. Nevertheless, it does work wonders. I went from having grown 0 inches in a an entire year to 2.5 inches in the next. Also, as a side note, you shouldn't type &quot;on average ... at best&quot;. It does not make sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The treatment that leads to that 3 inches cost about $60,000 a year (2013 cost); long term side effects are also unknown. That should be taken into account. </p></div>		</li>
