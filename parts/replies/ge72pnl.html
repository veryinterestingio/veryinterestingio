<p>during a two-week period, 130,000 workers visited 100 million homes there</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That works out to 770 homes per worker, or 55 per day every day. If they worked 10 hour days every day for 14 days that's about 5-6 homes per hour. In dense cities where each home would be an apartment with doors only a few steps apart, it sounds exhausting but definitely doable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, that sounds like a stretch. I wonder if they visited approximately 100 million <em>people</em>. If each house has, say, 5 people that's only about one home per hour per person working 140 hours in two weeks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given the realities of 1970s apartment buildings, dense slums, etc. and how people behave, once you knock on three or four doors in one floor of an apartment building or on one alleyway, the neighbors tend to all stick their heads out their doors to see what's going on. So you can deal with more than one household at a time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Knowing how they go to crazy measures to make sure every citizen is within blocks of a polling station (down to the team of 3 poll workers who travel deep into the forest to get one ballot), their efforts with smallpox doesn't surprise me at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hadn't heard about their effort for smallpox, but I watched a short doc about their effort to eliminate polio, and I remember that being super impressive too. And it touched on the fact that today there are many survivors of polio so being antivax isn't really a thing yet.</p>

<p>The authorities launched a campaign to vaccinate the whole country – 21 million people. They worked so fast that 18 million were vaccinated in just 10 days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As far I remember, teams were sent from north (Slovenia, Croatia) to south (Kosovo, Metohija, rest of Serbia) as help to local and military medicine teams and they went from village to village , house to house. If not opened , there was always police patrol accompanying technicians and they made sure medics entered the house and vaccinated everyone.</p>
<p>On written account of Slovenian technician few months ago, they found persons and babies (Kosovo) that were not even registered in birth books anywhere.</p></div>		</li>
