			<div class="markdown"><p>I love this question! I want to say YES, but unfortunately there is not evidence to support this. We know that if you have already had a stroke or a heart attack, a daily aspirin reduces your risk of having another one. We also know that taking aspirin, and not having had that type of problem, can actually lead to more bleeding problems than reducing your risk of heart attack or stroke. So we’ve moved away from aspirin the last few years. One or two glasses of wine a day may be benficial, but more than that I’m afraid not. I’m sorry to give such a sad answer.</p></div>		</li>
