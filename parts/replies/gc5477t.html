			<div class="markdown"><p>Cargo and container ships world wide have been instructed by the International Maritime Organization to stop using cheap but heavy polluting bunker fuel. From this year, the IMO &quot;requires that all fuels used in ships contain no more than 0.5 percent sulfur. The cap is a significant reduction from the existing sulfur limit of 3.5 percent and is well below the industry average of 2.7 percent sulfur content. Public health experts estimate that once the 2020 sulfur cap takes effect, it would prevent roughly 150,000 premature deaths and 7.6 million childhood asthma cases globally each year.&quot;</p>

<p>Requiring the same of cruise ships is more practical than trying to ban them outright.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you mean ships will have to put on their restricters a few miles from shore when coming into port, and then turn those restrictions off when back out on open water?</p>
<p>Cause thats whats been happening the few places that have tried to regulate big ships. Cash is king</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could be wrong but aren't they talking about refinement of the fuel? It's not like they'd get out over the horizon and the captain goes &quot;alright boys, bring out the sulphur barrels and let's fuck this fuel up good and proper. Don't drop that sulphur strainer! We'll need it to get this shit back out before we hit land.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Refining and what not could be good or bad either way but they still burn 80000 gallons plus a day.  Container ships are probably more.  Gas or diesel  or bunker oil it's still alot of pollution</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no significant economic activity that doesn't produce more  pollution than we'd think it does.  So until we come up with solar powered container ships  (something a Japanese startup is working on <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/energy/renewables/energysails-harness-wind-sun-clean-up-cargo-ships" target="_blank">https://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/energy/renewables/energysails-harness-wind-sun-clean-up-cargo-ships</a>) making the fuel less polluting is the best option unless you advocate eliminating all world trade.</p>
<p>And the disposing of old solar panels is also creating toxic pollution <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/solar-panels-are-starting-to-die-leaving-behind-toxic-trash/" target="_blank">https://www.wired.com/story/solar-panels-are-starting-to-die-leaving-behind-toxic-trash/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's already heavy restrictions for ships within sovereign waters. Once they approach a territory coming out of international water they switch to cleaner legit fuel. They also change from pushing their exhaust out top to in the water. </p>
<p>I watched a documentary or expose on it. I'll try and find.  Its good that they are trying but the biggest problem with maritime law is the ability of ships to fly what flags they want, circumventing laws meant for the country that use the ship, they can just change it, negating any agreement that country has (part of same doc)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The IMO is a UN agency with worldwide regulatory policing power. Flags of convenience are irrelevant when it comes to cargo and container shipping companies following IMO rules.
These new rules came into effect only from this year. So a documentary any older than that would be out of date.</p></div>		</li>
