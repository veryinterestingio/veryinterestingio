<p>A base pair is a brick, a gene is a house, and the human genome is a neighborhood. It takes many bricks to build a single house, and many houses to build a neighborhood, but a neighborhood has many things that aren't houses like roads/pathways/gardens/porches---all of which can be built of bricks, aren't houses (genes), but help support the overall structure and function of a neighborhood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With this analogy there’s a bunch of random ass brick pillars just out in your front/back yard that your porch light doesn’t shine on.
