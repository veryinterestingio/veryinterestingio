			<div class="markdown"><p>If you give the option to skip, people will skip. To be honest it was some years ago so I don't remember the exact information we were showing, but it was something we wanted players to see and the short load time was causing an issue.</p>
<p>It may have actually been the splash screen for the game now that I think about it more. The game loaded too fast so the company intro part went in a flash, the solution ended up being to fake that it was still loading (we only added like a second or something).</p>
<p>But again this is more of an edge case answer I think.</p></div>		</li>
