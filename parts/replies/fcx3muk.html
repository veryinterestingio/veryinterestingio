<p>The virus could be required to be deactivated, perhaps with no later purification needed. </p>

<p>I feel like you've dodged OP's original question with this response. How exactly is a a virus &quot;de-activated&quot;. You'll see some arguments questioning whether a virus is actually a live thing. For the purposes of this discussion, I'll consider it a molecular machine rather than a seed or spore.  If we breed viruses in medium or reactors, what is done to make it a &quot;killed virus&quot; or deactivate it, yet still have it cause the immune response necessary for its vaccination process?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m stealing this analogy from a far better educated poster than I, but the poster you are responding to didn’t dodge the question, he just didn’t dive deep enough, necessarily. “Deactivated” means just that, the machine no longer makes copies of itself. So the key is to keep the virus looking the same (so the immune system will recognize it as, for example, “hey that’s polio! Get him, boys!”), but turning off the copy machine. The machine’s exterior looks the same, but the copier is now broken internally. </p>
<p>Poster referenced using egg albumen then shifting to human cells. This denatures the virus, effectively, by growing the virus in a human cell - ensuring it grows up to LOOK like a recognizable human virus. It evolves to work great in humans!  Then they move that to a chicken egg cell, and let it teach itself to make copies in chicken eggs. Viruses are notoriously fickle about where they will work, so the human-appearing cell will insist on working in albumen only (imagine trying to use your US copier in Europe, where the electric socket plugs don’t match). In short, you’ve made a virus that LOOKS like a human polio virus, but can no longer operate as one. For an extra bonus, using agents like formaldehyde “cook” the virus. Imagine hardboiling an egg. It still retains its general shape and “eggness”, but it is now cooked, or denatured. The cooked virus is the same: it’s shell looks identical or “close enough” where the immune system recognizes it, but the insides are cooked. </p>
<p>I found those examples helpful... and these are primative methodologies, it can get FAR fancier. As to how to check for purity, it’s all about testing at every phase of growth. Then before and after packaging. Then through quality control testing over time periods and under varying atmospheric pressures and conditions. Prior to that, as required by regulation,  it’s tested in clinical trials and monitored by pharmacovigilance programs across the globe. So there is actual ongoing testing throughout the process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple ways you can achieve deactivation! The purpose of deactivation is to stop the viruses from being able to infect, or otherwise severely inhibit it. Usually what happens is that a virus is first grown in a lab, and then killed via heat or some chemical. </p>
<p>Viruses can be further broken down via the usage of detergents, which would shred the pathogen into pieces, but still trigger an immune response. </p>
<p>Deactivated viral vaccines are not as good as live viral vaccinations though, and sometimes you may need to take multiple booster shots to make up for that fact. IIRC its most commonly used for patients who have weakened immune systems.</p></div>		</li>
