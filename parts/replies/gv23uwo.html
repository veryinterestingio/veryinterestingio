			<div class="markdown"><p>It gets even more complicated, as the brain interacts closely with the rest of the body, and could not do &quot;its job&quot; without it: if you are training a skill (let's say throwing a ball or playing the F#m chord on the guitar) it is not only the brain that adopts to the situation, but also the muscles and nerves in your hand or arm.</p>
<p>There is a lot of research on the &quot;mereological fallacy&quot;, i.e. the (wrong) assumption that the brain alone is responsible for such processes. It's a very interesting topic (though probably a bit outside of the &quot;ELI5&quot; scope).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While you're here... I was thinking about this topic recently, and was wondering:</p>
<p>We tend to think of the brain as the controlling organ, getting feedback and putting out &quot;orders&quot; for the body to follow. What if instead of that, we pictured it as a synchronizing tool of some sort?</p>
<p>Like, instead of conceptualizing it as brain -&gt; nerves -&gt; bodypart, we went the other way, with the nerves being some kind of root of a given organ, each having its own, with the common &quot;ground&quot; being the brain, only there so that the organs can coordinate into a single entity.</p>
<p>I don't know, it's not much maybe, but I found this reversal of perpective interesting, and more in line with the little I know about neurology (for instance, how pain signals travel through the body, wether you're stimulating the bodypart directly, or the area of the brain responsible for the sensation).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So, thoughts? Would that be an accurate description? If not, why?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neuroscientist here. Brain controls conscious movement. It’s intertwined significantly with the body, and embodied cognition deserves respect, but the brain is the main player here. It’s sort of like: an engine and a car chassis/wheels. Which one is moving the car?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, that would probably be a more accurate description for octopuses, kinda? They have neuron bundles in their tentacles so that the tentacles can act independantly to the 'main brain'. (Probably) more so using the main brain to synchronise the body rather than it directly controlling it...</p>
<p>That said, where we call the &quot;brain&quot; is a bundle of nerves that happen to store, organize and decide based on stimuli. You could say that the brain is actually just every nerve in your body i suppose due to it being all connected. Interestingly enough, your hand will quickly reflex back after touching a hot surface without going to your brain to decide that, Somewhat supporting your perspective.</p>
<p>There are probably lots of little simple decisions like that all around your body, but either way, for humans the brain is a ridiculously clever thing that decides a large portion of your actions. Its not that we <em>think</em> the brain is a controlling organ, we <em>know</em> its a controlling organ.</p>
<p>Take whatever i've written with salt, im no expert, i just happen to have taken a couple classes...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, this.   I didn’t even try to add that in because... ugh.  That’s like trying to explain 4D, 8-player chess when someone pops up and asks what a rook does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mean the castle?  Yeah I know what you mean in ELI5 threads like this.  I would recommend the book &quot;The Idea of the Brain.&quot;  It's recent and I thought it was very interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a bit more detail, physical skills like handwriting are thought to be initiated in decision-making areas in the frontal and prefrontal cortex (in response to stimuli from sensory organs and memory-encoding regions like the hippocampus and internally-focused perceptive regions like the insular cortex). Following this initiation, skills are organized into the signals that will be sent to the physical muscles in the <a href="https://www.ebmconsult.com/content/images/Anatomy/Homonculus%20Sensory%20and%20Motor%20Cortex%20v2.png" target="_blank">motor cortex</a>, which has distinct but somewhat flexible musculo-topic organization. Generally speaking, signals involving sensory input or motor output in the brain often occur in brain regions that are relatively highly organized, whereas other brain functionality is often more distributed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who experienced severe aphasia but with a particular loss of nouns, I can say from experience that some of language is definitely stored in “a chest of drawers”, although my analogy was filing cabinet. The connection has been severed between the cabinet containing nouns, and the area producing speech. So recovery wasn’t analogous to “memorizing “ vocabulary in a foreign language, it was more like asking where you put your glasses and having someone say “on your head”. I would hold up an object and ask “what ...is?” And someone would tell me, and I’d nod happily and repeat it. After visiting that “drawer” many many times, I re-learned where to find my nouns. I didn’t need to learn every single noun all over again.</p></div>		</li>
