What the hell are these 'May flowers' I keep hearing about?&quot;</p>
<p>Heck, as I speak it's almost 90 degrees outside, and we're still in May.</p></div>		</li>

But last month a storm blew through, then the next day the system had changed and the same rain that went through the day before came right back at us</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is 100% the case. For example, where I grew up we only got snow if the storm moves from the South to the North. If it comes from the East it picks up too much moisture over the ocean, and if it comes from the West then the mountains restrict the lower portion of the storm and we only get the upper atmospheric changes. </p>
<p>But everything from nor'easters, to hurricanes, to even el nino/la nina patterns can make it so we get our weather from different parts of the world.</p></div>		</li>
