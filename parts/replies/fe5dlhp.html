			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but melanin isn't the only pigment used in every living organism. Reptiles, for example have three types:   melanophores, xanthophores and iridophores. That's why albino, or amelanistic, snakes aren't pure white, but still have creamy white colors with yellow and/or red markings. Depending on the organism there are many more besides those as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, or at least mostly yes. Leucistic snakes are solid white with blue eyes, although they often have some light yellow markings (at least in Ball Pythons which are what I'm the most familiar with). I don't know that it's truly entirely pigmentless but it's as close as I know of</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Look up &quot;snow morph&quot;. Of course this depends on the species as well, because for example cornsnakes can be a very light pink and still considered a snow. </p>
<p>Snow in general means though that the black, yellow, and red melanin is almost or completely missing.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Those are not pigments, those are pigment-containing cells.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatophore" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>: </p>
<p><strong>Melanophores</strong> contain eumelanin, a type of melanin, that appears black or dark-brown because of its light absorbing qualities. It is packaged in vesicles called melanosomes and distributed throughout the cell.</p>
<p>Chromatophores that contain large amounts of yellow pteridine pigments are named <strong>xanthophores</strong></p>
<p><strong>Iridophores</strong>, sometimes also called guanophores, are pigment cells that reflect light using plates of crystalline chemochromes made from guanine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looks like there are two forms of melanin: eumelanin (tan to brown and black) and pheomelanin (yellow to red). Different proportions result in red hair. Pheomelanin is also responsible for your pink lips, areolas, and genitals.</p></div>		</li>
