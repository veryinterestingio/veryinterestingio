We have very lush earth round around here, so I believe it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of Richard Feynman's explanation about where trees come from, during his talk about fire.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>&quot;the substance of the tree is carbon and where did that come from?  it comes from the air.  that's carbon dioxide from the air.  people look at trees and they think it comes out of the ground, that plants grow out of the ground.  but if you ask where the substance of... you find out, where did it come from?  trees come out of the air?  they surely come out of the ground.  no, they come out of the air.  the carbon dioxide in the air goes into the tree and it changes it, kicking out the oxygen, pushing oxygen away from the carbon and leaving the carbon substance with water.  water comes out of the ground, you see.  how did it get there?  it came out of the air didn't it?  it came down from the sky.  so, in fact, most of the tree, almost all of the tree comes out of the air.  there's a little bit from the ground, some minerals and so forth.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A I learned it, nitrogen potassium phosphorus and sometimes calcium are described as macro nutrients. Each one needs to be in the soil (or dissolved in water like a water soluble fertilizer) for plants to access it. There are also quite a few more micronutrients as you mentioned, also in the soil. All of these do deplete and need to be replenished for optimal growth.
Plants do uptake carbon and oxygen from the air as well as lots of dissolved oxygen in water at the roots.
The sun provides the energy necessary for photosynthesis, the reaction that turns co2 and water into oxygen and sugars that the plant lives on. The sugars and all the other nutrients are used in numerous reactions that allow plants to grow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in normal biological terms, those are still considered micronutrients, just the largest and most important micronutrients for plants.</p>
<p>The term macronutrient applies pretty much solely to the chemicals that are used to supply energy, namely sugars, fats, proteins and the like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe I'm missing what you're trying to get across but that doesn't sound like an accurate description in plant science terms. If macronutrients are referring to human macronutrients then a plant takes none. </p>
<p>Carbon, oxygen and hydrogen contribute to a large majority of a plants mass but that doesn't mean it can survive with just those nutrients. The macro/micro distinction in plant nutrients is a blurry line but carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus are always described as macronutrients. 17 nutrients are required in plant growth and deficiency in any one will cause complications with growth. If one is missing completely, plants will not continue to grow.</p></div>		</li>
