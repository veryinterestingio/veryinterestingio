<p>It will matter to the song and how it sounds but that is not the point right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not always. A lot of jazz/funk, and even prog metal will vary with who is actually keeping the tempo going. When I’m rocking a jazz session (as a drummer), the bass player/piano player is who I’m listening to for cues. I’m instinctively following them, while it may sound like they are following me. Lots of little flurries or riffs that take up empty space will actually be more helpful in tempo guidance than will a bass/snare cadence. A good example of this would be the Past, Present, and Futures album by the Chic Corea New Trio.</p>
<p>In a prog metal setting, while playing a strange time sig for instance, again the bass player is who I’m cued into (and sometimes the guitar if the melody is particularly choppy). I find that with me in particular, my brain kind of goes into auto-pilot while focusing on the bass or guitar line. My hands and feet will then reflex to what I’m taking in. I’m not at all “leading” or “setting” any kind of tempo. With that said, this is usually a niche style, and means nothing in the world of pop/rock where the drums aren’t as dynamic, but are more of a bedrock sound (as you’ve stated).</p></div>		</li>
