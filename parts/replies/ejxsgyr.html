<p>&quot;Homer, could we have a word with you?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I must have phrased that badly. My English is how you say? Inelegant. I mean to say, <em>May we have a brief, friendly chat?</em> &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Once again, I have failed. We request the pleasure of your company for a free exchange of ideas.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello! Your English is very good, except that you keep using “it’s”. “it’s” with an apostrophe always means “it is.” So, if the sentence doesn’t make sense with “it is”, don’t put the apostrophe. To make “it” possessive, you just add the s; no apostrophe.</p>
<p>Autocorrect always adds an apostrophe, which is very frustrating, so maybe it was just that :).</p></div>		</li>

I finished school 9 years ago and only really started talking it again a year ago. So I am still trying to keep up with grammar, haha.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, I feel that. I’m currently trying to learn Spanish - the understanding it part is easy, but speaking it? Especially with correct grammar? It feels impossible at times.</p>
<p>And English is quite a bit harder. You’re doing fantastically!</p></div>		</li>
