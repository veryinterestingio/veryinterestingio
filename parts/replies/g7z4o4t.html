			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly why. </p>
<p>The liquid layer in the front tints the backlight. </p>
<p>Old LCD screens used fluorescent tubes (similar in diameter to a coiled light bulb). </p>
<p>Newer LCDs and cell phones typically use a frosted glass sheet with LED lights on the edges. </p>
<p>LED's on their own typically produce blue, purple, or UV light. A white LED bulb has a phosphor coating that absorbs the blue light and uses that energy to release white light. This is an early LED bulb where the yellow plastic absorbs the blue light internally and transmits it as white: </p>

</ul>
<p>QLED TVs have a blue backlight. They have an advanced coating on the front that can turn blue into other colors. As a result they have brighter colors and less bleeding (washed out look). </p>
<p>OLED TVs don't have a backlight. Each pixel is made of three LEDs. A 4K OLED screen has about 25 million LEDs. As a result with an OLED, you get perfect blacks and vibrant colors. </p>
<p>Now rather than having one big LED panel for the backlight some other displays have a dynamic backlight with lots of tiny LEDs. This way you can turn portions of the backlight on and off to have brighter and darker spots. Apple wants to push this by having a backlight with thousands of tiny LEDs (rather than millions in an OLED).</p></div>		</li>

<p>For anyone wanting to know more: in front and behind of the LCD are two additional layers called polarising filters. What these do is only pass through light that has sort of been oriented in one specific direction.</p>
<p>This means that if you put two of these at right angles of each other, so one blocks anything but up-and-down-oriented light, and the other blocks anything but left-and-right-oriented light, all light from the backlight will be blocked and the screen will be black.</p>
<p>The liquid crystals are capable of re-orienting light, by twisting it. So what the TFTs do is set up the liquid crystals to re-orient the light from the first polarising filter, so it can pass through the front one. Thatâ€™s one pixel lit up. Do that a couple million more times and you have a white display.</p></div>		</li>
