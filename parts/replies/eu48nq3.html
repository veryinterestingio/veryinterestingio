			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the hydrothermal fluids that are gold bearing are extremely nasty and not 'groundwater' as such (the stuff you'd be able to drink more than once), gold is generally mobilised as Au-S or Au-Cl, this happens at temperatures which can often be &gt;150°C in fluids rich in H2S, chlorine, hydrofluric acid, silica, and all those other goodies you find near gold mines.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also it’s important to note how the fluids become acidic in the first place! Gold (and other economic deposits) are commonly associated with volcanic centers. The rising magma body has lots of “nasty” sulfuric and chlorine gasses that can move and concentrate the gold.</p>
<p>Does anyone know if volcanic fluids increase the ore concentration or just simply provide the necessary environment for deposition?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something else that may interest you is to look into <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrothermal_vent" target="_blank">hydrothermal vents</a> which are basically pressure vents on the sea floor. The water that spews from these vents typically contain high levels of dissolved compounds which solidify as the ocean water cools it. As such, mining companies will sometimes send submersibles down to extract valuable minerals. It's not always gold though. But certain fissures can produce deposits that are cheaper to retrieve than surface mining.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gold can be broken down into microscopic pieces by erosion over millions of years, and water is very good at doing things like that. Add in heat and pressure like you'd find in ground water deposits near a fault area and it can happen faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Still, it does generally have to be acidic fluid which the gold is dissolved in. Mechanical erosion is not how it happens either, it’s definitely a chemical process. Within hot acidic fluids, gold can be dissolved and transported as either an Au(Cl)⁻₂ complex, or as a bisulfide complex Au(HS).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The region <em>was</em> prone to tectonic movement - there's a whole mountain range along the east coast, after all... but we're talking hundreds of millions of years ago. That would be when minerals were brought up from lower in the crust.</p>
<p>California, on the other hand, is at the edge of two currently-colliding plates. It's probable the gold was brought up by the same process, but more recently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the gold veins in the california motherlode belt are located in an old subduction structure. It is likely that this structure provided both the pathways for gold-bearing fluids and the pressure drops from large colocated earthquakes.</p>
<p>The mother lode belt is seismically inactive today. In fact, it has been for quite some time. However, 60-90 Million years ago it would have been a major fault, and that is likely when the fluids were actively circulating. </p>
<p>All that's required for gold deposits is a source of fluids, a chemical solution gradient, a source of heat, and time. It turns out fault zones are great places to have all these conditions, but you can get similar deposition of minerals with volcanos, magma chambers, water flowing through limestone etc;. Therefore, it is not required that you have current seismicity or volcanism for gold deposits to exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never studied Australian geology, so this may or may not be relevant. Another explanation involves magma plumes. Imagine a lava lamp. Sometimes you get pockets of magma that are extra heated and rise to the surface. Sometimes these plumes reach the surface and sometimes they cool and solidify before breaking through. Sometimes these plumes contain gold. That's one way that you can find gold deposits without earthquake activity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a little oversimplified though, all rock and magma contains gold, just in trace amounts. It’s how those trace amounts get concentrated along certain veins or pockets - with magma bodies there can be a certain amount of transfer of the metal ions (like gold) into the separate fluid associated with the magma; often its more that circulating waters (groundwater derived from rainwater) will be heated by the magma body and dissolve gold from the surrounding rocks (not the magma body), depositing it upon cooling or a change in orther chemical conditions. </p>
<p>In the H₂O fluid associated with the actual magma body itself, the solubility of many metals is strongly dependent on its Cl⁻ concentration, as well as other things like sulfudation state, Eh and pH. Even in deposits which are thought to be from magma-derived fluids, the mechanism by which gold precipitates is still dependent upon the fluid evolution from mixing with local groundwater. </p>
<p>It’s not so much plumes either, which are a large scale mantle thing, but magma bodies within the crust which come near to the surface, where waters can circulate through fractures in the rock (the so called epithermal deposits).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rivers carve the earth over millions of years, carrying small bits of rock. Gold is specially dense, so any gold particle tends to go in a straight line when the river bends, so they are deposited in those curves. </p>
<p>You don't need earthquakes to bring the gold all the way up to the surface. Just bring it close enough so that water can reach it eventually. Tectonic plates can shift over those millions of years and by the time we find the gold, there's no significant tectonic activity in the area anymore</p></div>		</li>
