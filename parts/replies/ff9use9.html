			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in a previous life, I worked for a (now defunct) telecommunications equipment company.  My job was to write software patches for the phone switches that could be applied while the switch was running.</p>
<p>There were certain things we could not do directly in the code (the precise details are beyond the scope of this discussion), so sometimes we would have to get clever to do said things indirectly.</p>
<p>When people asked for the substance of what I did, I used the analogy of &quot;it's like writing pieces of software to fix a car's engine while it's hurtling down the interstate&quot;  Fortunately, we had the architecture to accommodate this behavior, but the behavior had been designed into the system.</p></div>		</li>
