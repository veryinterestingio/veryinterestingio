			<div class="markdown"><p>Tums is a base (calcium carbonate) that neutralizes some acid. It can help with mild indigestion and heartburn, however this relief is only minor and temporary.</p>
<p>If you're experiencing regular heartburn and indigestion please see a doctor.</p>
<p>Also, the liver's entire reason for existing is to remove toxins. Your liver filters your blood, pulling out the wrong things and making sure your blood has the correct proportion of the correct things. Your kidneys also filter your blood, purging excess liquid. Your lungs purge carbon dioxide from your bloodstream. Even your skin can eliminate substances, as anyone who eats a lot of garlic can attest to.</p>
<p>You don't need anything that &quot;removes toxins&quot;, because this already is the primary function of most of your organs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The toxins don’t actually stay in the liver. Like the post below, some gets pooped out but also the liver converts things to a more hydrophilic state so that they can be filtered by the kidneys and peed out</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not the person you asked, but I vaguely remembered a doctor telling me that we &quot;pooped out all of the bad stuff that made it's way into our bodies&quot;, so I went searching for an answer more suited towards an adult than the response I got when I was ten...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/liver-anatomy-and-functions" target="_blank">Turns out he was kinda right though</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The common hepatic duct transports the bile made by the liver cells to the gallbladder and duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) via the common bile duct.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's obviously a lot more complicated of a process, and situations where the &quot;bad stuff&quot; doesn't get pooped out at all and just clogs up your liver <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/chronic-liver-disease-cirrhosis" target="_blank">i.e. cirrhosis</a> - but an ELI5 for a healthy liver could be &quot;filtering blood and discarding bad stuff through your poop&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It alkalizes a little bit better than normal water does, and the gastric acid might get a teeny-teeny bit more basic than it otherwise would have. Still not going to neutralize your stomach, unless you chug it through a fire hose (and then you have bigger problems).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn’t mean that the water will cause the stomach to neutralize. I wondered if the acid in the stomach will reduce the pH of the alkaline water, thereby preventing any supposed benefits from drinking alkaline water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. You're absolutely correct. It hits the stomach and immediately gets neutralized. There's no other explanation available.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. Stomach acid has a pH of roughly 2. The only way to neutralize that would be to use a base that's equally as strong.</p>
<p>The opposite of a pH of 2 would be a pH of 12, which is somewhere in the vicinity of soapy water, ammonia, and bleach.</p>
<p>Yeah, you don't wanna drink those things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people unfortunately believe that they can consume bases and keep their body from being acidic.</p>
<p>Akaline water in the stomach is, for all intents and purposes, identical to regular water.  Because it is lightly basic and the stomach is <em>heavily</em> acidic.</p>
<p>Drinking alkaline versus regular water will hardly move the needle of acidity.</p>
<p>Some people just believe nonsense.  I know someone who only drinks alkaline water because they believe it turns their whole body into a base and they can’t get cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely right.  It only takes freshman chemistry to calculate that a glass of alkaline water becomes quite acidic the instant it hits your stomach acid.  Freshman biology will explain why you wouldn’t want to change the pH of your cells, even if you could.  America is really behind the rest of the world in basic science.  </p>
<p>Blind faith is very powerful thing.</p></div>		</li>
