			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that Hubble's Law isn't the Doppler effect (a frequency shift from objects moving away).  It's the expansion of space itself causing the redshift.  So the redshift is actually directly proportional to the age of light for far away objects.  More info in my main-thread response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The red shift caused by Hubble's law is because the light wave is stretching due to the expansion of space while a photon travels. This gives you a longer wave length. The measurable effect is the same as the Doppler effect I believe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is one big difference.  If the space between us expands then we won't feel a corresponding acceleration.  I took cosmology a while ago, and I remember there was an equivalence relation between the two points of view, as you suggested.  But I think the space-expanding point of view is more in line with general relativity, and it was definitely the preferred view.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Each element has only a list of very specific light frequencies it can give off in reactions, known as its emission spectrum. When measured with an instrument and viewed as specific wavelengths instead of just a visible color, the emission spectrums are unique enough “patterns” that the common elements in stars can be easily recognized even with distortion from shift. Then they calculate the amount of shift.</p></div>		</li>
