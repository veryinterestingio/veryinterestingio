			<div class="markdown"><p>does that mean CRT tvs were super high res since they didn't work with individual pixels, just a flat image?</p>
<p>I saw a youtube video of some guy playing a modern game on a CRT TV and said that it's the best looking game he'd ever played and that it ran incredibly smoothly, moreso than an LCD. </p>
<p>I could google this but I like talking to people</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I don't know a whole lot about how the cathode ray works, just that the technology back then was such that a CRT monitor could roughly match a 720p lcd display. </p>
<p>Something about how many vertical lines the projector bit was able to project per x amount of time.</p>
<p>Had LCDs not been invented though, I'm sure technology would have improved CRT displays. We do after all have DLPs that can project in higher resolutions. Not quite the same as CRTs I think but it is another form of projecting displays.</p>
<p>CRTs did have better response times though which is why, when lcd monitors were new, competitive gamers would still use bulky CRT monitors over flat screen LCDs. Now LCDs and oleds have pretty much caught up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CRTs still had individual pixels, same R-G-B concept as LCD (there were usually 3 different electron guns).  NTSC (USA TV standard) had 525 lines of resolution, but the TV displayed pictures in interlaced mode (every other line), so technically two pictures were required per frame.</p></div>		</li>
