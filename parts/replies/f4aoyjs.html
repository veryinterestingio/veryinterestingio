			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it’s a different perspective of the same phenomenon. You can equally interpret it as pressures cyclically filling lower ones that “propagate” that wave. I hesitate to acknowledge the wave itself since the ‘wave’ is actually just the term we use to describe it. If we disrupt water and outside water comes to fill it in it will propagate a wake but that doesn’t mean the wake itself exists, it’s the word we use to describe watching water fill a gap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We actually talked about this in my phonetics class last year. How the sound is made is your tongue makes a seal with your velum (the soft part of the roof of your mouth), then another closure is made further along the oral cavity (could be alveolar like OP describes, but it could also be anywhere from the hard palate to the lips). This creates an airtight seal and a small air-filled cavity between the closures. Then the volume of the cavity is made larger, i.e., the tongue is pulled down, so the pressure drops. When you release your tongue, air comes rushing in to equalize the pressure and makes the loud clicking sound.</p>
<p>The thing about clicks is that while most sounds we use are pulmonic egressive - initiated from the lungs by pushing air out through the vocal tract - clicks are velaric ingressive, meaning they start at the velum and pull air into the vocal tract. Meaning that while most sounds rely on a higher air pressure inside the mouth than outside, clicks rely on a lower air pressure inside than out.</p></div>		</li>
