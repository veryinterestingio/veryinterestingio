<p>It never occurred to me before that the brain works in exactly the same way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not a straightforward process. There is nuance and layers of complexity..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's how the Neural Network technique was first developed for AI. It's modelled after the brain. It's super interesting and would recommend looking into neural networks on YouTube or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have read a little on how they work, and touched on their use during my degree. They are fascinating. I have never seen mention of their origins before now though. </p>
<p>It makes total sense that they would be modelled on the human brain, I just never made that connection before today. </p>
<p>Everyday is a learning day. I love little personal epiphanies like this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love how a neural network in a certain design is equivalent to a certain algorithm. A network design for detecting edges or performing some calculation. Always fascinated me.</p></div>		</li>
