			<div class="markdown"><p>The safest way to wash produce it with running water. DON'T use soap or other household cleaners (which you may have seen in YouTube videos). You can use a vinegar solution (1 part vinegar to 3 parts water) though for removing pathogens, you really won’t get much more ‘kill’. Water can remove 90-99% of surface contamination. Your sink is probably dirtier than your produce. You need to clear it first, then remove the residual chemicals with fresh water before you start. I’d stick with rinsing under running water.</p></div>		</li>

I’m seeing a large number of people growing food and relying on information such as what you posted above which is counter to the research I’ve read on the subject.   I am aware that this hasn’t affected many areas yet, but I’m genuinely curious to know if you’ve had any discussions or training on these brain parasites that don’t wash off.</p></div>		</li>
