			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a common misconception. The virus has no purpose and its evolution has no goal. Sure, it might be disadvantageous to kill the host, but that doesn’t mean killing the host is impossible due to evolution.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The theory is that this Coronavirus came over from bats, via Pangolins and possibly other intermediary animals. Bats have one heck of an immune system and can handle tough viruses so this one grew to be super aggressive as it’s bat host would be able to take the beating easily. It has come over to humans and we are proving to be much weaker. As you say, viruses that kill off their host aren’t going to have the longevity of a virus that keeps their host alive, and preferably moving about interacting with others, so the theory is that this Coronavirus will evolve into nicer strains that allow us to do just that. There are already differences found in the strains of Coronavirus found in China vs USA vs Europe so it is evolving, and hopefully it will settle down into strains that don’t do us much harm.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The virus is stable, coronaviruses aren't like influenza in that regard. It is likely this virus would take a <em>long</em> time to mutate in that regard. Differences in strains don't mean much if our antibody response still recognises it as the same virus.</p>
<p>It will likely be that we eliminate the virus via a vaccination before it can become another cold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the very fact that most of the time it doesn't kill the host, and in fact often is experienced as a mild cold or flu, means it can spread to lots of people via these relatively healthy and mobile hosts.</p>
<p>Evey once in a while, it infects someone who's body doesn't do a good job of fighting it off.  But as long as those hosts are few  (maybe only killing off a &quot;few million&quot;), it's pretty successful.</p>
<p>P.S.  The Spanish Flu would be an example of an unsuccessful virus.  It killed off too many, and therefore made itself &quot;extinct,&quot; at least until it could mutate into a form that was somewhat less fatal.</p></div>		</li>
