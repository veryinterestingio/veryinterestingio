			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was deployed, we did a combat training exercise that lasted 48 hours. We weren't allowed to sleep for the first 24, and keep in mind we were busting our asses running around and being physical that entire time, all while learning combat tactics theory. Brain was working HARD. At about hour 22, I had a 10-minute shift where my buddy and I were manning a fake defensive fighting point and I swear to God on high that I saw an &quot;enemy&quot; down range about 50m away. I clearly remember seeing a human figure shifting around dressed in woodland camo, which is what the &quot;bad guys&quot; for the exercise wore. My buddy said there's no one there. We went back and forth for a good five minutes until he realized I was talking about a tree. I literally saw an enemy in the place of a tree because my brain was so tired. It's the only time I've ever hallucinated and I was shocked at how real it seemed. You could have held a gun to my head demanding the truth and I would have still said it's a bad guy, not a tree. But it totally was a tree. Lesson learned that day: sleep is sacred, do not fuck with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, I see you didn't learn the sleep while standing method. Your buddy is supposed to keep watch while you sneak in 1, 3, or 5 minutes of snooze. Then he wakes you up before anyone important comes around. Alternate lookouts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do a night shift once a week after which I go straight to my first job. So I basically skip one night’s sleep and try sleeping long (12-15hrs) after my double day/night shift and wake up the next day. Do you think that’s enough to recover?</p></div>		</li>
