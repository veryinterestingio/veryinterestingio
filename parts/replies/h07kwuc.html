<p>It's like saying &quot;I am two times more than you&quot; and expecting not to sound like someone having a stroke.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When measured in Kelvin, Antarctica has the hottest temperature per capita than any other continent on Earth. </p>
<p>One of my favorite nonsensical things to say.</p>
<p>EDIT: changed “degrees Kelvin” to “Kelvin” because apparently “degrees Kelvin” isn’t a thing. Thanks u/Sentrion !</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If OP had linked any studies it would be much more simple to determine what the percentage means. I'd assume it might be total word acquisition over the course of that year from the second to the third birthday (if all you know is momma and dadda when you turn two, every new word is a pretty big deal). Learning 6000 new words would be an increase of 2500% from 2.4 words, if I remember how to do percentages correctly</p></div>		</li>
