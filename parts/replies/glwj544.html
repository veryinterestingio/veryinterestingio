			<div class="markdown"><p>The same thing happens with babies who get over tired and won't sleep. Keeping them awake for too long creates a stress response which releases adrenaline and cortisol. The body just thinks I'm tired, but we're not sleeping so there must be danger. Time to be alert.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it can happen to everyone. Following the extreme sleep deprivation of having a baby, I developed some pretty bad insomnia. It took a while of my kid sleeping better to get over it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whoa. So many things falling into place here. As a parent I have heard and observed this over-tired thing but had kind of filed it into my &quot;Weird but true things about babies/toddlers that no one has really explained&quot; folder, rather than just the &quot;science&quot; folder.</p>
<p>Now though, wow ðŸ¤¯</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no idea how well-founded in science this answer is, but it makes a lot of sense to me. I have anxiety and am hyper-vigilant, and if I go too long without sleep, it sometimes kicks off a little bit of an anxiety attack or at least puts me on high alert and makes me jumpy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you are describing are exactly the effects that adrenaline (the fight or flight thing) have on the body, and make a lot of sense. Staying awake = more adrenaline = more anxiety and higher vigilance. Super useful when you get attacked by a wolf, not so much if you just have to work late (or party hard). In people prone to anxiety attacks, a higher amount of adrenaline can set these attacks off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I fear the first sentence in your comment can be potentially misleading. The body's circadian rhythm stimulates us to wake in the morning when the sun rises (with the hormone cortisol) and to sleep in the evening when the sun is down (via the hormone melatonin). That's the body's natural and healthy homeostasis. </p>
<p>Cortisol is a stress hormone that, as part of the flight/fight response, is stimulating and promotes alertness . If we stay up late, the body will produce more cortisol to allow us to stay up past our natural cycle â€“ which is quite likely a protective feature as you describe. But our bodies aren't made to endure stress chronically, and doing so is not natural or healthy. That's essentially keeping the HPA in overdrive, which leads to a lot of health problems in the long-term.</p></div>		</li>
