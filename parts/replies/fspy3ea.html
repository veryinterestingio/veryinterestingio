			<div class="markdown"><p>Speech-Language Pathologist here. You are correct, /m/ and /p/ are two of the earliest developing sounds, typically. Why? There’s definitely debate, but the fact that they don’t require any difficult tongue movements (as would be required in /r/) as well as the fact that they’re both produced at the very front of the mouth very visibly, are some credible theories. Here is a chart of the typical acquisition of phonemes in English, according to one large study: <a href="http://mommyspeechtherapy.com/wp-content/downloads/forms/sound_development_chart.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="http://mommyspeechtherapy.com/wp-content/downloads/forms/sound\_development\_chart.pdf" target="_blank">http://mommyspeechtherapy.com/wp-content/downloads/forms/sound\_development\_chart.pdf</a></a></p>
<p>Babies babble using those sounds, and parents/caretakers reinforce their use of “words” that sound like mama and papa. As such, they gradually learn to use these words.</p>
<p>P.S. I’m geeking out to see this in ELI5 because speech and language development is so dang cool :)</p>
<p>Edit to clarify: Not all language is learned by reinforcement in the typical sense of operant conditioning, or otherwise there would be no way we would have enough time to learn all the words we know! Look up “fast-mapping” to have your mind blown about how quickly we learn words!  Thanks to u/s0v3r1gn to pointing out that fast mapping in the traditional sense is a bit of a dated theory, and new research has changed our understanding of fast-mapping to show that our brains actually seem to do some crazy unconscious statistical calculations (wild) that I cannot explain effectively - fellow SLP's and linguists, help me out? </p>
<p>Second edit: WOW this comment really blew up! I am definitely no expert and new to the field but y’all’s curiosity and excitement. has really encouraged me that i picked the right profession. For those asking questions about speech and language development as a whole/speech pathology as a career, the American Speech-Language Hearing Association (ASHA) is a good place to start. I’ll try to dust off some grad school resources to direct people to other studies regarding phonological development. Other SLP’s feel free to give your input as well! There's a whole bunch of us over at r/slp , many of whom are way more experienced and smart than I am! This subreddit is 10/10 ❤️</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even though I’m not in a linguistics job right now, it’s been a major selling point on my resumes/interviews that my linguistics training is a major influence to my marketing skills .... I’ve got degrees in the science of using words to effectively sell!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you grew up in an Asian country such as China or Japan, I remember my Chinese Teacher told us that if native speakers of those languages don't learn the english pronunciation of 'r' kr 'L' then it becomes near psyhccologically impossible to pronounce them correctly later on. Never actually researched that, tho, so take it with a grain of salt.  Or maybe you're not Asian then pooey</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My ex had this too. She called it an accent, but everyone in her family had said that nobody in their family has an accent (they're from nova scotia), and if they did it wouldn't sound like that. When she was born was named with a name starting with R. When she stared going to school they realized her speech impediment and changed her name to her middle name, which was easier to pronounce. They thought she'd be made fun of in school if she couldn't properly pronounce her own name.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Then there's the problem of learning phenomes in other languages, like an American attempting to produce Japanese fu/hu. It sounds funny until they become proficient.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The language is spoken in southern India and it belongs to the Dravidian language family which is an isolate. </p>
<p>There's a theory that Korean, Japanese and the dravidian languages all belong to the Altaic language family which includes Turkish, and other Turkic languages.</p></div>		</li>
