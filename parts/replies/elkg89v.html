			<div class="markdown"><p>This second part is inaccurate, though not false per se. The reason why alcohol use is associated with excessive urination is because alcohol acts as a depressant  on the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus helps regulate body temperature among other things, but more importantly for this, it produces ADH (anti-diuretic hormone) aka vasopressin, which is a hormone that long story short enables water re-uptake in the urinary tract post-kidney. As this hormone's production is suppressed when you drink alcohol, water isn't taken up and is instead excreted. This is why (along with the relatively slow metabolism of alcohol in large quantities) alcohol consumption leads to dehydration, and a hangover, in the morning.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doctor here. This reply is correct.  Interesting historical medical fact about this... ethanol inhibits posterior pituitary secretion in general, not just ADH. So both anti-diuretic hormone <em>and</em> oxytocin (the other posterior pituitary hormone) are inhibited.  Oxytocin secretion, among other things, causes uterine contractions and heralds the onset of labor.  So in olden days women in premature labor were given alcohol to stop premature labor and it worked quite well.  Also, because ADH is suppressed until alcohol leaves your system, it doesn't help that much to drink water right after heavy drinking to prevent dehydration - the extra water just gets peed out.  You will still need to drink a lot in the morning to re-hydrate regardless of how much you drink before going to bed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You didn't directly imply it, but I want to take the opportunity to point out that it's a common misconception that dehydration is the root of hangovers.  Studies have indicated that's not the case.  The two are merely comorbid conditions after a night of drinking without enough water that often get conflated.</p>
<p>Instead, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/alcalc/article/43/2/124/122754" target="_blank">most hangover effects are the result of an immune system response</a>, and the leading cause of cognitive issues is tied more to the amount of congeners in what you drink, i.e. why whiskey makes you more prone to a hangover than beer.  Furthermore, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0015963" target="_blank">the headache component seems mostly to be caused by the breakdown of ethyl alcohol into acetaldehyde and then to acetate</a>.</p>
<p>NSAIDs are a good treatment for hangover headaches as a result, but Tylenol won't do much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The real determining factor is how much fat you're storing during and immediately after getting high.  During ketosis (plus my daily exercise) I had passed tests just two days after.</p>
<p>It is good to note that I only ever used every other month or so.  Regular use has a much heavier buildup, and can take months to fully clear your system even with heavy exercise and no consumption.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow this is cool. What if you smoked as you kept gaining weight and maintained heavy weight for years. Then you started working out again 5 years later to shed all the fat you have accumulated for all those years. Will those thc infused fat cells lie dormant for all those years and wake up when they’re getting burned only to screw with you on a drug  test  5 years later?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most tests look only for the metabolites, which you correctly identify as fat soluble. These are much more likely to be detected in waste flushed from the body after all. In addition, this means that people with a higher percentage of body fat will test positive for much longer than a slimmer smoker. For the average person, about a month without any smoking will be good enough to pass the most commonly used tests. For obese users, this can take multiple months. This is also heavily dependent on their level of use before quitting of course.</p></div>		</li>
