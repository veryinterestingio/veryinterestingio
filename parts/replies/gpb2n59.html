			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, you'd get like one reaction, a trivial amount of energy, and that's it.  It probably wouldn't be measurable and would provide practically zero energy to the corona.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does happen. A factor 10^18 in density leads to a factor 10^36 in reaction rate per volume (for processes that collide two particles). Sounds gigantic, but the Sun has something like 10^38 fusion reactions per second. At equal temperature and volume we would get 100 fusion reactions per second in the corona. The average temperature is lower, but you do get some really hot areas which should more than compensate for that. You can also consider cosmic rays hitting the Sun, they can lead to fusion reactions as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no chain reaction in the core either. In fact, it is the opposite, the heat released from one fusion reaction <strong><em>reduces</em></strong> the chance for further reactions due to adiabatic expansion of the plasma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the corona receives a metric butt load of energy from radiative heating from the photosphere. Up until the photosphere, photons have a hard time getting anywhere just due to the density of the star. I'd wager a high photon flux into the corona can add an appreciable amount of energy.</p>
<p>Then there is nanoflare heating which has been a suggested method of stabilizing prominences and is recently being applied to coronal plasma. Basically these are &quot;small&quot; flares that add energy directly to the corona. The complex internal dynamo of the sun produces a lot of magnetic heating and twisting magnetic field lines. Occasionally these lines &quot;snap&quot; back into place which releases a huge amount of energy, causing a flare. </p>
<p>It's interesting to note that the sun's structure can almldt be treated as a solid at the center and the rotation there against the fluid outer layers produces a lot of convection eddy currents as well as the aforementioned wildin magnetic field lines. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn.  Stars are freaking insane. Do you ever go outside on a sunny day and look up and think &quot;that's the direct radiation from a star that I'm feeling on my skin right now&quot;?   I read a sci-fi book about people who grew up on a generation ship and there's a scene where a lady who never had been on a planet's surface is trying to get used to being out in the open. And was freaked out because there wasn't any ceiling and it felt like you could fall off the earth and because there wasn't any shielding between her and the sun.  That really stuck with me and now when I try to open my mind I can get the same sensation and it's crazy.</p></div>		</li>
