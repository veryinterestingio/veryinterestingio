			<div class="markdown"><p>The original scrambling systems like VideoCipher suppressed the vertical sync pulse.  The information to rebuild it and phase it properly was contained in an encrypted data stream, usually located in the &quot;vertical blanking interval&quot; part of the video frame.  DES encrypted audio was often transported in this data stream as well.</p>
<p>Getting the audio &amp; sync data was nigh impossible back then, but you could rebuild the vertical sync pulse via the 3.58Mhz color burst part of the frame, but you wouldn't have exact phase &amp; sync, which is why you'd have to manually adjust the phase on the pirate decoder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And even before this, when the cable box was just a dial with alot more channels you could open the box up and premium channels like HBO just didn't have the connection soldered together, you could just solder that connection and get HBO. I don't think there was Pay-Per-View around that time (mid 80s)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, that was the time when cable channel frequencies were outside the range that your standard TV could tune.  And then there were cable plants where the operator would put notch filters on your feed to notch out the premium channels you weren't paying for (which you could crawl up on the pole in the middle of the dark night and remove).</p>
<p>It's always a battle between the content providers/carriers and the few folks who don't want to pay for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I remember in the 1980s my grandparent's den TV (one of those big all-wood console TV monstrosities) had a cable box where the top of it was always off, exposing the internal hardware, and there was some weird non-electrical-tape (looked like something grabbed from the medicine cabinet, whatever was handy) around some contacts in there and they always had HBO.  It wasn't until I was older that I put two and two together and was like, &quot;wow, my very Catholic old grandparents were TV pirates back in the day&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pay-per-view existed in the 80's (I remember wrestlemania being a ppv thing, when I was a kid) but I have no idea how it worked before digital decryption. With digital, the box gets remotely authorized, but when it was pure analog, maybe it was a positive filter that would be added temporarily, and you had to order in advance so there was time to get out and install it.</p>
<p>I could ask a former coworker, if need be.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I still remember when my friends and I were young we'd watch the scrambled Cinemax at 2AM back when it was all softcore porn because  every once in awhile you'd see titties fly by in the blur.</p></div>		</li>
