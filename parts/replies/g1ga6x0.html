			<div class="markdown"><p>What about the rotation though? My understanding of relativity is, that there is no absolute speed for linear motion, so standing still is only relative to something else.</p>
<p>But you can tell that you are spinning without reference (centrifugal force).</p>
<p>Does the one rotation of the station per orbit have a small effect? E.g. I assume a gyro would slowly rotate compared to the station?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the difference between Special and General Relativity.  Special deals with the special case of reference frames without acceleration, whereas General delves into free fall.
I wouldn't like to go beyond that because I only had 5 lecturer on GR and the lecturer was rubbish, so I'm really not sure ðŸ˜‚</p></div>		</li>
