			<div class="markdown"><p>A few answers are overly complex. This is the most straight forward answer. When the last round is ejected the mechanism holds the bolt back. So if the soldier doesnt notice that and pulls the trigger it will be obvious what happened and a slight tilt to the left will reveal the open bolt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question... you're tilting to the left to see the open bolt. The opening is on that side of the gun because the casings are ejected to the right... you're throwing the casings to the right because you want them thrown away from you instead of in front of you...</p>
<p>It just occurred to me...are there guns for lefties?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to some of the other comments, there are also guns that eject spent rounds in unique ways that make it a non-issue. The P90, as an example, ejects its spent rounds down, out of the bottom of the gun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many rifles have something that prevents the brass from being thrown back in your face if you're firing off your left shoulder. On the M16 it's just a little ramp that the spent cases bounce off of causing them to go off to the right rather than going back into the shooter's face. This isn't just for lefties either, as there are plenty of situations in a combat environment where a right handed shooter might want to fire off their left shoulder (e.g. firing out the window of a vehicle from the passenger side).</p>
<p>It's one of the big reasons why bullpup style rifles aren't more common in military service.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup.  Sometimes you can feel the difference when the bolt locks to the rear.  But if you don't notice it, you definitely realize when you squeeze the trigger and nothing happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An addition to this: you can feel the bolt going back and forth. So when it goes back but not forth, you can feel the difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there is a definite change in both feel of the last shot locking the bolt open and also in the balance of the weapon. Easy to recognise once it's happened just a few times when you first learn to shoot.</p></div>		</li>
