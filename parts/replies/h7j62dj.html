<p>If you do this with cigarettes, it'll also be different?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but then you’re adding sugars, other chemicals, and removing the filter that cigarettes do (which also filters out tar and ash). I’m guessing the reason it’s less harsh is because you’re using a coal to heat it up instead of combusting it directly. If you took a bong rip of tobacco it’d be pretty harsh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The key difference with a Hookah that people are not mentioning is you do not inhale like you do with a weed bong or a cigarette.</p>
<p>A hookah is like a cigar or a pipe.</p>
<p>So yes, you can put tobacco in a hookah.  Many do - Just like Grandpa does with his pipe.  But you don't inhale it.  You just &quot;puff.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can easily see this visually as well.  </p>
<p>smoke through a bong for the day.  Dump the water into a clear glass when you are done.  All that shit is what you aren't inhaling, that you otherwise could be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is similar to vaping in which vaporizer heat to hot enough temperature to vaporizer the THC/CBD…etc, but not hot enough to burn the actual flower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vaping is better because you don't get all the contaminants you get from burning the material.  </p>
<p>When it becomes legal here,  and if i decide to partake again,  I'm going straight to dry herb vaping. It's just the healthier choice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I started with. Got a portable flower vaporizer. It not as convenient as a vape pen since you need to clean it after at most 2 bowls, but it doesn't make me caugh at all.</p></div>		</li>
