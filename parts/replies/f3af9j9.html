			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting thought on the concept of a cosmic “speed limit” for one’s velocity thru time.  Since ‘c’ is the absolute speed limit for traveling thru the dimension of space, there must also be ‘zero c’, or zero velocity thru space. If time stands still at the speed of light, then it must run at “full speed” when velocity through space is zero. An object with a spacial velocity of zero would thus have a velocity of 100% thru time. However, since even the most mass-deficient place in the universe still experiences even the tiniest effect of gravity from mass elsewhere in the universe (and thus the tiniest amount of time dilation), it is impossible to travel at 100% of the speed of time, an impossibility like achieving 0 Kelvin. Even so, all things considered, somewhere in the universe there must be an object that experiences time faster than everything else, and I think that is pretty cool.</p></div>		</li>
