<p>I know one of my own Dutch ancestors chose Bezuidenhout as a surname after he left the Netherlands.</p></div>		</li>

<p>besides choosing funny names under the assumption the surnames would only last until they got rid of napoleon, a lot of people got their surname from the town/city they emigrated from, like this: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/2440+Oosterlo" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/maps/place/2440+Oosterlo</a> , often with the prefix 'van' (meaning from).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those names aren't that bad actually.  Boudegom doesn't really mean anything anymore now.</p>
<p>There are a lot of really bad names still in use now, for example I know a few people whose last name is Pannekoek which means pancake. But there are many that are far worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pannekoek would be a fun surname to have.</p>
<p>It always surprises me how language changes so quickly over time. It's funny because in Afrikaans it still means butt glue. </p>
<p>I've also met someone with the surname Skoffels, I'm not sure if it means anything in Dutch anymore but in Afrikaans it refers to when an animal like a chicken scratches in the dust.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are really insane ones.. for example the combination (married old lady) 'Geilvoet-De Pijper' translating as; 'Horny foot - the sucker'. Another one 'Rotgans' meaning 'rotten/shitty Goose', 'Poepjes' also exists, translated best as 'little shits'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d always understood that my surname originated around 1067, when the settlers from Normandy followed the successful invasion of the previous year. My surname being the name of the village one of those settlers came from.  Clearly that doesn’t marry  with your 1500’s timeline. Do you have any further insights?</p></div>		</li>
