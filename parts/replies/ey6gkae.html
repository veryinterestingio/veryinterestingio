			<div class="markdown"><p>True for minor sniffles. When you're seriously unwell however, it's not as benign. Fevers make you tachycardic (increase your heart rate) and increases the amount of oxygen your body requires. When your organs are beginning to fail, this can be enough to tip you over the edge.</p>
