			<div class="markdown"><p>Man I was so on board with the first half.</p>
<p>If I knew the actual chances that could change my life from here on out.  And chances based on distance.  For example; an ant is on my foot and I gently brush him off my foot within 5-10cm vs. flicking one off of my arm up to 4m.</p>
<p>An explanation would suffice with, or without sources within reason. Thanks.</p>
<p>Tbh I don't care about ant deaths.  I slightly care enough to change my flicking habits if it means I was responsible for its miniature horrible death.</p>
<p>If you can't get with me on this, may I recommend 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kid's.'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question but sadly there are <em>so</em> many pieces of data that it is near impossible to offer you a percentage chance based on distance.</p>
<p>Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ant scent path density is not absolute.  Scent maps might <a href="https://i.imgur.com/XnR9PbU.png" target="_blank">look like this</a>, with decayed areas and long &quot;arms&quot; going out to food sources.  If the ant crosses an orange path that's an 98% chance to get home, but who knows whether that will happen?</li>
<li>You don't know if the ant you flicked was picked up very close to her nest, or far from it.  Flicking her further may carry her closer to home.</li>
<li>Ant nest behavior is dictated by need - common black garden ants might be 10m from their nest if food is scarce, but in abundance they'll stay closer to home.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, there are simply too many unknowns to provide an answer.  Even if we <em>did</em> know the exact behavior and scent trail layout for this particular nest, the math would be incredibly complex to even know whether a short flick was better or worse on average.</p>
<p>I will say that a short flick which places the ant close to where you picked her up means that she's very likely to be close to her own scent trail and pick it up again.  A long flick is a crapshoot, who knows!</p>
<p>And I will always love and remember Antie and her brave, noble sacrifice in the face of that horrible scorpion attack.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh wicked, you got my reference.  </p>
<p>I just wish I had something I could play SimAnt on to run the tests. </p>
<p>Thanks for the prompt response. They seem to be going everywhere between the pool and the patio. So I would assume they're living pretty close. And I eat a lot back here, so crumbs. I hope they aren't affecting my raspberry bushes because I just got back from camping for four days, a couple of days ago and there is not a single berry.</p>
<p>I'm always getting them on me, maybe I should learn how to like the tickle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An old friend of mine used to impale them on thornbushes... some kind of evil emperor thing as a kid.  </p>
<p>He stopped doing that when he was eating an ant one day and it BIT his tongue.  It was fighting for its own little life.  That said to him that though they were part of a colony, they also had the spark of individualism.  He stopped all his terrible activities after that.  </p>
<p>This was from decades ago so, something I remembered down the years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a way, it's almost like ants are a multi-cellular organism made out of multi-cellular organisms. I don't care if a few of my cells die because my body is constantly producing more to replace them. That's a kind of interesting symmetry.</p></div>		</li>
