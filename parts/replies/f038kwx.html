			<div class="markdown"><p>The iron oxide also had the benefit of killing fungus and moss. Thats also the reason so many houses are still painted white. People used whitewash, made out of slaked lime, to paint their houses because of its anti microbial properties. And because it was easy to get.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best thing about this is if you follow the logical chains to a full conclusion.</p>
<p>Barns are red because red paint used iron oxide, which is inexpensive. Iron oxide is cheap because iron is plentiful. Iron is plentiful because that is the element in the fusion reaction in stars where it can no longer sustain that reaction. When a star burns out, it is mostly iron.</p>
<p>Collapse the logical chains and you get 'Barns are red because iron makes stars die.'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wasn’t paint as far as I’ve understood. They used stuff like linseed oil and mixed rust in for the anti-fungal properties. It was farmers making the ‘paint’ themselves. Plenty of rust to be found around a farm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. Also the tobacco barns have vents in the side that open up to start the curing process. It's tobacco harvesting season right now; you might see it! The plants turn bright yellow and are cut by hand and hung upside down in the barns with the vents open.</p></div>		</li>
