			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I'm looking at those guidelines and thinking...what the fuck?</p>
<p>Without knowing much more about this book (and let's face it, all the self-help and get motivated books are pretty much trash, because well, if one worked particularly well, we wouldn't need any of the others), this is <em>at best</em> suggesting that you should wake up, go to work, and then fuck around until the weekend, where you wake up, put in 8 hours of housework and other responsibilities, and then fuck around.</p>
<p>Not a lot of people can push all of their chores to the weekend. And the last thing people want to do with their days off is an 8-hour shift of chores.</p>
<p>This system just looks...bad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to be clear, this isn't the system the book asks you to adapt to. I don't remember the book giving you any system at all, instead gives you the assets to create the routine you want</p>
<p>And man is it good at doing that</p></div>		</li>
