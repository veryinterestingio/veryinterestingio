<p>The confusion comes with thinking fractals can actually exist in reality. They can’t. Physical matter can not be endlessly repeated down past an atomic or subatomic level. It’s just not possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is true. The Planck Distance (or Planck Length) is approximately 1.6 x 10^-35 m, and is thought to be the smallest physical distance that it's possible to measure. On a related note, the Planck Time (the time it takes for light to travel the Planck Distance, approx. 5.39 × 10 ^−44 s) is thought to be the shortest time interval that still holds scientific or statistical significance.</p>
<p>However, fractals can and are used to approximate things like surface area and perimeter of non-uniform objects, like calculating the surface area of Earth or the amount of coastline on a continent. It may not be physically possible for fractals to exist in the universe, but they definitely can be used to estimate impractical-to-measure things.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a very common misconception. There's nothing inherently special about the plank distance, it's just the length scale at which our current understanding of the universe breaks down</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback/elaborate on your comment, it's not even entirely clear to me that sub-Planck distance intervals make any less sense.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The Planck distance is just one of the Planck units.  Every kind of physical quantity -- length, time, energy, current, resistance, temperature -- each has a corresponding Planck unit.  They're also called natural units, because they'd be the same for aliens a billion light years away.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The Planck Constant (6.62607004e-34 m\^2 kg / s) is a number that you can derive experimentally.  The significance of this number doesn't matter, but the point is that if you explained to an alien what it was, they'd be able to calculate the Planck constant and come to the same conclusion as you.  It's a universally consistent unit.  There are four other universal constants: The Boltzmann constant, the permittivity of free space, the gravitational constant, and the speed of light.  You can experimentally validate all of these values, and between all of them, they have a combination of all of the fundamental units: time, length, mass, charge, temperature.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So what this means is that you find the combination of any of these five constants that cancels all the units out EXCEPT, for instance, length, and you get the Planck length.  In the case of the Planck length, it's just sqrt(planck's constant * gravitational constant / speed of light \^3).  With a little algebra and those five constants, you could figure out the Planck unit for anything you can think of.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I don't know enough QFT/QED/GR/whatever else to comment on whether it *also* marks some special<br />
boundary, like where physics &quot;breaks down,&quot; but as far as I know it doesn't.  That *approximate* scale is where quantum mechanics and general relativity start to come to loggerheads, but its adjacence is more a coincidence than anything else.  I'd just call it an area with plenty of open questions.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 how our current understanding of physics breaks down at the Planck length. It's just the unit of length you get combining the Planck Constant, the speed of light, and Newton's gravitational constant.</p>
<p>You can get a Planck mass and Planck energy as well, both of which are human-scaled values (about 20 micrograms and 500 kWh, respectively). Nothing seems to break down at those values.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not a valid explanation. Everyone in this thread seems to be explaining that fractals are made of infinitely many small parts, and then making the (incorrect) logical leap to say &quot;and therefore, adding up infinitely many things means it just keeps growing forever and is infinite&quot;.</p>
<p>This is absolutely not true. There are plenty of infinite series in mathematics that converge to a finite number, for example the infinite sum 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... is equal to 2. It's not enough to say that fractals have infinite perimeter *because* their boundary is made of infinitely many separate pieces.</p>
<p>See the 3rd reply here for an example of a modified Koch Snowflake that has finite perimeter, but is still most definitely a fractal.<br />

<p>However there seems to be some discussion in the thread about the example being &quot;non-fractal&quot;, due to a proof of the H-dimension of a finite length curve. </p></div>		</li>
