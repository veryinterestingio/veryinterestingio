			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically, this would be breeding those that can have offspring with their siblings.</p>
<p>So we will effectively be creating a purposely incestuous breed.</p>
<p>But dont dogs already mate with their parents and stuff? And there isnt a problem that I know of with that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is and it isnt. Inbreeding is only a problem if the potential for the genetic disorder exists.</p>
<p>If 2 individuals have no combination of genes that could create a disorder then there's no risk. </p>
<p>The problem is that there's a number of recessive genes and gene combinations which are detrimental which is why inbreeding is discouraged. It doesn't however create problems from nowhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is definitely a problem with dog inbreeding from pugs that can barely breathe to German Shepherds with hip dysplasia and spinal problems. Not to mention a significant increase in cancer risks in pure breeds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To a degree that's more of a problem of inappropriate selective breeding than the inbreeding itself.</p>
<p>Breeders are focusing on certain characteristics even if their detrimental, and also ignoring other problems that come along with them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just because breeders would breed even the ones with bad genetics. The OG comment here says you remove the bad ones from the breeding pool, and you shouldn't have too many issues like bred dogs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really an inbreeding problem. Those breeds were made to have a specific appearance and those are just side effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it will be an “incestuous breed, but basically don’t have a choice. There will be a greater chance of genetic diseases but over time the healthiness of the population will improve</p></div>		</li>
