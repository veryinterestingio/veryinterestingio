			<div class="markdown"><p>MD here. Largely true, but there are large proportions of people with “normal” anatomic variants of their vasculature. These often include extra or missing arteries (less often, or less importantly, veins too). It can be a major headache for surgeons and other interventionalist, and it’s one of the reasons an experienced surgeon is so valuable. Imagine you need to take out a kidney and haven’t entertained the possibility that someone’s is fed by two arteries rather than just one!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have been informed I am one of those people with extra blood vessels. One runs through/around the nerve that causes carpel tunnel in each arm. The guy doing the ultrasound said I needed to give the surgeon a heads up if I ever have carpel tunnel surgery.</p></div>		</li>

We learned it wasn't draining because the hepatic artery had become occluded...and had been for some time. Turns out scarring had blocked it for some time and her body had grown other vessels into the liver to try and keep the oxygen supply up. Pretty fascinating what the body can do.</p></div>		</li>

They will both start off as one stream, but later break down into different paths depending the local environment  in their respective paths. That's an analogy to blood vessels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scientists recently did a study and found that the median artery in the forearm of adult humans has become more prevalent over the last 250 years.</p>
<p>It typically used to fuse with other arteries when a person grows up but due to genetic changes it is now present in 35% of adults and it is predicted in 80 years almost everyone will have it.</p>
<p>This reveals that while most people have similar vein/artery patterns those patterns change over time (as they grow older) and with genetic variations.</p>
