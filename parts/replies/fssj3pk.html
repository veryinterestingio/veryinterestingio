			<div class="markdown"><p>Add to this the music. The game stores instructions on how the system will play the music, much like a sheet of music, vs modern games having stored recorded versions in high sample rates. So basically music storage then vs now would be like the difference between a text file and a high quality mp3 or flac file.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if Nintendo used it, but the original MIDI protocol was introduced in the early 80s and is more or less the same today. It sends basic commands like the note, velocity, and on/off. It works so well and takes such a minute amount of memory that it just stayed alive all this time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also interesting because MIDI was in part developed by Dave Smith, who made iconic synthesizers and wanted a way for instruments to communicate to each other. They still do with the same protocol (and he still makes synths) to this day. In fact, MIDI 2.0 has been only very recently introduced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve heard that some of the sounds were re-used, just at different speeds. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>the 1-up fanfare is in fact a cropped out version of the flagpole melody. In fact, the mushroom power-up sound effect is a sped up version of the first part of the fan fare (so like the opposite of the 1-up). I feel like it must have saved memory to reuse the same theme throughout the game.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nintendo has more incentive to do so because of the limited storage of the Switch (32GB internal, with microSD expansion supported), but most first party Nintendo games on the Switch are around 5-15GB, which is relatively small compared to other triple a games:</p>
<p>Luigi's Mansion 3 - 7.3GB<br />
Mario Maker 2 - 3.1GB<br />
Animal Crossing - 5.3GB<br />
Paper Mario (unreleased) - 6.4GB<br />
51 Worldwide Games (unreleased) - 2.3GB<br />
Super Mario Odyssey - 5.5GB<br />
Breath of the Wild - 15.7GB (not sure if that counts the DLC packs)<br />
Links Awakening - 5.8GB<br />
Splatoon 2 - 8.1GB<br />
Smash Ultimate - 15.7GB<br />
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - 6.8GB<br />
Pokemon Sword/Shield - 10.2GB</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Japanese AAA games in general stay smallish. Dark souls 3 is 18gb sekiro is 12gb, resident evil 2 remake was about 20 i think, monster hunter world was about 25gb. </p>
<p>Strangely with monster hunter world, once they made the dlc they either didnt have time, or realized it wasnt worth the time to optimize the files. The dlc was about 80gb, over 3 times the size of the game.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What the fuck, the original was literally 0.5MB. I think they doubled that for the colour version so 1MB</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really sure if that's a great comparison though. They're also all not demanding games.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have an interesting counterexample - I released a game (as freeware, so not talking triple A here) and one of the first bits of feedback I received was &quot;I assumed it was just garbage because the download was so small. Luckily i tried it anyway&quot;. It was just a card game for goodness sake!</p>
<p>I just added a shitload of royalty-free high quality backdrops for card tables to pad the download size and definitely saw an uptick in downloads after that. So I think there's some sort of psychological &quot;bigger=better&quot; going on</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern games still work like your first paragraph. It's just today those bricks can be higher res and more variations of the bricks are used. Modern games still have strict memory limits, especially on current-gen consoles. Tiling textures and trim sheets are still used a great deal. And including &quot;bricks&quot; you would never see is seen as very bad practice.</p></div>		</li>
