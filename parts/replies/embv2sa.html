<p>They are storing a hash of your password, which is (ELI5) basically like an encrypted version of your password that can't be decrypted</p>
</blockquote>
<p>an ELI5 version of them storing hashes would be that they don't store the key, they store the lock.  Then, when you offer a new password, they try it against the last 5 locks they have, and if opens one of them, they tell you to try again.</p>
<p>They can't see what key <em>will</em> work by looking at the lock, only whether a particular key opens it or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is good.</p>
<p>But I have a qn. If most people just keep adding digits to the end, doesn't that compromise the encryption key?</p>
<p>Like I could go through the last 5 passwords of increasing lengths and check if it's 1, 12, 123, 1234, 12345?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. </p>
<p>Yes, because if I figured out your password once, I could figure out out again. </p>
<p>But really no. The way these hashes work, even a small change will give in an entirely different result completely unrelated to the previous password result.   They are as different as if you changed every letter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hashing is essentially a function. You have an input, and it gives you an output of a fixed length. Potentially, there's an unlimited amount of inputs, but a finite number of outputs. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Whenever you're making a hash (using a comprimation function, which is common nowadays), you're taking the input, splitting it to evenly sized chunks and you run them through the function, and you do some operations so that they influence each other. In short - the size of the key, input, or whatever you want to hash does not matter, the output is always a fixed length.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Theoretically there are multiple inputs (also given the inputs can have an infinite length) that share the same length, so you could log in using a completely different password, but given how many possible hashes there are, it's almost impossible to do so, and that's enough for security.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One would hope, but as Adobe showed us six years ago, <a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/11/04/anatomy-of-a-password-disaster-adobes-giant-sized-cryptographic-blunder/" target="_blank">even massive corporations that are household names can get it wrong</a>.  Turns out modern encryption algorithms are weak against the kind of attacks generally used against password databases (especially if you misconfigure them like Adobe did).  Remember kids, always use a dedicated password hashing algorithm like Bcrypt, Scrypt, or Argon2.  They're industry standards for a reason.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's something I'd implement in any system that forces users to change passwords after time so they don't just try incrementing a value. But also... I'm against forced password changes as it just leads to lazy passwords being used.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Password hashes are meant to be expensive to compute, and you need a few hundred variations only to cover the basics (e.g. 1 character being different).</p></div>		</li>
