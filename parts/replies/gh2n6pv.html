<p>Dehydration: Caffeine is a diuretic, it makes you urinate more water than you take in. More often than not when you're tired after drinking coffee, your actually just dehydrated.</p>

<p>Just a heads up, this is not true. Coffee still hydrates you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because people hear that caffeine is a diuretic, which is true, then jump to the completely false conclusion that anything containing caffeine is also diuretic.  This is false because coffee and tea and other caffeinated beverage are mostly made of water, so as long as the water in the drink is more than the water loss causes by the caffeine the drink itself is water positive.  Coffee hydrates you a bit less than an equal amount of water, but it's still a net positive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While is is true that caffeine is diuretic, coffee is not.  People assume that just because one component of a food or drink is diuretic, the whole food or drink is too.  That's false if said food or drink contains enough water.  </p>
<p>Think of the caffeine as creating a water &quot;debt.&quot; As long there is enough water in the drink to pay the &quot;debt&quot; you still get a net possible of water and the drink hydrates you, just not as much as an equally large glass of water would.  </p>
<p>Normally prepared coffee or tea does not have enough caffeine to incur a net debt. The water contained in these drinks is more than enough to make up for the diuretic effects of the caffiene.</p></div>		</li>
