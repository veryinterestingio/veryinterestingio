<p>I am currently working in my PhD in synthesis of non-noble metal heterogeneous nanocatalysts for OER...I've worked with XANES before, I have been to APS and worked on their beamline. How much experience do you have using this technique? I am very interested in what you might have to say.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have done XANES before, you certainly have had more experience with x-ray absorption than I have. I mostly have done kinetic, mechanistic, and DRIFTS work with zeolites and other metal oxides for alkanol conversion. I have never had cause to do XAS nor have I visited a beam line, though others in my Ph. D. group have done so. I needed to know how the experiments worked and how to interpret the data to understand literature for my thesis, but I have never collected or analyzed my own data. It is selective for a particular metal center like XANES, but it is a Fourier transform of the extended periodic data following the initial XANES features, which are indicative of oxidation state and coordination. This requires a lot of line fitting and apodization (k-weighting) to give you clear peaks in the transform. </p>
<p>Sorry I cannot be of more help, but I hope you are enjoying graduate school!</p></div>		</li>
