			<div class="markdown"><p>So when you're hungry and just don't eat and the sound goes away (you usually get hungry at set time) that would mean that the contractions are less active/not as strong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The contractions are just as strong, even stronger in fact. Ever notice that you typically will need to poop right after a meal or a hot drink? That's the &quot;gastrocolic reflex&quot; which is a fancy way of saying stimulating the gut causes the entire system to get moving! The sounds of borborygmus decrease after eating because the food in your stomach and upper small intestine is more solid and thus a poor conductor of sound compared to air and fluid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s super cool and I had no idea! I think OP meant that if they don’t eat and the noises go away does that mean the contractions decreased. Cause there would be no food to dampen the sound.</p></div>		</li>
