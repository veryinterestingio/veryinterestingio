<p>That’s how the sun heats the Earth, and how a spacecraft lost in deep space will freeze.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in OP's example the sandwich (or whatever food) would lose all its thermal energy via radiation? I guess it would have to. I'm going to crunch the numbers later on how long it would a sandwich to freeze solid. I always thought of radiation as a slow process but it looks like BB radiation is a function of absolute temperature to the 4th power, so maybe not so slow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eventually yes.  I don’t recall the formula offhand - blackbody flux is some function of surface area, emissivity, and relative absolute temperatures.</p>
<p>It’s not a super fast process, overheating is a design consideration on spacecraft because it’s difficult to dump heat to a vacuum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be a matter of hours before it froze, assuming it's not exposed to sunlight or any other energy source.</p>
<p>I did this calculation once long ago to answer the question of how quickly a person in space would freeze. It was something on the order of \~8 hours assuming they were dead and not generating heat. Certainly not the insta-freeze you see in literally every movie. </p>
<p>Radiation is indeed slow at low temperatures. The time to get from water-freezing temp down to equilibrium with the background radiation would be muuuuuch longer than the time to freeze.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Leave a sandwich in a room, and it will be getting hit by thermal radiation from all sides emitted or reflected by the walls, ceiling etc.</p>
<p>Put that same sandwich in the vacuum of space, and it emits its energy in every direction but can only absorb meaningful energy along whichever face is towards the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are forgetting radiation. Whatever you left in space would radiate heat in the infrarred. Very slowly, true, but it would eventually go down to whatever temperature resulted on the object being heated by the light of the closest star.</p></div>		</li>
