			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m too lazy to read all the comments to see if someone has mentioned it already but my geometry teacher in 10th grade told us how he gets rid of headaches and it’s always worked for me for mild to medium headaches it could very well be “all in my head” (pun intended) but I don’t care cuz it works even though it sounds like bullshit.</p>
<p>Basically you close your eyes and imagine you brain, just your brain with a black or white background. And you pick two colors. I sort of imagine mine as a 3D CGI image and instead of a pink fleshy brain I imagine more of the circulatory or nervous system within my brain so I can see all parts of my brain in my mental image not just the outside. You have a color for your brain and a color for your headache. I almost always go with a black background and a light bluish green color for my brain/nervous system. Then since most of my headaches are in one area (it’s works best if it’s not a whole head headache) I imagine that area pulsing red. You concentrate on the pounding of the headache and where it is exactly and make the red pulses match the pounding of the pain. Then you slowly make the pain color, in my case red, change and fade into the blue color. I have no clue why it works but it does. It’s not like I’m completely cured if I stand up and start moving around quickly it will hurt again but if you just want to relax or fall asleep and can’t cuz of the pain this almost always works for me if it’s not too severe and a specific location like behind the eyes or on one temple. </p>
<p>Call me crazy idc I thought he was a nut job when he told us all. Then I tried it and have been using it for my headaches for 17 years.</p>
<p>Happy headache free holidays everyone l.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a crazy alcoholic geometry teacher who was coincidentally also my drivers ed instructor. He taught me the “Black Ball” trick. You empty your mind of any image so it’s just a big black field, then picture a giant white ball as big as you can get it. You shrink the ball slowly in your mind and have it shift to darker colors as it gets smaller until it’s a minuscule black dot on a giant black field. </p>
<p>I have done this for years and it always makes my headaches feel focused to the prefrontal lobe where they sort of just dull out. Sounds like a similar technique. Neat! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like how some medicines have so many side effects that the commerical goes on for like 30 more seconds after the last person is like &quot;I tried it and it helped.&quot; And they're just listing these possible side effects, such as drowsiness, headache, sweating, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, death, or instant death</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>If</em> (big if) it's dehydration related, which most of my headaches are thanks to meds, the cause is only being aggravated as you lose more water. When I have a headache it's almost always because I'm overdue for a glass/bottle of water (or my day's dose of those meds).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because there are many, many different kinds of headache, each with different causes and aggravating factors. There are even sensible variations between two people with the same specific diagnosis. It's hard to pinpoint the reason for the behavior of headaches even if we know which kind you have. The mechanisms involved are still too obscure.</p></div>		</li>
