			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah this is the general idea, and eating clay as a folk remedy goes back a millennia, especially for pregnant women. in some gas stations and convenience stores in the south and midwest USA, you can even to this day find baggies of white and red clay meant for such consumption (red for pregnancy or &quot;illness of the blood&quot;, white for everything else, such as upset stomach). The thought is that a hankering for clay or dirt is a more specific reaction than general pica behavior, since it may indicate an iron deficiency, which could be remedied by eating from an iron rich dirt source. hence the original question, eating ice mimics rocks and bark and stuff that we may otherwise chew on to get some sort of mineral benefit. just like how doggos like to eat grass when their tummies are upset. for pregnant women, theyre literally making blood for 2 now, so it makes a whole lot of sense for that to be the main factor in preggo ladies eatin dirt. and just like the doggos, we have a built in instinct for &quot;oh man my normal food just aint cutting it&quot; </p></div>		</li>
