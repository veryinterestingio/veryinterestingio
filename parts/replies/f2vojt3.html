			<div class="markdown"><p>And Christians were in love with converting back then, eventually the king would get himself a diocese in his capital and the bishop would send out people to the villages and town to pray and convert. It wouldn't be like you'd wake up and be a Christian, but maybe in a year or a decade it would spread from wherever it started and old temples or shrines would be torn down or disused, first the big city, then the town over, then soon you'd have a preacher walk to your town every Sunday to hold a mass, eventually you'd break down and join or be ostracized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And hell so many pagan religions had end times like the Norse with Ragnarok. Two people survive under a new god and Christians just say that was Adam and Eve and the new god was the one watching over everyone (even the old gods) and has come to help everyone. </p>
<p>Pretty effective and showed a flexibility, creativity and open-mindedness that is honestly hard to find from modern theologies now. Which is sad.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its pretty common (and acknowledged as part of church history) in Eastern Orthodoxy. The guiding theology is that the teachings of Christianity were revealed/understood in part to/by pagans, and that Christianity just gives the full &quot;truth.&quot; </p>
<p>In my family's village in Greece, there's a small shrine dedicated to St. Elias (pronounced EEL-yass) that was previously a shrine to Helios. St. Elias wasn't chosen by accident. This flexibility with beloved traditions helped the church grow in these areas with some ease, and is how folk practices with roots in pagan religious practices survive to this day, such as killing a chicken and using its blood in a new building's foundation for good luck (then feeding the chicken to all the workers).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a lot of research suggesting that those events only occur in Pagan lore because of Christian influence having there be an end result that coincides with Christian lore. </p>
<p>For example, the majority of Norse/Germanic lore is found through the Eddas, which were put together by Snorri Sturlusson, a Christian Monk and Author, who also prefaces all of the lore with an explanation that the gods are really just men (Trojans, or descendants of the Trojans, to be exact) that came to be worshipped as gods over time. He used a lot of Christian influence to both make the church of the time happy with his publications, as well as to justify conversions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Religion is a &quot;meme&quot; in an evolutionary sense (see original meaning from Dawkins).</p>
<p>That means, it's an idea that has &quot;evolved&quot; and iterations of it that are more successful are the ones that survived.</p>
<p>So, in a lot of ways, religions ARE like living things.  They exist, reproduce, evolve, die and multiple depending on their successful survival characteristics.  Those that are incapable of surviving die and those that are compelling enough to reproduce, survive.</p>
<p>Pretty neat when you think about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read a book a long time ago (I think by Stephen Flowers/Edred Thorsson?) about the Christianization of Iceland, the last big Norse Heathen place. According to the author, Catholicism was first introduced but it was more of a label, and the old religion was still allowed to be practiced, albeit under the table or under the guise of a regional Catholic ritual. But the old ways were oppressed when the Protestant reformation hit Iceland. That's when you had the destruction of sacred areas, buildings, idols, arrests, and so forth.</p>
<p>Also, look up Thorir Hund.</p></div>		</li>

I mean, I'm being super reductive and the book's about a whole lot more than that, but the central conflict revolves around the budding internet circumventing what was once mental and cultural &quot;firewalls&quot; preventing the spread of corrupting ideas, like say, should a chunk of civilization, oh, adopt fascism and implode, the rest of society would be &quot;immune&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why the Bluetooth symbol is a rune (or rather, a superimposition of two runes)!</p>
<p>Bluetooth was also developed in Lund, a city that used to be Danish. I'm not sure if this is a related fact or a pure coincidence, though, since the name came much later.</p>
<p>Edit: Wikipedia says that &quot;The idea of this name was proposed in 1997 by Jim Kardach of Intel, who developed a system that would allow mobile phones to communicate with computers.[8] At the time of this proposal he was reading Frans G. Bengtsson's historical novel The Long Ships about Vikings and King Harald Bluetooth.&quot;</p>
<p>The Long Ships takes place (partially) in the region around Lund, so it's probably not a complete coincidence at least.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>To expand on that...</p>
<p>&quot;The Bluetooth logo is influenced by the Nordic runes similar to the modern Latin “H” (Haglazl) and “B” (Berkanan). The combination of these two letters embodies the connection that Bluetooth establishes between two electronic devices.&quot;</p>
