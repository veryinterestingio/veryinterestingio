			<div class="markdown"><p>Salty. The 5 basic tastes are sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and savory (umami).</p>
<p>Salt tastes salty.
Acids taste sour.
Alkaloid bases taste bitter.
Glutamate tastes savory.
Small sugars taste sweet.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s a bit more to it but most commonly thatâ€™s what causes the major tastes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if you have sweet food with X levels of sweet reaction in tastebud, when you add salt, does it somehow become X+Y sweet tastebud reactions and Z salt tastebud reactions?   Or is it merely dame X sweet and Z salt and it's the mind that makes the +Y?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AFAICT we only know this qualitatively from the person. Inferring from the protein sensors that exist on the taste cells, X+Y seems more reasonable. The reason is that when taste cells are activated, the signal they transmit is physically composed of moving salt ions around, into and out of the cells. The salt sensors are themselves also holes in the cell membrane that filter ions. So a little salt can alter this.</p>
<p>It's difficult to make an experiment that involves us measuring the signals coming out of tastebuds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neat, is this what you find personally? How much salt are you adding? These are important parts - for example, beyond a certain concentration of salt, the effect reverses from more sweet to less sweet.</p></div>		</li>
