			<div class="markdown"><p>there absolutely are bee experts. many people at universities are studying honeybees. i would also argue that commercial beekeepers and long-term backyard beekeepers also are experts but in different ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to be a bee keeper and can confirm that this will happen. They'll make several queen cells for the best chance of survival. The young queens will then fight to the death. Normally the first to emerge will have an advantage and will attack the other queens within their cells. Sometimes if the colony likes the younger queen and the original is still there, they can kill off the older queen. Rare but does happen.</p></div>		</li>

<p>if the best queen is slow to emerge workers will protect that area from a lesser but quicker to emerge queen who would certainly eliminate that better competition given the opportunity.</p>

<p>Damn this is some GoT kinda stuff. I have recently started keeping a stingless bee hive (safer for everyone as I live in the city and a noob not keen on being stung) and I'm a bit anxious at the rate of honey collecting they're doing, especially since I've bought some flowering plants to sustain them.</p>
<p>But I guess maybe they'll just outgrow the hive and split into new colonies too, so that might be good for the environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, not really. But from what I've seen on Youtube and stuff, these stingless bees are traditionally kept on a cut piece of log/bamboo. Tho from what I've asked the seller and some other people who'd done this, I can always make or buy a small wooden box with some modifications.</p>
<p>I'll expect to be doing that in a month or less, depending on how well the bees are doing by then.</p></div>		</li>
