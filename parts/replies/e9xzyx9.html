			<div class="markdown"><p>The workers can kill a queen too. And then they will need to immediately create a new queen by feeding a larva from an egg the queen laid more royal jelly to cause it to mature into a queen. A hive without a queen can't make new workers and they'll all die.</p>
<p>The royal jelly isn't rare,  the workers secrete it from glands on their heads. all the growing bee larva are given some, but the ones that will become queens are given much more of it which causes them to grow significantly larger than a worker bee</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a bee hive, each hexagonal structure is called a <strong>cell</strong>. Some cells are full of honey, some full of pollen, and some are chambers are used to grow baby bees. The queens need <em>bigger cells</em> because as larva they grow to be bigger than a regular bee larva.</p>
<p>Normally special large cells are made for queen bees, but if workers want to make a new queen to kill the old one, they can feed <em>ANY</em> larva to grow into a new queen, and they can expand it's cell to make room for the baby queen, in which case it is known as an &quot;emergency cell&quot;</p></div>		</li>
