<p>The &quot;2 trillion stimulus&quot; is probably what I described - they will lend out or purchase assets and get liquidity into the system. Airlines will borrow money from the Fed to stay alive. In almost all cases, these funds will have to be paid back (unless the company goes belly up anyway) The SBA will provide loan or loan guarantees to small businesses. </p>
<p>I will say this just in case, &quot;bailouts&quot; are typically not &quot;money given away&quot; which is the impression that it seems a lot of people have. Bailouts are usually loans or purchase of assets that otherwise would not happen in the current situation - meant to give breathing room for recovery. In cases of loans, they have to be paid back (and usually are very quickly because the collateral is high quality). In cases of asset purchase, the Fed eventually (who knows when!) sells them back into the open market for cash or if the assets are loans, the Fed is paid back when the loans mature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's disentangle two things, the fed's actions and the government's actions.</p>
<p>The government - The government is debating a $2 trillion spending bill. This will be financed entirely by taxes and the government selling treasury securities in financial markets. None of this money will come from the fed's activities save for the fed turning over its profits to the treasury as it does every year (roughly $50 billion). Much of this money may be spent as bailout loans to businesses like you described.</p>
<p>The fed - The fed will make repo loans and buy assets to expand the money supply, ensure lending is happening, and prevent deflation.</p>
<p>These are not the same thing. The fed can effectively create money to do its job, the government cannot. The activities the fed performs do not fund the government's budget. Entangling these two things makes it sound like the government spends by, effectively, printing money, which it does not.</p></div>		</li>
