<p>H1 blockers reduce the effects of healing to at least some extent. So taking Benadryl will actually weaken your scabs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some scientists believe that the itching effect that histamine has is not just a byproduct but actually intended. Histamine is initially low and increases only towards the end of healing (fresh scabs don't tend to itch). The itching could be a trigger to signal that the healing process is almost finished and that the now useless scab can be removed. The timing of this process, however, is not super accurate which is why wound often itch before it is safe to remove the scab.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Removing old scabs could just promote general hygiene (in a grooming sense). Idk how much of an evolutionary advantage that would be or much truth there is to that theory. I just found it interesting as a possible explanation of the itching effect of histamine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always kinda just assumed that the evolutionary “”point”” of scabs/wounds/scars itching was because scratching or rubbing it would promote blood flow to the area, like a massage, which would promote healing? how accurate was that assumption?</p></div>		</li>
