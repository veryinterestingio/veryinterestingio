			<div class="markdown"><p>So is it that asymptomatic folks have had exposure to a related virus? Or possibly a flu with enough similarities? Or is it genetic? Because wouldn't you expect to find certain groups of people localized with much better immunity? Like say folks who live in remote regions and eat bats regularly for example?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exposure to a related virus is a possibility, but it's also just possible that their immune system is just good enough to do it without needing to go full bore.  This isn't necessarily immunity though, it's just your body is good enough at fighting it that it doesn't need to result in measures that are detectable.  You can still spread the virus, which is why asymptomatic spreaders are a big deal.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Kinda like dealing with a small leak vs a completely burst pipe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't it also mean that the virus just didn't attach in a more dangerous area? So the body has an easier time getting rid of it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been seeing some studies popping up recently about disproportionate symptoms possibly related to Blood-type. I don't know that accuracy, but several of the places doing these studies have noted that type-O and type-B seem to have a better chance at not experiencing the worst this virus has to offer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please take the previous replies with a grain of salt. Even at this stage nothing is absolutely known. Everything I have read in response to your comment/questions is theoretical-they may be accurate but we simply don't know. Studies are still ongoing and results have been generally mixed and the studies are generally small and inherently flawed. It very well may be that the answer is a mix of factors including genetic predisposition, viral load exposure, previous exposure to &quot;similar&quot; viruses, or even blood type. The real answer at this point though is: no one knows for sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Asymptomatic infections are also more common when you're exposed to a very low viral load.  A droplet of exhaled water might contain hundreds or thousands of viral cells.  So if you only get exposed to a few droplets, it's a pretty small number of viral cells for your immune system to deal with.  If you spend a few hours in an enclosed space with someone and neither of you is wearing a mask, you might wind up exposed to millions of viral cells.  One of the reasons that cloth masks are actually useful, even if they're not 100% effective, is that reducing the viral load you're exposed to is going to give your immune system a better chance to respond to the virus without being overwhelmed.</p>
<p>To continue /u/that_other_goat's military analogy, it would be the difference between the military needing to deal with single boat loaded with troops (dangerous, but doesn't require the entire arsenal to deal with) and a full-scale invasion of the entire Russian army.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So effectively, these subjects have been immunised by a small load of the virus, and might now be immune from future infections of the same strain? I know what there is growing proof that antibodies fall after a certain period, but what if their T-cells or B-cells store that data and they are functionally immunised.
I'm still trying to understand why patients like these should then be locked away until they can be given a vaccine, which will only perform the same process upon their immune system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Staying on the military analogy in regards to viral loads, we still don’t know if a country with a massive strong infantry based army would be well suited to handle a small “seal team” infiltrating your country and placing explosive charges at some of their more critical infrastructure locations and blow them up. If you have a million soldiers, and 200 000 enemy soldiers (big viral load) come marching at you in broad daylight.. it seems like a sure win - and a guaranteed battle. But if you have that same million soldiers, does that mean guaranteed success in preventing a small elite team paradropping stealthily inside your borders in the darkness of night (small viral load which may not provoke a quick immune response getting nearer your critical systems in the process)?</p>
<p>A smaller viral load MAY have that effect.. of getting in “undetected”. Or it may be stomped by those million soldiers in a millisecond. We just don’t know enough to draw absolute conclusions yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to piggyback off OP's excellent answer here, to add to this, not showing symptoms is actually a sign of an efficient immune system. A lot of the more severe cases which result in pneumonia are actually due to an overreaction of the immune system which results in a cytokine storm. A little like the same over-reaction that gives you allergies except the immune &quot;attack&quot; in the case of COVID-19 is targeted at the lungs. This also explains why the fatality rates are lower in lesser developed countries - the people in those countries are much more likely to have experienced a similar infection at some point in their lives and so their immune systems are somewhat more primed.</p></div>		</li>
