If you don't need to waste energy on synthesizing a vitamin/nutrient because it's already available in your food, then you might lose that ability over time. But if a species is stuck with a very limited diet, it's likely that they compensate by synthesizing more nutrients using the chemical building blocks available from the food.</p></div>		</li>
