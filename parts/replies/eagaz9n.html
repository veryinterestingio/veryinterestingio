			<div class="markdown"><p>Ohhh.</p>
<p>Bird = Satellite</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I used to work in automotive engineering and they would always have this very specific vocabulary.</p>
<p>It was more to separate the ones that knew from the ones that didn't. But IMO it just makes everything more obscure. (And acronyms so many goddamned acronyms)</p>
<p>Now I'm in software development and I think the vocabulary is much clearer in this industry, I don't know why, maybe because it changes so fast or because everything is so abstract already.</p></div>		</li>
