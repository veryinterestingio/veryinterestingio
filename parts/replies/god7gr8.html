			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory the blade shouldn’t shed its oxide layer but in practice that’s one of the many reasons that cutting tools aren’t used often in space. Other reasons include debris, the possibility of accidents puncturing suits or the station itself and not wanting to waste the limited available material on off cuts. Odds are the majority of space manufacturing is going to be additive rather than subtractive, structural components being manufactured to spec rather than cut down onsite.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The solution is basically just to cut in a pressurized area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More that just in a vacuum, it's a common phenomenon to encounter when working with some grades of stainless steel. If you're ever using stainless steel fasteners or have any stainless on stainless rubbing surfaces, it is critical that you apply anti-seize to the faces or design in some non stainless seperation. On threads the moment you tighten them down the threads could cold weld, making removal a matter of drilling or cutting, and on tubing surfaces the two will quickly gall, damaging the parts.</p>
<p>There's a few other metals that you can cold weld in atmosphere, but almost zero instances where it's a desired property.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a metal there are always wandering electrons, but now that there is an exposed surface the bond to the oxygen molecules can happen there, and it does.</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dante451" target="_blank">Dante451</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of? Metal typically has electrons wandering around, so electron hungry oxygen will take them and form an oxide. Thing is, once a thin oxide layer has formed, either metal has to diffuse through the oxide to the air, or oxygen has to diffuse through the oxide to the metal. That's a slow process, so the oxide basically stops forming as the thickness reaches a point that inhibits further diffusion. </p>
<p>So, oxidation occurs because those electrons are available, but the broader picture is that there isn't anything inhibiting the oxygen and metal from getting it on. Also, it's not like the cut surface is charged or anything. It will generally have a neutral charge, so the electrons are not really more available than before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So theoretically if I had a brick of metal, cut it in half in space, and then pressed the two halves together again perfectly, there would be no &quot;seam&quot; where they re-bonded? No difference in strength at all? No irregularities in the grain inside?<br />
They just &quot;melt&quot; together like two masses of liquid, even though they're solid?<br />
This is a very hard thing to visualize.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's going to depend on the specifics of the material and the geometry.</p>
<p>A hot weld actually melts material, which (1) automatically fills any gaps or minor geometric deviations, (2) messes with any kind of heat-treating, and (3) can cause some interesting stresses from thermal expansion/contraction.</p>
<p>A cold weld only contacts the parts that touch, and is generally going to be a large grain boundary due to the two different sides having different crystal structures at the point.  At least if you have a metal with a grain structure.</p>
<p>This, it's likely possible to create a situation where a cold weld is stronger than a hot one, but in the majority of situations it will be weaker.</p></div>		</li>
