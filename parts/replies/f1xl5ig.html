			<div class="markdown"><p>I honestly think that part of the problem stems from <em>Animaniacs.</em>  If the theme song animation is to be taken as canon, the Animaniacs themselves are actually a horrifying twenty feet in height.  But since we see them interact with &quot;real&quot; humans, who are taller than they are, we assume that the WB Water Tower (and, by extension, all other water towers) are cartoonishly small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looking at random specs, I'm seeing capacities between 150,000 and 2,000,000 gallons.</p>
<p>Damn,  even a medium 500k gallon, if full, would weigh over 2,000 <em>tons</em> (1,900,000 kg),  not counting the structure itself.</p>
<p>Yet it sits on those spindly legs.  Granted, it's never really <em>filled</em></p></div>		</li>
