			<div class="markdown"><p>The heat isn't just evaporating the water, it's also denaturing the proteins. Proteins are normally tangled up into tight little balls, heat makes them untangle and straighten out a bit in a process called denaturing. This new shape causes them to act more like velcro and is where the &quot;stickiness&quot; comes from. This is also why bloodstains should be washed with cold water, not hot. Hot water will cause the blood proteins to denature and stick more to cloth, &quot;setting&quot; the stain.</p>
<p>Edit: I've gotten the same responses from a few people, so I thought I'd add them here for convenience. Semen is also mostly protein and solidifies in a similar way when heat is applied. Blood and semen have both been used as an egg white substitute. <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Natural_Harvest.html?id=5UwDkwEACAAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description" target="_blank">Here's a cookbook</a> of semen-based recipes. I can not vouch for the book as I have not tried any of the recipes, but the principle is sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also how jello turns solid. Gelatin is mostly protein, and the hot water used to dissolve it is also denaturing all those proteins. As it cools down, those denatured proteins partially &quot;re-nature&quot; and get tangled up with each other, causing the whole thing to go from liquid to solid.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sodium citrate (my username is the formula) is used as an emulsifier and a preservative. It helps turn solid cheese into cheese sauce, a key ingredient in nachos. As a bonus, take the numbers out of the formula and what do you get? NaCHO!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on, aquafaba is used as a substitute for egg <em>whites</em> (and a very good one). It won't work as well as a 1:1 substitute for whole eggs since the yolk also contributes a lot of fat. You'd need some other fat source in addition to the aquafaba to accomplish a similar result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are also used as a leavening agent. Beaten egg whites are mixed into cake batter to add air, which expands during baking. They also give the baked good a spongey texture. If you bake a lot, it becomes apparent that eggs are a key ingredient to how most of the world perceives sweets</p></div>		</li>
