			<div class="markdown"><p>Another tidbit: Domesticated corn can't survive on its own together. The kennels are so tightly packed they can't be dispersed probably and would stick on the cob as it fell to the ground. When they germinate together in the same spot... Well, that doesn't bode well for the plants.  </p>
<p>Also, chihuahuas often need C-sections to help them give birth</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that may be exactly why they're against GMO's?  We have dominated nature in such a way that it can't even survive without us.  These sheep are doomed to a life of slavery.  Imagine being born into a world where you can't even survive outside of having your body owned, controlled, and exploited constantly for its resources.  This is the situation tens of billions of animals are born into every year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People don't understand that domestication isn't like taming.</p>
<p>Domestication is selective breeding. Evolution over generations.</p>
<p>Taming is just teaching an individual.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. And the studies around domestication are incredible. Domestication is a natural process that exists dormant in many species. Look at how a domestic pig will change once it becomes feral. Domestication often leads to variation in colors of an animal. Many animals have piebald and spots come out after generations of domestication. There are also signs that humans have become domesticated over time and some individuals display domestication traits more than others. Really incredible stuff.</p></div>		</li>
