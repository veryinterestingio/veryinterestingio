Of course, finding the concentrations is only an intermediate goal, the real goal is to understand sources and sinks.</p>
<p>I happen to know and work with some of the OCO-2 science team, and I thought it worth adding that the measurement (total CO2 concentration in the air column between the ground and the satellite) is accurate to very close to 1 part per million (ppm), in a quantity that is about 400  ppm (subject to spatial/temporal variations, of course).  The science team has taken pains to remove instrument systematic effects and to validate the remote sensing retrieval against ground data, so we have great confidence in the accuracy of the measurement. </p>
<p>A successor instrument, OCO-3, was recently launched to the space station and got first light data just last month.  It has a different orbit which will provide observations at different times of day than possible with OCO-2’s polar orbit, so there’s a lot that can be learned about plant behavior and human emissions from these new observations.</p></div>		</li>
