			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/mshelikoff pretty much answered that in steps 3, 4, and 5. Mostly step 5.</p>
<p>When doing step 5, you find a limit for <em>l</em> which has to be in the range 0 to n-1, where n is the shell number, or principal quantum number. The third shell, which has n=3, means <em>l</em> can be 0, 1, or 2. Those are the 3 subshells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The shell with 3 subshells, <em>l</em> = {0,1 2},  is essentially <em>the definition</em> of the 3rd shell <em>n</em> = 3. I'm using the mathematical treatment in the textbook <em>Quantum Chemistry</em> 4th edition by Ira N. Levine.</p>
<p>The quantum number <em>m</em> is defined first as any integer because it must solve the complex equation:
e^(2 pi m i)=1</p>
<p><em>k</em> is set to any whole number 0, 1, 2, ...</p>
<p>The quantum number <em>l</em> is defined as <em>l</em> = <em>k</em> + |<em>m</em>| which imposes the limit on <em>m</em> such that |<em>m</em>| ≤ <em>l</em>.</p>
<p>Then the quantum number <em>n</em>, the shell number, is finally defined last as <em>n</em> = <em>k</em> + <em>l</em> + 1 which imposes the limit on <em>l</em> such that 0≤<em>l</em>≤ <em>n</em>–1 .</p>
<p>This mathematical treatment is presented in a very different order than what happens in a chemistry course where the shell number or principle quantum number <em>n</em> is usually discussed first.</p></div>		</li>
