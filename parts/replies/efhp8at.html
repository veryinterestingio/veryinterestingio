			<div class="markdown"><p>My cousin's wife was told by docs that there was nothing more that could be done to fight her cancer and that she had 6 months to live. My cousin became disraught and desperate so he sought out a Hindu PRIEST to do some ayurveda because this PRIEST said that he could 120% cure her. Cousin gives this PRIEST $1500 to rub magical oils, chant, and blow incense in her face or whatever and you won't believe it...SHE FUCKING DIED ANYWAY! No wife...no refund...&quot;It was God's will&quot;. These people are crooks who seek out uneducated and desperate people and take advantage of them. It's wrong!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Big pharma pays for most studies, and this is not necessarily a bad thing. These studies are VERY EXPENSIVE and big pharma is dependent on these studies getting done to be able to release and sell their drugs. Most researchers are very open about sources of bias and will honestly report their findings. Of course, there are obvious exceptions (tobacco and sugar companies and the studies they've sponsored), but most of the time it works out ok.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you include non-pharmaceuticals in that?</p>
<p>For instance, <a href="https://examine.com/supplements/hypericum-perforatum/" target="_blank">St.John's Wort</a> has sufficient scientific evidence that some doctors may recommend it for depression before a pharmaceutical anti-depressant. </p>
<p>But would you call it medicine?</p>
<p>On a different note, most people would call Dextromethorphan a medicine, since it is sold as such for cough suppression in pharmacies and has been for some time. However <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextromethorphan#Cough_suppression" target="_blank">recent scientific studies</a> have concluded it's no more effective than a placebo. It is still sold as a medicine however. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that alternative medicine is shit, but I assume there were more types of alternative medicine used and when you take so large sample and group it all as one thing, then there's the oversight that for instance you'd get those results even if one specific alternative treatment was much more effective than normal treatment, but it was only 1% of all alternative treatments they looked at. That'd be only fixed by distinguishing between various alternative treatments.</p>
<p>Also it's a bit confusing when you use &quot;traditional&quot; as the one doctors use, while some in this thread use it as equivalent of alternative medicine, basically what people did traditionally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They didn't group it as 1 thing, they performed data filtering on the 1.9 million peoples data to create a matched control and experimental group based on age, ethnicity, gender, comorbity and a few other criterion. It ends up being a 200/2000 control/experiment study for comparison. They use &quot;complementary medicine&quot; in the study, pointing to anything monitored and recommended simultaneously to the actual treatment, but not by a doctor.</p>
<p>The study shows that people are more likely to delay difficult cancer treatment as a result of the other treatment, which accounts for the majority of the increased mortality rate over 5 years. </p>
<p>The study also indicates people using complementary medicine didn't have any substantial delay in initial diagnosis which I find interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right that this over generalizes.</p>
<p>But the big point is that as a general rule, standard of care shouldn't be ignored. IMO, if an alternative treatment plan recommends avoiding standard treatments, it's even more likely to be bullshit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you should add to your summary that the increased mortality was only found when not taking into account that the group receiving complementary medicine (CM) had a higher refusal rate of conventional treatment (CT). This suggests that the CM itself is not harmful, but the fact that patients &quot;substitute&quot; CT with CM means that their risk of dying from cancer increases.  </p>
<p>A very good and thorough study, but the design is retrospective, so bias will always be a point of critique. I would advocate for sharing results of randomized controlled clinical trials. The problem with RCTs is that many types of alternative medicine cannot really be blinded to either researcher or subject, e.g. acupuncture, acupressure, etc. This is an example of a good RCT showing that European mistletoe has no effect on symptoms during chemo-treatment for breast cancer or the 5-year survival of patients:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30247950" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30247950" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30247950</a></a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree. There would be no problem with a cancer patient following the doctors recommended treatment protocol AND using something like peppermint essential oil (properly diluted in carrier oil so it’s safe on the skin) to help reduce their nausea of something. As long as they have talked to their doc about the oil and there’s nothing in it that will interfere or interact with their treatment. Or using something else that will <em>allegedly</em> ‘cure’ the cancer. Again, as long as they won’t hurt the patient and are safe to use together, as confirmed by their doctor. Then you will most likely get no additional effect from the alternative medicine, a small placebo effect/ boost to the regular treatment. The peppermint oil <em>may</em> assist some people in reducing nausea. It’s not going to make anything worse, as long as it’s not harmful on it’s own, or in combination with the cancer treatment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I completely agree with you. The same goes for all other &quot;interventions&quot; that may be helpful to the patient's well-being, e.g. religion, traveling, hobbies. If it makes the patient have a better quality of life then we should not deny it to them, even if it contradicts with our own views of what would be fruitful had we been in the patient's situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pushing back on this one. A patient I met on the wards a couple of weeks ago showed up with serious, life-threatening symptoms unrelated to his cancer. It took a while to figure out what was wrong but eventually it came out that he was taking a supplement advertised to help cancer that contained cyanide and was dying of cyanide poisoning. Unregulated supplements are NOT safe. You can't guarantee what goes into them. Encouraging people to self-medicate without medical supervision is a horrible idea and causes people to die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aren't RCTs generally used to determine some treatment's efficacy to begin with?</p>
<p>Oh, also, isn't the point - no pun intended - in acupuncture/-pressure that the needles or pressure are applied to specific locations? That seems like something you could fudge in order to blind the trials. The &quot;technician&quot; is given a list of places to needle, he doesn't know if they're random or traditional, the patient doesn't know either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A retrospective study could also identify an effect of a treatment, but you could never be certain if this effect was real because the subjects may be different from the controls - they were already grouped when you decided to investigate the treatment. Randomized allocation to treatment and control groups eliminates this bias, since, statistically, all other traits than the treatment itself would be distributed randomly in all groups.</p>
<p>As for acupuncture I think blinding also depends on the subjects' knowledge of how real acupuncture is carried out. If you start simulating real acupuncture too much you could also say that you actually may start &quot;treating&quot; with the placebo intervention - since we can't explain how acupuncture actually works (assuming it works). Someone actually did a study about whether patients could &quot;figure out&quot; if they were being treated with actual needles or dummy needles - and in this particulary study, they could: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4352029/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4352029/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4352029/</a></a>   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume by &quot;known nonsense&quot; you mean forms of alternative medicine that are so vague and esoteric in their nature that it is just impossible to expect that they world ever have an effect based on a natural scientific understanding of the world, e.g. aura healing or homeopathy, but some types (so-called &quot;natural medicines&quot;, diet changes, vitamin supplement, etc.) you can't just say is nonsense at face-value. They might actually work. A good example of such a therapy form that sounds like it should not work but has been proven to be very effective is electroconvulse therapy of major depression. Also, the study I provided a link to is just one RCT testing alt. medicine in cancer patients, so it's clearly not impossible to get permission from an ethics board to conduct such a study.</p></div>		</li>
