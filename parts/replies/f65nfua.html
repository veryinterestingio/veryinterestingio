<p>If the thingy that the magnet slides around to open up the gas tube is dirty it won't close and gas will get out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simplified, a boiler is basically a metal tube with a gas burner under it with some water flowing at the right rate to not boil but not go so fast that its cold.</p>
<p>To achieve all this there are parts such as a pump to push heating water around and a whole lot of safety and sensing equipment to make sure it all happens in the right order to the right temperature and ideally doesn't go wrong killing anyone but the basic picture is still just a finned tube as a heat exchanger, a cold water input and a big hot flame under it (usually, you can get electric water heaters but gas is the type with a pilot).</p>
<p>The pilot just lights the bigger flame inside, if you listen you can hear the 'flooootomphhh' when its switched on as the burning air expands inside the tank for a split second when the large burner lights, then a mild roar from all the little grill holes in the burner plate like a row of blow torches on their side.</p>
<p>That's it, metal tube, gas flame, flowing water and/or pump, plus a whole lot of kit to make sure it works safely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I feel like the answer’s in his comment but it’s not really ELI5. I think since he’s saying that the hot water tank is 40,000 btu/h, that it must be a powerful enough heater to warm your water quickly. He also seems to be under the assumption (maybe correctly, but I didn’t read it that way initially) that OP thinks the pilot light heats the water tank, hence the comparison of pilot light btu/h vs the water heater.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone right now is focusing on the UEF, which is the “efficiency” of the water heater and directly correlates to how much money it costs to use a water heater each year.</p>
<p>US regulations have skyrocketed in the previous years, so the result is there are less electric water heaters (unless it’s a Heat Pump type) in the market.  Achieving a high UEF allows your product to be competitive.</p>
<p>Every storage water heater (which are the ones I focus on) has to have extremely good insulation, with most of the market leaning towards cyclopentane (which I’m not a fan and decided not to use due to lower insulation) due to low costs.  Insulation has also been affected greatly due to regulations, as a lot of it has been banned in recent years due to the ozone layer and global warming (this latter one is currently being banned or phased out).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pilot light: a small flame (similar in size to a candle flame) that burns continuously. Among other things, it serves as the ignition source when then main burner needs to light up.</p>
<p>Thermocouple: A semiconductor device which converts a temperature differential directly into electricity. In this case, by being warmed by the pilot light it generates the power needed to activate the solenoid.</p>
<p>Solenoid valve: An electromechanical device which uses electrical power to open and/or close. In this case, the valve for the gas is normally closed. But when electrical power is provided, the solenoid valve opens and allows gas into the system.</p>
<p>This means that if the pilot light goes out, the main valve to the system will switch off. This prevents a large amount of gas from being emitted unburnt into the home until it explodes. If you need to light the pilot light, there's a small bypass switch which needs to manually be held down to allow the gas to flow until the pilot light has lit up and the thermocouple is able to generate enough power to hold the solenoid valve open on its own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A thermocouple isn't a semiconductor FYI. That'd be a thermistor.</p>
<p>A thermocouple is made of 2 dissimilar metals touching. It's some physics property that if two different metals touch, they produce a voltage that changes based on temperature. The thermocouples used in industry are literally two wires that are spot welded together at the end.</p>
<p>Different types of thermocouple use different metals. K type thermocouples have one wire of alumel and one wire of chromel.</p>
<p>Source: I frequently make thermocouples using a spot welder and hundreds of feet of thermocouple wire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what he’s saying is that the system won’t deliver hot water if it detects the pilot is out—not because there isn’t hot water, but because it’s designed not to. Just because the pilot is out doesn’t mean the main flame, which is heating the water, has gone out.</p>
<p>The pilot is this little flame that keeps the main heating fire lit.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about the thermocouple or solenoid, they weren’t part of the actual answer if I understood correctly. That was in response to people saying OP’s house was going to explode.</p></div>		</li>
