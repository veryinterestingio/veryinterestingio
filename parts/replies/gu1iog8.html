			<div class="markdown"><p>He's saying that our brain likes anything salty by default as it was in scarce supply in the past. Salt in small quantities is healthy but in modern times, salt is excessively used by companies to make food taste better. Obviously anything in excess is unhealthy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, salt in the amounts of a &quot;typical&quot; western diet are horrible for us. They are very bad for the heart especially. Salt in small amounts is absolutely fine, and in reasonable quantities we need salts to use as electrolytes which helps our body use electrical signals via the nervous system. </p>
<p>But I digress. There is so much added salt in highly processed foods and most restaurants that most people who aren't paying attention are eating too much salt. Usually it's shown as &quot;sodium&quot; on an ingredients list or nutrition label.</p>
<p>One way to discover if you're eating too many salts: make homemade vegetable soup with a low-sodium stock from the store, and use all fresh or frozen vegetables (most frozen veggies keep their nutrients very well) and do not add any salt to the soup. Just chop the veggies and throw them in and add some pepper and maybe some herbs if you like, BUT NO SALT.   If you find this soup to have basically no flavor, you're probably eating foods that are way too salty. By adding more salt to the soup, you'll start to recognize the threshold where your tongue picks up the salt ir is used to. If you practice eating less salt, you will greatly enhance other flavors.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Could you provide a source. My understanding is that unless you have high blood pressure salt intake is no big deal. You get a short term blood pressure spike and then the body gets rid of it.</p></div>		</li>
