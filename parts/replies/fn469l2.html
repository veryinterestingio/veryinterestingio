			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the most simple answer is, well, it really depends on what kind of chemical it is. </p>
<p>Most will irritate the cells on the inside of your stomach and intestines in different ways. They might block an important chain of chemical reactions inside your cells provoking a response (diarrhea/vomiting), or they could interact with your actual nerves in one way or another. </p>
<p>Your body has different kinds of sensors at the molecular level that, when they detect something is amiss, will trigger that evacuation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body does not know.  If you experience symptoms that might be caused by food poisoning you tend to throw up.  Dizziness causes it, among other things.  Basically when you throw up it is your body guessing that it might have eaten something bad and trying to get rid of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not bacterial waste, toxins are actively produced by bugs like cholera and s aureus. Its these preformed toxins that cause food poisoning by altering gut nutrient and water reabsorption. Diarrhea is not a protective response, its a reaction to a toxin. </p>
<p>Vomiting is a protective response. Vomiting is triggered by bad chemicals in your blood (that you consumed, such as  alcohol) reaching the area postrema part of your brain which triggers the emetic/vomiting response. This is one of the many things that cause vomiting, others include signals from your sense of balance (sea sickness) and taste</p></div>		</li>
