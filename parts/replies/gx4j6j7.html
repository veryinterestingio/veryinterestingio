<p>A 2020 study which reviewed more than a 100 tests of motivation crowding theory and conducted its own field experiments found that paying individuals for intrinsically enjoyable tasks boosts their performance, but that taking payment away after it is expected may lead individuals to perform worse than if they were not paid at first.[4]</p>
<p>so if you pay someone for something they want to do anyway they will do it better but if you take away payment from something they use to pay for then people do worse than if you never paid at all.   its interesting but also kind of obvious</p></div>		</li>
