			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. As a HS sports coach who has to go through concussion training every year, let me tell you the guidance has changed. The patient should rest and sleep as much as possible. </p>
<p>The old reasoning was that because sometimes people would slip into comas after head injuries. This is rare, and rest is the best way to restore and heal your brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My roommate got a concussion and coach had me watch him for the next day and keep waking him up. This was in 2010 so people were still misinformed lmao</p>
<p>Luckily I relented and just let him sleep. I was being lazy and the fucker would stay awake for like a minute.</p></div>		</li>
