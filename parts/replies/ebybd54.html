			<div class="markdown"><p>First I figured out how I wanted t write (small caps), then I practiced my alphabet in my free time like doodling in the margins, and yes reminding myself to use it. I still slipped a lot in the first couple months, but now Iâ€™m writing completely differently. </p>
<p>Edit: it also helped that I was journaling at the time, so I had a good amount of practice time each day. </p></div>		</li>
