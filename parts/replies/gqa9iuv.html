			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it’s important to clarify that viruses don’t benefit from a host with an immune system per se. The immune system is an impediment, and indeed, viruses often evolve to overcome immune defenses. However, as viral fitness depends on success in reproduction and transmission, a virus that does too much damage too fast may burn through its host too quickly for its own good. </p>
<p>I think it’s important to be wary of arguments that viruses naturally evolve to be less virulent or hold back in order to benefit the host. Viruses evolve to benefit themselves, full stop. If the hosts’s interests overlap to some extent, cool; if not, who cares? Fatal viruses can be rather successful, e.g. HIV, which we now manage to treat, but which has a rather effective infection and transmission strategy despite its naturally fatal outcome. Many viruses of bacteria are full-on fatal, the only semblance of restraint being how long the virus waits (and multiplied) before popping the bacterial cell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would elaborate slightly by mentioning that viruses have no intent.  They don't think, or plan, and their path is purely random and accidental.  Their existence, mutation, and selection is purely coincident with the phenomenon we vaguely refer to as &quot;life&quot;.  As for any long term co-evolution, there's no reason to think that some form of symbiosis - or equilibrium - won't occur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your reasoning feels a little backward here - &quot;Equilibrium&quot; (neither organism getting such an advantage in their conflict that they're able to completely overwhelm wipe out the fitness of the other) is the <em>only way you can have long-term coevolution.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Its debatable if viruses are even alive, they can't reproduce on their own. They can't survive outside of the host. They are more like a computer virus in nature: they exist only to reproduce because all the code fragments that didn't exist to reproduce stopped existing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For context:</p>
<p>About 70% of ocean biomass is microbes. About 20% of these microbes are killed every day by viruses!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Debating whether viruses are alive or not is a bit like the medieval practice of debating how many angels can dance on the head of a pin: it's an interesting pedagogical exercise that doesn't change our understanding.</p></div>		</li>
