			<div class="markdown"><p>Not close at all.  Crow communication is incredibly difficult to decipher.  They make dozens of different sounds and they use a lot of them in all kinds of contexts.  That use of the same calls in different contexts is what makes it so hard.  They also don't use what's called &quot;referential calls&quot; like a lot of social animals including prairie dogs, many primates, chickadees etc.  Referential calls are calls that refer to a specific class or event like &quot;there's a hawk...there's a cat...I found a banana&quot;.  My colleague at the University of Washington studied crows calls around food for his Masters.  You can find a couple blog articles I wrote on his <a href="https://corvidresearch.blog/2019/03/14/crow-vocalizations-part-i-new-science/" target="_blank">research</a> and the <a href="https://corvidresearch.blog/2019/03/14/crow-vocalizations-part-ii-qa/" target="_blank">state</a> of communication at large at my blog.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems like the Crows warn others as I approach in the woods. Is that what is happening? Is that different than referential calls?</p></div>		</li>
