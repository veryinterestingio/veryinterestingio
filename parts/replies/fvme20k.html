			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was younger (37 now), the red flecks in my beard were apparent when I'd let it grow out. Sort of a coppery undertone.</p>
<p>Now all the places that were coppery are gray, so I've got a salt and pepper going on because of it.</p>
<p>Neither of my parents have red hair, but my brother has a full head of red hair thanks to the recessive genes he got from both of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I come across as a gray/brown hair guy. But in certain light, my hair can look reddish. And some individual hairs on my head are red. My gray (white) hairs are not really concentrated in any spot, they're just distributed around my head. But my beard would be very white if I grew it out.</p>
<p>There's a large spectrum of hair colors out there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I too have a red tint to my beard. My second son was a redhead, which surprised us, as my wife is a brunette and her parents and sister had dark hair. Turned out her grandpa was a redhead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's cool. I'm a natural redhead with green eyes, my ex is brown haired with Hazel eyes, and our son has dark blonde hair and bright blue eyes. He's pale like me but can tan, unlike me. I'd say it's probably obvious he has the ginger gene from me, but it's cool to read its a possible indicator too</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you come across that article again I'd love to look into it, I tried looking it up but didn't find anything. I have pale skin, blue eyes and dark hair but I'm adopted and don't know any of my blood family, making me wildly curious about these things.</p></div>		</li>
