			<div class="markdown"><p>Elasticity of supply is a real concern though. In other words: Mines and other industries cannot be set up over night.</p>
<p>Sure, there are other possible stable conditions, but if the time and energy required to switch between them are too great, it is just like a monopolizing power within a single country's market: Dangerous in potential to exploit other actors and game the system to perpetuate consolidation of power.</p>
<p>It's a lot like how the free market ideals require perfect information, rational decisions, and the free movement of labor. There are time and energy costs associated with each of those, limiting the accuracy of the model--and forcing us to confront the fact that exploitation will occur unless power is regulated in distribution to some extent by agreement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two possible solutions to this (probably more but I’m just an armchair consultant). You could build other sources of cobalt/rare earth metals/whatever resource has a limited number of suppliers. This would be expensive. These new sources would not be profitable for the likely future. It’s likely that future government would cut the funding and they would close before they became useful. Alternatively you could build up a strategic reserve of the material. Something that would sustain crucial activities long enough to build these alternative sources. This is probably the cheapest solution and maybe already exists. The  American government has a strategic cheese reserve and Canada has warehouses full of maple syrup. There is likely a big stock of cobalt somewhere that would protect the world from unfriendly actors disrupting the supply chain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly we mine all the rare earth metals we need, by accident, in the US right now.</p>
<p>The problem is for the most part, rare earth tend to be mixed in with Thorium, often as much as one atom of thorium per atom of rare earth metal.  And thorium is technically controlled as a nuclear material.</p>
<p>So mines digging up incidental amounts of thorium-rich ore would have huge thorium liability.  This would be nonsensical and we could never mind anything with the regulations in place, so mines are allowed to just toss the thorium back into the ground, and the US regulatory agencies will basically pretend they never dug it up.</p>
<p>The problem is, if we wanted to extract the rare earth materials out of the mining tailings... then that would involve separating it from the thorium, which would count as 'processing and concentrating' the material.  So they can't. So they don't.  So a $20 Billion nothing industry of rare earth metals lets China dominate the $1 Trillion electronics industry that rare earths are crucial to.  It's like fairy dust, with a tiny bit sprinkled into everything now-adays.</p></div>		</li>
