<p>So for SPF 50 then 50 times longer no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but: that is what happens when they apply it to some kind of detector in a lab. How well it actually sticks to human skin, when you may find yourself sweating; or in the water; or wearing a garment that may abrade the lotion away without providing adequate sun filtration by itself - those are all open questions.</p>
<p>I’m a redhead, a freckled ginger. I wear serious sunscreen if I will be outside for more than 15 minutes. I’ve been diving at a resort recently and not worried about exposure during travel between dive sites, because the reef-safe sunscreen is all ZnO based - it does not wipe off so easily. I have spent maybe ten minutes on or off shore in direct sun - none without sunscreen. If I go out to the pool or beach, I stay in shade. I’m still sporting a very mild sunburn on my shoulders. Nothing too painful, just something you notice in the shower.</p>
<p>Those of use whose ancestry lies in Britain and Ireland are not equipped for sun. My wife, OTOH, has some Native American ancestry, and corresponding black straight hair. We went to Mexico once, a resort, and by the end of the week they no longer addressed us in English - she tanned so well that they assumed that I had married a local girl and spoke Spanish (which I do, at roughly the three-year-old level).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also a difference between UV-A and UV-B . I think spf is only defined for one of those, but not necessarily the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have four half siblings. Mom's given us all some nice Scottish/Scandinavian genes. Their dad is 3/4 German, 1/4 native American. One sister looks like a model for an Irish tour agency, and can't go outside for more than five minutes without sunscreen, or her skin turns as red as her hair. (Actually redder, since her hair is bright orange.) The other sister goes outside for an hour and her skin gets a nice glow - a day outside for a baseball tournament (with SPF 10 Sun lotion of course) leaves her looking nearly as dark as her great grandfather, who was native and worked outside every day of his life. (My dad gave me some Irish/English skin that was totally inappropriate for growing up in Florida.)</p>
<p>Sunscreen is just always in my purse in the spring/summer. Aloe is usually sitting out on my bathroom counter. I probably need to go check with a dermatologist soon to check for melanomas. Yay genetics!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That kinda make sense if you reapplied as needed, however long that is for your specific formula, to maintain the SPF coating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer.  The SPF <strong>is not a measurement of how long you can stay out in the sun.</strong>  The number is the denominator for the fraction of how much UV radiation you are exposed to (where the numerator is fixed at 1), compared to no sunscreen.</p></div>		</li>
