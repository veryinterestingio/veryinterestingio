<p>I've had the privilege of interacting with some people behind the iNaturalist project, though I confess I was unaware of the stink bug example you linked to, TIL!</p>
<p>To answer your question, I think there's huge potential in civic engagement in tracking the spread of invasive species. Full disclosure, I'm not an invasive species biologist, but much of ecology is about the effective monitoring of wildlife diversity and distribution, and when many people get involved that will be of great help! One key is that participants try their best to be consistent in methodology, which apps like iNaturalist or <a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/news/mammalnet-live-download-simple-app-and-help-us-collect-data-wild-mammals-europe" target="_blank">MammalNet/iMammalia</a> can help with.</p>
<p>I chose the term &quot;civic engagement&quot; deliberately because I believe we can all be citizen scientists and exercise our civic duties by doing science and studying issues of public concern.</p></div>		</li>
