			<div class="markdown"><p>I wanted to confirm that last sentence is correct but a lot of people dont believe it het. Right now on tests its even better than some payed programs.</p>
<p>In my opinion if you are really worried you can supplement windows defender with malwarebytes. Its a free program with paasive antivirus which you can activate every once in a while to do a scan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is partially true, in blind tests almost all antivirus programs perform about the same after something has been out in the world and infecting machines for about a week. But only for PERSONAL HOME computers.</p>
<p>Prior to it being a week old, Windows Defender is horrible. This isn’t Microsoft’s fault exactly, but more a symptom of Microsoft being so popular that malware publishers check to make sure their program doesn’t trigger Windows Defender before sending it out in the world.</p>
<p>They suffer from their own popularity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well isn't it good that people keep their windows and their defender up-to-date, and don't delay important security updates because they can't be bothered to restart their PCs.  </p>
<p>Window's defenders edge is the fact that... It is basically everywhere. When the team involved in it figure a virus out, then with an update they can inoculate basically every PC.   </p>
<p>I mean like... Who wouldn't install the important updates? Or stop windows or defender from downloading and installing updates that don't require a restart.   </p>
<p>The best Anti-whatever still is a smart user. Don't go to shady sites, don't install random programs, use a safe email service and don't open random attachments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite thing about MalWare Bytes is that they put out program updates often (not just definition updates), and every time they do a program update they let you start another 14 day free trial for the pro version.  In the last year I think I've been a trial Pro user for more time than I've been a free user.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, an anti-virus program acts an awful lot like a virus.</p>
<p>If I told you that there was a computer program that'd run all the time, watching everything that happened on your computer, that'd sound pretty shady wouldn't it?</p>
<p>We trust that our anti virus is only looking for the things we want, but if you have two of them one is gonna go &quot;hang on, what is that guy doing over there?&quot; at the other.</p></div>		</li>
