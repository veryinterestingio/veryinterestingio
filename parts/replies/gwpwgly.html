<p>Not that we know of, that's the conjecture (but definitely not 2, as 1 is not considered prime).</p>

<p>I quickly found a counter-example to your more constrained conjecture:</p>
<p>22 = 19 + 3 = 17 + 5</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The conjecture does not require that the even number is a unique sum of primes (as given with 22=19+3=17+5) or that the sum is of unique primes (6=3+3, 10=5+5, etc.). All that is required is that you can have 2a=b+c for some integer a and primes b and c.</p></div>		</li>

edit: as /u/gravityandpizza pointed out, I missed the even part</p></div>		</li>
