<p>Try biting into an onion with your nose shut</p>

<p>That actually doesn't stop you from smelling the food, it just cuts down on the intensity.</p>
<p>The air inside your mouth also reaches your olfactory bulb, even if your nostrils themselves are blocked. The technical term is retronasal smell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Retronasal smell is almost entirely blocked by pinching the nose. This is because there is no where for the air to go, so the positive pressure in the nose will keep out air currents, and thus prevent the molecules from reaching the bulb.</p>
<p>It even says this in the article on retronasal smell: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another way to isolate the sense of retronasal smell is to use the ‚Äúnose pinch test.‚Äù When eating while pinching the nostrils closed, the flavor of food appears to dissipate, namely because the pathway for air exiting the nose that creates the flavor image is blocked</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, blocking your nostrils is like turning down the volume rather than turning it off.</p>
<p>For a good example of cutting it off altogether, consider how food tastes when you get sick and your nasal passages are completely plugged up with mucus. </p>
<p>It's not you being sick that makes everything taste wrong, it's your sense of smell being blocked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a very reduced sense of smell.  But I don't really know that my taste is that much reduced.  Tasting good food is one of the great joys in life still, and bad food is still aweful.  I like to think my taste buds are adapted, like a blind person gets better hearing.  May or may not be true, I can't compare my taste to normal.  But I don't lose taste when sick :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My friend slipped on a skateboard when we were in HS and bumped his head a bit. Lost his sense of smell completely. He definitely has a highly muted sense of taste but is somehow amazing with food and drinks. Manages a fancy restaurant, can't taste for balls. Go figure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since 20-30% of taste still comes from taste buds in our tongue, 1. he still has the sense of taste, although reduced, and 2. his brain might be compensating by amplifying what comes to it from the taste buds.</p></div>		</li>
