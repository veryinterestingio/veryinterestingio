			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add that way of administration of some drugs strogly depends of situation. For example adrenaline (epinephrine): in anaphylaxis it is administered intramuscularry, in resuscitaton - intravenous. Mix the situation and drug won't have desired effect (im. during resuscitation) or you add serious hearth problem to already endangered person (iv. in anaphylaxis). In one case you want to slightly stimulate hearth and constrict most of body vessels, so you give drug to the muscle, so it will steadli release to bloodstream. In another you want to make heart start working or start working effectively, so you want to give it full power stimulation with single ,,punch&quot; of stimulatn, so you give adrenaline to the bloodstream so it will reach heart fast.</p></div>		</li>
