			<div class="markdown"><p>Duct tape varies very widely as do bandaids. I would say there is overlap at the extremes of each- as in the high end of bandaids is probably about the same as the lower half of the range of duct tape. </p>
<p>Duct tape has its principal advantage in its “cloth” backing which really stabilizes it against shear and lateral movement. And also it’s wide surface area (remember the area dependence). Traditional duct tape has very poor adhesion at high and low temp extremes (which is - ironically- what makes it a very poor choice for ducts). </p>
<p>There are several classes of adhesives, and classes of backings. The backings each have performance characteristics and the adhesives have different characteristics. </p>
<p>For this information- it is best seen on Grangier.com and perhaps McMasterCarr. I had the need to educate myself on the finer points of tape a while back. And those along with 3M were my primary resources.  I wasn’t trying to invent new tape formulas, I was just trying to solve a pesky industrial problem that needed more effort than “whatever roll is closest”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well microfoam is the one I was thinking of. But even that’s listed as being easy to remove. And it is- it’s just super stretchy and sticks to itself really well so it’s good for pressure dressings. </p>
<p>I mean running through their list on the website - I’m familiar with using all of these - though often not by name. It’s usually “paper tape” “clear tape” or “ foam tape” etc. but none of these are great stickers. Much less than a bandaid. </p>
<p>In a hospital setting this makes a lot of sense. You really don’t want it to stick well.  I would not say any of these are representative of a standard bandaid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who uses duct tape ALOT not all duct tapes are created equal. Solid black easy to rip tape is by far the best in terms of strong hold, but clean release. Colourful duct tape, while fantastically fun is frankly frightful. Doesn't hold well, and when it comes off it leaves adhesive all over the place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea I agree. Although I find the boundary for crap and good to mostly fall to generic vs brand. Name brand companies actually try and get a winning formula. Generic cheap stuff is whatever sticks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah honestly why are all the colorful duct tapes absolute shite for being tape? I’ve found one in Orange that was actually good, and I’m pretty sure that’s because it was supposed to be used as warning/caution tape or something</p></div>		</li>
