			<div class="markdown"><p>Mine improved significantly (I've had my share of dental problems) when aside from sugar, I reduced my dairy and carbohydrates consumption. Basically, when I stick to meat/fruit/veggies/legumes I have better dental health (better breath included) than when I add to my diet any of the others. Especially with dairy and sugar, I start noticing more sensitivity on my teeth as soon as I eat them more often.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. I believe most animals' natural diet keeps their teeth clean. For example cats' dental problems come from eating cat food but eating raw meat with bone helps them keep clean teeth. I just remembered this article about a fruitarian couple:</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2018/09/14/we-only-eat-fruit-and-havent-brushed-our-teeth-in-two-years/" target="_blank"><a href="https://nypost.com/2018/09/14/we-only-eat-fruit-and-havent-brushed-our-teeth-in-two-years/" target="_blank">https://nypost.com/2018/09/14/we-only-eat-fruit-and-havent-brushed-our-teeth-in-two-years/</a></a></p>
<p>It says that medical professionals are skeptical and don't recommend eating only fruit and not brushing your teeth but some fruits are very low-carb (such as the avocado) and our ancestors eating meat could have helped the same way it helps carnivores</p>
<p>What you eat has a huge influence on your dental health, but we're used to processed foods so we need to take more care.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. In Diamond’s book “Guns, Germs and Steel” one of the chapters looks at the early natives living on tiny Easter Island (the one with the massive stone heads” and they had a very sugary diet from eating beets or something I think and never brushed their teeth, and all their teeth were rotting and fell out when they were like 30.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a bit of a factoid. Most folk before modern medicine did not die in their mid 30s, they typically lived to their 60s ish. But, infant mortality was much higher, dragging the average down. A quick Google says infant mortality was estimated at 28% before 1 year of age, circa 40,000 years ago. So for a population of 10,000 people, lets say 7200 live to be 60, meanwhile 28%, or 2800, die at 1.</p>
<p>(7200x60)+(2800x1)=434,800  </p>
<p>434,800÷10,000= an average age of 43.48 years old. Which is obviously not the actual &quot;average&quot; age of death.</p></div>		</li>
