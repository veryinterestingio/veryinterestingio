			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of rainfall comes from water that evaporates from land, and through the evapotranspiration of plants. How much, I don't know, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's a decent proportion despite the planet being mostly ocean. That's because salt water slows evaporation, and evapotranspiration by plants is expedited by biological activity. So it shifts the equation towards land a bit, or maybe a lot.</p></div>		</li>
