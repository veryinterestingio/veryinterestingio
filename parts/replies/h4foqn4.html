			<div class="markdown"><p>This is our get-out-of-jail-free card for FTL travel. You can't travel through space faster than light, but if you compress the space in front of you, then you can travel through less space to appear to travel faster than light.</p>
<p>It's like quickly moving from one end of an accordion to the other by compressing the bellows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In effect what's happening is that more space is being created between objects. So it's not that our galaxy, and a galaxy billions of lightyears away are <em>moving</em> apart from each other at faster than the speed of light. Rather, so much additional space is coming into being that <em>even light</em> isn't fast enough to bridge the ever increasing gulf between galaxies.</p>
<p>The further apart two objects are, the more space is being created between them, so some of those galaxies that we can view today, as they were billions of years ago, have since gotten far enough away that light leaving them <em>now</em> will never be able to reach us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this also mean the currently observable universe could only be a fraction of what truly exists out there? Is there any way of knowing how much might be beyond that?</p>
<p>I remember hearing based on the expanding gulfs between galaxies, we eventually won't be able to see anything beyond our local cluster or even galaxy; would we have any way of deriving knowledge that something beyond there does exist, without being able to refer to historical data we collected when we <em>could</em> see beyond?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More properly, the Universe's expansion isn't a &quot;speed&quot;. It results in an <em>apparent</em> speed for distant objects, but the expansion itself isn't one - it has the wrong units. The expansion's units are 1/time, not distance/time like velocity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great explanation, but the more I think about it the dumber I feel and more confused I get. Like in your car example, the bottle is thrown out at 13b light-years away and by the time it gets to us the car is now 45b light-years away, wouldn't that mean that the universe is somehow expanding faster than the speed of light? Sorry if that sounds stupid, I don't know much about this stuff. I'm just trying to figure out how the object moves the additional 32b light-years farther away in the timeframe of only 13b years if it's not somehow moving faster than light.</p>
<p>Edit: ok,was curious and found this article <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2020/06/12/ask-ethan-how-does-the-fabric-of-spacetime-expand-faster-than-the-speed-of-light/amp/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2020/06/12/ask-ethan-how-does-the-fabric-of-spacetime-expand-faster-than-the-speed-of-light/amp/</a></p>
<p>I don't really understand too much of it, but cool animation of a raisin cookie made a little bit of sense to me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Unfortunately, there's a limit to how well an every-day analogy can really capture what's going with advanced physics. What's shared between the car and the galaxy is that the distance between it and you are increasing, but in the case of the car, this is because of velocity, while in the case of the galaxy, it's because of the metric expansion of spacetime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The speed of light isn't really relevant because nothing is really moving faster than it. </p>
<p>You can do this type of &quot;fake speed&quot; with a lot of things. A flashlight, for example. Take a flashlight, ideally a fairly focused one, and point it at a far away wall. Now flick your wrist and watch the spot on the wall speed off really quickly. If you go big enough, you can easily &quot;break&quot; the speed of light. For example, imagine shining a light at the moon. If you now flick your wrist, the spot of your hypothetical flashlight would rush over the moon extremely quickly, quite possibly faster than the speed of light. Works the other way around, too. Aim a telescope at some planet, tap on it lightly, and then watch that very planet speed away at insane speeds. And yet, neither the planet nor your telescope moved virtually at all. Nor did the photons from your flashlight, they traveled the same straight line they always travel.</p>
<p>Same with the expansion of space, nothing really moves faster than the speed of light, it just appears that way from where you're sitting. Not really the same thing, but same idea.</p></div>		</li>
