			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if you did it, it wouldn't stay clear for very long because of the harsh environment like you said. Even the highest-quality glass get cloudy if used repeatedly without washing with soap and drying to prevent spots. I guess you could swap out any tubing visible under the hood if you're going to Coffee and Cars or something, like how you might clean everything under there right before or right as you get to an event. I just can't think of what tubing you can see just under the hood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest one is the radiator hose on the top. Otherwise you could see vacuum hoses. Both of these things are frequently replaced with colored silicon hoses though if you're building a showy car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah cool so pretty similar to water cooling in a pc, clear tubing can be cool but is not necessarily helpful as a diagnostic because you would notice any issues at other stages of the loop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, if you grab and squeeze one of your cooling hoses, you can feel both the temperature of the coolant and the &quot;pulse&quot; of the water pump as well. Aside from the color and anti-freeze protection there's not much else about coolant to diagnose and those two items can be done at the overflow tank. </p>
<p>Brake lines and fuel lines are rigid lines. </p>
<p>Vaccum lines could be clear, but those would likely look worse over time as they'd darken with, um, greasy air. I mean, the vac lines might be helpful to be clear, but it wouldn't tell you anything a cotton swab can't.</p></div>		</li>
