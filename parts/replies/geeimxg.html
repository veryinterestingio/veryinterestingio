There’s a gummy booger, which is semi-solid and the perfect “picking” and rolling between fingers kind.  There’s a plate booger, which is solid and flat and sloughed off the side of the nasal passages.  There’s a rock booger, which is solid and roundish and blocks the passage, leading to that awesome “Ah! Air!” feeling when removed.  Finally we have a rock with a tail, which is a rock booger with a slime trail pulled from deeper in the nasal cavity attacted to it.  You’re welcome.</p></div>		</li>
