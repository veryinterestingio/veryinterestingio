			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a myth. The hump is made of fat. It helps insulate the camel, against both cold and heat</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hump is mostly fatty tissue so can store large amounts for food and for heat. Their feet are large and flat, helps the same way on snow as it does on sand. Big eyes to help let in light and long eyelashes to keep snow out</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Camels actually survive without water for long periods because their kidneys are adapted to filter the water more efficiently. IIRC mice are actually even better at filtering water than camels, which means mice can last even longer without water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, horses were brought by the Europeans so they were all domesticated, and some of them escaped into the wild. </p>
<p>Native Americans had never seen horses before the Spanish came, so they made a big impression.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>surprisingly many native American cultures adopted to using horses rather quickly and became deeply instilled in their cultures. Between the reintroduction by the Spanish and westward expansion of the USA many became formidable warriors on horseback.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some horses (along with pigs, goats, etc.) were intentionally released with the idea that they could reproduce on their own and be caught later for draft/food. Feral pigs have been in the Gulf Coast since the early colonization days. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_Imperialism_(book\)" target="_blank">Crosby's <em>Ecological Imperialism</em></a> goes into how these hogs facilitated the spread of European diseases throughout the lower Mississippi Valley.</p></div>		</li>
