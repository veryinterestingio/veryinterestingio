			<div class="markdown"><p>8+ years? That’s a tough one. Salt water is pretty harsh on any piece of equipment. The best I can say is that it may be possible but somewhat unlikely. Sorry for the cop out answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the reply (not a cop out! Was a difficult question). Yeah I figured if it eventually gets found it wouldn't be able to be deciphered. Though the Air France Brazil crash if I remember correctly it's black box and voice recorder was found almost a year later and it was decoded. </p>
<p>MH370 will remain a mystery I suppose</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a follow up question. Why don’t these boxes store video from the various cameras? I feel like this would be important in the event of a crash.</p></div>		</li>
