			<div class="markdown"><p>If you don't mind answering - what is the reason for sharp and flat notes being called sharp or flat? Like, why not just give each note it's own letter? Is there something different about a sharp/flat note, or does it just have to do with fitting all the keys on a piano?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because within Western musical conventions, each scale only ever has 7 notes, no more, no less. Thus, you will always have an A, B, C, D, E, F, and G tone, and the only way to shift those notes in order to make it fit within a given mode (e.g. major or minor) is to give them some kind of mark to shift them up or down a semitone from their nominal notes.</p>
<p>For example, for a C-major or A-minor scale, you just have the nominal notes (A-G), but if you move to say G-major or E-minor, you end up needing to shift the F-key up a semitone, thus your notes are now A, B, C, D, E, F#, and G.</p>
<p>This also results in a pretty self-consistent musical ruleset, in that you only end up with 12 discrete tones, but you can use those 12 tones to create <em>any</em> 7-note scale.</p>
<p>As for why they're specifically called sharps and flats; that I don't know.</p></div>		</li>
