			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this can all be verified by listening to a race-specific built car. </p>
<p>If you think motorcycles can be loud, wait till you hear 10,000 rpm, open header, V8, drag cars race a 1/4 mile. </p>
<p>When the &quot;exhaust&quot; is literally just a set of headers running to a turbo (if equipped) and then straight out to the open air, it gets pretty loud.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had an sv650 like this. Headers to an open pipe. That thing screamed when wide open. You could hear it from a good half mile away from in front of the bike and it would trigger my car alarm to alert if I rode past it at more than just an idle.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm keeping my stock muffler because I live in the city and have neighbors, and I like to slip through the woods quietly (it's an enduro).</p></div>		</li>
