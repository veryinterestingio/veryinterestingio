			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the trouble with ELI5 is that people tend to ask the kinds of questions where if you were to really explain it, there's a minimum level of background knowledge required first. Answers like &quot;because the colour is diluted by water&quot; don't <em>explain</em> like someone's five, they're just kinda vaguely state something that is technically true but that absolutely will be interpreted in the wrong way. The important distinction between a 5 year old and a 20 year old for the purposes of ELI5 is their background knowledge on a subject. The best answers imo need to fill the background information gap in order to actually explain the question, not just throw out a weak mostly wrong two sentence thing, and sometimes that background information just takes a lot of words to explain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, you do you.</p>
<p>But, the simple and accurate answer is the one i gave; the foam <em>is</em> colored, the tinting agent has just been massively diluted. </p>
<p>Yes, there are other optical factors as well and there's more to the dilution effect that goes beyond what OP may envision as simple dilution by addition, but, in the end, it's mostly dilution through one mechanism or another that loses the color. </p>
<p>To make the foam have more noticeable color, just add more coloring agent to the soap.  <a href="https://www.funathomewithkids.com/2013/08/rainbow-soap-foam-bubbles-sensory-play.html?m=1" target="_blank">We used to do it with the kids</a>.</p></div>		</li>
