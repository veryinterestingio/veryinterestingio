			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. Most of the time your body is acting on your circadian rhythm and telling you “this is the time you normally eat, so eat”. This triggers the ghrelin hormone which gives you the hunger grumbles in your belly. </p>
<p>If you choose to ignore this feeling or you’re too busy to eat at this time, the hungry feeing passes in about an hour. </p>
<p>Your body does start to eat itself if you choose to never eat, but you really have to be at a caloric deficit. The body will also go after the fat stores first which isn’t a huge detriment to the body assuming you’re at a healthy weight.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Read this as &quot;gremlin hormone&quot;, which would also explain a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>actually it'll only do that  after glycogen stores are depleted, which typically doesn't happen to most people these days... </p>
<p>glycogen is just how sugar is stored in a chain in your liver for short-term storage.... this is why people carb load before marathons, etc. </p>
<p>you'd need to fast for ~12 hours to run out of glycogen, so most people get hungry and eat before that happens. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because glycogen is easier for your body to use as energy, it's used before fat, so if your glycogen stores are full, your body doesn't burn fat. To start burning fat, you need to diminish your glycogen stores so your body has no other choice than to use stored fat for energy.</p>
