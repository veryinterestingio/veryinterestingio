			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe these are the fuckers I’ve been trying to ID. I live in the Midwest and every summer (well this is my 3rd summer here so every summer <em>so far</em>) we get these little fruit fly things but they’re bigger than the fruit flies I’m familiar with. And we have no fruit. </p>
<p>They seem to love my sink/drain and I’ve wondered where they come from and how to prevent them or kill off their breeding ground but I couldn’t ID them properly to research. So maybe this is what I’ve been looking for. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They’re attracted to lighted fly traps. But finding the source of the infestation is kind of key. They love death and fermentation.</p></div>		</li>
