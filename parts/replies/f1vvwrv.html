<p>Things like texture......play a large part in what we consider the “taste” of food.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find it strange that a lot of people forget how important texture is to some cultures and get caught up on strictly flavour, like with shark fin soup people always mention how it lacks flavour but forget that the importance of it is about the texture.</p>
<p>not defending shark fin soup, just found it to be the best example for the texture vs flavour aspect. Maybe if people found an alternative made artificially from things like collagen or engineered amino acids then we could have less people harvesting things like sharks or bird nests or other oddities in the name of culinary appeal</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chinese people buying shark fin soup has nothing to do with texture. It's one hundred percent a stupid status symbol. That's also why they're into shit like rhino horn, bear gall bladder, and literally sucking the blood off of fresh deer antlers that are still attached to live deer.</p>
<p>Source: am chinese and have seen way too much of these bullshit. It's our version of homeopathy and healing crystals combined with a dick competition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much every thing but taste affects how we view food eg rarity/delicacy, price, look. All those can trump flavour it’s not crazy to think texture is as much taste as it is feeling, they hand in hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation! What made me think of this was reheating oily leftovers. It tasted terrible cold and then I heated it up in the skillet and was amazing. So your reasons definitely line up with my experience.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Another thing that contributes to our experience of flavor is smell, so a bowl of soup would taste better hot because it’s giving off pleasant aromas with all the steam but if you ate the soup cold, you would not experience this sensation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Flavor is made from the combination of taste and smell. If you can't smell it will severely impact the way you taste. See airline food as an example.</p></div>		</li>
