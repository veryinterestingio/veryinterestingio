			<div class="markdown"><p>The channels are used to provide a level of separation between different wifi devices. What determines if a repeater or mesh can  broadcast at full or half speed is the amount of antennas it has. An antenna can only broadcast or receive but not do both at the same time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not true at all... In fact your cellphone and cable box do this all the time. Either using active circuits to cut noise or just using a circulator.</p>
<p>The answer is more a factor that the cheapest and most common WiFi chips don't/haven't had multiple transceiver circuits (or chips that support duplexing)</p>
<p>And because the standard didn't specify multiplexing in a substantial way until recently there's not reason to include that capability, since it wouldn't be used except in edge cases.</p></div>		</li>
