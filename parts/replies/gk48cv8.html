<p>Pink eye <em>is</em> caused by fecal particles, but usually it's fecal particles on your hands if you don't wash after using the toilet. If a fart contains flecks of feces it's theoretically possible that the fart could give someone pink eye, but super unlikely. Your kid would probably have to straight up raw dog a shart on the other's pillow to give them pink eye.</p></div>		</li>
