<p>This of course is an absolutely tiny difference, but it is a difference.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I can't believe I just didn't think about that ... I am so used to gravity calculation on school level that I can't just approach those equations with an open mind.</p>
<p>Or at least could not - maybe this has changed now because of you! Thanks so much again!</p></div>		</li>
