<p>The environment is so harsh that at points, the sperm cells that touch it and die are physically protecting the ones that are still alive. </p>
<p>They're swimming through a passage of corpses made from their dead brethren which are acting as shields from the horrible environment of death that they have to pass through to reach the egg.</p>
<p>It's like you have a million Sams just jumping into the lava of Mount Doom to build a Sam-cadaver bridge for Frodo to walk across.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So, it's basically Attack on Titan's Opening 5. But with sperm. And a Sam-cadaver bridge.</p></div>		</li>

This is a documentary my biology teacher showed us called &quot;The great sperm race.&quot; that talks about the difficulties a sperm faces when traveling to the egg. It's an hour long, and the top comments pretty much sum up what the documentary says, but everything is reanacted by people dressed in white playing the sperm, and as zombies so that's pretty fucking great</p></div>		</li>
