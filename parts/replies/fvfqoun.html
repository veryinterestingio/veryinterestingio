			<div class="markdown"><p>True indeed, but some subset of analog stuff will be lost forever if it isn’t digitized for the sake of preservation. </p>
<p>It’s a bit of give and take.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that is true, but analog kind of gets fetishized in audio circles. I have a very nice guitar setup with a Laney Ironheart tube amp and 4x12&quot; cabinet which sounds great. I also have a great jackd+guitarix desktop setup which also sounds great. There are subtle differences in the playing feel, where analog feels slightly better to me, but just listening to both its hard for me pick favorites. Both sound very good with the correct dialing in. Just try saying that around your typical enthusast though...ooof, that will start a war. </p>
<p>Thing is, I don't want a &quot;warm&quot; analog tone, or any other opinionated tone, I want a neutral tone, and I'll equalize it myself, thank you very much!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me it's not tone. It's full control(from an audio techs point of view.) I'd much rather work on a 120 channel Gohst brand studio board more than a 120 channel  multi-page digital, just for the simple fact everything is at my fingertips and I can physically touch each control point. Like having a manual instead of an automatic in your car. On the flip side though, I'd much rather have a digital DJ console over vinyl so I guess it just depends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, &quot;no pixels&quot; isn't exactly accurate, there is grain which doesn't have a specific size or shape. There's some debate on equivalents, but it's in the ballpark of 25MP on low ISO 35mm film, and of course more for larger film formats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Distortion is a huge catch-all term. The lens causes <em>geometric</em> distortion, but other forms of distortion are present on pretty much anything. For example, a non-linear audio recording/transmission medium may cause <em>harmonic</em> distortion, where tones appear in your audio signal that were not there in the original. What the poster you are responding to is probably referring to are spatial aliasing, quantization error and clipping (of which I would only really consider the latter a form of distortion, the same as harmonic distortion that is), which often are specific to, or at least more noticable in, digital formats, particularly less advanced ones. But film has its own kinds of reproduction limits, like grain or sensitivity curves.</p></div>		</li>
