			<div class="markdown"><p>In college, I used to blow glass and we had occasionally some recycled glass to practice on, it was terrible and useless and required so many chemicals to get it to be plastic again. </p>
<p>When I lived in Moab, they had color sorting set up as a social experiment to see if people did it or not. It all was ground up and use to cover the landfill. </p>

<p>Plastic breaks down and can't be just melted and made into another bottle. Most of it goes into carpeting.  Which hey, we have a constant and huge supply of the base material (crude oil) and carpeting is nice.</p>
<p>Glass is too heavy to ship to glassworks, and sand is too cheap. It costs more to move than you gain from recycling.</p>
<p>Aluminum is absolutely 100% as efficient and recyclable as Captain Planet lead us to believe in the 90's. The stuff is great. </p>
<p>Cardboard is currently the money-maker for recyclers. (or it was a year or two ago).</p></div>		</li>
