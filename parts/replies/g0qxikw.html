<p>There are other diseases of &quot;molecular mimicry,&quot; but these are the most clear-cut examples.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  I did not intend to imply otherwise.  You examples are well demonstrated cases of known links.</p>
<p>There's a lot of autoimmune (and other) chronic disease that is probably caused by an unknown (or incompletely characterised) infectious environmental factor.</p>
<p>The edit was a response to an up-swelling of people suggesting RA, CFS, or other incompletely understood processes were caused by a specific illness they had.  There is a strong history of people/professions locking into what seem to be correct causal links that turn out to be very wrong.  Some of the less well characterised links we think we know will turn out to be false/minor.  I could have worded it better but will be leaving it as is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert, but- I think what matters with diseases of molecular mimicry is that, when your body finds a convenient protein to attack and &quot;latch on&quot; to the undesirable organisms, that it be unique. This isn't that tough- the target (epitope) can have a vast array of different configurations.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, in some individuals (mainly those with a human leukocyte antigen called HLA-B27), there is an uncomfortable similarity between the bacterial epitope and proteins that are &quot;native&quot; to the human body. So when the &quot;killer&quot; cells from the immune system set out, they are &quot;mis-tuned&quot; for human cells, too. The fit might not be all that perfect, but it works, so now there's autoimmune attack.</p>
<p>That salmonella, shigella, and campylobacter happen to share the same epitope isn't all that weird; they're kinda closely related; that group A strep and chlamydia <em>also</em> sometimes share that- I don't know how closely related they are, or if it's just some grand coincidence among bacteria, sorry.</p>
<p>Anyway, look up coxsackie virus and diabetes. The immune system targets the virus (which is surprisingly common in kids), and- whoops, now your body attacks its own Islets of Langerhans cells, which produce insulin. The result is type 1 diabetes for life.</p>
<p>This also seems related to specific HLAs (HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, and HLA-DRB). Look at HLAs as a &quot;blood type&quot; for white blood cells, but instead of A, B, AB, and O (with Rh +/-), it's a much wider array of HLAs. Some of these seem closely tied to certain diseases, and autoimmune diseases in particular.</p>
<p>In some rare instances, it seems possible to combat the autoimmune attack of the Islet cells, and reverse type 1 diabetes. Some day, maybe we'll fix this with a transplant, or through some sort of &quot;ablation&quot; of the immune system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Between Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter?</p>
<p>Not too much in terms of the diarrheal illness they cause. You can expect diarrhea (sometimes bloody), stomach cramping, and fever from all three, but the other possible symptoms/downstream effects can be different. </p>
<p>All can cause a reactive arthritis, but campylobacter is also known to cause <a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Guillain-Barr%C3%A9-Syndrome-Fact-Sheet" target="_blank">motor axonal neuropathy or GBS</a>.</p>
<p>They can cause other illnesses as well, for instance salmonella is a well known cause of osteomyelitis in sickle cell persons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lure of these findings has also led to major fuckups. XMRV was thought to cause chronic fatigue syndrome, but it turned out to be a bunch of bad logic built on a laboratory virus. Add in some bad PCR protocols and bad antibodies. It took many labs a lot of time to debunk that one, and many people suffering from the disease were given a false sense of hope.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, the XMRV hypothesis is one I only know about because of that Plandemic video that got passed around.  I did research on Dr Mikovits and found out about the theory on XMRV through her work, which, as you said, was debunked for a few reasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was at the Retroviruses meeting when the virus was first presented. All the retrovirologists were excited (including myself) because it was a new virus you could work on. Of course, once everyone starting working on it, the problems began to arise.</p></div>		</li>
