<p>You can put in a hex code and it will list similar paints from various paint brands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Paint stores often mess up 'gloss' and 'flat' for me (not just one, but three) - despite providing an actual sample I scraped directly off of one of my walls.<br />
Be wary of that as well, OP.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but also no.
Each paint manufacturer (Behr, Sherwin Williams, Benjamin Moore...) Mind you I said manufacturer not brand...
Has their own pigments and base stocks.
The retailer has a seperate mixing system and database for each line they carry and a spectrometer that will read a sample into that paints data.</p>
<p>Sometimes a color can be mixed close enough to &quot;match&quot; in multiple paint lines and some colors simply cannot. Some paint stores (or employees) will be willing to try stuff the systems don't list or say don't work with varying results. </p>
<p>Most paint counters are computerized with the color mixing so colors are much more repeatable and consistent than the old hand shot units.</p></div>		</li>
