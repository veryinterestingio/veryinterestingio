			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I’ve been waiting to see the answer that includes the fact that when the magnetic force of a permanent magnet does work, that energy is removed from the potential energy. After doing enough work it will lose its magnetism. Just like a paper clip that sits in a uniform magnetic field long enough will become magnetic itself, but that energy is quickly lost. Permanent magnets just store much more energy, and required much more energy to be naturally or synthetically created.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, eventually. Transfer of energy from one form to another is usually not 100% efficient. Like if you pick a bouncy ball off the floor and drop it, it will bounce slightly less high every time and will eventually sit on the floor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, was annoyed I had to scroll past a few incorrect answers to get here.</p>
<p>You don't create the energy when you pull a magnet apart from the paper clip.  The paper clip doesn't start out magnetized, and the magnet doesn't start out with a paper clip attached, so the first time they are brought together the energy would not exist (if pulling them apart were it's source).</p>
<p>Also, while forces can exist without expending energy, the moment they are used to move an object, energy must be exchanged. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer, for the first time I stopped seeing magnets as some magical thing and instead realized the energy to do their work came from somewhere and is not infinite. Thanks!</p>
<p>Could you also explain to someone who always struggled with chemistry and physics: how does the proper alignment of electric poles actually exert a force on a separate object? Its a field right? It propagates at c? I know the word, but it makes no sense to me. I can imagine light particles bouncing off surfaces no problem, but wtf is a field</p>
<p>In other words is it known how electromagnetism works? How can it do work over distance without physicsl contact? Or do we use the word field as a placeholder we dont fully understand?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ultimately the term &quot;field&quot; is simply a mathematical construct. The best way to explain what we mean by &quot;field&quot; is that it is a number value associated with points in space. Imagine that you had a balloon inside of a box, and you drew a dot on the balloon's surface. If you inflate the balloon enough, the dot eventually touches the edge of the box. But if you deflate the balloon, the dot moves away from the box and towards the center of the space that it encloses. If you know the rate at which the balloon inflates and deflates, you can describe the velocity of the dot as it moves from the edge of the box towards the very central point of the volume that the box encloses. In mathematics, we would call the combination of the position of the dot and the direction in which it is moving as you inflate/deflate the balloon a vector. Fields, then, are basically the sum total of the entire surface of this balloon - the sum total of all the possible vectors (technically fields can keep track of vectors, spinors, tensors, and scalars, but let's just focus on vectors since that is the most &quot;everyday&quot; form of a field),  that could be formed if one were to go around the surface of the balloon leaving dots. </p>
<p>An electromagnetic field, then, describes the relative path that a charged particle would take if it were to enter the volume of the field. An important aspect of this is that particles with like charges will repel each other, and particles with opposite charges attract each other. That is why two magnets can either push or pull each other depending on what side faces the other - if the two &quot;north&quot; poles are facing each other, they repel, but if a &quot;north&quot; and a &quot;south&quot; pole face each other, they attract. So if you were a charged electron, that is, a particle with a net negative charge, and you found yourself under the influence of a magnetic field, you would experience momentum towards the positive side of the field. All a field really is is a way to describe the motion of this charge over a volume of space. The field itself actually doesn't move - it is the particle that moves. Fields actually &quot;propagate&quot; instantaneously - if a magnetic field were to form, any particle no matter how far away from the center of the field would be affected by the field at the same instance of time, with one caveat - many physical fields, including the electromagnetic field, are subject to Gauss's law and are inversely proportional with distance from the source (in other words, with every gain in distance the field's effect is reduced by a square of it's initial strength. Going back to our balloon, imagine drawing a group of 5 dots on the skin of the balloon when it is deflated, and then inflating the balloon. Those dots started out close together, but quickly spread out as the balloon inflates. If you measured the size of the balloon you would find that the distance between each dot increases at a rate that is squared the increase of the radius of the balloon itself - a demonstration of Gauss's Law).</p>
<p>As for why the particle actually moves, you have to take a quick dip into quantum field theory. To keep it short, &quot;particles&quot; are not really solid things at all - they are more like a swarm of tiny insects. If you imagine a cloud of no-see-ums or other tiny bloodsuckers, you have a general idea of the shape of that cloud - but that cloud isn't really a solid thing, despite being able to describe it as a &quot;ball&quot; in shape. &quot;Particles&quot; are the same way - discrete packets of energy buzzing around in a mostly spherical shape. Now if you took a flyswatter to the insect swarm you might get lucky and manage to swat a few of the pests, but the cloud is largely just empty space, and you are also just as likely to miss hitting any insect. You are, however, more likely to hit an insect with the swatter if you aim at the dead center of the swarm, where the insects are packed closer together, rather than at its edge. Particles work the same way - they are clouds of probabilities, but have no definite hard edges. The closer you get to the center of the particle, the more likely you are to hit it, but if you move further away from the center the odds of a collision decrease. </p>
<p>There is a difference between a particle and a cloud of biting insects, however. Energy cannot simply exist everywhere; it has to exist in discrete zones, and two particles cannot share the same exact space (this is the Pauli Exclusion Principle…and the math behind it is a bit advanced to explain with fun anecdotes I’m afraid). This phenomenon is what quantum physics is named after - the idea that energy must exist in distinct packets or quantities called quantum, and that no two quantum can occupy the same exact point in space.
Now imagine that we have two insect swarms, and that if an insect inside the swarm were to bump into one from the enemy swarm, they would both die. As they move closer together, the edges of the swarm have very little insects and so the insects have enough space to avoid each other and can live. But as the swarms are squeezed closer and closer together, more and more insects start to hit each other, until finally the center of each swarm is nearly touching and insects are constantly smashing each other. Since the insect swarms are desperate to separate and avoid all this carnage, it takes an outside effort to hold them this close together – perhaps a small child has captured them both inside of a bottle. Now, instead of forcing the swarms together and getting destroyed, we open that jar and let them move however they like, but start them off so that their centers are almost touching. The insects, not wanting to smack into the other swarm, start to move further and further apart, and the further apart they are the less likely they are to hit one another. Charged particles are a bit like that in a magnetic field – they move away from the areas where the magnetic field lines are densest, and towards areas where the lines are less dense. They do this because they cannot exist in the same space as the origin of the magnetic field (because that is simply a property of our universe), and the odds of them overlapping gets further and further reduced the more distance that they have between them and the origin of the magnetic field. It really is all about probability – the charged particle is simply more likely to exist further away from the magnetic pole with a similar charge, and so it does exist further away from that pole.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, that is just about as far as we have gotten with our understanding of the universe. There are still some fundamental questions about the primary forces that we are unable to really answer with our current mathematical models. And a big one is the nature of fields – for example, we do not really know why some fields can both repel and attract and others only attract. Magnetic monopoles (magnets with a single pole) should exist in nature – the math says that they are there – yet only magnetic dipoles, with a positive and negative end, have been observed. And we have no idea why. That is part of the fun though – there are still mysteries out there that need solving!</p></div>		</li>
