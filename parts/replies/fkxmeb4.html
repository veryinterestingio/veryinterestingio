			<div class="markdown"><p>They aren't readily available because regulating fecal transplants is a nightmare. You have to know what in the poop is beneficial and what is harmful, and develop criteria to make sure all the transplants are as beneficial and safe as possible. We are pretty far away from knowing any of that, so it's only being used in specialized life-threatening cases like C. diff where the risk is deemed acceptable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep... appendixes do have a use, but it’s still thought that the bacteria they act as a reservoir too is primarily meant to aid the digestion and combat of bacteria from things most humans don’t have in their diet any more.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, so you're up on it!  So sorry you had to be in hospital now, of all times.  Folks saying the appendix can somehow shield its microbiome from abx must think it has its own little blood supply somehow...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it’s more that it’s just a little tail that’s out of the normal passage of food.  So diarrhea, for instance, doesn’t clear it out.  We certainly haven’t evolved an organ to help us minimize antibiotic side effects in the 100 years or so they’ve been around.  It’s lucky side effect if anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm really curious about this. Had mine out as a young kid and now at 30 I struggle with depression/gastrointestinal issues. I never drew the correlation until recently hearing about the appendix possibly playing a role in gut bacteria.</p>
<p>I really do wonder if it's been the cause of at least part of my issues. The only other person I've known to have their appendix removed when they were young has near identical symptoms to me, but obviously that's nowhere near enough evidence. Still makes me wonder though. </p>
<p>Guess it doesn't matter though, it was get it removed or die. I think I will start incorporating as much fermented food into my diet as possible, can't hurt I suppose, although I've seen plenty of reports that it most likely will barely help the problem, if there is one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. Your gut microbiome does a lot of heavy lifting when it comes to digestion. It’s also part of why if you rapidly switch to a diet of fast food from a “healthy” diet (and vice versa) you get indigestion because your gut biota change in composition to deal with your typical diet.</p></div>		</li>
