			<div class="markdown"><p>Has there ever been any speculation on the evolutionary purpose or medical benefit of a bladder versus just kind of leaking through and routing the kidneys straight out?  Just to avoid the ability of predators to track?</p>
<p>You could easily see a purpose to a bladder if you could absorb clean water back, but since you can't ...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are, quiet literally, continuously making urine. Therefore, without a bladder, you would CONSTANTLY be leaking urine. I can see that as impractical from a hygienic aspect as well as a predator/prey aspect. The role of the kidneys is to mechanically filter the blood and reabsorb water and manage electrolyte homeostasis. Adding that function to the bladder is redundant. Furthermore, urine has metabolites that are irritating and/or toxic, so youâ€™d need another filtering mechanism in the wall of the bladder. As far as I know no one has questioned the evolutionary benefit of having a bladder. Furthermore, other animals have much more efficient kidneys (like cats), or excrete nitrogenous wastes (like urea/uric acid) as solids (like birds).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add the fun fact, a key test in a kidney transplant is checking the kidney for signs of life; circulation and especially urine production. You can literally see it drip out of the ureter after attaching the major blood vessels, and before it's attached, if the kidney manages to start production immediately, which it often does if it's from a live donor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's an article that briefly discusses the evolution of the bladder.  As a soft organ, it's not going to be preserved in fossils very well, but looking at living animals, it appears in all mammals, no birds, some reptiles (turtles and some lizards but not snakes or crocodilians), and in amphibians.  Fish have one, but it's different: it appears that the bladder evolved at least twice through convergent evolution.</p>
<p>According to this article, in contrast to what /u/baloo_the_bear says, at least some animals do have water-permeable bladders, and use them to maintain liquid balance.  The article is vague on whether that's true for mammals, though it speculates that since mammals are the only vertebrates that produce super-concentrated pee, it might not be.</p>
