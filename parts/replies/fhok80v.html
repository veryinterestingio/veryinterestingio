<p>Say, they drop out of the presidential race, but have funds saved, can they use them to run for governor? Are there strings attached?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Candidates can transfer funds to a campaign for one office to another. It's quite common when a candidate seeks higher office. The only exception is for a candidate who is running for 2 offices at the same time. So for example, a member of the House of Representatives who is running for reelection and running for president at the same time can't transfer funds between the 2 campaigns, but they can transfer funds if they decline to run for reelection in the house, or if they want to run for president in the next election cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can not transfer funds from a Federal Election to a State/Local Election or vice versa. Someone quite recently got in trouble for this as they transferred money left in their state account to their federal. Can't remember who exactly pretty sure it was a woman though.</p>
<p>This is because funds for federal office are audited/governed by the Federal Election Commission.</p>

<p>The one thing that's not allowed is for the candidate to keep the money for personal use.</p>

<p>Directly.</p>
<p>However, IIRC:</p>
<p>A candidate can loan their campaign money. But they can also charge interest on that loan. A lot of interest. So someone in it for the money could loan their campaign a bunch of money at a huge interest rate and then only get paid back very slowly. Over years or decades this could amount to a lot of money.</p></div>		</li>
