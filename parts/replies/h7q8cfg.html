<p>As a huge science nerd I like all his videos but even of you don't generally find science videos interesting he has a series of cooking/food videos that are really cool.</p></div>		</li>

I also noticed that sodium bicarbonate (Baking soda) is in them, and so they might also have some weak acid to make some flavors a bit sour and so that the acid reacts with the sodium bicarbonate to make even more co2 and make the candy even fizzier.</p></div>		</li>
