			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of good stuff in here, but humans can most definitely withstand at least temporary core temp variations of 1 degree C without “serious problems or death” (ie fever, mild hypothermia.) Also interesting to see the new study which shows the average adult body temperature may actually be 97.5F (36.3 C)!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting related fact is Aboriginal Australians have a beneficial genetic mutation that lets them raise their core body temperature safely and just run hotter when appropriate without the deleterious effects of a fever. In addition to just being more efficient when it's hot out, it greatly increases their resistance to childhood diseases, as they can just raise their body temp to kill off bacteria without inducing the damaging effects of a fever or the higher metabolic requirements they usually take.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on a point someone else made. Humans on average have a core temp of 37C but actually can be a degree lower naturally. The lowest your body can tolerate is approx 34C and the highest 42C. After 42C your enzymes will denature and basically be useless and it’s a permanent change. That’s why you die from hyperthermia. The ability of the human body to increase or decrease temperature by a degree is actually crucial to survival as it will kill off bacterial infections. So yes the human body can tolerate a change of more than one degree but it is a very limited change</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mine is nearly always a cool 36 even. It's one of my cool party tricks that always makes nurses think they're getting incorrect readings. That, and they can never find a pulse in my left hand... I wish I knew more about the cause for these variations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ICU nurse here and I totally agree with your hyperthermia point. I believe that hypothermia is more fluid though, in certain patients after cardiac arrest there are protocols that call for the patient to be put into a therapeutic hypothermia. Core  body temp is dropped to 33 C for 24 hours unless another arrest happens within the 24 hours,which then resets the 24hr period. When patient is rewarmed, it is done at a max  rate of 0.3C/ hr. This is mainly for patients that do not respond to anything after ROSC, or return of spontaneous circulation, to try to improve rates of long-term neurologically intact survival.</p></div>		</li>
