			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people will have felt heart break in their life, but that does not mean they have Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.  The cause of seems to go back, in part, to the hormones of our fight-or-flight system.  I would bet those hormones play a part in why feel the way we do during heartbreak, along with another stress hormone, cortisol.  I am suggesting all of these as things as part of what is going on outside the brain,  The brainit own thing going on with these same catecholamies, along with a cousin dopamine and and oxytocin.  All of those can have modulating effects on places responsible for modulating pain, such as the gray matter around a little aquaduct apply named the  Periaqueductal gray (PAG).  All just a guess, though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve lived with a damaged, weak heart for 15 years now. The doctors never found the exact cause of the arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy, but I was going through a really traumatic breakup over the course of 3 months. The doctor suspected the breakup, and mentioned Takotsubo and the constant rush of adrenaline going through my heart. I’ll always wonder if that was indeed the catalyst.</p></div>		</li>
