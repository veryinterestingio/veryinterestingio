<p>You need a utilities bill, a driving licence/passport and maybe a council tax bill.</p>
<p>Without all 3 you will struggle because anywhere you go you are asked for them all. So if you are missing even one you will have to jump through a lot of hurdles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not as bad as that, it is certainly possible, but you are correct about the jumping through hoops part. Most places that actually deal with helping homeless people are very clued up and know what to do, but it usually takes time, and can be frustrating as fuck for everyone involved.</p>
<p>The main things you need if you are a UK citizen with zero ID and no fixed abode are a tenancy agreement, usually from the charity that homes you (easy), a copy of your Birth Certificate (easy), an official letter from a council being aware of said tenancy agreement, (harder), confirmation you are on the electoral roll (fairly easy after some time) then a NI number. (Hardest one). It takes time but the other things tend to fall into place after that. (Worked for a homeless/addiction charity a good few years back).</p></div>		</li>
