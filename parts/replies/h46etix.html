			<div class="markdown"><p>Just fyi: it wouldn't float into the sun unless you were on an intercept trajectory. If you were in orbit around earth when you disposed of an inconvenient corpse, most likely it would eventually re-enter the atmosphere and burn up unless you were far out there. If you ditched it on your way to Mars, it would have its own solar orbit and would likely drift forever.</p>
<p>It's actually pretty difficult to get to the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wrt the ditched body en route to mars,  wouldnâ€™t the potential of entering the gravity well of a celestial body aside from the sun be potentially more likely than drifting into the sun or being effected by its gravity well?</p></div>		</li>
