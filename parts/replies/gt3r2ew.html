<p>Key word there is “most”. Many cheaper ones don’t and some computer programs may prevent it from going to sleep. I use a rotating slideshow for my desktop background which flips every few minutes and eliminates the need for screensavers or the sleep function but a screensaver would work just as well.</p></div>		</li>
