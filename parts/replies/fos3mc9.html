			<div class="markdown"><p>For the sqrt(2) to be rational, there must exist positive integers x and y such that:</p>
<pre><code>2 = (x/y)^2</code></pre>
<p>Furthermore, x/y must be an irreducible fraction; that is, they must not share a common factor. (This does not reduce the generality of the proof at all; if you have two numbers x' and y' which do share a common factor z, let x = x'/z and y = y'/z and continue with the proof.)</p>
<p>By simple algebra, we can rearrange that equation as:</p>
<pre><code>2 y^2 = x^2</code></pre>
<p>Now, a number is odd if and only if its square is odd, and likewise a number is even if and only if its square is even. This should be obvious when you consider that an odd number times an and odd number is also odd, and ditto for even.</p>
<p>The equation shows that x^2 is two times some other number (y^2, but that's not important), therefore x^2 is even, therefore x is also even.</p>
<p>What about y? Since x is even, we can write is as 2n. Therefore we have</p>
<pre><code>x^2 = (2n)^2 = 4 n^2</code></pre>
<p>Substituting back into the above equation, we have:</p>
<pre><code>2 y^2 = 4 n^2</code></pre>
<p>Divide both sides by 2 to get:</p>
<pre><code>y^2 = 2 n^2</code></pre>
<p>Therefore y is also two times another integer (n^2 in particular) so y is also even.</p>
<p>Therefore we have x is even, and y is even. But x and y were supposed to have no common factors, yet we proved that 2 is a common factor!</p>
<p>Tracing our logic back, we find that the only unwarranted assumption we made what that integers x and y existed in the first place. Therefore, no such pair of integers exist such that 2 = (x/y)^2. That is to say, the square root of 2 is not rational.</p>
<p>Euclid gives essentially this same proof (using Geometry instead of algebra, but using the same even/odd contradiction) in Volume III of his Elements. The Pythagorean's were supposed to have known that sqrt(2) was irrational several centuries earlier, but it is not known if they used this proof or another. </p>
<p>Showing pi is transcendental is much harder. I'm not aware of any elementary proof.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just have to say, I am not what I would consider to be a Math person at all, but I thoroughly enjoyed the way you wrote this up! Thank you for sharing. </p>
<p>Maybe I need to give math a second chance :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A huge part of our collective mathematical illiteracy is that there are so many bad math teachers, driving many away from even trying to understand it.</p>
<p>Most people go their whole life without having even 1 good math teacher, and our society bears that unsavory fruit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You really should. If you enjoyed that maybe you are a math person after all.</p>
<p>Math shouldn’t be about computation, it should be about reasoning like here. It’s even more rewarding to come up with that reasoning on your own than it is to read someone else’s (though both are fun).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great proof, and it is the poster child of 'proof by contradiction.'  This and the demonstration that there must be infinitely many primes.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took Methods of Proof in college (great class, lots of fun - professor, eh, not so great) and what you just did here was fantastic. When I tell people that it was one of the most enjoyable classes I took in college they look at me like I strangled a baby.</p>
<p>I'm going to save this explanation to show the next person I tell. Math + logic + creative thinking/problem solving = fun. </p>
<p>Cheers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I failed my first abstract algebra exam and had a huge crisis of confidence as I was trying to major in math. I asked the professor if I was in over my head and he basically yelled at me for not trying hard enough while reassuring me that no professor in the department thought I wasn't capable. That was a very important conversation for me because after that I tried much harder, studied for every test, passed that class and went on to complete my major.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I remember a fairly straightforward proof by contradiction in my abstract math textbook, but I no longer have it and I don't see it on the wikipedia page. I think it was similar to the proof by infinite descent but its been years.</p>
