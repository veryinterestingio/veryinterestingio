			<div class="markdown"><p>This does depend on the engine. On modern high bypass commercial turbofans the majority of the power from  the gas generating fuel burning part of the engine (the core) is employed in turning a final turbine stage, which powers the big fan at the front, which in turn generates most of the thrust (~70%). Most of the air going through one of these engines just goes straight through the fan, through the bypass duct and out the back of the engine, without ever seeing fuel or fire.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tried to explain this on a different thread and I was flamed, the C5 engine produces more thrust from the bypass ducts in a ratio of 8:1. A non zero but far smaller amount of thrust is the expanding gases from combustion, but every time people look it up they are given the explanation true for turbojets that haven't been used in decades.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the odd military jet still uses them but I think the vast majority use low bypass turbofans nowadays, and an afterburner to give a bit of kickdown when required.</p>
<p>About the most recent commercial jet I know of that used true turbojet engines with no fan or bypass was Concorde, and its rapidly  closing on twenty years since they were grounded.</p></div>		</li>
