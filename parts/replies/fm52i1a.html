			<div class="markdown"><p>So they are air breathers long before they fully emerge as frogs. Interesting stuff! However I still wonder if the initial transformation, while still tadpoles, occurs discretely as a sudden water-no/air-yes event or do they do both for a while...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Air and water breathing occur in different parts of the body, so it's very likely they occur simultaneously (I would say it's true for certain, if I had any actual sources).  Oxygen from the water is absorbed through gills and skin, from the air through lungs and skin.  You can run gills and lungs at the same time, more than a few fish can do this.</p></div>		</li>
