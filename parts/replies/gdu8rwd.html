			<div class="markdown"><p>You bring up a point I wonder about (unrelated). In the US, language is moving towards gender neutrality, e.g. waitress =&gt; wait-person, mailman =&gt; mail-person. I can't imagine it's unique to the US, so I wonder what happens with languages that tend to have male/feminine forms of words.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is hard to answer. A lot of people want to make a point about feminism and inclusive language in French and some points are valid...</p>
<p>But contrary to English French has no neutral &quot;it&quot; equivalent. Even the plural form are gendered.</p>
<p>Also all noun have a gender chair (chaise) is feminine and so are testicules ... It is a grammatical gender and is most often totally discociated from sexual gender consideration so when you push on the conversation there... It becomes stupid sounding grammatical gender is as close to sexuality as plural is</p>
<p>Still the rule that says that if there is 1 masculine word in a group, the plural will be masculine is ridiculous and needs to change.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You have a few dozen irregular verbs that won't end nicely with -ed but you can list them all on a page and the weirdness stops there</p>

<p>Wait, as a native English speaker...what are these?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up irregular verbs. Instead of the standard </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I look -&gt; I looked - I have looked</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Irregular verbs can be like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I go -&gt; I went -&gt; I have gone</p>
<p>I hide -&gt; I hid -&gt; I have hidden</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no consistent rule, you just have to know each one by heart. You can look up a complete list online. I'm surprised they weren't covered in class in your school.</p></div>		</li>
