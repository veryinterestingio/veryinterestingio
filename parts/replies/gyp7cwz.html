			<div class="markdown"><p>The best experiment ever is giving free alcohol drinks to people and see them loose their shit because they are &quot;drunk&quot; and just casually say they have been drinking alcohol free drinks some keep up with the act because most likely feel embarrassed and don't believe it others just snap out of it.</p>
<p>Now if when I was almost in a alcoholic coma someone told me it was just orange juice i would just behaved normally...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That happened to my neighbor in high school when he threw a party. They raided his parents' basement fridge which had a lot of beer in it. Supposedly they got &quot;shit-faced,&quot; but when his parents found out (he did get in trouble) they cracked up because all that beer was non-alcoholic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds like one of those stories that kids tell either other, who has a fridge with enough alcohol free beer to get a party of kids to think they are drunk?</p>
<p>What kid hasnt looked at the % of alcohol in the beer they are drinking for that matter?</p>
<p>The strength of the drink you were drinking was something to brag about when i was in high school</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A more interesting experiment could be to serve people alcoholic drinks and then lie convincingly to tell them they have been served non-alcoholic drinks. Then observe their behavior, physical coordination, speech, etc.</p>
<p>Edit: For clarification, I intended this to be as u/parad0xchild said below: Subjects order alcohol, researchers serve alcohol, subjects have enough to feel the effects, researchers lie to subjects saying they didn't serve alcohol, then observe. Sorry for the confusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took part in a study where the participants were asked to do different tasks before and after being served either alcohol or placebo. </p>
<p>It was absolutely not enough alcohol to get very drunk, but just (around) the amount for a slightly noticeable effect. </p>
<p>I thought that it was quite difficult to tell which group I was part of. After the test was performed I spoke to a few of the other participants, they were also unsure which group they had been in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went to a party once in college, and the guy serving drinks told me “Be careful, this is 30% hard alcohol.” It was like a gin lemonade, and I thought he meant “Of the liquid in this cup, 30% is liquor and 70% is non-alcoholic mixture.” So I drank a fair amount!</p>
<p>Turns out he meant all of the liquid in the cup was liquor, 30% ABV. I distinctly remember thinking “why do I feel so drunk?”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had a couple years where my depressed ass couldn't handle any alcohol, so I played &quot;get pretend drunk&quot; at parties to take the edge off being the only sober friend. It worked decently well depending on my headspace, I could still unwind and let loose a bit by basically pretending I was drinking and tricking myself into a have fun/lower inhibition mindset. Definitely not quite the same but mindset is a huge part of social drinking</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can administer heroin/cocain to a rat and increase its dose over time. The rat can then be exposed to fatal levels of the drug but survive if it is in an environment it's similar to such as it's home cage. </p>
<p>Move the rat to a new (e: un-)familiar environment and the effects can be hugely different, even killing the rat.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best way to compare it to a real experience everyone has probably had, think back to teen years when one of your friends had their first alcohol/drug experience with you. The silly ramblings and bizarre behavior that you've never experienced with someone on that substance before, is the kid psychologically intoxicating himself. It's why I hated all intoxicants as a teen. There was always at least one person who acted a damn fool while pretending to not be in control of themselves, after like half a beer or a single hit of weed.</p>
<p>At best they freaked me the fuck out and made me paranoid, at worst they hurt themselves or someone else and ruin the next few weeks while we dealt with having gotten caught.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol. My first few drinks around 13/14 I thought I was wasted after one beer. First hit of weed though? I thought it would be chill but it wrecked me. Almost immediate and genuine freak out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah some people just don't do well their first time. But like, people who are freaking out are usually sitting quietly or talking about why they're freaking out. Fidgeting, maybe walking around in a panic.</p>
<p>But Some people would stand up and start yelling and running around and doing ridiculous stuff as soon as they felt funny because they thought they were going to lose control of themselves because of whatever propaganda they had heard</p></div>		</li>
