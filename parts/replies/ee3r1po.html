			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a bit more on atoms as opposed to molecules. Atoms are definitely not bland, the noble gases are some of the most inert elements on the table and a vast majority stay true to just remaining as atoms. The reasons as to why that is is really interesting and worth learning if you're interested but the larger elements of the group can behave differently. Xenon for example can react with other atoms as it can exhibit hypervalency and form a compound called Xenon hexafluoride.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Crystals are not what you call of as bonds in chemistry.</p>
<p>While there is some amount of energy binding stuff together in a crystal, it's not due to what is called a bond.</p>
<p>Basically when you create a crystal, you are pacing the element or molecule into order.</p>
<p>Like you can place Lego pieces on the floor in a nice pattern, or you can just put them in there randomly.</p>
<p>Thus you can just cool Xenon down to about -100Â°C and it'll form a crystalline solid.</p>
<p>The real difference between &quot;highschool&quot; noble elements and others is that they don't form bonds, because they have the &quot;best&quot; amount of electrons to be happy.</p>
<p>All other elements will either give away, steal or (sometimes) share electrons. Noble gasses don't have to do that.</p>
<p>In reality it's not that strict. So you can take the larger nobles gas atoms like Xenon, and &quot;force&quot; them to share electrons with fluorine for example and make Xenondifluoride. It's even &quot;stable&quot; as long as you don't put some small amount of energy in it like light or heat, which causes it to decompose.</p>
<p>So with the Lego analogy: Noble gasses are just pieces of plastic.</p>
<p>But if you press them hard enough into other pieces, they'll still stick together. (very simplified).</p>
<p>The ability to form long chains of the same element is called concatenation, and is what makes Carbon so unique.</p></div>		</li>

And it would probably all come from carbon and hydrogen atoms. One of which is basically pencil lead, and the other a gas. So when two such things combine, how do we end up with butter, which has so many complexities? </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That is the fundamental error you're making. Carbon is most definitely not just pencil lead. Hydrogen is not just a gas. The properties of lead and hydrogen gas are already due to complex inter-molecular/atomic interactions; the &quot;simplicity&quot; of lead is more due to its structure rather than it being made out of carbon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's creamy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you take starch and mix it with water, the consistency drastically changes. Afaik, and really don't take my word on this, this isn't even a chemical process; just the mixture itself displays these properties. There are probably better examples, but you should get my point. Two very different materials can display very different properties when mixed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>turns brown when heated</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, but the consistency drastically changes. Heating it already causes a chemical reaction in certain ways. It is already not necessarily the same configuration. Furthermore, changing color simply means different portions of the spectrum get reflected. It changes color, not just because of the underlying material, but also due to the structure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>melts easily</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because of the molecular bonds. Solidity is, to dramatically simplify it, just how strongly atoms are attached to each other. If you consider molecules, it should be clear how different shapes can attach to each other in different ways, more or less strongly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>has good smell and flavor</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't even a special property of butter. This is your senses telling you the precise shape and composition of the butter molecules smells/tastes good. Nothing &quot;objectively&quot; smells or tastes a certain way. Again, here the shape is just as important as the material.</p>
<p>All materials have properties not just due to what atoms they're made of, but the shape in which they fit together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if I'm understanding this correctly, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen themselves are bland, but since they can form complex shapes like a fat molecule, those shapes themselves lend to the characteristic of a fatty substance?</p></div>		</li>
