<p>Try the upper billions for combinations of existing genes.  This doesn't take into account genetic drift (change in the actual base pairs) or crossover elements from influenzas not native to humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look at it this way, there are two proteins used to categorize a flu virus, neuraminidase and hemagglutinin.  N and H.  The genes for these two proteins can be easily swapped around by multiple strains of influenza infecting the same individual.  So scientists categorize them by numbers: H1,2,3.... etc.  N1,2,3.... etc.  </p>
<p>However, these genes aren't static.  They mutate regularly and rapidly.  Essentially, this year's H1 gene isn't the same as last year's or the year before.  The same is true for the N gene.  You simply can't vaccinate against something that mutates that rapidly.  Moreover, influenza has a habit of incorporating genes from other influenzas that <em>don't</em> infect humans, causing viruses like the bird flu to appear.  Vaccinating against flu viruses is, as far as we can tell, not only not practical, it is entirely impossible.  </p>
<p>The same is true for Rinoviruses (common cold).  Just can't cure it because it changes too quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chicken pox is actually kind of weird. We're not sure how long chicken pox immunity lasts. Usually if you get it naturally, you're safe for life. We also think that's true for the vaccine but recently a lot of studies have come out about waning immunity for lots of vaccines. It should last a long time, but no one is quite sure exactly how long that is. Of course the danger with that is that chicken pox is more severe when you're older compared to being a child</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We honestly don't know how long immunity to that vaccine lasts because it's too new. It's only been in use since 1995 and the two dose regimen that they recommend now started in 2006.</p></div>		</li>
