<p>You associate the bed with insomnia and stress which is not with the couch</p>

<p>It could even be more than that. A lot of people spend time in their bedroom doing things other than sleep (and I don't mean sex, the people doing that are not complaining about lack of sleep).</p>
<p>If you lay awake in bed reading or watching TV, or otherwise spend a lot of time in your bedroom, then you are not training yourself to sleep when in bed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once read that your bed is the appropriate place for only two things: sleep and sex. I am in my 60s and I have never had a television in the bedroom, and my late wife preferred to do her reading in the living room (which is also television-free). Plenty of fun times in bed, though.</p></div>		</li>
