			<div class="markdown"><p>The simplest answer is that it would’ve been impossible for J&amp;J vs Moderna/Pfizer to conduct identical trials since new variants emerged between the initiation of the trials. </p>
<p>In the US the onus is on the company to develop the best clinical trial to prove the safety and efficacy of their treatment and the FDA’s job is to make sure that trial design is actually meaningful.</p>
<p>Trials are designed based on a ton of preclinical data and also on the financial risk tolerance of the company. It would be very cumbersome for the FDA to mandate exact clinical trial specifications.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Among other things, this is a global pandemic, and the vaccine companies were testing their vaccines in different countries around the world.</p>
<p>They're also targeting a global set of government decision-making bodies. It's not just the FDA that has to approve this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no &quot;right&quot; answer. All the approaches are perfectly valid. Generally, when setting up a clinical trial that a company hopes to use for FDA consideration, the company will consult with the FDA ahead of time to be sure their protocol will be acceptable. It's not the FDA's job to design or run a company's trials for them, and it shouldn't be.</p></div>		</li>
