			<div class="markdown"><p>For me, I would wake up early after a night out due to dehydration.</p>
<p>Thirst wakes me up and I'd have a pint of water before going to bed and a pint on the bedside table.</p>
<p>Once my sleep has been disrupted early it's hard to properly go back to sleep.</p>
<p>Since it would be on a day off, I'd get up, do something useful and hopefully get the chance to have a nap later.</p></div>		</li>
