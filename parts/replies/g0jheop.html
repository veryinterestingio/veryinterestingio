			<div class="markdown"><p>Then you’ll love this :) when the spider sheds its skin and slides out the back, it has to shed its entire esophagus as well, because it’s attached to it mouthparts. The whole thing has to be slid out carefully since for some reason it has evolved to swallow THROUGH A TINY HOLE IN ITS BRAIN :|</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned this when I was like 9 my family and I went camping. We had a daddy long leg on our clothes line in camp do it. Those suckers are bright red when they first shed. It was pretty cool to watch and up until that point I had no idea spiders did that, and neither did my parents. Its kinda cool when you learn a fact based on live experience rather than second hand knowledge. I don't have many but that is one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also have an awesome family memory involving spiders. My dad didn't know that mud dobbers/mud wasps keep live spiders in their egg nests for their babies to eat when they hatch and my dad kicked such a nest and his foot was covered in different spiders almost instantly. That was the only time I've seen my dad dance lol. </p>
<p>Edit: a few of the spiders were black widows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun I once buddied with a friend to the bathroom while camping and she was like &quot;hey theprincessinsomniac you know about spiders right, is a red hourglass bad&quot; I told her I wasn't sure(a lie so she didn't panic) but that she should avoid touching it. She told me it was in a web in the corner of the stall. Above her head. She finished up quickly and I got her outside. While she was in there I inspected the bathroom and found no less than 20 black widows all over the room. I made her shake out her clothing when we got outside(I did too). I went back to camp and made an out of order sign, then made her walk with me to the counsellors cabins back by the bathroom. They had to close the camp for exterminators the next day and we all had to go home a day early (it was a big girlscout camp facility were troops could come for a long weekend) The thing I couldn't believe was that people had used that facility the whole weekend and nobody noticed. That night was actually the first time I had used it. There were better facilities closer to the mess hall and activities spaces. This was just used by overnight campers staying near it but still. All that and then when we got home and unpacked the van I picked up a plastic tote and felt something squish under my finger under the rim. Dead Black widow, my mom had a freaking cow. I was fine. Nailed it before it could bite me I know I was very close to unlucky though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are talking about cellar spiders. You're talking about either crane flies or harvestmen, neither of which are spiders. </p>
<p>All three animals are routinely called daddy longlegs, causing a lot of confusion to everyone involved (except the critters, who don't give a fuck of course lol).</p></div>		</li>
