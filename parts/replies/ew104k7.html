<p>Becuase there are fewer birds that side.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many years ago at work, a truck driver and I were watching a flock of geese fly over and the driver said to me &quot;When they're in that formation, do you know why one side is always shorter than the other?&quot;</p>
<p>I thought I was going to get some amazing fact of ornithology and migration patterns that few people knew. But nope, he said &quot;'cause there's less geese in it.&quot;</p>
<p>Makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was one of my late father's favorite &quot;dad jokes&quot;. We'd be on some long car trip somewhere in the winter, see birds flying, and he'd break it out. When I was young, I never could remember from year to year that it was a gag, but as I got older, I feigned ignorance just so he could lay the punchline on me.</p></div>		</li>

Even out to 100ft they were getting a 10% improvement. Air resistance is no joke once you start going a decent speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, my dad would do that when he would tow sailboats to races.</p>
<p>Personally, I wouldn't do it normally...I'd rather pay for more gas and drive faster than sit behind a semi for hours on end, but if you are already going to have to drive slower because you are towing, you might as well draft for the fuel economy.</p>
<p>You can even feel/hear the engine working less hard.</p></div>		</li>

Edit: misunderstood the lane line part, makes sense.</p></div>		</li>
