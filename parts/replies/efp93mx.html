			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't the nuclear weapons that are the problem. It's the hundreds of cities burning out of control for weeks or months.</p>
<p>Nuclear fallout also doesn't stay up in the air for all that long. So detonating a couple of bombs a year isn't going to do much damage. Detonating a hundred at once is a totally different story.</p></div>		</li>

<p>From what I've read this is exactly the thing that would cause a nuclear winter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surface tests were in desolate, deserted areas. Sand / dirt doesn't really burn like paper, wood, all the stuff that is in a city. Plus, out in the desert or atolls in the ocean, there's nowhere for a firestorm to begin or spread.</p>
<p>However, a city is a perfect place to generate massive firestorms, which generates massive smoke and particulates, which are shot 50k feet or more into the atmosphere, where they catch winds and jetstreams, then are deposited hundreds, sometimes thousands of miles away.</p>
<p>Think of it as lighting a ball of paper on fire then throwing it in the dirt. It will produce smoke and some ash, but with nothing else to burn, it goes out quickly.</p>
<p>Drop that same burning ball of paper into a garbage dump where it catches oil, wood, rubber, plastic, and a thousand othee things on fire, and it will burn for hours, days, even weeks, and will produce huge clouds of toxic smoke and ash/particulates.</p>
<p>In the above scenarios, plain ball of paper is the testing, while the garbage fire is a metro area (think about how much flammable material is in an entire city). Add in the radioactivity and you can see why it's so lethal. Then multiply it by the 100 nukes in your question, all in different regions spread out and catching the various weather patterns...</p>
<p>Then think about farming. So after a nuclear war, the sky is grey/black from the fallout still floating around, which blocks out the sun, making photosynthesis hard if not impossible. Then add in the fallout that has landed on the fields, which must be removed to a depth of 12-18 inches so it doesn't affect the plants growing in it. But wait, the first time the wind blows upwind from the field, all of the radioactive material that settled there gets deposited into the freshly cleared field. So then you have to remove it again. Then another wind/storm simply deposits more.</p>
<p>There's an extremely complex situation involving hundreds of factors when it comes to nuclear war. On top of that, the lives lost, the major disruptions from mass death (including rotting corpses which are perfect for harboring and spreading many diseases), lack of clean water to sanitize or wash with, the chaos around surviving hospitals, the lack of organized law enforcement, the panic of citizens, and the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>I do love post-nuclear fiction more than all others, but the only story I've read (or movie I've watched) that comes close to the true horrors of the aftermath of a nuclear exchange is &quot;The Road.&quot;</p>
<p>Read up on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to see what a minor exchange does to both the target and the surrounding/downwind areas. Then again, multiply it by both 50x (to get 100 detonations) then multiply it again by the power difference in weapons used against Japan (low yield fission weapons) vs the warheads we have today (Fusion weapons in the 1 megaton to 10 megaton range with multiple MIRV warheads on each ICBM.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Watch the British movie Threads. It’s depressing as hell but gives you an idea of what it would be like to unfortunately survive a nuclear war.
If it’s a bit old for your liking watch the American movie The Day After.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never really thought it out before - but it's not just that there's fires. But in the chaos and devastation after, there would be no one to put them out - so they would burn and burn and burn.</p>
<p>Even without the radiation, I bet the air would be unbreathable for an incredible amount of time in some areas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>-WRONG, IGNORE THIS POST- The surface tests were largely done with deliberately lower yield weapons to test and validate the processes for creating larger weapons.  The weapons in service now are exponentially more powerful and more destructive than most of what's ever actually been been detonated as a test.</p>

<p>EDIT: Apparently 400 hours of Fallout and two bottles of champagne do NOT make me a nuclear physicist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most nukes in service are rather small compared to what was tested. The warheads in the current US arsenal come in between 100 and 500 kT meanwhile the US tested warheads up to 15 MT(Castle Bravo) and the Soviets up to 50 MT(Tsar Bomba)</p>
<p>If you want to double your blast radius you need ~8x more explosive energy so it's more viable to just build a lot of small warheads, plus it's more likely that you'll get some of the dozen 100 kT warheads to Moscow than getting a single 5 MT warhead through</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, turning several city blocks into radioactive dust that gets forced miles into the air isn't the same as detonating a bomb underground. There are videos of the old underground tests, the ground humps up a few dozen feet, then falls back down with little dust at all on the surface.</p></div>		</li>
