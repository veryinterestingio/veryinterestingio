<p>I don't understand that. How is getting a loan &quot;cheaper&quot; than spending your own cash?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have $1000 cash, so you go buy a truckfull of hotdogs from Costco and sell them at the fair for $1200 total. You made $200 on a $1000 investment, or 20% return.</p>
<p>The next year you only have $100. You borrow $900 from your sister, but she charges you $100 interest. Then you buy and sell the hotdogs for the same price as before. You made $100 (that's the $1200 revenue, minus the $900 principal and another $100 in interest) on a $100 investment, or 100% return.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because they put that cash to work for things like investments, acquisitions, loans, etc....  </p>
<p>Think of it this way. If you could make 8% (varies by activity obviously) on your cash by putting it to work for you but get a loan at 2% you would borrow as much as you could.  Then there is the cost of liquidating those investments or the tax implication of repatriating cash from overseas... that's why it's cheaper do borrow than spend their own money.</p>
<p>Many large companies even take out daily loans to finance the next days operations because their cash is tied up. So if those loans aren't available because the credit market freezes up some of the largest companies in the world wouldn't be able to pay their bills. They would have to liquidate investment or repatriate cash, making the market problems even worse.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That and the Reserve Primary Fund 'breaking the buck' were the two most alarming things about that series of events.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm extremely confused by this too. I asked another question that got removed but someone's response was &quot;this gets paid back&quot; but how? Like isn't the government buying up bonds? How does the money get back to the government?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What the federal reserve did was offer 1 trillion worth of &quot;repurchase agreement buybacks&quot;. What this means is anyone holding us government debt (bonds &amp; treasury bill's mostly) can sell those bonds to the government for cash anytime they want but agrees to pay a little more to get those bonds back in maybe a month or next week. </p>
<p>Imagine if you could sell your car tomorrow for $2000 but have to buy it back for $2010 next month. In the meantime, you can use that money to pay rent, electric bill ect. Same concept for companies. They are just trying to make sure everyone can pay the bill's until this blows over</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Fed <strong>buys</strong> a Treasury Bond or other illiquid asset from a bank, say paying $1000, for a bond that will be worth $1200 in another 8 years remaining. The bank gets $1000 cash to lend now to consumers, but doesn’t get to claim the bond’s $1200 because it’s now owned by the Fed. But the bank doesn’t have to pay anything back.</p>
<p>The Fed can either sell the bond to someone again or wait for it to expire and just keep the cash for future operations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the context of the latest Fed announcement of monetary injection into repo markets, the Fed lends out money to primary dealer banks (or PDBs), who then further lends to banks and entities. You can see a list of primary dealers <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/primarydealers" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Repo agreements, or repurchase agreements, are usually akin to short-term loans whose duration spans from overnight to weeks or more. The repo agreement is that the buyer gives a bunch of securities (assets) to the seller for X amount of money, and at the end of the agreement the buyer will pay X+interest amount of money and get their securities back.</p>
<p>As a bank, repo agreements are useful because you can get essentially a quick loan to cover any cash shortfalls without needing to sell off your non-cash assets. These types of situations may arise because banks are legally required to carry a minimum cash reserve by end of day. So you can imagine if a bank has lent out a lot of money and are below the cash reserve requirements by end of day, they can go out and participate in an overnight repo agreement.</p>
<p>Edit: You can see the New York Fed's repo operations <a href="https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/tomo-results-display?SHOWMORE=TRUE&amp;startDate=01/01/2000&amp;enddate=01/01/2000" target="_blank">here</a>. As you can see, the securities that are transferred is for the most part Treasury bills, notes, and bonds.</p></div>		</li>
