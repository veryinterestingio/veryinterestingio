			<div class="markdown"><p>This a a great question- immunotherapy has been quite promising because it basically helps jumpstart the body's natural immune defenses to cancer. Cancer cells evolve to evade the immune system and many immunotherapies mess with the mechanisms that cancer cells use to hide from the immune system. It's still possible for resistance to immunotherapy to evolve though: cancer cells evolve changes in their signaling pathways and other systems that allow them to proliferate anyway. Here's an article that might be interesting to you with more details about this: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7425302/#:~:text=Immunotherapy%20resistance%20is%20classified%20as,respond%20to%20immunotherapy%20(3)" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7425302/#:\~:text=Immunotherapy%20resistance%20is%20classified%20as,respond%20to%20immunotherapy%20(3" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7425302/#:\~:text=Immunotherapy%20resistance%20is%20classified%20as,respond%20to%20immunotherapy%20(3</a>)</a></p></div>		</li>
