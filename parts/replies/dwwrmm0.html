<p>The blades spin through the air, and their angle of attack can be adjusted as they spin.</p>

<p>The key part here.  That's why helicopters are so complicated &amp; require so much maintenance.  That's why it took over 30 years from the first airplane flight to build the first real helicopter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a helicopter mechanic. This is correct except for one thing and he left it out for the sake of explanation. But with gyroscopic procession if rotating clockwise you would increase attack when the blade is forward to get the helicopter to tilt left. He did mention there are other forces at play and I’m sure that’s what he was talking about.</p>
<p>That’s a little more info for ELI5 but figured I’d share.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does that work? Increasing the attack in the right side to tilt the copter left made sense to me. Wouldn't increasing it with the blade at the front of the aircraft simply lift the front more? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you read a little about gyroscopic procession it will help you understand better.  Basically with a rotating mass when an input is put at a certain point you will feel the input 90 degrees in the direction of rotation. Ex. Input for right attack up results in tail raising making you fly forward if rotation of rotor head is clockwise. Here are some good videos.</p>
<p>This one is shortest and I think you will get it just from watching this one.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Conservation of angular momentum means that if you take an object that is standing still without spin, and then it tries to spin in one direction, the rest of the body if it is free to, will spin in the other direction. You can do this yourself with an office chair. If you move your body one direction, your ass will go against that and rotate the other way.  The blade rotates clockwise so the body of the helicopter will rotate counter clockwise, or to the left.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went to a 2 year college for it. You have to have an A&amp;P license (Airframe &amp; Powerplant). IIRC the FAA requires so many hours or some kind of time limit in class before you’re eligible to test for your A&amp;P license or you can work under another A&amp;P mechanic for I think a year then you are eligible to test. Just research how to get an A&amp;P license.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So does that mean that when tilting forward, the blade will rapidly go down when it’s on the back and rapidly tilt back when it spins to the front? Which has to be done in a time frame of 1/50 second? (I recall helis have a rough average of 3000rpm or something?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  It's done through a thing called swashplates.  They are a pair of plates with bearings between them.  The top plate spins and is attached to the rotor blades, while the bottom plate don't spin.  Pushing the bottom plate up or down or changing its angle forces the top (spinning) plate to do the same thing.  The top plate then forces the blades to change their angle of attack as it follows the lower fixed plate around.  It's a bit difficult to explain in a few sentences, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83h6QK-oJ4M" target="_blank">but this is a pretty good animation that shows how it works</a>.</p>
<p>The blades follow a smooth path and gradually change pitch as they move around the circle, they don't suddenly change angle of attack at any point.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. The blades also speed up and slow down as they flap up and down which is called lead-lag. Basically it's like a figure skater, as the rotors flap up and down away from horizontal they speed up. To get into it even more, there are 3 types of rotor systems helicopters can have: rigid, semi-rigid, and fully articulated (not including multi-rotor helicopters like the Chinook or KA-52).</p>
<p>Rigid are the simplest type mechanically, as there are no hinges, the rotors physically bend to flap and lead-lag. The advantages of this are easier maintenance, and you can get some crazy maneuverability (see Red Bulls Bo 105). The disadvantage is the blades are very pricey due to being structurally complex.</p>
<p>Semi-rigid are always a 2 rotor setup (think Huey). The rotors are rigidly attached to the rotor hub and flapping is done by the rotor head physically tilting like a teeter-totter. Lead-lag is the same as a rigid system. One cool thing I always like about semi-rigid systems is the 2 rotors make that classic helicopter <em>thwump-thwump</em>. One disadvantage of semi-rigid systems is you can get what's called 'mast-bumping'. Basically if you push the cyclic forward too quickly causing the blades to flap excessively and making the rotor head hit the rotor mast, not a fun time.</p>
<p>Fully articulated systems are 3 or more blades. The rotors are attached via hinges and the rotors flap and lead-lag using those. Advantages are cheaper blades to replace as they don't have to be as structurally complex as one on a rigid system. Disadvantages are many more moving parts that can require maintenance.</p>
<p>Also, always check your Jesus nut.</p>
