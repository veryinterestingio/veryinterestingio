<p>Therefore based on these conclusions identical twins will be genetically predisposed to same-sex sexual behavior.</p>

<p>That reads as twins are more likely to be engaged with same-sex sexual behavior. When I believe the intention was the research suggest there is some level of genetic predisposition relating to same-sex sexual relations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One perfectly good possibility is that it's mainly due to hormonal or other events in the womb which would account for genetic similarities that affect their shared mother. IOW, maybe some mothers are predisposed to cause gender-related behaviors, which are reflected in their children's genomes, but not caused by them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are, actually. Not that it undermines the whole thing, just suggest heritability is often overestimated. There's :</p>
<p>1) prenatal environment. Sure, <em>after birth</em>, they didn't share environment, but they did for 9 months. Stuff including stress level of their mom, circulating androgens, and others. Epigenetic factors <em>can</em> survive as well. At least some genes called imprinted genes survive the two epigenetic erasures happening early in development. There aren't a lot of these genes (like, ~150 total), but there are some.</p>
<p>2) People are usually adopted into families of similar ethnic background as their biological parents, meaning they share a more than random portion of their environment with their biological parents. </p>
<p>3) Adoptive parents tend to be more educated, wealthier and in better psychological health than the bio parents. Meaning there is a &quot;range restriction&quot; in the sort of environment adopted children get put into. </p>
<p>This is not to be read as &quot;nurture arguments&quot;. The debate is meaningless in the first place, genes don't mean shit without context, and <em>vice versa</em>, so it's always both nature and nurture.</p></div>		</li>

Wouldn't it be an even number if it's made up of identical twins or higher multiplets?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The second study was just a population study comprised of any individuals. The selection process did not require them to be twins. The first study specifically was examining twins and therefore the selection process required participants be twins.
As a side note, with studies of multiples it is possible to have an odd number (i.e. if you have 5 families, 4 pairs of twins and one set of triplets you would have n = 11).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah that makes sense.
There was a news story a few years back where the amount of wedded people was odd as well, because someone married themselves. </p>
<p>On a side note, is it biologically possible for identical triplets to exist?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The study on twins does not discuss any particular instances of this within the study.  Twins with this scenario you noted would provide invaluable data for these type of studies, particularly for explaining the role of the environment on behavior. However, these are generally rare so twin studies use statistical models that try to measure the strength of genetic variance and shared/unique environment between twins for a phenotype.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why the studies tend to use fraternal twins as a control. Fraternal are going to be born in the same time and place, minus the genetic similarity of identicals</p></div>		</li>
