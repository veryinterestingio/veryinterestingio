			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, most fridges have a drainage hole at the back that allows condensation to drain out. This hole also functions as a breather to counter the vacuum. Sometimes this hole will get blocked and the vacuum would get worse. If you find your fridge difficult to open consecutively, try clearing this hole and it will open easier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, the drainage hole is connected through a tube to a collector recipient on the back of the fridge. Normally, the water from the collector just evaporates but when there is enough humidity in the air and the difference between inside of the fridge and room temperature increases, there might be so much condensation that the collector fills with water effectively blocking the access of air through the tube.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like your parents have a SubZero. It’s one of the most expensive fridges you can buy. They also are only installed and repaired by SubZero factory mechanics which is why this professional repair man might not have encounter one.</p>
<p>Edit: to clarify it isn’t a true vacuum seal, it’s just the door is sealing itself shut in order to maintain optimal temperature and humidity for food longevity.</p></div>		</li>
