If the pressure gets high enough, the heart can't overcome that force to open the aortic valve, and blood stops flowing.   Of course there is every scenario in-between as seen in the Frank-starling curve, which would result in various different cardiac output ratios.</p>
<p>Pulmonary edema and CHF are the same thing in my book because CHF always causes pulmonary edema unless you have cardiac defect like a foramen ovale.  Pulmonary edema is going to be the effect of chronic mild-moderate CHF.  Total circulatory collapse is going to be the effect of severe CHF (like in the event of transfusing as much liquid as possible into a body)</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think the point being that in this scenario you develop pulmonary edema long before this happens. Heart failure and volume overload both share pulmonary edema as a characteristic symptom, but heart failure bears other symptoms that volume overload does not share, in particular resting fatigue and exercise intolerance.</p>
<p>Heart failure is defined as an inability to meet corporeal supply in any context, regardless of fluid status. So This isn’t correct.</p>
<p>To help visualize what I’m talking about, here is the Starling Curve for heart failure paired with normal. You’re saying the plateau is equivalent to heart failure because that’s where you’re in pulmonary congestion, but heart failure explicitly entails a separate mechanism and therefore a substantially downshifted curve.</p>
