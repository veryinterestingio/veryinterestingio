			<div class="markdown"><p>You summed up pretty well the issues with robots. They are so inflexible they don't work for a lot of applications.  You would think  stacking lumber would be easy for a robot, but wood is not similar enough from piece to piece for them to be effective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Picking strawberries is another thing machines are terrible at.</p>
<p>Every strawberry and every plant is slightly different. Stawberries are fragile, so you have to be gentle with them yet also account for the different size, shape, weight, and placement of every berry.</p>
<p>Human brains and human hands do this without thinking. A toddler has enough brainpower and dexterity to pick berries.</p>
<p>Yet robots are so inflexible they can't figure out how to pick berries. There's a ton of money for berry picking. Automating farming would be an enormous money saver, but these are extremely difficult problems to solve.</p></div>		</li>

<p>baking is a lot more manageable (it's food chemistry)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depends on the thing being baked. Bread can be difficult to automate, because alignment of gluten strands, development of dough strength, microbial growth, and things like pH and temperature of the dough feed back onto themselves so that a baker has to react and respond to the subtle signals the dough is sending, in order to get the rise and the crumb they're looking for.</p>
<p>Bread machine bread works really well for very specific styles of bread, but some types of bread really are best made by hand, especially with free formed shapes and/or bread with wild yeast or sourdough.</p></div>		</li>
