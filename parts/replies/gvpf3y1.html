			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and Ross and Spencer. I am not a speech therapist. I am her caregiver (my background is environmental science so a little outside my realm) following her prescription and being creative in dreaming up new language learning tasks. </p>
<p>But wow, being with her daily for the last few months post-stroke has been super informative. My own Mother has vascular dementia so there’s a whole ‘nother level of brain dysfunction. </p>
<p>No wonder it’s so hard to personalize treatments; although there are many similarities, there are exponentially more individual and nuanced situations. I truly feel sorry for the folks that can not afford, have no access to or family willing/able to go the extra mile for good care... it really makes a difference.</p></div>		</li>
