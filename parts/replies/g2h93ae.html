			<div class="markdown"><p>Identity theft was much easier when social security numbers (SSN) were assigned when needed (i.e., at your first job), instead of at birth.</p>
<p>If you need a full fake ID, with a social security number, the way to go was to tour cemeteries and come up with lists of people who died young enough that they probably never applied for a social security number.  If your age makes sense for that birth year, then you just pretend to be that person, and gather all the vital documents that person would have gotten if they hadn't died.  Get a copy of the birth certificate by claiming to be that person.  Apply for a driver's license and a Social Security card with that same information.  </p>
<p>In the 1980s, Social Security numbers began to be assigned at birth, so this no longer works.  Applying for a SSN as an adult is extremely unusual, so this application will get a lot of attention.  The birth certificate you provide will more likely than not be matched to the real person's SSN, and its status as belonging to someone deceased.</p>
<p>Around the same time, driver's licenses became harder to obtain without a SSN.</p>
<p>The downside of making it nearly impossible to steal identities from dead people is that ID thieves have to focus on living people.  They steal mail and other documents and use them to apply for jobs, loans, identifying documents, etc.  The consequences of their actions fall upon the real people who have to prove they didn't do those things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite rare, though you could do it. I didn't get one until the 1986 tax changes required an SSN for all dependents. Before that, most people didn't get one until they got their first job. There was no need to have one if you didn't have to file taxes yourself.</p>
<p>If your parents were giving you assets at birth that would require you to file taxes, then you would have needed a SSN.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I rented a boat with my fake ID in high school. Also hijacking top comment to say modern fake identities are actually stolen identities, its way easier to pretend to be someone else than it is to create a new person to be. They don’t even need to be dead, you can buy people’s identities on dark net markets like empire, and commit fraud in their name. Also fake ID’s are just a fake passport or drivers license not a fake identity, it’s practically impossible to get your info into govt databases, but most services don’t actually  check govt databases. I used to buy weed and alcohol and tobacco and use gambling websites with online identity verification using my fake in high school.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the German banking system not use some for of nation ID number to verify a person's identity?</p>
<p>Here in the states you have to give a valid Social security number in order to open a bank account. There are ways around that, as the system isn't exactly perfect, but you still have to have someone's SSN to open the account.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't speak for German banks but in  Ireland and the UK banks ask to view your passport. Which seems a lot more secure than some random number that was never designed to be secure. SSN is the most ridiculous system I've seen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can only speak for our system but i guess its for every bank. You have the clients ID and the number on the ID. But there is no &quot;check&quot; to see if it is valid.</p>
<p>Normally you also ask for the clients Steuer-ID (Tax-ID) without that there are problems when he is paying taxes, but you normally dont need that sincemost people are under 701€ (under thst you dont pay Kapitalertragstaxes). But i dont think that this number verified online, but im not sure.</p></div>		</li>
