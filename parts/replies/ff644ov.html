			<div class="markdown"><p>What confuses me is burping relies on gravity to let gas separate and rise to the top where the esophageal sphincter can let it out without releasing any reflux (most of the time).  </p>
<p>I'm guessing you just can' t burp, so it would be wise to avoid carbonated beverages:</p>

<p>Pretty much the same as lying down.  You really need to sit up to burp or bad things can happen.</p>
<p>Yep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the esophageal sphincter still ends up on top when lying down, but it's harder to burp safely.  If you were inverted it seems impossible to release stomach gas and not the reflux.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oh, my valve! It's closing! Are you satisfied now that you have ruined me for the rest of the evening? Everyone has a valve! Mine is simply more developed. I am trying to open a passage which you have succeeded in blocking. It may be permanently closed now for all I know.</p></div>		</li>
