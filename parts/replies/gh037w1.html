			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just that. Theree was a bacteria during the American Civil War that caused the wounds of soldiers to glow. And it was considered a good thing because soldiers who had the &quot;Angel Glow&quot; were more likely to survive or even never get infections. The bacteria in question (and the nematode hosts) used anti-bacterial chemicals to clear the way for their own proliferation.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's mainly the bacteria/whatever microbes on the seafood itself that glows. The meat/flesh itself doesn't glow.   Generally the bioluminescent glowing is called phosphorescence in this case.</p>
<p>You can read a bit about the whole spiel in this nice review and its mechanics across organismal groups.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. It makes sense in context since people would see one lobster have this strange effect and leave it alone, until its the last lonely lobster in the tank. If you've seen this you know how darkly strange and sad it is.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also there was a time when lobster was looked down upon to the extent to where one jurisdiction passed a law limiting how much you could feed to prisoners.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The phosphorescent soil bacteria displaced the gangrene from their open wounds and prevented sepsis. </p>
<p>It took being mildly hypothermic to allow soil bacteria to thrive on a human body, but it's hard to argue with the results.</p></div>		</li>

<p>has been known for quite a long time</p>

<p>I'll add an interesting engineering (!) application of this phenomemon that's fairly relevant in the context of a Dickens novel:</p>
<p>During the early Industrial Revolution, coal mining was extremely dangerous. Coal seams are often accompanied by pockets of hydrocarbon gases, which at the time were known as <em>firedamp</em> (&quot;fire vapour&quot; in modern English). This, combined with the uncovered candles used for illumination, is clearly a health and safety inspector's worst nightmare.</p>
<p>Until the invention of the safety lamp, miners tried all sorts of methods to be able to see while avoiding a fiery death, including (<a href="https://youtu.be/c-WO73Dh7rY?t=125" target="_blank">somewhat nauseatingly</a>) decomposing seafood. One option that was actually attempted was to drag around a bucket of rotting fish, but it turned out that dried fish skin also exhibits the same effect, providing a faint source of light.</p>
<p>I bet modern coal miners are glad electricity is a thing now,</p></div>		</li>
