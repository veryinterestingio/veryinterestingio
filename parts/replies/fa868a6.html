<p>I'm fairly well read carbon extraction and have never heard of this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm guessing due to the sheer scale required. The wiki article there is saying that azolla can draw down about 6 tonnes of carbon per acre, but that would mean we'd need a land area larger than the entirety of North America entirely dedicated to it to counter global emissions</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Palynological controls and calibration with the high-resolution geomagnetic reversal record allows the duration of the event to be estimated at <em>800,000 years.</em>  </p>

<p>I agree that if we want to avoid the brunt of the mess we caused we must rely on geoengineering. Orbital mirrors, marine cloud seeding, stratospheric sulfate aerosols, high albedo crops. Carbon sequestration if/when it becomes worth the effort. And of course, maximizing nuclear fission and renewable energy alike and researching fusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the concept of greening the Sahara desert. If you totalled all the carbon in all land plants and animals, you wouldn't even have half the carbon in our soil. You also get something in the end, instead of just throwing money away. The best solutions to carbon emissions provide something in return.</p></div>		</li>
