			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah.</p>
<p>lumens = how much light is being put out</p>
<p>lux (or foot-candles) = how much light is hitting a surface area (1 lux = 1 lumen per square meter)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When the light is reflected back to your eyes by an object (lets say a red shirt), the object absorbs the wavelengths of some colors, and reflects other colors. If you see a shirts as &quot;red&quot; then the shirt absorbed all other colors except red and reflected the red light back to you. In a debatably more accurate sense, the shirt is actually every color except red, since it absorbs all other colors and rejects red.</p>
<p>In a perfectly accurate sense, objects have no color at all, and the color that we see is a construct within our minds. If you shine perfectly green light at that &quot;red&quot; shirt, it will look black since it absorbs the green light and there is no red light hitting it to be able to reflect back to your eyes.</p>
<p>Side note, Philips Hue and other color LED bulbs are awesome and trippy when you play with the colors and look at various different colored objects around your house.</p></div>		</li>
