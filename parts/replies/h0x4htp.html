			<div class="markdown"><p>So that’s the true definition of “digital” and “analog”</p>
<p>You have one that is broadcast using radio frequencies and one that is transferred electrically in a digital format and decoded using a computer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That definition isn't quite right.</p>
<p>Digital television is still broadcast to this day over the air using radio frequency. The difference is the shape of the carrier signal.</p>
<p>Analog signals can exist in an arbitrary state between two voltage levels, and the decoder circuitry interprets the voltage level as an intensity level for values such as brightness, color, sound volume, etc. The concept of pixels does not apply, because the picture is built as a sweeping line of these voltage levels moving across the phosphor screen. Electrical and radio interference can influence these variable signals and leave an impression on the finished output. When the frequency of two interfering signals overlap, you can even perceive the &quot;ghost&quot; of one channel on another.</p>
<p>Digital signals exist as either ON or OFF. The decoder circuitry simply has to decide for each time slice whether the signal was on or off. Then it stacks each value until it forms a binary number which corresponds to a discrete integer value (say:0-255) within a predetermined range. This integer value is sent as a specific intensity level to the hardware for each discrete pixel on the display. Sound is similarly reconstructed in discrete number values, before a digtital to analog converter recreates a clean analog signal for your speakers. Electrical and digital interference don't have any effect on the signal as long as the voltage level is not sufficient to affect whether the decoder can read a state of ON or OFF at each time slice. If the interference is bad enough to affect that discrete comparison, the entire picture will be corrupted, because the reconstructed signal no longer makes mathematical sense to the decoder algorithm.</p>
<p>Whether or not the signal is sent over wires or radio waves is entirely independent of whether the signal is analog or digital. Digital can be wireless or wired. Analog can be wireless or wired.</p>
<p>Either can be transmitted as a direct wired signal, or modulated over an rf carrier, wired or wireless. The main difference is that digital is literally all or nothing. Analog is allowed to be fuzzy and still work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Er, not quite. Originally broadcast TV was analog, starting with the first black and white broadcasts. The RCA jacks, be it the single yellow, or component or S-video were also all analog. The TV would decode them and output signals. I'm sure some CRT TVs before digital broadcasts moved to being &quot;a computer&quot; in some sense but that wasn't needed strictly speaking. Even in that case the TV was still processing analog signals, and largely outputting analog signals (directly or indirectly) if it was a CRT. </p>
<p>All signals that exist in the real world (over the airwaves, over a wire, even over the tiny pathways in a CPU) are analog. A &quot;Digital signal&quot; is an analog signal with very specific rules. The most simple (but not only) is that below a certain voltage it is considered &quot;OFF&quot; (or 0) and above a voltage (usually there is a gap between these to make it more obvious when it &quot;should&quot; be one or the other) it is &quot;ON&quot; (or 1).</p>
<p>The most important difference is that analog is continuous, while digital is discrete. So long as it is within the range of voltage or strength allowed (physical limit or otherwise) the only limit to the detail is the sensitivity of the equipment and the noise in the signal. With perfectly sensitive equipment and zero noise there are technically infinite numbers between say 0 volts and 1 volt. (In reality, you will be very limited by noise, the receiver's accuracy and the sender's accuracy). So the difference between 0.1 and 0.9 is more than 0.3 and 0.6. For digital, the most simple is binary (On and Off), there is no &quot;more on&quot; or &quot;less off&quot;. For a simple binary signal, everything that fits the same rule is equal and the same; 0.1 and 0.3 are both &quot;off&quot;, 0.6 and 0.9 are both &quot;on&quot;. </p>
<p>Because we change what is &quot;important&quot; about the signal, it actually becomes easier to pack more information into a given signal. Since we can turn that information easily into logic that follows rules we can do smart things that make it easier to ignore or deal with noise as well.</p></div>		</li>

<p>All your device had to do was convert the desired composite video into an NTSC broadcast signal with appropriate levels</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or in the case of (one of?) the first &quot;DRM&quot; (or I guess Content Rights Management since it wasn't digital...) an <em>in</em>appropriate signal that still worked. VHS tapes with copy protection played in a VCR would result in a signal (both over VHF or the RCA jacks) that was just out of spec enough that another VCR would recognize it as &quot;don't record this&quot;. While a TV would happily still turn that signal into picture and sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and annoyingly, dvd did something similar by messing with the agc. I had a late model CRT with integrated VHS, and i could never get DVDs to play nice with the RCA inputs.</p></div>		</li>
