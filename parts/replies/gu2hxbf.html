			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, you can reverse the process to make your miniatures and models look life-size. Difficult/impossible to do with a single image, so you take multiple exposures at different focal <del>lengths</del> points and blend together the sharpest parts of each image.</p>
<p>Edit: There are other ways to achieve this as others have pointed out, focus stacking is basically the cheapest if you don't have a DSLR with decent lenses. They achieve the same end though: getting all parts of the image in focus.</p>
<p>For examples, look up focus stacking. There's also a guy called <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelpaulsmith/" target="_blank">Michael Paul Smith</a> who takes photos of <a href="https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uuuploads/miniature-car-photos-elgin-park-michael-paul-smith/miniature-car-photos-elgin-park-michael-paul-smith-25.jpg" target="_blank">old 50s vehicles</a> that are <a href="https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uuuploads/miniature-car-photos-elgin-park-michael-paul-smith/miniature-car-photos-elgin-park-michael-paul-smith-26.jpg" target="_blank">actually models</a> he's made.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure he does it all &quot;in camera&quot; with lenses, but same result.</p>
<p>There's a program called Helicon Focus that does the same thing, but once you realise how it works you can achieve the same in your favourite image editor.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small pinholes have a resolution problem.  As you hit about f/32 to f/64 you get pretty significant drops in clarity (gets blurry) due to the pinhole size starting to get close to the fundamental wavelength of visible light.</p>
<p>f/64 is never really possible to get sharp, and a true pinhole is probably f/100 or higher and is usually blurry as shit (by modern SLR standards anyway)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For video, you want to also do the following: </p>
<p>- Reduce framerate to 8 FPS or less. This makes it look like stop motion.</p>
<p>- Slightly increase the color saturation. This makes it look like colored plastic rather than real materials.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You now have what appears to be a stop motion video of a miniature that was actually real life!</p>
<p>Source: I'm a TV editor and have done this professionally for several shows. Lots of fun when production actually shoots at proper angles. Not fun at all when the angles suck and you have to rotoscope the entire foreground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It needs to be a downward angle, around 45 degrees. Like you’re looking down on a model rather than standing inside of it. You also want to try and minimize objects that cross the lower and upper third boundaries of the frame. Telephone poles, skyscrapers, etc. don’t dirty the frame with foreground objects or it breaks the illusion. Disney shot a great video in this style that shows both angles that work perfectly (car parking lot) and not as well (anything shot side-on. The steamboat is the worst).</p>
