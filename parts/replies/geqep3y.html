			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand we would expect to find more, but if we assume the solar system is typical then it stands to reason that we wouldn't be finding many terrestrial exoplanets yet. Most of the ones we have found are significantly bigger than Earth which is itself the largest terrestrial body in the solar system. Again, assuming the solar system is typical, it would also stand to reason that exoplanets much bigger than Earth would be rare. So perhaps most stars, even those without gas giants, have small terrestrial planets orbiting them, but we don't see them. Instead we almost only see the relatively few freak systems that have abnormally huge terrestrial planets.</p>
<p>It just seems to me to be similar to being on a mountain top, looking down, and wondering why you see mostly large animals and few insects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly, we detect exoplanets when they pass between us and their star, causing a dip in that star's brightness from our perspective.</p>
<p>Bigger planets block more light.</p>
<p>So yeah, we're much better at finding larger planets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We also detect planets by looking at the motion of a star. As a planet orbits a star, the planets gravitational pull on the star will cause the star to move. This causes the spectra of the star to red shift and blue shift as it will be moving towards and away from us. Observing the spectra of a star allows us to determine if a planet is orbiting it.</p></div>		</li>
