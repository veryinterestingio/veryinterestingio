<p><strong>Gravity and Shape</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just want to expand on this point a bit, as it's the primary way we figure this stuff out for gas giants - and is also the primary science goal of the Juno spacecraft currently orbiting Jupiter.</p>
<p>While an orbit around a perfect sphere will not change, an orbit around a slightly squashed sphere will gradually change over time. In particular, two things will happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://i.imgur.com/HgJ0oeA.gif" target="_blank">perihelion will precess</a></p>
</li>
<li>The <a href="https://i.imgur.com/bjeFy2e.gif" target="_blank">nodes will regress</a></li>
</ul>
<p>By carefully measuring the spacecraft's position and velocity, we can watch how the orbit subtly changes in these ways. We match these changes to mathematical models of the interior; as we alter each layer's density in the model, this affects how spherical that layer is, and in turn, how that layer contributes to the changes in the orbit.</p>
<p>Early models were generally just two layers, a small central dense core that's more spherical, and a surrounding mantle that's less dense and less spherical. The actual math is pretty gnarly with integrals that don't have analytical solutions (pro-tip: Maclaurin spheroids, not even once), so we really needed computation to get better before our models got better. These days they're really sophisticated, with potentially numerous layers and density gradients, and enough to demonstrate pretty clearly that Jupiter's core has been slowly dissolving into the surrounding mantle of liquid metallic hydrogen.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm having a lot of difficulty understanding what the hell I'm seeing in this gif... I think it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodal_precession" target="_blank">this</a>, precession of the orbital plane of a satellite around the rotational axis, but... it just doesn't make sense for me visually... </p>
<p>That the planet depicted is probably Uranus (with the strange axial tilt) doesn't help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that gif is showing the nodal precession of the Moon's orbit; the Sun, Earth, and the Moon are depicted there. The red circle is the Moon's orbit, the dark gray circle is the Earth's orbit.</p>
<p>I think you're confusing the line of nodes (white, where the Moon's orbit intersects Earths orbit) with the planetary rotation axis (not depicted). No planetary bodies are moving or rotating in the gif, it's just demonstrating how the line of nodes sweeps out a full circle every 18.6 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How can molten iron create a magnetic field when iron loses its magnetism when it hits around 800 degrees Fahrenheit? The sun makes the strongest magnetic field in our solar system through electrons bouncing around in the fusion process. Wouldn't a similar occurrence cause planets to have magnetic fields? Also venus has iron yet little magnetic field generation. I have always wondered about this and can't seem to find a plausible solution. What do you think?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you might be confusing ferromagnetism (that really only works for Iron, Nickel, and Cobalt) with induced magnetism. There are many different ways to generate a magnetic field.</p>
<p>It's not the fact that it's iron here that matters; it's the fact that it's a material that can conduct electricity. After all, consider that a wire loop made of pure copper will generate a magnetic field if you run a current through it.</p>
<p>Similarly, for a dynamo effect inside a planet, what matters is the motion of a fluid that can conduct electrical charges. In the case of Jupiter and Saturn, the source of their magnetic fields is hydrogen squeezed so tight that it becomes a liquid metal. In the case of Uranus and Neptune, their magnetic fields come from water under extreme pressure, which becomes an electrically-conducting slush.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mentioned that global magnetic fields are created by the motion of a liquid conducting material (not necessarily iron) in a rotating planet.</p>
<p>The most likely explanation for Venus’s lack of field is that it’s rotating too slowly to create the right flow pattern, but because we haven’t yet landed a good seismometer on it, its interior structure is still not confidently known so it could be one if the other factors too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That was definitely the common explanation a few decades ago (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1979LPSC...10.2277R" target="_blank">Russell, et al, 1979</a>), but recently it seems most hypotheses have focused on the lack of internal convection (e.g. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X18305211" target="_blank">O'Rourke, et al, 2018</a>) as the missing component of the Venusian dynamo. Even in the first linked paper, while Russell suggests that slow rotation is a cause, he also notes that Mercury is a slow rotator yet maintains a magnetic field, and scaling that value to Venus parameters does not properly predict the field's weakness.</p>
<p>It remains unclear whether convection is being quenched by a shallow temperature gradient throughout the planet's interior, or perhaps just in the Venusian core where planetary accretion would have left stably stratified layers of metal that were never homogenized enough to encourage convection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on seismic waves a bit. There are two types of seismic waves that get to the core. One can pass through liquids and the other cannot.  The earth is dotted with recording stations that check for these waves constantly. What happens when an earthquake occurs is some of 'solid only' waves will hit stations on the other side of the planet but they will not hit ones DIRECTLY on the other side of the planet. That's because the core creates a kind of 'shadow' effect with this type. With the other type the wave will actually bend in a similar way to light at the boundary between the solid mantel and liquid core.  It will do this whenever it hits a liquid/solid boundary and the amount it bends tells us a lot about the makeup of what that liquid is.  That bent wave will hit one of the recording stations and seismologists use a bunch of math in combination with the readings they got of the other kinds of waves to pinpoint the earthquake epicenter and then can calculate where all of the boundaries are using certain known variables like the speed of each type of wave etc.</p></div>		</li>
