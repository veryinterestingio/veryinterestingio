<p>Then when he stopped wearing the lenses it took another couple of weeks for his brain to start seeing the normal upside-down images as normal.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Figure Out Which Way is Up</p>
<p>This is where things can be a bit tricky, especially if the victim becomes disoriented. There are two ways that you can find out which way is up so that you can hopefully get yourself oxygen. Try holding your hand straight up over your head and see if it reaches the surface of the snow. This step may also help others find you easier. You could also try spitting saliva from your mouth. Your spit will move down, so youâ€™ll want to work your way in the opposite direction.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find it weird that people can remember how to spell their own names, but can't remember which direction left is.</p>
<p>You have a 1 in 26 chance of picking the right letter each time to spell out your name. You have a 1/2 chance of picking the correct direction when choosing left or right.</p>
<p>Left and right are so ridiculously simple compared to all of the other shit we do every day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are seeing this situation rather narrowly. For example, you are never asked to spell your name backwards, or advanced by one letter - like spelling Bob &quot;Cpc&quot;. It's easy to respond to things that don't involve choices, where the answer is always the same.</p>
<p>Left and right change all the time, sometimes within seconds, based on positioning.</p>
<p>Anyway, left and right seem to be simple <em>for you</em>, but you are only one data point, right? Your claim that it is so &quot;ridiculously simple&quot; is a little obnoxiously self-centered, based on the obvious fact that for many, MANY people, it is NOT simple.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Your</em> left and right never change, and people confuse the two constantly.</p>
<p>Left and right from your perspective are always, 100% of the time consistent. Your left hand will always and forever be your left hand. All other points of reference are simply one logical step away.</p>
<p>I see your point, but understanding left from right is a 50/50 chance no matter what perspective you're guessing it from.</p>
<p>Granted, there are a lot of medical reasons why someone might confuse the two, and someone with a genuine mental hurdle to overcome will of course have a much harder time with it than I would.</p></div>		</li>
