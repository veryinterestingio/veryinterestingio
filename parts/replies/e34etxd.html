<p>In short, a bird has two types of lungs. One that takes in air and one that only exhausts air. (The air moves between them via tubes that exchanges the gasses with the blood). So air will only move in a single direction through these lungs (it moves cyclic).</p>
<p>Which is in contrast to mammalian lungs, as we suck in air and push it out from the same organ.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So for car folks, bird lungs are like a rotary engine and mammalian lungs are like a piston engine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're at all familiar with heat exchangers (radiators, for example), it's the same principle.</p>
<p>Birds use what's called counter-current exchange, which keeps the differential (between low oxygen and high oxygen flows) as big as possible, forcing more oxygen towards the low oxygen side. You can actually end up with a higher concentration in the &quot;low&quot; stream (blood) than you started with the the &quot;high&quot; stream (breath) (sounds crazy but here's an example graph, where the colder stream leaving the system is actually hotter than the hot stream entering):</p>

<p>Mammals are just filling up a tank and then waiting for exchange to occur on the surfaces without utilizing flow, either co-current or counter-current, both of which would be more efficient from a transfer perspective.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Iirc (dont quote me on this) the blood flows in the opposite direction  of the air in those tubes I mentioned earlier. This increases the  efficiency as the waste gasses (CO2) are dumped near the &quot;exit&quot; lung (in  lack of a better term) and frees up space for oxigen at the intake  lung.</p>

<p>Sounds legit. ^(Just wanted to quote you)</p></div>		</li>
