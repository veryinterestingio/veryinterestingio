			<div class="markdown"><p>That actually isn’t correct, in fact an increase/higher concentration of estrogen is what causes an LH spike and then ovulation. Birth control is actually a vey <em>low</em> amount of estrogen, and when taking in <em>small</em> amounts it has a paradoxical effect of inhibiting that LH spike/ovulation. It’s a pretty unique phenomenon that doesn’t really happen with other feedback systems in the body.</p>

<p>Here is a pretty helpful info-graphic that shows the different hormone levels throughout the menstrual cycle. You can see the increase in estrogen level that leads to the LH surge, followed by ovulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question since you seem to know your stuff: How is it that you can give a low amount of estrogen to mimic pregnancy without your body just making more? Additionally, how is it that the low amounts of estrogen don't stop pregnancy in regular (not on hormonal treatment) bodies?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pill’s mostly progesterone. If you administer it at a correct dose it basically tells your hypothalamus to slow down hormone release and the follicle doesn’t develop. The mature follicle is what gives you that estrogen kick, so if it doesn’t develop levels will stay low. </p>
<p>In a normal cycle progesterone is produced by this thing called the corpus luteum. It develops right after you ovulate and tells your body not to develop any more follicles (because you’re already ovulating), and if you don’t get pregnant it dies and comes out when you menstruate. Without it progesterone drops and everything starts over. </p>
<p>With the pill progesterone is artificially kept high so your body never gets the signal to start the cycle back over. You’re basically arrested post-ovulation.</p>
<p>Also Low Estrogen can definitely cause problems if you’re trying to get pregnant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the person you replied to, but your questions got me curious as well. I checked one of my books on pregnancy, and the primary producer of more estrogen in pregnant women is the placenta. This makes sense, since the estrogen is supposed to send a signal to the ovaries to not send any more eggs, since there's already a fertilised one in there. Since someone on anticonception is likely not pregnant, there's no placenta to pick up production, so during the stop week levels return to normal and they would get their period. </p>
<p>Estrogen, by the way, is a group of hormones: estriol, estrone, and estriadol. Estriol is the primary hormone produced by the placenta, reaching levels a thousand times higher than you'd find in someone not pregnant. </p>
<p>As to why estrogen doesn't stop ovulation in people not on hormonal anticonception, naturally occurring high levels of estrogen can apparently cause irregular or absent menstruation. This is one of the reasons why people who are obese can have fewer periods: fat is one of the producers of estriadol (as are the liver, brain, testicles, breasts, and adrenal glands).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick explanation:</p>
<p>A hormone called GnRH is made from the brain, which stimulates the production of another hormone called FSH (follicle stimulating hormone).</p>
<p>FSH stimulates the development of follicles (eggs) in the ovary, and these follicles produce oestrogen. Oestrogen has a negative feedback effect on the release of GnRH <em>and</em> the release of FSH, meaning that as oestrogen levels rise (produced by the developing follicle), release of GnRH and FSH stops. This naturally functions to prevent the development of too many follicles.</p>
<p>Taking oestrogen as a pill provides just enough of the hormone that it stops the release of GnRH and FSH (remember that oestrogen has that negative feedback effect). The lack of FSH means that the follicles don’t develop and so ultimately ovulation doesn’t occur. Since the follicle is the source of oestrogen, if the follicle doesn’t develop then the body isn’t able to make more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cramps are usually from your uterus contracting to get rid of the tissue build up from days before your period. An egg is released from your ovary several days before your period starts and generally you shouldn't feel it at all (unless something is wrong).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly the first month of pregnancy doesn't have a ton of specific symptoms, a lot of them are similar to birth control or even period symptoms. When I was pregnant with my older daughter my first symptom was period-like cramps. I honestly thought I was getting my period, but since we were trying I took a test and surprise! Good cramps.</p>
<p>This pregnancy (I'm six months along) my first symptom was just breast tenderness, which is again: common with periods. The positive test was a shock and delight after three years of trying.</p>
<p>A lot of people don't realize that the first two &quot;weeks&quot; of pregnancy are BEFORE you actually conceive. It starts from the first day of your last period. So if you're five weeks pregnant, you actually conceived the pregnancy three weeks ago. That first month? Really NOT a lot of symptoms to notice in most cases. A lot of people don't realize they're pregnant till around eight weeks, because a lot of us have period-like bleeding during the first month.</p>
<p>If you think you might be pregnant, the only way to know is to test. They sell really cheap strips online if you don't want to pay &quot;first response&quot; prices, if you just want peace of mind because you're on birth control or you've been trying a while.</p></div>		</li>
