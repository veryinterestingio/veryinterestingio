			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually a modern car will take more visual damage than a classic car as there are more crumple zones designed in to absorb energy from a crash. Look up some modern vs classic car crashes on YouTube.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure a newer car takes more visual damage, plastic bumper covers, crumple zones, and folding hoods will always appear to be more damaged than solid metal. If you get anywhere below the surface the classic car will be completely and totally fucked, as energy travels throughout the body and tweaks every panel throughout the structure. It hardly matters, of course, as generally the occupants in the classic will be 100% dead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In all the videos I've seen the classic car takes considerably more visual damage as well. Just because there's no plastic in the bodywork does not mean it's stronger, it's all just decorative paper-thin sheet metal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah no. The old car will fare better and is less likely to be totaled after a crash. But the passengers in that car are waaaaay more likely to be dead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever seen a modern car crash into a classic car at any kind of normal speed? The newer car has a bashed in front end and everyone walks away with some soreness. The older car is just as bashed in, except everyone inside is dead because the frame stopped immediately while the passenger compartment kept going. The older car's driveline has also ripped through the middle of the car and broken everyone's pelvis, so even if the occupants aren't dead they'll never walk again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. That’s what I said. Also, high speed crashes are <em>not</em> normal speed crashes. There’s a reason crash tests are typically done at 30 mph or less and not highway speeds.</p>
<p>But by the speeds where the classic car is starting to get significant damage (around 5-15 mph), the modern car is already totaled, because enough body panels and airbags have gone off, and possibly the start of the frame crumpling, that there’s basically no way to economically repair it unless it’s a very expensive car that’s also still pretty new.</p>
<p>And yes, the occupants of the classic car will probably be dead, and the occupants of the modern car will live. I said that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The bodywork on older cars is all thin decorative sheet metal and gets absolutely mangled along with the passengers. People think &quot;metal&gt;plastic&quot; and assume all old cars are these unyielding tanks but they just aren't..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and so is the bodywork on modern cars. It’s thin decorative sheet metal, not plastic, and not strong. That doesn’t make the difference. The difference is in the speed range where the classic car’s bumper gets dented but the energy is otherwise transferred directly into the car’s chassis. At which point the passengers probably get a concussion and/or a giant spike in the middle of the steering wheel shoved into their solar plexus.</p></div>		</li>
