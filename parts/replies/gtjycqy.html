			<div class="markdown"><p>This is false, modern instruction sets include entropy based random generation, creating a truly random number.</p>
<p>Iirc, in x86 its RDSEED, and in arms instruction set it is RNDR</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but that requires more power and it’s more expensive. C just uses the time for the seed and so do most languages and libraries. C++ has a lot of different generators but all use a seed that may or may not be truly random</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The guy is /sorta/ right. You can't be 'truly' random because on a non-quantum scale nothing is random. If you tossed a coin, and you knew exactly what speed you flipped it at, exactly what the air resistance was, the mass, friction, etc. you could predict whether it would land on heads or tails. But while that's difficult, it's /possible/. So random number generators are never truly random. But you can get close by say, taking the list digit of the number of nanoseconds that your computer has been on when you query for the random number.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a fun additional fact, this is why, on old game consoles, you can plug in a computer to perform exactly the same inputs at exactly the same moments every time (this is called a TAS, or Tool-Assisted Speedrun). Because random number seeds were usually things like number of milliseconds since the console booted up or number of steps the player has taken, a TAS can have exactly the same &quot;random&quot; events every time. It's fascinating, and they're pretty fun to watch!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used the same sort of approach to semi-bypass &quot;Copy Protection Checks&quot; on old DOS games.  You make a batch file that sets the system clock and then immediately launches the game.  Then, the &quot;random&quot; check ends up asking the same question every time.</p>
<p>Sometimes this didn't work (for example, if there was user input before the check), or only worked some of the time (I assume due to some kind of exact timing variance on load - eg: Star Control II Super Melee would always ask one of 3 star locations when you did this).</p></div>		</li>
