			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not just ADHD, that's the genuinely poor sleep hygiene of most working class people these days.  I used to have terrible, awful problems with sleep.  So many of them went away when I started following the instructions I got - only use the bed for sleep/sex, not for hanging out in.  Have a routine before bed.  Don't drink alcohol.  Get out of bed if you can't fall asleep within 15 minutes and try again after clearing your head.  Keep all clocks out of view.  Simple things.  Now I sleep two 4-hour shifts with a 1-2 hour break in the middle, which apparently is pretty natural, and I don't need to fall asleep with a TV on to do it.  I don't even need an alarm clock anymore.  I wake up NLT 7:30 every day like clockwork, and since my REM isn't interrupted, I feel refreshed most days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the very little info OP gave, ADHD is one possibility and if he can relate to the symptons it would be a good idea to talk to a therapist.</p>
<p>With that said,  I have insomnia since early childhood. How is this a working class problem? Also, personally for me, having clocks around when I am trying to sleep is the worst thing I can do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. If this is common look for a therapist. Had it all of my life without knowing until I got married and my wife noticed the signs (restlesness, insomnia, lack of focus, etc).</p>
<p>Lately, I usually just pick something relaxing to watch on my laptop while lying in bed, until I doze off or I get up and go do something else. Trying to force myself to sleep only adds to the frustration.</p></div>		</li>
