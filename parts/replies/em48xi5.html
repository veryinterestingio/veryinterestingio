			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. That's standard practice for all construction. A whole team of engineers will first assess the damage and give the architects the data. AFAIK that process has already started....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good, I'm really glad. I've wanted to visit there (among many other places) ever since my art history class. My professor for that class went to school to be an architect, and she's been to a bunch of really awesome places. She even got to tour the roman Colosseum before they stopped letting people into the interesting parts. She had lots of cool pictures to show us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi fellow architect:) You're correct about all the points, except we do have very detailed plans of the roof frame (done afterward, we lost the originals). We do have however the original plans of Viollet-le-Duc's spire and even very acciraye models made by skilled carpenters.
There is already a Chief Architect in charge of the building (since the cathedral is a state Building), and he's working around the clock with his team since the fire to stabilize and protect it.
Not to mention the absurd time of drying (firefighters dropped tons of dirty Seine water) it will take; about 6-12 months.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard that they cut a lot of corners with these super tall sky scrapers in Dubai. Last time it was in the news when one hotel caught on fire and the whole building lit up in a matter of minutes.
Something to do with using aluminium sandwiched plastic panels to cut costs instead of using sold metal panels. Apparently these are extremely flammable?
The Burj Khalifa only cost around $1.2b to build, seems quite cheap for a project of that scale.
I'd like to hear an architects opinion on this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But you'd be surprised how cheaply even tall skyscrapers can be built. The material is manufactured in places like China, so the costs are drastically cut down. Product quality is monitored, however. Construction isn't as expensive as you'd think. In India we can get good construction for under 50 USD per square foot, and that's the higher side. </p>
<p>Additionally, the 1.2B is just the construction cost. The finishings, the interiors, the landscape isn't generally divulged.</p>
<p>Solid metal panels are inadvisable in very high building because they add tremendous weight. Aluminium sandwich panels are normally safe. But freak accidents happen. Which is why quality control is crucial.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I suspect this and the related expertise in building skyscrapers available plays a big role as well. There's going to be a lot less throughput available for Notre Dame bits and less knowledge about streamlining construction. You see similar challenges with nuclear where the construction is full of bottlenecks where only a few people in the world can roll your 300 ton in got into the part needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They used non -fire rated “aluminum sandwich panels”, the solution that everyone now has to use is the fire rated version of the sandwich panels - Solid metal is not used for that purpose.</p>
<p>The correct name is Aluminum Composite Material - ACM.</p></div>		</li>
