			<div class="markdown"><p>They can use non protein nitrogen and via microbes in their gut convert this to protein for their bodies to utilise. A ruminants (cow/sheep etc) digestive system is built to be able to take in large volumes of low quality feed e.g. grass,hay and extract as much from that feed as possible. Whereas monogastric (single stomach) animals like pigs are unable to digest more complex plant material eg cellulose  and require a more easily digestible diet (humans are technically also monogastric).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know roughly what percentage of their protein intake comes from  the conversion you mentioned vs. consuming microbes directly? Or at least, which is the more significant protein source? (The higher-level comment here suggests that the protein comes from digesting bacteria, but I want to know if that’s the primary protein source or not.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>This may be true for our food /supply chain but we have found two sources of energy that fuel biotopes that are 100% independent of the sun.  One is in caves and based on gas.  The other is thermal vents at the bottom of the ocean - where no light lives.   Discovery channel had it on many years ago.</p></div>		</li>
