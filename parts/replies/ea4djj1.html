			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a lawyer, but I think it means that your house contains one or more apartment units (probably located in Brooklyn or Queens), and one or more of those apartments are (or were at some point since 1993) rent stabilized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>NYC law states that your landlord has to take care of it and if they don’t, you can get your own exterminator and subtract the cost from your rent. </p>
<p>NYC is extremely tenant friendly and something as bad as this is a huge quality of life issue. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That seems like a ludicrous loop hole built in to fuck people over who didn't bother to buy a protector for their mattress. Having a mattress protector will do absolutely fuck all to prevent bed bugs from taking root in your apartment. Those fuckers will live in the walls, outlets, carpet, drawers, anywhere. They'll live in another room and travel to eat off of you at night. Mattress protector protects your mattress from having to be thrown out lol. </p>
<p>So fucking absurd. It's this type of legal loop hole contract bs that's fucked everything up and has completely removed common sense from the equation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A mattress protector doesn't stop them at all. It only forces them out of their favorite nesting place. I had them a few years ago, had a mattress protector. They decided my alarm clock was good enough, as was my bedframe and dresser. But at least my mattress was safe....</p></div>		</li>

You'll get 50% people telling you &quot;I have nothing of value to add you should call a lawyer&quot;, 30% stories about &quot;this one time my Aunt Jemima had bedbugs and they kept jumping in her syrup!&quot; and 20% people claiming to be lawyers and giving you the most absolute shittastic advice you could imagine.</p></div>		</li>
