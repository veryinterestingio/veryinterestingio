			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe. I’m no doctor, so take it with a grain of salt and ask your eye doctor their opinion. From what I understand if your astigmatism has “leveled off” (stopped changing as much) then it shouldn’t get significantly worse.</p>
<p>I’ve had an astigmatism since 4th grade and never noticed significant changes between check ups but, I did end up needing updated prescriptions every so often until I was in college.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I’ve read about LASIK, which is used to correct astigmatism, you have to wait until you’re in your early 20s so that your prescription stabilizes, so this might be due to what you’re talking about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I developed astigmatism in just my right eye about a year ago and it’s been really annoying. If my frames aren’t perfectly leveled, then my head starts to hurt or my eyesight gets janky. </p>
<p>How have you dealt with astigmatism? Are there any possible ways to make it “better” or to “cure” it?</p></div>		</li>
