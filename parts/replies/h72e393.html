			<div class="markdown"><p>One other factor in play is that short people have a mechanical advantage in jungle environments, and most jungle environments are located in hotter parts of the world. This is also why OP's original assertation does not account for savanna-dwelling people, who are typically quite tall as well: <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/quirks/nov-17-2018-greenland-asteroid-impact-short-people-in-the-rain-forest-reef-islands-and-sea-level-and-more-1.4906857/tiny-people-have-evolved-in-rainforests-because-it-s-where-tiny-steps-are-better-1.4906870" target="_blank">https://www.cbc.ca/radio/quirks/nov-17-2018-greenland-asteroid-impact-short-people-in-the-rain-forest-reef-islands-and-sea-level-and-more-1.4906857/tiny-people-have-evolved-in-rainforests-because-it-s-where-tiny-steps-are-better-1.4906870</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't find any information on the timeline of this subject, but the current warm climate of continental Europe has not always been this warm in recent evolutionary history. One thing I'd postulate about the cold and wealth is that perhaps people who spend their days in cold climates, such as during the little ice age, may be a driving factor of the industrial revolution in Europe. People simply do not want to spend as much time outdoors and innovate to avoid it. I have no actual facts on this and it's just one idea I've had.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The trouble with looking for a link between temperature and wealth is that our sample size is 1: Earth. We have nothing to compare it to, and there are an incredible number of conflating factors. It's not really accurate to say that colder places are wealthier, but rather that those that benefited from European colonialism are wealthier, and it's not clear whether temperature had anything to do with enabling this colonialism.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So why is Nigeria, India, Bangladesh so poor after independence?</p>
<p>China, Korea, Japan never was fully colonized by European states. In fact, the only ex-colonies that have reached very rich developed status are either tax havens (HK, Singapore), resource rich (Dubai, UAE, Kuwait), or Anglo-derivatives (US, Australia, New Zealand, Canada). Most of the other ex-colonies are very poor or among the most poor (South Asia, Africa).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, warmer climates tend to have a larger abundance of food and less of a need for intensive agricultural practices. </p>
<p>To survive the winter one has to innovate a bit, pickling, preservation, textiles, storage, etc....</p>
<p>This could also explain why northern indigenous populations are typical less populous than the warmer, more abundant Amazon or Mississippi River basins. At least in terms of indigenous populations.</p></div>		</li>
