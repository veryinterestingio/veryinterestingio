			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually spacing out your meals can be a great way to lose weight. Instead of eating 3 large meals eat 6 small meals throughout the day. Same amount of calories but your digestive system is always running. Also as a bonus you donâ€™t stretch your stomach out as much so you will feel less hungry in general after a while of doing this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I already do that. Eating 2-3 small meals instead of one larger one.
Eating 3x a day, in our modern world is completely over-eating.</p></div>		</li>
