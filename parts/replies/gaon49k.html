			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, the course of medication was for 14 days AFAIK. In one paper, (sorry can't remember which one) it said that the lymphocyte numbers rebounded. Do you think that after rebounding the t cell lymphocytes would continue to attack the beta cells or would the 14 day ago allow the beta cells to repair, enabling them to start producing enough insulin?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The returning levels of lymphocytes dosnt mean they were the same proportions as prior to treatment, this  medication and others very similar are still being evaluated I had a quick Google just now... And it's being trialed for a few preventive steps... What's your interest in this drug may I ask?
If the t cells return to normal levels they will definitely start removing the beta cells in the pancreas if they already had done so before,</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm doing an immunotherapy research project at uni which is why I am interested in teplizumab. </p>
<p>So when the t cells start coming back to normal, that means that the diabetes has returned? ok cool. So then with this treatment, the patients would stay immunocompromised due to the lack of t cells?</p>
<p>Apologies for the seemingly obvious question, I am only in first yr  so understanding papers isn't my strong suite.</p></div>		</li>
