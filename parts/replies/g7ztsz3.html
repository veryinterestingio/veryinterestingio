			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! It's exactly the vaccine based on Adenovirus 5 that threw me off. I read somewhere that the vaccine didn't produce a immune response in all humans because the Adenovirus 5 is already circulating among people.</p>
<p>And thanks for the metaphor of the syringe, that helped me a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now that you mention it, I forgot about the fact that Ad5 is naturally circulating, and it's an explanation why the CanSino vaccine doesn't produce as strong immunity (due to the immune system for the pre-exposed to Ad5 fighting the Ad5 instead of producing a response to the spike protein).</p>
<p>I found this <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/05/22/early-study-of-covid-19-vaccine-developed-in-china-sees-mixed-results/" target="_blank">StatNews piece</a> on the early CanSino results that says as much.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The answer to your question 'can this platform be used' is yes it absolutely can - the technology can be 're-used' with simply new DNA 'cargo' to the new virus target.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure &quot;absolutely can&quot; is appropriate, it's a very legitimate concern that people with immunity to the vector might clear the viral vector too fast for it to work efficiently and thus not respond much to the vaccine antigen. That's the reason that the companies developing these vaccines often choose low seroprevalence adenoviruses (eg. chimpanzee adenoviruses) in the first place - to avoid pre-existing immune responses to the vector. </p>
<p>It isn't incredibly clear how big of an issue this is, as some studies suggest that immunity can still develop reasonably well after the second use of a vector, whereas others have suggested that pre-existing antibodies against the adenovirus being used as a vector results in lower titers of antibody against the antigen being vaccinated against.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you elaborate more on how this vector works? Does the adenovirus contain something that is deposited into our immune cells that gives them the ability to produce an antibody that targets the spike protein of SARS-COV-2? Or is it more of just a &quot;shield&quot; the immune system recognizes more quickly, so when the adenovirus is handled by the immune response it ends up picking up and responding to the payload inside as well?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course - happy to.</p>
<p>The Ad5 vector cannot replicate, and is well-suited for both mucosal cell entry (lining of your nasal and bronchial passageways) as well as other cells in the body.</p>
<p>This virus then has to be produced in large billions quantity per individual, and the method to produce them industrially is known.</p>
<p>Also in favor of Ad5 is storage, it doesn’t have -20C or even -80C storage (dry ice shipment) (like Moderna’s) requirements.</p>
<p>The virus delivers a single payload to a single cell - say a fibroblast cell below the skin - and that cell will start pumping out SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and express it on the cell surface.</p>
<p>Your immune system will recognize it and start generating both a general and a specific immune response - including those valuable CD4+ Th1 T-helper cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, I think I got it. So really the target cell and &quot;source&quot; virus the payload is derived from are largely irrelevant outside of what works for the treatment at hand. AD5 acts like a normal virus and injects the payload for creating an antigen of the source virus (the spike protein in this case). The &quot;infected&quot; cell then picks up the payload as part of its normal protein synthesis, like it would a regular viral payload, but in this case it only creates the antigen instead of the entire virus. Then the immune system can respond to those antigens without threat of there being an actual virus attached to it that can reproduce.</p>
<p>That's fascinating, the ingenuity in this field never ceases to amaze me.</p></div>		</li>
