			<div class="markdown"><p>An excellent example is the language formerly known as Serbo-Croatian. Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks at one point stopped liking each other, so they started to say that Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian were three separate languages, although they can still understand each other about as well as British and American native speakers of English. That leads to weird results like &quot;bilingual&quot; signs that are character for character the exact same text. <a href="https://m.imgur.com/ZePeS" target="_blank">https://m.imgur.com/ZePeS</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked in the UN missions in the dissolved Yugoslavia after the Kosovo conflict.  They can understand each other's <em>languages</em> (if they want to), but those people.... they'll never understand <em>each other</em>.  </p>
<p>And if you really intently listen to them with genuine interest, and ask a lot of deep-diving questions,  and really hear them out, you too will also never really understand them.  Their rationale for almost everything about their mutual hatred is rooted in a combination of three things: 1) feelings they have <em>today</em> about the conflicts between Serbia and the Ottoman empire; 2) insistence on blood feud levels of hatred because there's some family story about someone's great, great uncle somehow &quot;provocating&quot; someone else's other distant cousin over something stupid and trivial, but now they have to hate and kill each other forever; and 3) a social more that it's completely acceptable to be dishonest and/or criminal if it means that you get over on someone you have some manufactured reason to dislike.  </p>

<p>I was shocked to realize that a <em>ton</em> of words printed on Russian signs were just English words written using the Cyrillic alphabet. It made functioning in Russia significantly easier despite not knowing the language.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who can't read cyrillic, that 3rd version shares a lot of similarities with the first 2. Especially the 2nd, 3rd (kinda), 4th, 5th, 7th, and 8th words.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>V's and B's tend to translate directly in a lot of languages, and the single character word did too, and because of that helps  with the 6th work. And the character counts are identical if you consider those lj and nj replacements.</p></div>		</li>

<p>that process would likely involve doubling-down on the regionally-distinct features of that dialect</p>

<p>Fantastic post.  Earnest question here: I imagine most language evolution happens over time and unintentionally.  When you make the statement quoted above, do you mean that speakers of a regionally-distinct dialect would <em>intentionally</em> stress unique characteristics of their dialect and over time this could split the languages?</p>
<p>If so, I find the intent part really interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe so. Spanish is interesting because is so varied and distinct from country to country and even local provinces within a country.</p>
<p>Argentinian Spanish is a good example. It's so vastly different on the way its pronounced that it changed the way their people write. For instance, most words use different accents and tildes on the wrong syllables according to proper Spanish grammar which is taught by schools in other Latin American countries.</p>
<p>I'd say this usually happens when you have a lot of multicultural immigration, aside from Spaniards there were a lot of Italians and Germans immigrants which influenced their own Spanish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this happens anytime you remove a language from its mother country and transplant it somewhere new.</p>
<p>Another example would be French in France being a very different language than the French spoken in Quebec (Québécois or Joual). Which is different, again, from Acadian (spoken in New Brunswick), from Cajun (Louisiana), Haitian French, African French, and Indochinese French.  I expect that the regional dialects within France offer a similar experience but are closer to each other as to be indistinguishable at times. </p>
<p>I learned &quot;proper&quot; Parisian French while in school. My daughters speak Québécois and they have a hard time following me sometimes, and I they.</p>
<p>Edit: got my Cajun and Creole confused. Thank you u/alose</p></div>		</li>

<p>Argentine here, you’re describing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voseo#History" target="_blank">Voseo</a>. It’s actually just an archaic form of the second person that took off as the standard in Argentina and Uruguay (and other Latin American countries to lesser extents.), I believe it predates the immigration waves.</p>
<p>While the conjugation is unusual to those unfamiliar with it, it is “correct” and documented even by the prescriptivist Real Academia Española.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminded me of something I learned from my college roommate. Her parents are from Mexico (she was born in the U.S.) so Spanish was her first language growing up, but her dad also spoke a particular dialect of Spanish unique to his small town. He would revert back to it when his family visited, and no one else in the family could understand him. For all intents and purposes, he spoke a whole separate language but because of what the OP commenter said it's only considered a dialect. He's from a pretty remote area so I imagine in that case it arose more from isolation than multicultural influences.</p></div>		</li>

There was some disagreement in a Quora conversation about how &quot;thick&quot; the Neapolitan dialect of the show is, but apropos to the point made by u/throwaway_lmgk, if not for the fact that they're under the same national flag, Italian and Neapolitan might be two different languages, not dialects.</p></div>		</li>

To put things in prospective I'm from Trento so can't confirm, but I can perfectly understand italian with a thick napolitan accent, and with little effort I can understand the regional italian of Neaples, I for sure have less problems understanding spanish than the napolitan dialect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually neither, real Neapolitan is almost lost, few people really speak it. As somebody else was saying, the real Neapolitan is quite distant from Italian and most of the words are different. What they speak is instead the current slang, where most of the words are italian but 'deformed' in a Neapolitan way.</p></div>		</li>
