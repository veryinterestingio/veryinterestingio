			<div class="markdown"><p>I love that outside article! However, it seems a little extreme. Here's a series of &quot;whoa take it a step back counter points:&quot;</p>
<p>Sun burns are bad, everyone agrees, as they raise cancer risk. If you are not tan and are indoors all day 7 days a week, then go out for a long hike put sunscreen on as you will burn otherwise. Your skin is not used to that much sun.</p>
<p>For white folks, 10 to 30 minutes in high sun is all you need for vit D. Brown folks need more but as is often the case this has not been studied well.</p>
<p>This is mostly based on the correlation that people who spend more time outdoors live longer.  This is not causation that sun exposure makes you live longer. People who are outside all the time are probably more active and that may be what increases life span.</p>
<p>Sun exposure increases wrinkles. Consider applying sunscreen to your face at least while leaving arms and legs more exposed.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ditto. I wouldn't give it much credence. If you have the data and some good conclusion then you must publish it somewhere reputable. A dermatologist who once came into my office told me a very simple thing (backed by proper science):</p>
<p>The sunshine that benefits you is the lighter variety --the 7-9AM sunshine (in the subtropical region where I live). For that type of sunshine you rarely need a sunscreen. After that the level of harmful UV rises a lot. Those of us who have darker skins will build up more melanin during that time and block it off. Those of us who have lighter skins would need stronger sunscreens. Interestingly, she said to go for a lower SPF than higher ones because higher SPF sunscreens are usually thicker and difficult to apply evenly --the tiny patch you ignore is at a higher risk of skin cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My biology teacher told me this as well. The dangerous times are some time around 10-11 until about 2-3 in the afternoon. That’s when you want to apply sunscreen regularly and avoid being outside for prolonged periods. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looking at the swedish data, there are a couple things that stand out immediately.  The high exposure group is twice as likely to have &gt;= 12 years of education (they're more highly educated), and they are twice as likely to have a high disposable income.</p>
<p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/joim.12496" target="_blank">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/joim.12496</a></p>
<p>The outside article says what I'm saying, but only obliquely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In fact, says Weller, “When I diagnose a basal-cell skin cancer in a patient, the first thing I say is congratulations, because you’re walking out of my office with a longer life expectancy than when you walked in.” That’s probably because people who get carcinomas, which are strongly linked to sun exposure, tend to be healthy types that are outside getting plenty of exercise and sunlight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is sun exposure making people healthy, or do healthy people get more sun exposure?  Is it a cause or effect of good health?</p>
<p>The Swedish study makes some outrageous claims only to slightly walk them back in the conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our finding that avoidance of sun exposure was a risk factor for all‐cause death of the same magnitude as smoking is novel,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Comparing to smoking is extremely problematic because we know that smoking does cause cancer, we know why, and we know that reducing smoking reduces cancer and improves health.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, it is not possible to differentiate between active sun exposure habits and a healthy lifestyle, and secondly, the results are of an observational nature; therefore, <strong>a causal link cannot be proven.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd disagree it's not possible to differentiate, and after alluding to causality for most of a paper, it only gets stated that they can't show that at the end.  They also offer no commentary to the data that the highest exposure group has higher hazard ratio (HR) as their model includes more other potential causes (income, exercise, etc).  I feel that presenting data without any model adjustment is extremely unhelpful.  People latch onto the most salacious data and don't dig to see what the other causes might have been.</p>
<p>I also don't see any assessment of sunscreen use.  Take the high exposure groups, and divide into sunscreen users and non sunscreen users.</p>
<p>Sorry for the rant.</p></div>		</li>

<li>
<p>It (barely) references research, and tries to wrongfully weave it into the &quot;vitamin D supplements don't work&quot; and &quot;sunlight good, sunscreen bad&quot; narrative. Biased writing to say the least.</p>
</li>
<li>What I understood from the research behind it is that there's a correlation between actively spending time out in the sun and having a longer expected lifespan than people who spend time indoors all day. Actually mapping out the causes and determining the healthiest degree of exposure, however, requires nuanced thinking - all UV rays are not created equal and so on.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right as I said it's an article for the lay reader, which gives a bit of food for thought and anyone can go to PubMed and dig deeper if they choose. </p>
<p>I think it's pretty established science by now that supplements in general aren't good for anything.</p>
<p>It's also pretty obvious that healthy vigorous people who spend time outdoors might live longer than people who are shut in, out of the sun, for a lot of reasons.</p>
<p>But the things about sunlight, melanomas, death from melanoma, blood pressure, mood, etc. etc. would probably be intriguing to all but the dullest mind, and beg for deeper examination, which is why I posted it.</p>
<p>If nothing else, it's a good reminder that even things we think are surely true and settled, like &quot;use a ton of sunscreen and minimize sun exposure&quot; are actually more complicated.</p></div>		</li>
