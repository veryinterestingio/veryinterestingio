			<div class="markdown"><p>First and second languages are handled differently by the brain, so that might explain part of the phenomena. Having not seen the studies, it is unclear to me if they included people with multiple first languages or multilingual subjects who learned a second language after the critical language period.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm echoing what my parents told me after their conversation with the special education department explaining why he should try Chinese instead of Spanish (even though my dad is fluent in Spanish). Here's an article on the topic that has two references. I'd also like to note that not all cases are created equal. His manifestation is not the same as some of my friends who supposedly have the same disorder. Most of the issue he faces is the anxiety surrounding reading because of the low speed and high effort. It makes things like 6 page diner menu seem insurmountable.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting. I don't have any problems with dyslexia in English, but I'm learning Mandarin, and I find that a lot of the characters which are some form of square box with horizontal lines in / under it difficult. I can't for the life of me count up how many lines there are and which ones are in the box, part of the box, or outside the box, even if I have my face pressed six inches from the paper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was learning to write Chinese (I can't anymore, it's a skill that I couldn't maintain), I was taught the name of the strokes used in the characters (Shu, hen, etc.) and I memorized the order by sort of reciting these names in the order they came. It helped immensely with remembering the order and you don't need to count or anything, just remember the words like a song or something and as you recite the stroke, draw the corresponding lines so your muscle memory kicks in later on as you hear/remember it.</p>
<p>Idk, if this will help you, since our brains work differently, but it gave me an edge over the other white boys in class ðŸ’ª</p></div>		</li>
