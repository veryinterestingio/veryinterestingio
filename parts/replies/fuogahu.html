			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer! I have some follow up questions.
The umbilical cord goes from placenta to baby. When the baby is born, before the cord is cut is it still attached to the placenta inside the uterus? Like one big rope going from baby, through the vagina to the placenta? I distinctly remember asking this question during sex ed in grade 6 yet no one seemed able to answer</p>
<p>Also the placenta is attached to the uterine wall during pregnancy right? Yet the placenta is delivered after the birth. At one point does it dettach? Does it begin to detach leading up to the birth?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes cord is still attached and still pulses for a wee while after birth as fluids are still being transferred back and forth. Placenta detaches after the baby is born as the uterus needs to contract to stop the bleeding. If it doesnâ€™t detach cleanly you continue to bleed. So quite important that the uterus contracts back to its normal size as quickly as possible after birth.</p></div>		</li>
