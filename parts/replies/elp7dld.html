<p>Another important aspect is the zeros of this function, zeta(x) = 0. There are many hypotheses tying the zeros of the zeta function to primes numbers and their frequency. This has huge implications in cryptography.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have not heard of zeta(3) being anything too interesting.</p>

<p>Euler proved that for every even integer <em>n</em>, ζ(<em>n</em>) is a rational multiple of π<em>^(n)</em> (most famously, ζ(2) = π²/6). His proof did not work for odd values of <em>n</em>, but surely someone would find a way around the difficulty and prove some kind of formula for all <em>n</em>, right ?</p>
<p><em>Wrong</em>.</p>
<p>We're now more than 250 years after Euler and the best anyone (Apéry) ever managed to prove is that ζ(3) is irrational. Is there any relation between ζ(3) and π^(3) ? No one has any bloody idea (there are obviously conjectures and computational results, but nothing more). And don't even dream about knowing <em>anything</em> about ζ(5), ζ(7), etc., it's just too damn hard.</p>
<p>TL;DR: the value of ζ(3) has no practical interest (that I know of), it's just infuriating because it's ridiculously hard to tell anything about compared to ζ(2) and ζ(4).</p></div>		</li>
