			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct.....But they cant access those RPM's without torque.  Small electric motors can access that torque instantly with the whole linkage scheduling more fuel flow, increased fuel flow burning and increasing RPM's or combustion engines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the motor torque that's doing the thrust instantaneously, it's the torque absorbed by the prop, with variable pitch prop torque can be changed near instantly just by moving the blades, no waiting for RPM change of anything.</p></div>		</li>
