			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a big problem with the data being used this way, and why I’ve argued that racism and police brutality, while intermixed, are actually separate problems. That doesn’t make either less serious an issue, but it does mean that some of the solutions that are being proposed may not work, having been built on faulty assumptions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's like you say, police violence has multiple factors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, police brutality is largely a class issue, but race is also used as a signifier for class. If police discriminate against the lower class, they’ll use signifiers like someone’s race to guess which class they belong to. </p>
<p>It’s a problem that class is used to discriminate against people, and it worsens the problem that race is a social class. We need to stop classism, and a completely intertwined part of that is ending racism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way i look at it is this... If I snapped my fingers and eliminated all racism in law enforcement, we'd still have a ton of innocent people being killed every day, just perhaps in more equal numbers. Because the police in many places are essentially paramilitary forces that operate mostly above the law.</p>
<p>However, if I snapped my fingers and eliminated police brutality, those lives would be saved. Yes, we still need to resolve the racial bias because certain populations would still be subjected to unfair policing, but if we're trying to save lives, then it's the abuse of power and corruption that we need to get rid of first.</p>
<p>Edit: Multiple people have pointed out that many of these abuses probably wouldn't exist if they had predominantly affected whites, and that's very likely. However that cat is out of the bag, the abuses have been accepted and allowed. I look at the protests that focus on race and I wonder... If the police departments sat down and literally said, &quot;we will do anything you want that is physically possible to fix the race problem&quot;. What would they ask for? Sensitivity training? Racial guidelines? Stricter hiring practices?  A plethora of these already exist. There are no practical solutions to the racial bias problem that can just be all of sudden implemented. That's a years long transition of all of society, one that we should begin, but that won't save lives for years to come.</p>
<p>But what we <em>can do</em> all of a sudden is... 1. Force them to wear body cameras, and make turning them off a criminal offense. 2. Eliminate no knock warrants. 3. Create an independent body to investigate abuse. These things focus on the root cause.</p>
<p>Edit: I've realized that there may be another philosophical side to this argument. My argument rests on the principle that a human life is de facto the highest priority. I haven't even attempted to compare it to the unfair policing, which in some cases might be seen as torture, of millions of Americans. So which is worse? The loss of a few hundred lives, or the potential torture of millions? It's not a philosophical question that I'm qualified to answer because I can't actually speak to the subjective effect of being black in America. I don't really think it changes the fact that that problem can't be solved nearly as quickly as the others, but I at least want to acknowledge that my argument comes from a place where I don't even have to compare against living black, because I'm not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Classism does need to be stopped. Racism does need to be stopped. But police need to be retrained, trained differently from hereon out, and held accountable and everything. That they do this at all and can get away with it is not a class issue, it's an institutional issue. If cops weren't allowed to brutalize anyone for no reason (effectively), then racism and classism would have greatly diminished effects in that context.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Five thirty-eight just published an article about something similar to this. Instead of race/socioeconomic status, they showed that the police killings have gone down in cities but are actually creeping up in rural and suburban areas.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The STEM representation is actually pretty much right where you want it to be if you control of high school graduation rates. That is ultimately to say that the average socioeconomic status of black people is lower than that of white people.</p>
<p>Defining <em>why</em> that's the case is a long and complicated task but the various items on that list of <em>why</em> are ultimately the things that need to be addressed for any long term growth and healing to happen (if the planet survives that long which is a very real question at this rate).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot that these numbers don't account for. Socioeconomic status, crime rate, geographic location, etc etc. Much of that is arguably still a result of racial bias, but ignoring these factors obfuscates the causes of statistics such as the ones in this post</p></div>		</li>
