			<div class="markdown"><p>Like the old days of Apple II/C-64 floppy drives: you don't know where the read head was when it powered down, so you just step the motor backwards one more time than there are possible steps to make sure it gets back to the starting position.  If Track 29 is the last possible place it could be, step it backwards 30 times and you'll know that it is now at Track 1.  That's why those computers always booted up with that <em>braaaaaaap</em> sound: it's the drive head motor thumping against the stop up to 30 times, making sure it's at Track 1, and then getting down to business.</p></div>		</li>
