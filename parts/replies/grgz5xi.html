			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty easy to get the effect without trying anything specific, but for best results, do it with the sun to your back. Since rainbows appear in part due to a mirror-like reflection, they always appear in the direction opposite the light source.</p>
<p><del>If you spray above you, you can see the entire, uninterrupted circular rainbow.</del></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't get to choose where the rainbow appears by spraying water above you. The position of the rainbow relative to you is determined by the position of the sun, not by what direction you spray the water. Indeed, in a sense the rainbow is already there, and you just spray water around to find it.</p></div>		</li>
