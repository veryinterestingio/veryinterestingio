			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this!!</p>
<p>I will add that the severity of any symptoms experienced by a person with BPD also exist on a spectrum. Some symptoms can be much more intense and disruptive than others. </p>
<p>The onset of BPD is correlated with previous childhood abuse and/or neglect. It’s a pattern of these maladaptive behaviors that interfere with day to day life. </p>
<p>I wasn’t diagnosed until I was 35, as I have what is called “Quiet BPD.”  My symptoms are and always have been completely internalized, vs acting out towards other people. I have for sore verbally lashed out at people; however not with the intensity typically associated with more typical presentations of the disorder. </p>
<p>It can sometimes be hard to diagnose, however, it is actually treatable. Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) is considered to be the most effective treatment for people suffering from BPD. It’s made a huge difference for me, in that I’m finally learning the tools to identify and then regulate my emotions; vs just flipping shit and panicking when things start hurting me (emotionally) and start spinning out of control. </p>
<p>I’ve had periods of time where some old patterns will start to raise their heads; but I can identify them and rein them back in before they get out of hand. </p>
<p>BPD has a terrible reputation and (I feel) is tied to a much, much heavier stigma than probably any other mental illness. It sucks, because due to the stigma we just keep our mouths shut; for fear of scaring people away... avoiding abandonment is the primary goal driving our more negative behaviors, so inflicting that on ourselves is a no-go. </p>
<p>I don’t mean to speak for all pwBPD.  But all of us pwBPD share many common symptoms, manifestations, and experiences. </p>
<p>There is a great thread on r/AITA about BPD, and there are a lot of great comments there which very, very clearly explain BPD from the perspective of the people without it. </p>
<p>I feel like I’m not doing a great job of articulating all the points I want to make, but I’m happy to try to answer any questions you may have :)</p>

<p>I joke, but it is a real problem. Mental illness in general is still* heavily stigmatized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weird isn’t it how we all think someone in the hospital or with a broken leg cannot be asked to just walk on. After all, we see that something is wrong. While at the same time it is completely normalized to ask/tell mentally ill people to just go on, basically asking them to walk with their broken leg without a cast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have BPD and have a cousin with schizophrenia. She tried to kill me once when I was a child but everyone's reaction was &quot;oh poor child is sick, have some understanding, she didn't mean to kill you&quot;. I cry because I'm in actual physical pain from a fracture in my spine and people are like &quot;well stop being so dramatic it's probably not even that painful you're overreacting&quot;. The problem with BPD is that people think we're just being unreasonable by choice, while schizophrenia is just absolutely uncontrollable. BPD is no less controllable than schizophrenia, it's just that they manifest differently. Schizophrenia is all the way on the psychotic side of the spectrum, while BPD is somewhere in the middle between psychotic and neurotic, hence the name borderline.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably similar for me with why there's been confusion with therapists that I've had with some feeling I do have bpd and others (current) ones don't, or others staying they don't see it. Talked to current one about DBT since a previous one had wanted me to try it (rather pushily) but current one also feels like there wouldn't be a whole lot for me to learn from it either since to him it seems like a lot I do or know and has been self taught is pretty much what they teach there too I guess? </p>
<p>Meds have also helped a lot to keep me from me losing my shit and told him too that yeah sure shit feels weird and muted but I'll take it because at least I have some time now to be able to think and emotions arnt so damn immediately overwhelming, and bad situations arnt with brain immediately slamming on the panic button multiple times or shutting everything down, or the other problem with anger because oh my god is my anger the other bad thing and sometimes it can be explosive so there isn't really any time to be able to try to think and try to control myself because it went from irritated to pissed off and half a step from being physical in some way or another (I've even had to stab myself in the leg before to ground myself and keep from losing it on someone in the past. I've gotten a lot better than I was and tons better than when I was a kid but oh my God has anger always been a hard thing for me.)</p>
<p>I am so glad meds help mute things and give me more of a chance to actually work on ways to de-escalate myself.</p>
<p>I was abused as a kid by my mom and brothers and older brother and mom was abused by dad. On top of autism and other problems, and health issues, had a great time. Least dad left after awhile so didn't add to it further.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A former friend of mine has BPD. On the outside, he can be nice and fun to hang out with. However, once you get to know him more, he can be very difficult due to his lying , manipulative and gas lighting behavior. He also has fears of abandonment and craves companionship and struggles to maintain relationships due to this.</p>
<p>He needs therapy to help him improve and from what I know, for a while he really was improving thanks to finding a therapist that was finally getting through to him. Unfortunately, he started to slip back to his old ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know you're probably just making a little joke, but it's okay! There is one thing psychology undergrads get drilled into their heads; if you're self diagnosing off of a checklist, you'll think you suffer from everything.</p>
<p>A lot of symptoms are just heightened versions of pretty typical struggles, or a very specific collection of traits.</p>
<p>If you feel like these boxes you tick are causing you great stress, or interfering in your ability to live healthily, that's a sign that you might he well served reaching out to a professional. That's generally a good rule of thumb or any mental health issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of the diagnostic criteria for “personality disorders” is that it negatively affects your interpersonal relationships and disrupts your day to day life. You’re allowed to be at a certain spectrum of a personality without having a disorder and that’s just who you are and it’s okay!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The interesting thing I've found about mental illness is that if we went in diagnosising people by common symptoms alone almost everyone in the world would have one.</p>
<p>The problem? Is the symptoms lining up is not enough</p>
<p>Feeling one way about someone one day and another thr next is pretty normal but obsessing and loving every inch of someone one day and hating their guts and wanting to destroy them the next is not, and then having that feeling every week especially is uncommon.</p>
<p>When things start to impede your everyday living that's when you know to start asking for help. But even If you're just worried therapy cna always help</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything you’ve said matches someone in my life. We live together, were best friends, would say that I’m the only reason he keeps living. He’s swung into absolutely hating me, telling others I don’t care about him, if he killed himself I wouldn’t notice, etc. At the moment I’m counselling someone who he is currently doing the same to, who he essentially replaced me with when the hatred started, put the love and adoration on for but is now lashing out and cutting her out. Apart from family we are the only 2 friends he has as everyone else has “done wrong by him” at one stage or another for reasons that change whenever he is asked. With no real friends, he constantly is on dating apps, where he starts seeing girls, calls them his “friends” and lies to all of them that there is anyone else. When shit hits the fan he blocks them out of his life. Everything in this list is all things her and I have discussed that he does, knowing there is some underlining mental issue but not sure what.</p>
<p>He sees a psychologist but from things his told us we both believe he lies to them. Lying seems to be a chronic part of his behaviour too, whether it’s to get him out of doing something wrong, fabricating events for sympathy or just some times for no explainable reason at all. </p>
<p>When he gets caught out for his bad behaviour, instead of showing remorse and sympathy to the person he has hurt he says he’s going to kill himself, essentially trying to turn anger towards him into sympathy and not allowing you to be angry and cut him from your life. </p>
<p>Is there anything we can do to help him seek help or is this something he will hopefully work out in time? We’re at breaking point with it effecting our own mental health</p>
<p>Edit : there’s a lot more I could add to this about anger (hours of rage over the tv being too loud), reckless behaviour (says cocaine in the only thing that makes him happy and he is going to end his life by overdosing on it), issues with work, etc etc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you asked about how to help, the first rule is safeguard your own wellbeing. Don't be afraid to have good boundaries with them--don't be afraid to say 'no' to them.</p>
<p>Be aware that suicide attempts are common in BPD sufferers, and actual suicide is a real risk. But that doesn't mean you must allow them to manipulate you with it. If they are suicidal, call the professionals. Your town/city may have emergency mental health outreach workers who will come to talk to a person in crisis. If they are really flipping out or are involved in an attempts, call an ambulance or police as necessary.</p>
<p>In non-crisis mode, you might tell your friend that you care&amp;are worried about them and wish they'd get help. That you notice their pain. Unlike many other personality disorders, people with BPD often are quite aware of their own pain and can notice that something is wrong. So they are more treatable and likely to improve.</p>
<p>It's hard being a friend to a person who has a mental illness. I hope you take care of yourself, and that your friend takes your advice.</p></div>		</li>
