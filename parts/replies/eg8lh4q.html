<p>not exactly good for you</p>

<p>No worse than all the sugar. The most prominent case, as far as what got media attention, was a dude who drank a handful of liters of soda on the daily.</p>
<p>Is there anything conclusive showing BVO is actually dangerous in any way in reasonable amounts?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.</p>
<p>In the UK, in addition to not containing BVO, Mountain Dew doesnâ€™t contain any orange juice, and like every soft drink the UK version is made with cane sugar not corn syrup. </p>
<p>Cane sugar already tastes infinitely better than corn syrup, which tastes horrendously sour to me. </p>
<p>American Mountain Dew tastes â€˜thinâ€™ and sour to me, UK Mountain Dew tastes like ultra heaven. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US they ban things that are proven unsafe by certain standards, in the EU they ban things that aren't proven safe by their own standards.  Very much a matter of opinion on which one you'd rather have, but each has their own merits. </p></div>		</li>

I will still defend it to the death, and its BVO.</p></div>		</li>
