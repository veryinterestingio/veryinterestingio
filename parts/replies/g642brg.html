			<div class="markdown"><p>Individual contribution limits make this rather hard to do efficiently and legally, and also not particularly hard to detect if you don't follow the rules. Louis DeJoy was funneling money thru his employees, except that most of them only donated when DeJoy offered to pay them back, so their donation records demonstrated rather obvious fraud.</p>
<p>That said, as long as the donations are to the &quot;right&quot; party while it's in power, that same &quot;right&quot; party will look the other way and run the clock out on any form of punishment.</p>

<p>Idk how we'd select candidates at that point, but we need to move away from campaigns being about who has the most money to throw around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was true, it's not anymore.</p>
<p>Trump broke the precedent for presidents divesting from personal businesses, which enables him to charge (and over charge) the campaign fund for services provided.</p>
<p>The obvious example is the Campaign Office. It's in Trump Tower. When he swapped from self-funding to fundraising, he quintupled the rent.</p>
<p>Don't need to be a rocket scientist to see what's going on there, right?</p>
<p>(This isn't chump change either. Rent went from $35k to $170k, so $135k/month increase, over a million dollars a year)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He did that throughout his presidency. Moved meetings from Camp David (were theyve always been held, as the resort is used only for presidential and government related affairs, it is very secure and well protected) to Mar a lago, his personal resort, to which everyone is charged a very high price both to rent the area and to pay for extra security (as well as limiting the amount of people allowed in the resort). Even then ordinary members have made their way into some meetings. </p>
<p>Not to mention everytime he goes golfing (several times a week sometimes) it costs hundreds of thousands. Not just from AF1 and security detail, but because he has to rent out the Trump course hes using. Money that of course ends up in his pocket.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Political action committees (PAC) are the exception to the above. No limit, no public record. The caveat is that while the PAC works on behalf of the candidate, there can be no coordination (wink wink nod nod).</p></div>		</li>
