			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding life and Earth, plate tectonics will likely end in 1-2 billion years as the core cools and that will likely lead to a great weakening then ending of the magnetic field around Earth which will likely lead to us becoming Mars like as our atmosphere is eroded away by high energy particles from space. So, you see, nothing to worry about from the galactic collision.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolution seperating species takes place over something like tens of thousands of years, a billion years ago life was essentially bacteria and single-celled organisms. The Cambrian explosion which brought complex life into the scene happened around 540 million years ago, or half a billion years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im not a biologist but I did study anthropology and therefore human evolution. Humans as we are today have been around for about 400,000 - 200,000 years. Before AMHSS (anatomically modern homo sapiens sapiens) there were many other upright walking species considered humans or proto-humans. Too many to give a bunch of dates, but I can say stone tool use right now dates back as far as 2.4million years. Those tools were simple, but more complex stone tools start, IIRC, around 1mya and of course as human species brains get larger, and their ability to retain knowledge through generations intensifies (human culture) time between technological advances becomes shorter at an exponential rate. </p>
<p>In other words, humans have only been humans as we know for at most about half a million to a quarter million years. 1 billion years is a rediculously large timeframe in comparison. If life descends from what we are now to then, I doubt any of us would recognize it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We may even have less. The slowing down of tectonic turnover combined with increased weathering due to higher temperatures are likely to reduce atmospheric CO2 to the point where the carbon cycle breaks and photosynthesis becomes unviable in perhaps 800 million years. Clock's ticking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But I'm hopeful: the pace at which scientific breakthroughs are made is accelerating. There where millennia between the invention of the wheel and steam power, a century between the first train and the first airplane, decades between the first airplane and the moon landings. 800 million years must be enough to colonise the galaxy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>assuming we get of this rock. a million years is a long time to engage in some mega projects.  we could for example prolong our stars life by stellar lifting material like iron and other fussion inhibators.. or out right lower the stars mass.</p>
<p>planet side some latge scale terraforming wouldnt be to much of a problem</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is my guess as to the solution for the Fermi paradox. Think about how many things had to go right just for life to exist, and then for life to exist long enough to develop intelligence? And at any point we could be wiped out by a stray meteor. Maybe it's just that most planets that harbor life aren't able to sustain it long enough to produce intelligent space faring races</p></div>		</li>
