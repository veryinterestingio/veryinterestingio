<p>TL;DR Neil Gaiman and Neil Armstrong shared with each other they were feeling imposter syndrome at an event recognizing great people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Armstrong was extraordinarily humble and quiet from what I've read, which is exactly why he was chosen to be the first moonwalker. You don't want a braggy person as the face of your space program at a time that national pride is at an all-time high.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of a story that I've heard Martin Amis tell about Saul Bellow. Apparently, on his deathbed, Bellow was talking to someone who was visiting him, and after a lull in the conversation, apropos of nothing, Bellow asked his visitor something like, &quot;Tell me--when people see me walking down the street, do they say, 'There goes a man' or 'There goes a schmuck'?&quot; (Amis's wording, or thereabouts)</p>
<p>As Amis said, here was &quot;a man whose medals clanked when he walked.&quot; Among many other things, Bellow was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Pulitzer Prize, and the Nobel Prize. He is the only writer to date to have won the National Book Award for Fiction three times. </p>
<p>If a guy like that can wonder if he's any good or not, anybody can. As you say, that's impostor syndrome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do too--and it gets better when you consider how late in his life the triumphs happened. The second volume of Zachary Leader's biography of Bellow came out a couple of years ago, and here's a bit from <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9bdb2d2c-f3f6-11e8-938a-543765795f99" target="_blank">a review of it in the FT</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It often feels as if Bellow — the Yiddish-speaking baker’s son who grew up on the mean streets of blue-collar Chicago, and whose brother Maury worked for Al Capone’s lawyer — spends Leader’s first volume applying for jobs and grants he fails to get. In <em>Love and Strife</em> [volume 2], lapped in honours and plaudits, he turns plenty of gigs down...</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would just add that it’s generally only felt by very competent people. It’s not just modesty, Dunning-Kruger plays a big role in it. You have to be competent enough to realize how much you <em>don’t</em> know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>THIS. So much. Every time it comes up i have to take a step back and explain the dunning-kruger effect. Not a lot of people seem to (want to) understand it, though...</p></div>		</li>
