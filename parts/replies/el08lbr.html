			<div class="markdown"><p>I have always wanted to know, and no one (that I know anyway) has ever seen a &quot;wild&quot; hamster so I always assumed it was a domesticated &quot;something or other&quot; rodent that were only bred as pets...</p>
<p>So where do they live in nature? Geographically, as well as environment, if you please.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TIL and thank you for bringing it up.  I felt like you that hamsters were just pets, but in retrospect, that's a bit silly lol they had to come from somewhere right?</p>
<p>I googled real fast and it says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first hamsters were discovered in <strong>Syria</strong>, though they also live in Greece, Romania, Belgium and northern China. In the wild, they like to live in warm, dry areas, like steppes, sand dunes and the edges of deserts.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From Wikipedia on the various types:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Roborovski hamsters</strong> are found in desert regions, such as the basin of the lake Zaysan in Kazakhstan and regions of Tuva, Mongolia and Xinjiang in China.[5]</p>
<p><strong>Campbell's dwarf hamsters</strong> inhabit burrows in the steppes and semideserts of central Asia, the Altai mountains, autonomous areas of Tuva, and the Hebei province in northeastern China.[15]</p>
<p><strong>Golden hamsters</strong> originate from Syria and were first described and officially named in 1839 by British zoologist George Robert Waterhouse. Waterhouse's original specimen was a female hamster; he named it Cricetus auratus or the &quot;golden hamster&quot;. The skin of the specimen is kept at the Natural History Museum in London.[7]  An orange-colored golden hamster
In 1930, Israel Aharoni, a zoologist and professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, captured a mother hamster and her litter of pups in Aleppo, Syria. The hamsters were bred in Jerusalem as laboratory animals. Some escaped from the cage through a hole in the floor, and most of the wild golden hamsters in Israel today are believed to be descended from this litter.[7]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further info:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hamsters are very territorial and intolerant of each other; attacks against each other are ubiquitous. Exceptions do occur, usually when a female and male meet when the female is in heat, but even so, the female may attack the male after mating. Even siblings, once mature, may attack one another. In captivity, babies are separated from their mother and by gender after four weeks, as they sexually mature at four to five weeks old. Same-sex groups of siblings can stay with each other until they are about eight weeks old, at which point they will become territorial and fight with one another, sometimes to the death. Infanticide is not uncommon among female golden hamsters. In captivity, they may kill and eat healthy young as a result of the pups interacting with humans, for any foreign scent is treated as a threat. Females also eat their dead young in the wild.[9]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a plethora of information on hamsters online.  You only need to look.</p>
<p>I kept hamsters for a long time when my children were young.  Something you might not see in any information out there is that the males sing to the females during courtship.  That's just a little bonus note from me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They like running, full stop.  But in nature, there are a lot of distractions.  </p>
<p>Cats will run on wheels, too.  Lots of animals will do stuff for entertainment.  Why wouldn't they?  We do.  We're not so vastly different in basic ways.</p></div>		</li>
