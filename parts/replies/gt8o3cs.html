			<div class="markdown"><p>Going a little more into the applications of chaos theory: It can give you a rough idea of how far into the future you can reasonably expect to predict a system's behavior, even if you understand the workings of the system perfectly.</p>
<p>For example, rough estimates, using chaos theory to measure the Lyapunov exponent of the atmosphere, indicate that it's basically impossible to predict the weather beyond a couple of weeks, no matter how much data you gather and how well you understand the physics of the atmosphere. So basically, that tells you that 10-day weather forecasts are about the best that's reasonably possible, and we should focus on improving those rather than trying to extend our forecasts even further.</p>
<p>So chaos theory can be very helpful in letting us know when we're wasting our time trying to predict things and when it's actually possible with some effort.</p>
<p>EDIT: Please read u/Fig_tree 's comment below. I wrote this out quick and a little sloppy, and they wrote a great clarification of what I meant by saying you &quot;can't&quot; extend the forecast farther, because that's not technically true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand your point about more data not helping predictability, taking more precise measurements <em>does</em> help you make predictions farther into the future... The problem is that for chaotic systems, that relationship is (iirc) logarithmic.</p>
<p>So let's say I can predict the weather two weeks in advance. But I want more! I'll increase the meteorology budget and get measurements that are ten times as accurate!  Had to spend more than ten times the money, scientific progress being the way it is, but I'm sure it's worth it! Now my models can predict...</p>
<p>2.2 weeks out. </p>
<p>Not good enough, so I'll do it again. I'll bankrupt the country to put weather stations in every home, develop new sensors that get another few significant digits on the measurements, we can make forecasts out to...</p>
<p>2.23 weeks. </p>
<p>So you see it's not that more data doesn't help, it's that even radical improvements in knowledge of initial conditions don't produce radically more knowledge of the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, I thought about getting into that but I ran out of time so I glossed over it and my language was a bit sloppy. This is a perfect explanation of why there is, in practice, some scale at which diminishing returns create an effective barrier to longer forecasts, even though it's not really a brick wall in principle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im know nothing really about physics but what your wrote made me me curious. I read on wikipedia (yes ik not the best source) that even with fully determenstic systems the outcome diverges as you said logarithmically as time goes on if I understood that correctly. But why? It feels like that goes against normal logic, so even if you understand evey possible behaviour of a fully determenistic dynamical system it still eventually becomes impossible to predict? Do we just not have the resources to calculate out further? And if we would have the resources does that mean we could genuinly predict the future with 100% accuracy? </p>
<p>If you dont want to answer or my questions dont make sense/are wrong, feel no obligation too, just a very interesting thing to learn :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could we feasibly get to a point where we have an extremely accurate 10-day forecast, such that we'll know down to around a few minutes when it's going to start raining in any given square mile, what percentage of the sky will covered in clouds, the exact temperature with decimal points, etc? But like, only for 10 days ahead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're getting closer and closer to that for 24 hour forecasts, so it's not impossible we'd get better accuracy in the future. Depends how much money is spent on weather prediction and services though - airports get better forecasts than the general public because they pay more for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can actualy do that today. On the <a href="https://metoffice.gov.uk" target="_blank">metoffice.gov.uk</a> go to detailed weather map and chose the radar map (that shows the rainfall and its intensity). You can move it forward in time and quite accurately predict when will a rain patch reach your area. I use it frequently to avoid the rain while cycling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This spawned a thought: Given that human variable behavior can have a direct and immediate impact on weather, at what point does the publicized forecast need to be fed back into the model and is this a solvable problem?</p>
<p>Air traffic effecting the weather is the obvious example, but the further down the chain we get into absurd levels of detail, at some point even the change in thermal emmisivity and reflective properties of civic spaces with/without pedestrian traffic would come into play.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if we somehow developed a method for mapping out every single particle in the atmosphere and every energy source changing things, we wouldn't be able to accurately predict the weather further. Is it really chaos or just a lack of information making long term predictions impossible? Or are they considered one and the same?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, I didn't explain that part in enough detail.</p>
<p>Yes, in principle you can keep getting more and more precise measurements and extend your forecasts further.</p>
<p>BUT</p>
<p>the relationship is logarithmic, not linear, so you have a problem of diminishing returns. This <em>effectively</em> limits us to some timescale in practice, because you're expending more and more effort to get a few days, then hours, then seconds added to your forecast ability.</p>
<p>Fig_tree did a good job of explaining this elsewhere in this comment tree.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There iss a a bit of confusing wordplay here </p>
<p>Remember a prediction saying that things are too chaotic to predict, is in itself, an accurate prediction. </p>
<p>So truthfully we have begun to more accurately predict, when things will become chaotic enough that predictions don't apply. </p>
<p>It's actually an over abundance of information saying that predictions are just impossible over X amount of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That gif is really interesting. Is there an ELI5 on why something as &quot;simple&quot; as 3 pendulums doing the same basic thing (falling with gravity from a random point) can cause these wildly different paths?</p>
<p>In my uneducated view it feels like since it's just a simple movement and seemingly no external factors that the result should be quite predictable - but apparently not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's perhaps better to assume that physical systems are chaotic, and ask how they can not be chaotic. In particular, if you suspend quantum mechanical arguments for a moment, and imagine an electron or photon bouncing around a confined potential, like a tiny ball bouncing off of infinitely strong and and tall walls, there are only 11 systems that have no chaotic regimes, and these are called integrable systems. A simple explanation of integrable systems is that they have exact solutions. These integrable systems also correspond to a coordinate system. The most common integrable coordinate systems are Cartesian, cylindrical, spherical, and elliptical coordinate systems, but mathematicians found an additional seven arcane coordinate systems in which the dynamics of that tiny bouncing ball can be exactly solved. Any tiny perturbation or deviation away from these reflecting cavities necessarily means that the system has a chaotic regime. With a tiny deviation from an integrable system, the integrable solutions still correspond to bouncing ball orbits that periodically repeat in time, so they can be expressed by an exactly solvable equation. These orbits form ellipses or spheres in something called position-momentum phase space, which is too technical for this forum. But essentially, in certain parts of phase space, the future time evolution can be exactly predicted if the initial conditions of position or momentum are at exact centers of these ellipses. If they are within an ellipse, the time evolution can still be very accurately predicted using certain arguments that either involve something called perturbation theory, or ray theory. But outside of these integrable approximations of of the system, there exist an infinite number of solutions that can't be exactly solved, but can be numerically approximated using a computer to take tiny steps in time. </p>
<p>With all that being said, there are exactly zero integrable systems that can be exactly solved in our multi-field/particle universe, because any tiny deviation, even a particle a light-year away, takes the system away from the exactly solvable case. A further complication is that quantum mechanics accounts for the wave-like nature of all particles, which is most simply encapsulated in something called the uncertainty principle, which allows something called quantum tunneling from one set of solutions to the next. A further complication is that quantum mechanics is inexact, and requires something called quantum field theory, initially developed by Schwinger and then grossly simplified for high energy scattering experiments in colliders by Feynman. Quantum field theory introduces something called vacuum fluctuations, which can loosely be though of as noise, like random fluctuations of ripples on a lake on top of waves that a boat in a late makes when it passes by. More technically, fields and their corresponding particles, interact and this is interaction is accounted for by using renormalizable Loretnz-invariant propagators , which essentially means that there are things called propagators that correspond to solutions of the wave equations for every field/particle, which solve the minimum of action wave equation for any field/particle. When the solution to the wave equation doesn't allow for wave-like propagation, this is called a virtual particle, in the parlance of quantum field theory. </p>
<p>The tl;dr upshot is that quantum field theory and quantum mechanics and the existence of many fields/particles means that chaos still exists in ANY system, but it is hard to observe because quantum mechanics allows tunneling through phase space, which acts to smooth-out the chaotoic sea that is inherent in any system. Even without many fields and without quantum mechanics, the time-evolution of any system can't be exactly solved, and this is explored with chaos theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly what this guy says op he’s right on the money. </p>
<p>Inside a vacuum all physical phenomenon will strictly obey the laws of physics, so what they are ACTUALLY saying is the slightest differentiation in initial conditions cause a chaotic effect on the predicted outcome.</p>
<p>The term chaos is because trying to recreate the same outcome inside our box of physics becomes mayhem because even the slightest disposition of a quark will cause such a different outcome. </p>
<p>But like I said inside a vacuum(where the interrelation of particles become constant) things are very predictable, OUTSIDE of the vacuum the sheer vastness of particles, their spin, displacement, not to mention quantum phenomena we have yet to quantify will creat mayhem for any desired result depending on how detailed the measurement. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's about sensibility, when the pendulums hit their limit they will &quot;bounce&quot; into another direction, but even the slightest difference in position will cause them to bounce in a completely different angle, and that happens every time it &quot;hits&quot; so even if 2 pendulums start at roughly the same position, if they're even a single pixel off they'll end up completely different after a few bounces</p>
<p>In a real life setting, you could even release several pendulums in the exact same position and they would still end up different, because of wind and other external factors, they're just very sensitive!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is kind of circular reasoning. They are chaotic because they are sensitive to initial conditions, and they are sensitive to initial conditions because they are chaotic. It doesn’t really get to the heart of <em>why</em> chaos arises, and that is due to nonlinear dynamics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you’ll allow some math outside the realm of what a five year old could understand, chaos arises from <em>nonlinearity</em>. If a system is governed by a nonlinear differential equation (roughly, the dynamic observables’ dynamics are related by a nonlinear function to their current state), then chaos will arise naturally (near initial conditions will tend to exponentially diverge). However, if the system is governed by a linear differential equation, then near initial conditions will lead to near final positions.</p></div>		</li>
