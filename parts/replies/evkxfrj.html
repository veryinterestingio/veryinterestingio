			<div class="markdown"><p>Glad to finally see the right answer. But just to be clear, a 95 F wet bulb temperature is not where things &quot;begin&quot; to get bad. 95 is highly fatal and only exists in artificial conditions like a sauna. </p>
<p>Nowhere on earth reaches that high, thankfully. A wet bulb temperature in the mid 80s is already dangerous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because humans create &quot;waste&quot; heat and you need a temperature differential to dissipate it. If the outside wet-bulb temperature is anywhere near body temperature, there is not enough differential to dissipate heat and body temperature will keep rising.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is true. Even in hot, muggy Florida, I rarely see a wet bulb temp over 80F.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It hasn't been particularly hot here (Florida Treasure Coast) the last few days, but we've hit a wet bulb temp of 80 a few times.</p>
<ul>
<li>7/30/2019 12:53</li>
<li>90° F</li>
<li>66% relative humidity</li>
<li>1017 millibars HG</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the <a href="https://www.weather.gov/epz/wxcalc_rh" target="_blank">weather.gov</a> calculator, I get a WB temp of 80.45° F.  Based on a quick chart I did, we spent 8 AM to 6 PM above 78° F wet bulb. It's been god damned miserable out here. I can't walk two times around the block without being a sweaty mess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heat index isn't as good as wet bulb. Heat index is calculated with just temp and humidity. Wet bulb takes into account temp, humidity, wind, cloud cover. It is a much more accurate prediction of how humans deal with heat through sweating.</p></div>		</li>
