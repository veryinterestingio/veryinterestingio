			<div class="markdown"><p>I do half the time in the microwave and half the time in the oven. Usually turns out just the same if I put it in the oven the whole time. So, if the directions say 4 minutes in the microwave or 30 minutes in the oven, I'll do 2 minutes in the microwave and then 15 minutes in the oven.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One way to combat this is to change the power level when using a microwave. They can only penetrate so far into food, and heat transfers from the nuked outside toward the middle. Giving food more time to allow that transfer of heat will keep the outside from drying out as much.</p>
<p>e.g., White Castle sliders get a really hard crust on the bread if you follow their directions, but do it 2 minutes at 60% instead of 1 minute at 100% results in an evenly cooked slider with a soft bun. (e: I'm referring to the frozen variety.)</p></div>		</li>
