<p>The term fi  in the Drake Equation (fi is the fraction of planets with life on which life becomes as intelligent (and more importantly, capable of creating technology to produce detectable interstellar signatures of its intelligence) as we are (or more), is probably a very small number, small enough to bring down N (the number of civilizations per galaxy) to maybe 1 (with significant error bars, however). So this would be a solution to the Fermi Paradox, not a filter, and there would therefore be no paradox.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My problem is that we assume that we should be able to detect &quot;radio waves&quot; from advanced civilizations. Does that not assume that the they are producing electromagnetic radiation to a detectable degree? Or could they not be much more efficient using lower energy and/or more tight communication that wouldn't be as detectable?</p>
<p>I realize L in the Drake equation kind of covers this, but most people assume it means the civilization ends rather than is undetectable after a certain point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your point is taken into account. We don't assume just &quot;radio waves&quot;. My reply above says &quot;produce detectable interstellar signatures&quot;. There's no mention it's limited to radio waves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the implacations for us would be very different. The nearest star to earth is Alpha Centauri at 4 light years, which could conceivably be visited in one human lifetime with some future spacecraft. So if civilizations are relatively common in the galaxy it is conceivable we'd be able to make some sort of contact with them.</p>
<p>In comparison, the nearest galaxy is Andromeda, at 25 million light years away. So it's 6 million times further than the nearest star, and even having a single radio back-and-forth conversation would take at least 50 million years. So if there's just one civilization per galaxy, communicating / contact with alien civilizations is basically impossible.</p></div>		</li>
