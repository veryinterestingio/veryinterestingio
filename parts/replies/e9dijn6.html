			<div class="markdown"><p>435 is a very conservative estimate when you start looking at things like school district overrides, water management districts, Justice of the Peace, etc. A lot of these things overlap and mean that even within a Congressional District, not everyone will have the same ballot. </p>
<p>I live in Maricopa County, and I think that the County Recorder here is doing a great job. If results take a few weeks, that is fine with me as long as every eligible vote is counted. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Later they use machines to scan the ballots to count the votes. And there are rules to call for hand counts in the case of recounts.</p></div>		</li>
