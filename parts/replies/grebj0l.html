			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, and though it doesn't actually apply to deliberately soft punches, if a boxer wants to hit something really hard then his fist needs to contact it <em>where he expected to contact it.</em> If the surface he hits is closer or farther, or even off center from where he expected it to be then a TON of power is lost. Of course, against a human opponent it can be hard to get your punches to land when and where you expect them to.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In all fighting, contact with the opponent gives more vision then sight. A skilled swordsman's first tip-off of his opponent's intention is their subtle give or push of their blade in a bind.</p>
<p>Likewise, the tactile information yielded by boxer's flesh not only lets you gauge their next action, it also lets you gauge distance even when your eyes can not.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The unseen blow is the one to fell you.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In combat where grappeling is allowed, posting on the enemy's body tires them out.</p>
<p>If you are of greater strength/size then your oppoent you can also grip part of them and pull them down. This makes it so that they:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can't really kick you. </li>
<li>You are in a good position to sprawl if they attempt a double leg take down.</li>
<li>Striking with their arms comes from their core, you are negating their ability to use their core effectively. </li>
<li>You can use the limb or shoulder to force it in the way of and attack. Kind of like tangling them up with their own body. </li>
<li>If your strength is far greater then theirs or they are inexperienced you can find a number of ways to get their back. </li>
</ol>
<p>Of course this gets a lot more complicated the more skilled and powerful your opponent is.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Repeated jabs to the same area but weak, your opponent may begin to disrespect your jab, and that‚Äôs when you change up your game and get a solid shot in. </p>
<p>To a certain degree a lot of mind games goes on during a fight on the professional scene, and getting your opponents into exploitable patterns is certainly one of them.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I should add that this is why fighting someone with a long guard is really, really annoying as a beginner. A long guard is where you hold your lead hand out straight,  almost right up in the opponent's face. It obscures their vision and keeps them at a distance, helping you to control the flow of the fight.</p>
<p>Once you get used to it, there are tactics to deal with it, but when you're starting it's super annoying to fight against.</p></div>		</li>
