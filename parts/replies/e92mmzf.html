<p>Also, Just tried the forearm squeezing thing - pretty cool. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just a little more complicated (and varies from person to person).  Your ring and pinky fingers don't share a tendon, their tendons are connected.  This connection isn't always straight across (shaped like an H).  Sometimes it is at a diagonal (shaped like an N).  When there is a N shaped connection, the Left tendons can pull down without pulling down the Right, but if the Right tendon pulls then the Left must follow. (and vice versa for a backward N shaped diagonal).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The tendon to the ring finger also links to that of the middle finger. If they meet in a &Psi; shape, you might have to extend the pinky and middle fingers just to be able to extend the ring finger.</p>
<p>There are separate tendons that allow sideways motion of each finger that generally won't be linked, and still more tendons for flexion (curling finger) that may be linked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And I have a pinched nerve in my neck, so if I push in around my elbow sometimes it makes my pinky twitch like crazy.<br />
So annoying a small spot in my neck makes my pinky and thumb randomly twitch. And the thumb twitch is strong enough if I'm resting on keyboard spacebar it will hit it and trigger a space  on a mechanical keyboard.
A lot of connections going on in the body. </p></div>		</li>

I remember once in highschool Anatomy &amp; Physiology, we were dissecting chicken wings, and I was having the time of my life freaking people out by animating the wing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went to a magnet high school and my 9th AP biology class required us to dissect a dog testicle, to extract pure DNA. It involved a scalpel, a muller, a centrifuge, and holy crap did it smell terrible. I'm pretty squeamish, but I thought I could handle this one. I toughed it out, but it was rough. The next week was dissecting kitten fetuses, so I opted for the 3-page essay instead. </p></div>		</li>
