			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question! This is something that a lot of labs are looking into. It seems that if birds are stressed due to limited food or shelter when they are young, they can fail to learn song properly and their song will be less attractive to other healthier birds. Birds in urban areas have also been known to increase the pitch of their songs so that they can be heard above ambient noise. Climate change has different effects on different habitats and birds, though, so we can't make any general claims about ALL birds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In our experience, if a bird is under stress it will sing less. Our birds will sing thousands of times each day when they are feeling healthy, but when they are a bit under the weather that singing rate goes down. Can't really speak to how that relates to the wild.</p></div>		</li>
