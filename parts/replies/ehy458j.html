			<div class="markdown"><p>The Green Sahara Period or sometimes called African Humid Periods appear to be primarily driven by the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/West-African-monsoon/images-videos/media/640047/126422" target="_blank">West African Monsoon</a>. The Indian Monsoon does affect Africa though. It is the Indian Monsoon that brings the rains to the Eithiopian highlands which in turn drives the flooding of the Nile, historically in the months of August and September. The Indian Monsoon is also known to shift in response to the Milankovitch Cycles (which is the name for the &quot;wobbles in the earth's orbit and rotational axial tilt&quot; referenced above). During previous glacial minimum ~ 120K years ago, the Indian monsoon shifted to the west, making the Arabian Desert into a Green Phase, like the  Green Sahara  Phases. However, it seems like GSP's occur when the climate is cooler, and Green Arabia Phases occur when the climate is warmer.  </p></div>		</li>
