<p>Partially it is because of an issue with regulations, and partially cost. For the regulation piece, US-certified carriers can only use approved weather sources for flight planning and enroute. Most major airlines have a meteorology staff, and that combined with NOAA aviation forecasts makes up the bulk of &quot;approved&quot; weather sources.</p>
<p>As for the cost, since most aircraft have Wi-Fi installed, pilots can just use that to provide connectivity for their iPad to grab the approved weather data, rather than rely on ADS-B in. Also, every airliner has weather radar onboard, which is harder to use correctly but gives you real-time data rather than composite radar that is filtered and therefore delayed by up to 15 minutes.</p></div>		</li>
