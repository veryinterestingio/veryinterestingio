			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes!! I also have Alice in wonderland syndrome and I could almost ‘harness’ the distortions if I focused on the tunnel long enough. The room around me got stretched or shrunk at random but if I blinked or looked away it instantly reset. Freaked me out for awhile as a young kid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me, they start to disappear.  If I sit still and stare long enough, some things in my field of vision will start to blur into the rest of what I'm looking at.  I always presumed that to be some cone cells getting &quot;tired&quot; of processing the image or something along those lines.  I don't know for sure, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does that explain why when I am laying on the grass staring up at the sky on a clear day, I can see small little spots of colour flick around occasionally where I am starting?
Edit: changed ‘starting up’ to ‘staring up’.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! the brains visual cortex has got a lot going on. It is presenting that in response to light photons from sun, electric sources and more and to internal stimuli from ‘biophotons’ affects of chemicals, physical pressures etc.</p>
<p>The brain’s sharing the work load of processing signals, some synapses in your brain might be sending a few signals faster or slower, or have received a different message and so it looks like a glitch.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your colour flicks and shapes and colours at night - the phosphenes we all experience, are also what people who have migraines can experience but far more extremely, or from chemical signals changing such as from fasting, or with drugs, hallucinogens, magic mushrooms etc, these can be bright colourful and quite structured like pixels, screens, stripes, grids and stars. </p>
</li>
<li>Most incredibly, in order for us to feel we are seeing normally, our brain is constantly masking our nose from our field of sight, and overlaying and compensating for the image that would be in its place, so it does any incredible amount of processing and work to fill that in for us!</li>
</ul>
<p>Also our visual senses change and grown with us, when we are little our visual systems eyes and brain are not ready to perceive much except dark and light to begin with, our brain is only ready to perceived shapes and contrast and movement from the rod cells in eyes, before adapting to colour from the cone cells in eyes, as we both evolve and learn to see in our first year and beyond. Adding here, why people blind from birth don’t really experience phosphenes apparently, that part of cortex was not stimulated in same way, but those that lose sight later can often still do so.</p>
<p>A great question, our visual senses and brain are so awesome!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow! Thank you so much for explaining that to me :) my next question I was going to ask was going to be: Why do I see such bright and vivid colours, patterns, stars etc when I have a really bad headache, and I close my eyes and press my left and right index fingers into the sides of my nose (just above the tear duct). But you explained that clearly for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are referring  to the Blue field entoptic phenomenon. </p>
<p>ELI5: Basically, the flashes you see are caused by cells in your blood that are moving through tiny veins in the back of your eyes.</p>
<p>Interestingly, you won’t see these exactly where you are staring, because there are no veins in that specific part of your eye. You do see them in a small circle around the center, though.</p></div>		</li>
