			<div class="markdown"><p>The sundial is sort of auto-calibrated since one full revolution of the shadow will invariably take exactly 24 hours by the definition of an hour. (Well, now we know that the apparent solar day varies in length a little bit, so we use different means of standardizing time units, but it was not important in terms of required accuracy back then).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, the &quot;more precise&quot; concept of time that we have now was considered in some places as an approximation of actual time, i.e. solar time. Yes, the solar cycle varies through the year, but if your life revolves around when the sun comes up and sets, it makes sense that you'd consider this the most natural unit of time. Mechanical clocks were still useful (indoors, on cloudy days, and at night, for example), but were thought of as an approximation of the time. There were even complex mechanical clocks (called &quot;equation clocks&quot;, after the &quot;equation of time&quot;) that mechanically reproduced the variable time as it would be indicated by a sundial.</p></div>		</li>
