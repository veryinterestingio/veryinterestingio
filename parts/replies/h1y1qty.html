			<div class="markdown"><p>If this comment is too complicated then it's the same reason why leaves are green. Molecules absorb, ignore or bounce back different colors of light because of their shape. Infrared and ultraviolet are just colors we can't see, and colors that glass absorbs. Leaves absorb most colors but reflect green, so you see green light reflected.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do photons get absorbed then emitted at the opposite side of the atom?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>X-rays are a great way to think of transparency in other wavelengths of light. They pass through nearly everything, except bones and metals etc. Glass and water allow light to pass through them in the visible spectrum in the same way</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the photon just doesn’t get absorbed at all. If it was absorbed and remitted, light would be scattered in all directions out of the other side and you wouldn’t see a clear image.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, light absorption, reflection, and opacity are actually on a spectrum. While you cannot absorb half a photon, you can absorb one photon of an identical color but not the other. Some materials will be opaque to a range of colors, but more weakly at each end of the range. Additionally, when metal is heated and glows, it does not radiate colors equally and just gets brighter when it gets hotter, it actually increases the average photon energy (shifting towards UV) in addition to increasing the amount of photons it emits which make it bright.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So why does UV still &quot;hit the doorway&quot; when you don't send any Vis or IR along with it?</p>
<p>(I mean, I know why - I'm an optical physicist specialising in interaction between light and matter - specifically transmission/reflection spectra as I used to make photovoltaic cells - I'm just asking what a 5 year old might).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct.  Absorption for dyes works the same way, just interacting with specific polymer chains instead of a bulk material.  Same with chlorophyll in plants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, I gotcha. Honestly your post went a <em>little</em> over my head until I made the connection that IR and UV are basically colors outside the visible spectrum, but knowing that made it work</p></div>		</li>
