			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer so far. The main cause of crooked teeth is teeth needing more arch space than actually exists. Around 70% of Caucasians have anterior mandibular crowding, so it is more normal for these teeth to be crooked than straight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here‚Äôs my best translation of OP:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The main cause of crooked teeth is teeth needing more room in the jaw than there actually is. 70% of white folk have crowded teeth in the lower part of their mouth. This means that even ‚Äúnormal‚Äù touching of the upper and lower teeth together (called occlusion) can actually be bad.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's all interesting, though I've also heard that diet can play a role as well.  </p>
<p>In a nut shell, I believe the idea was, a diet of softer foods leads to crooked teeth, whereas a diet of foods that need adequate chewing leads to better alignment.</p>
<p>It sounds skeptical and the people I've seen talk about it are also trying to teach a technique called &quot;Mewing&quot;, which can help you define your jaw and some claim can negate the need for braces. And chewing gum does not produce the same results, as this heavily relies on the tongue movements made while chewing/swallowing to produce results.</p>
<p>I'm on the fence about this personally.  I ate a lot of grandma's overcooked roast beef growing up.  I also choked on food a lot, so I chewed my food more.  I have my Wisdom teeth and people ask if I've had braces often.  When I was younger, I did have a better jaw line and my teeth were straighter. In the last 10 years I've gotten lazy (refried beans, burgers, chili vs dry beef, beef jerky, whole beef in general) and I do notice a difference in my face/teeth.</p>
<p>It's an interesting idea, I hope to learn more about it to know if it's legit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tongue posture matters to a degree. If you put a net force of 5 grams on a tooth for 4-8 hours per day, it is possible to cause orthodontic movement of the tooth. Remember the tongue is one factor, but the face muscles and cheeks pushing is another.</p></div>		</li>
