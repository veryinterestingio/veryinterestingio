			<div class="markdown"><p>It is the site where the change of state (liq-&gt;solid or liq-&gt;gas occurs).</p>
<p>When everything is exactly the same, it can be hard for such a site to appear.  However, if there are slight (microscopic) impurities, these can disturb the system just enough to lower the energy for the phase change.</p>
<p>If you have very pure water and keep adding heat uniformly, everywhere in the solution has the same energy and no one area preferentially wants to become the first bubble site.</p>
<p>If you have a supersaturated sugar solution, it wants to crystallize because it is too saturated but no one area preferentially wants to form that first seed crystal.</p>
<p>You can help such a system by disturbing it and giving it that first area that is slightly different where the phase change can start.  After that, the disturbance spreads as bubbles form or sugar crystals form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In short it's a spot where forces change out of the steady state. In this case the ratio of cohesive and adhesive forces change and either molecules come out of solution (crystalize), change from liquid to gas (like boiling), or dissolve out (like bubbles in champagne).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nucleation means the formation of a small piece of a new material phase.</p>
<p>In the case of water boiling, nucleation means creating the smallest stable bubble of steam.</p>
<p>When you make the steam bubble, you make two things: the bubble volume and the bubble surface. The surface costs energy to make, while the volume is favored to make.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you can buy a bottle of distilled water and leave it outside in the winter to try it at home. It’s also possible with normal water bottles but I’ve only been able to get it to work with distilled</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember the time I saw this it blew my mind. Temperature was maybe 10F one morning, got into my car, noticed a totally liquid water bottle sitting in the cup holder. Astonished, I picked it up and watched it freeze in a wave of crystal formation right before my eyes. Slower than I would have expected, it probably took a few seconds to get from one end of the bottle to the other. Very cool physics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a fun trick you can leave an unopened soda bottle in a freezer, get it to the freezing point without actually freezing (it is still liquid) and when you pour it into a glass it turns into a slushie.</p>
<p>Also works with alcohol if you're into that sort of thing.</p></div>		</li>
