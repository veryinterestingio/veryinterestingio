			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll take this one step further and add you can calculate the base of the clouds by (temperature - dew point) /2.5x1000 = cloud base in thousands of feet. Temperature must be in celcius.  If you want to use Fahrenheit you have to devide by 4.4.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the standard atmosphereric lapse rate is 2 degrees celcius per 1000ft.  I'm not sure why thats different from the 2.5 used in cloud base calculations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dry adiabatic lapse rate : 2C/1000ft </p>
<p>Saturated adiabatic lapse rate : 3C/1000ft </p>
<p>Generally for flights we plan for 2C/1000ft of temperature loss. It’s normally pretty close as a rule of thumbs, but the Air Force weather nerds and NOAA do a really awesome job of predicting and measuring temps at altitude, normally within a degree or so. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, yes it does. That's what the standard lapse rate is. But it's only a rule of thumb. Another is that atmospheric pressure drops by 1&quot; of mercury per thousand feet. And that only works up to about 15,000 ft. That's how altimeters work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait. Just stop everything. Is this the same reason why there is always such a clean line on the mirror when you're taking a shower above which the mirror is fogged up and below isn't? And as the room continues to heat up the line slowly shifts down? Because I have been trying to find out why this happens since I was a kid, lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that’s close but not quite what’s happening. In a smaller area like a contained room, the warm, damp air rises and is contained by the ceiling. Then it condenses on the colder mirror (a vertical plane instead of the horizontal temperature layer in the sky). As the shower runs and the room gets more humid, more of the mirror fogs because it can’t rise any higher.  </p>
<p>On second thought, I just read your comment again and maybe that is what you described. Either way, nice connection you made! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I've always assumed it's because the room is heating up which I want to say allows it to hold more moisture, right? But then since you're continuing to add more moisture from the shower the imaginary horizontal line moves down as the region above becomes fully saturated. This has vexed me for so long, I've researched so much trying to find some pretty equation that would model what's going on, but I could never find anything that fit exactly. I even thought about designing an experiment where I just continually measure temperature and humidity in multiple points in the room and try to just find some differential equation that fits the data, lol. Don't ask me why, this is like the White Whale of my life, lol.</p>
<p>Edit: Oh, I forgot to add one key point that I noticed about all this. The line is only well defined when you have the shower curtain/door closed. This means that all the steam is forced upward and because of the air current being generated by the shower it displaces the air at the top of the room downward. I've surmised this because the line will <strong>not</strong> be so clearly defined if you have the curtain/door open.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh that's cool.  I guess I've never looked at my mirror when that process is happening lol.</p>
<p>In any case, yes, you're right, essentially the same function -- condensation appears when temperature and humidity reach that sweet spot, and (based on your bathroom layout) that depends on &quot;altitude&quot; lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mirrors are too small for this effect. More likely you've got convection air flow in your room from the hot water that circulates air and dries and/or heats the mirror from below. Additionally the mirror might be cooled or heated from whatever it is mounted on, which may cause a difference in fogging that starts near the mount points and grows / shrinks over time. </p></div>		</li>
