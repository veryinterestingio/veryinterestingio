<p>The surface tension is an objective measurement. If it's positive, then it's reasonable to call the material a liquid. (It will form droplets, not expand to occupy the chamber, etc.) If it goes negative, then it's reasonable to say that we've taken the liquid past the critical point.</p></div>		</li>
