			<div class="markdown"><p>All of those things get thrown away, but I think you are right to note that the bulk of the plastic trash we produce is single-use things like bottles or wrappers for random food items meant to be thrown away. If our problem is too much gargage, and we're making 10 tons of garbage one way, it's not wrong to suggest the 10,000 pounds of garbage made a different way would be a nicer problem to deal with.</p>
<p>But then we wouldn't be able to get a dozen individually plastic-wrapped snack cakes for less than $3 and they wouldn't last for 3 or 4 weeks on the shelf. Humans are really bad at making short-term sacrifices for long-term solutions.</p></div>		</li>
