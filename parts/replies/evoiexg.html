			<div class="markdown"><p>The entire reason that the character chef was killed off so suddenly was because the voice actor was a scientologist. He hated the Scientology episode and quit when they refused to pull it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And they totally(and hilariously) lambasted him in the episode where chef was joining a cult and killed off.  The spliced sound clips of his speech were janky and awkward and amazing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was a joke, because they knew for sure that Scientology was going to go after them.  Obviously it was still helmed by Matt and Trey; they voice most of the characters!</p></div>		</li>
