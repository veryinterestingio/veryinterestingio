			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I was going to say. It's not universal yet but it is definitely considered the world language and is insanely popular for business and media entertainment. </p>
<p>I lived in germany for a while and people there love english. What's cool is that someone from Germany can meet someone from France in Italy, and they can order their beers in english. It's a middle ground that most people are somewhat familiar with. For incompatible less popular languages in europe, it can be a lifesaver for both parties to have a bit of common ground in english. </p>
<p>Lastly, spelling and grammar is very situational and weird in english, but overall I think it's easy to speak and learn for most people compared to other languages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basic spoken English actually does have some pretty consistent rules, but more to the point English is quite tolerant of linguistic rulebreaking, such that even if the English isn't &quot;perfect&quot; it's still quite intelligible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Judging by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis" target="_blank">input hypothesis</a>, the complexity of grammar rules play a smaller role in language acquisition than it may seem at first. The fact that it's so easy to get access to English content is such a huge benefit that it vastly outweighs the idiosyncrasies of the language when it comes to learning. By that measure, English should be by far the easiest language to learn.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In a few years/decades it might shift to Chinese, though that one might be a harder sell because of how different it is structurally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whatever language creates the information era basically  becomes permanent.</p>
<p>English overtook French as the language of trade and international law right before the internet/information era.  Programming syntax, science, and most of the content on the internet is English.</p>
<p>English basically is the dominant global language, Spanish and Chinese will be regional at most, but most Spanish and Chinese native speakers will still learn English.</p>
<p>There may be some really interesting commingling of Spanish and English in the Western Hemisphere in the next couple hundred years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless Chinese adopts a consistent phonetic alphabet, it will never survive as a medium of common communication.</p>
<p>Being a tonal language complicates this even further. <del>Some people are in fact tone deaf which would cause all sorts of unnecessary miscommunication both ways.</del> It's a beautiful language in concept, but people in English get tripped the fuck up on things like their there and they're. That's a hundred times more common in Mandarin.</p>
<p>The fact that they still use modern hieroglyphs to write when even ancient civilizations like the Maya and Egyptians developed their hieroglyphs into phonemes is honestly ridiculous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here is a Chinese poem using Chinese Hanzi:</p>
<p>《施氏食狮史》</p>
<p>石室诗士施氏，嗜狮，誓食十狮。氏时时适市视狮。十时，适十狮适市。 是时，适施氏适市。氏视是十狮，恃矢势，使是十狮逝世。氏拾是十狮尸，适石室。石室湿，氏使侍拭石室。石室拭，氏始试食是十狮尸。食时，始识是十狮，实十石狮尸。试释是事。</p>
<p>Here is the same Chinese poem, written phonetically:</p>
<p>« Shī Shì shí shī shǐ »</p>
<p>Shíshì shīshì Shī Shì, shì shī, shì shí shí shī. Shì shíshí shì shì shì shī. Shí shí, shì shí shī shì shì. Shì shí, shì Shī Shì shì shì. Shì shì shì shí shī, shì shǐ shì, shǐ shì shí shī shìshì. Shì shí shì shí shī shī, shì shíshì. Shíshì shī, Shì shǐ shì shì shíshì. Shíshì shì, Shì shǐ shì shí shì shí shī. Shí shí, shǐ shí shì shí shī shī, shí shí shí shī shī. Shì shì shì shì.</p>
<p>Now, obviously this is an extreme example, but written Chinese has a problem: There are too many homonyms! This is because Chinese syllables all consist of an initial sound followed by a final sound. There are only 23 initials and 35 finals and 4 tones.</p>
<p>Of course, Chinese combines syllables into compound words (in other words: initial + final, initial + final) to reduce homonyms and obviously with spoken Chinese homonyms aren't as much of a problem per se.</p>
<p>But if you know Chinse speakers and they say a word without context, often one speaker will say, &quot;Which version of the word are you talking about?&quot; Then the other person will then have to say a common phrase with the word in it or &quot;air write&quot; the word so the other person knows what they mean. The phonetic sound of a word doesn't always convey enough information about which word it means.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is one technical reason why adopting a phonetic approach instead Hanzi will be a bit tough in Chinese.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Linguistically this is extremely wrong.</p>
<p>Tonal languages and tone deafness have nothing to do with each other. Being &quot;tone deaf&quot; means it's harder for you to recognize the details of musical pitch. It means you can't tell from hearing a note whether it's an A or a B; it doesn't mean you can't tell the difference between rising tone and falling tone.</p>
<p>Languages and writing systems are related but distinct entities. Mandarin has multiple associated writing systems. Some of them are logosyllabic, i.e. &quot;simplified Chinese&quot; and &quot;traditional Chinese&quot;. Others are alphabetical, e.g. Pinyin.</p>
<p>There is simply no reason to believe phonetic alphabets are &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot; for common communication. There is also no reason to believe there's a greater or lower incidence of confusion or miscommunication with any Chinese language compared to English or any other language. This should be self-evident in the fact that they collectively have over a billion speakers.</p>
<p>As a smaller detail, neither Chinese nor Mayan writing systems are or were hieroglpyhs - that is the name specifically for an Egyptian script.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because almost nobody was motivated by the non-ethnic/non-national sales pitch of Esperanto, particularly in the context of just how much English-speaking media there is out there. Further, Esperanto kind of failed in it's own goal of creating an inclusive language, as the language is still fundamentally European in terms of descent.</p>
<p>Beyond that; English has (arguably) transcended national/ethnic boundaries, in the sense that the language no longer &quot;belongs&quot; to the English in the same way that other languages belong to their parent countries.</p></div>		</li>
