<p>However don't steal Canada's thunder! Marpat was based on our CADPAT which was the first pixelated digital camo issued in the world :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember the first time i saw a soldier in CADPAT. It was on the parade square at Minto Armouries in Winnipeg. A Patricia walked in wearing the fabled new uniform. All training ceased for about a full minute while we all gawked.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The Army and Air Force uniforms blended in with absolutely nothing</p>

<p>This is anecdotal, but the Army ACU pattern actually blended quite well in the mountains of western Afghanistan. That was my experience anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Guess that really depends on where you’re spending your time. The ABU pattern uniform was worse than useless - but it beats the version they were considering, which was Smurf’s-asshole bright blue and grey, </p>
<p>So glad we switched to OCP.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ABUs were the most god-awful pattern and uniform I've ever worn. I still don't think OCP looks quite as slick as pressed BDUs with well-polished boots but they're miles and miles ahead of our old Airman Battle Pajamas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a shame the army didn't adopt UCP-D. My squadron was issued this pattern in northeast Afghanistan as a test, and it was infinitely better than the ACU. Odd thing was, it used the exact same pattern and colors, with the addition of brown. It basically looked like you hadn't changed your uniform in two months, but our CAG pilots recounted how they could easily pick out pieces of gear that were ACU colored, like vests and helmets, while the rest of our bodies were indistinguishable from the terrain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While the Navy's blue digital camo is hated nearly service wide, it's actually very well suited for it's original purpose:  to hide grease, oil, and paint stains.  The uniform is called the Navy Working Uniform, and often times sailors will be handling grease, oil, and paint while they work.  Unfortunately, as you mentioned, the uniform is extremely flammable and is thus barred from being worn aboard ships WHILE UNDERWAY.  It is authorized aboard ships when in port.  I hated the uniform when I wore it, but did respect its intended use once I learned what it was for.  I dirtied mine up pretty good while doing maintenance, and you could barely tell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Classic Spit n' Polish Navy.  This happens to all Navies during periods of extended peace.  Like dumping shells over the side to avoid gunnery practice because it irreversibly stains the bare-metal muzzles of guns but you can't bring all those rounds back to port because it has to go somewhere.  </p>
<p>The only uniform that should be authorized on ship in-port or underway is essentially a copy of the <a href="https://f1.media.brightcove.com/8/4221396001/4221396001_3964051568001_Oil-Rig-Christmas-Song-vs.jpg" target="_blank">North Sea rig coveralls</a>.  They are orange, and they do show dirt and grease but much less than you'd think.  They are fire-retardant and oil-repellant, because obviously working on an oil rig these are issues.  No other uniform will ever be satisfactory.</p>
<p>Military went to Off the Shelf 20 years ago and the North Sea working coveralls have been in existence for 40+.  Need a CNO or SecNav will balls, I don't think a SecDef or POTUS could get away with it.</p></div>		</li>
