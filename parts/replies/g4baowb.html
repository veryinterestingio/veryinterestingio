			<div class="markdown"><p>The smell has to do with vasodilation of the various vascular structures in your nasal cavities, which increased blood pressure or exercise can do - I’ve asked a nurse about this before because it is also the explanation behind why you can smell saline when you’re administered it intravenously</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But why does more relaxed blood vessels expose your olfactory receptors to the contents of the blood? Wouldn't it have to make the vessels more permeable to allow some of their contents to escape? Otherwise nothing new would reach the receptors</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hemoglobin is the thing in your red blood cells that transports oxygen.</p>
<p>It passively picks up oxygen in your lungs, caries it in your blood, and then drops it off in your muscles wherever oxygen is depleted due to muscle activity. This process is happening every second of your life.</p>
<p>When you do strenuous exercise, everything is happening at a faster pace, so some hemoglobin accidentally gets sperated from your red blood cells in your lungs and you breath it out into your mouth.
Hemoglobin is made of iron so your taste buds start detecting iron in your mouth. </p>
<p>This is why it is important to have iron in your diet, and why you feel weak if you are anemic (have iron deficiency) because your muscles are not getting oxygen efficicently.</p>
<p>This is all a big simplification, but it is a normal thing to happen and nothing to worry about. Same thing when you smell 'blood'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is actually not hemoglobin leaking out of cells so much as the capillary beds breaking under extreme demand. It is very minor bleeding that gets rebuilt better (denser) as your lung capacity grows and you get in shape. </p>
<p>First practice of any season I would taste blood. As you get in shape it goes away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you talk about energy storage that is very broad because the body has a multitude of energy storage and three main energy systems. But it's not about energy in this sense.
See /U/azuretaken comment. That redditor explained it more in-depth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hm. I was incredibly unfit (couldn't do a single pressup, couldn't run for more than thirty seconds) and started training. Ran until I was nearly fainting, did cardio exercises til I just about threw up, lifted weights until I literally passed out and fell over. I've never had this iron taste. I'm guessing it's specific circumstances, not just hard exercise. Or maybe I just have a terrible sense of taste when it comes to tasting iron ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I rode my bike 7 miles to work every day. Took me 25 minutes to get there and 20 minutes to get back, uphill vs down. That's not flying but it's not bad. Some days it'd be faster depending on how i felt. Every single day i tasted blood...er iron. </p>
<p>I just got used to it but it scared the crap it if me in highschool when I'd go off and spit thinking I'd be spitting out blood and just get clear saliva. My soccer coach thought I was lazy and a bit crazy because I'd stop and try to stop tasting blood before going back to practise.</p></div>		</li>
