<p>insulin is released in response to rising blood sugar</p>

<p>There's another mechanism too. There are special cells in the intestines called L cells and K cells. They can actually detect sugar in the intestinal lumen (before it is absorbed into the blood). They release molecules called incretines (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1" target="_blank">GLP-1</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_inhibitory_polypeptide" target="_blank">GIP</a>), which stimulate insulin secretion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just curious, does this mean it’s impossible for sugar free gum or diet soda to cause your body to release insulin? Someone told me it could cause issues because your body anticipates sugar but then none comes. Didn’t know enough to dispute.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's lots of studies on this. It depends on the sweetener.</p>
<p>Sucralose does, probably because it so closely mimics sucrose. Aspartame doesn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, yes.</p>
<p>There was a popular misinformation site that said that if you drink coke zero the body anticipates that you get glucose, enormous amount of insulin is released and then you get fat.</p>
<p>Every single part of that story is entirely inaccurate.</p></div>		</li>
