			<div class="markdown"><p>Blueprint isn't applicable. That's entirely the problem, is that your skin *doesn't* have a blueprint for what it is &quot;supposed&quot; to look like. So you get hurt, and your skin cells just do what they're programmed to do using chemical signals and kinda hope for the best. And since there's no central planning and everything's going by local rules, you end up with a bit of a mess, and there's no reason for your body to intentionally &quot;clean up&quot; after the mess since you technically have whole, healthy skin again.</p></div>		</li>
