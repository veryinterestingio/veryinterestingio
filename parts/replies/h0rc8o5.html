			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer here.</p>
<p>And we will add that it’s mind boggling that there’s no authentication or anything to combat spoofing, it’s all just openly trusting the caller to send the proper info.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the mid 90's a friend was trying to blue box a call from a payphone using a handheld ham radio. We were teenagers. On maybe the 10th attempt, he held the phone to his ear to see if it worked and an operator said &quot;You have to hold the speaker closer to the handset.&quot; Scared him half to death and he never tried again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a pocket voice memo device I got for Christmas as a teen.  I recorded the coin tones and went to the payphone to call all my girlfriends I met online on QLink.  It wasn't long before the phone company got smart and muted the microphone when making calls so you couldn't use that trick.  It was a pain in the ass because when you made a legit call, there was a second or two where the person couldn't hear you until your microphone turned on.</p>
<p>Another major change the phone company did around that time was stop the phone ringing for infinity.  You could call someone and if they didn't answer, the phone just kept ringing.  I ran a bulletin board and had a black box which kept the voltage at a level that stopped the phone from ringing but looked to the phone company as if I never answered.    It essentially made me have a toll free number.  The changes made to the switching equipment in late 80s put an end to that too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As annoying/infuriating as it has been, this simplicity did lead to a couple of times where the spoofer ended up spoofing <em>my own number</em>. It gave me a good chuckle on those occasions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth mentioning that caller ID is one of the worst implemented and half-assed systems I’ve ever seen. There’s a central database (technically more than one) that all carriers are supposed to send their caller ID info to and download changes made by the other carriers. The problem is, each carrier maintains their own database and has to pay every time they “dip” the national database for changes. So sometimes you have the wrong or caller ID displaying for weeks or even months because generally if there’s a name mismatch the receiving carrier will display what they think it is rather than what is outpulsed.</p>
<p>Also most cell carriers don’t even bother displaying caller ID name, just city and state. The number of companies I’ve had to explain this to and then get bitched at because of it is ridiculous. I’m not sure if stir/shaken will help this at all or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: phones only know who is calling them because the calling phone <em>tells</em> them what number it is. It's a trust-based system. Factory phone systems are not designed to lie, but with some alteration they can.</p></div>		</li>
