<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Almost all planets have the capability to have an atmosphere. Atmospheres are important because they insulate their planet and all that. However, incoming solar radiation from nearby stars easily damages this atmosphere and chips away at it quickly. A planet's magnetic field will act as a shield for the atmosphere, deflecting solar radiation and protecting it from decay. </p></div>		</li>
