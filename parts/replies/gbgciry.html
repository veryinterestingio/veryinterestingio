			<div class="markdown"><p>I started to lose hair from the top middle first. It's slowly thinning out now from the front as well. Soon I'll be full blown Picard and I ain't even mad about that now a days. Thanks to genetics from my mom's side of the family I'll end up with the good ol Picard hair.</p></div>		</li>

<p>God only made so many perfect heads.  The rest of them he covered with hair.</p>
<p>It's kind of like bodies.  Those who have a perfect body can get away with wearing less clothes and still look great.  But most of us don't have perfect bodies so we wear clothes because nobody wants to see that.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people these days with completely shaved heads whose heads just are not very attractive.  Go with the 1950's fringe around the side -- let the little hair that you do have compensate for your head.</p>
<p>That's what I do.</p></div>		</li>
