			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine a combination of dryness (air + skin), how positive charge-wise the other object/person is, how well your shoes or the floor you're standing on dissipate static and how actively you move. On the condition where people wear the same clothes and stand in the same area, people with dryer skin + more actively moving people, with longer hair would generate the most static.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dryness can matter a lot with certain materials. We worked on smart paper towel dispensors at work, and the paper storing massive static charges on dry environments was a huge problem. It would generate such a large field that eventually the MCU would freak out and reset because of it.</p></div>		</li>
