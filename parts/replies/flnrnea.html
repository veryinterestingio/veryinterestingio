<p>A well managed company will retain a cash reserve so that they can get through hard times. Not many will have enough cash reserves to get through a major disaster that virtually stops all of their income for an extended period of time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the thing that has pissed me off about Reddit during all this. All the snide comments about companies not having the cash reserves to weather 6 months of no business and expecting them to continue paying all their employees their full rates. Well run companies will have the reserves to weather a downturn for an extended period of time. No company can weather a complete stop for an extended period.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the point of all that snideness isn't to say that companies should have 6 month cash reserves, but that expecting workers to do it is impossible for a lot of people.</p>
<p>It's just as unreasonable to ask individuals to have 3-6 months wages saved up as it is to ask that of a company. I think people are just getting angry at the double standard they see in the US. We have socialism for companies (we should) and rugged individualism for people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the issue is that a lot of people are (somewhat) comparing apples to oranges in terms of risk and stability. An individual is much more likely to be out of a job and would need to tap on that 3-month emergency fund. An established business (generally) only needs to use emergency funds in &quot;catastrophic failure&quot; situations like these. The higher risk of income-flow disruptions as an individual makes it more crucial to have larger emergency funds. In addition, a company investing in itself with money will do a lot more to expand its net worth in the long run than an individual.</p>
<p>Plus, businesses also know that in cases of catastrophic failure, they can hold us as hostages and demand to be bailed out. We as individuals can't, so even if it's unreasonable, we still need to have that emergency fund saved up for our own sake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue is this: People say &quot;save up for your emergency fund so you won't have as much trouble when you're unemployed&quot;. </p>
<p>Then they see companies getting bailouts, which makes them think &quot;why do I need to save for a random unforseen emergency, but these corporations can expect help as soon as they need it?&quot;</p>
<p>It's about exposing hypocrisy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True.  A well-run company not only has some healthy cash reserves, they also have insurance.    </p>
<p>Of course, that doesn't help if the insurers are overwhelmed and collapse too.  Which is what caused a big part of the last financial crisis, and is true in this one as well.  That's when the government has to step in. They are essentially the insurer of last resort.   </p>
<p>A hard-line libertarian or conservative should take the position of &quot;<em>Well, they aren't strong enough to survive a disaster, so let them fail! It will leave an unfulfilled demand that the freeeeeee market will fulfill in the end, and the economy will be stronger as a result! Let the weak die off and strengthen the herd!</em>&quot;</p>
<p>Strangely, I'm not hearing that much, and that doesn't seem to be how they are voting in Congress. It's almost like they are willing to sacrifice their principles when their net worth suddenly plummets like a pig running off a cliff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why I have a hard time taking libertarians seriously. They don't live in reality. The fact of the matter is that restarting any sort of business takes time, a lot of time. If they all suddenly go away, no one has work. It will take years to rebuild it and during that time no one can eat and our society falls apart. Our current state of legal and social constructs and way of life evolved from a lot of mistakes and people will continue to make mistakes. One of those mistakes was having no regulations, you know, the libertarian paradise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With all due respect, there's a difference between letting 1% of your companies fail in a recession, and letting 50%. The Bush Admin let Lehman Brothers fail. They rejected the bail out request. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it were the companies failing in a free market, that would be one thing. In the US, we have many state and local governments forcing businesses to cease all operations. </p>
<p>It's not fair to call a company weak when the government mandates that they make 0 income while the company still has overhead expenses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also a government mandated shutdown of more or less the entire economy nation (merica) wide. While reality is that staying open would probably be worse for humanity and the economy, it's not a fact..... Just a very reasonable expectation. </p>
<p>So if we were free to stay open, even if most people self quarantined, and 5% of us died, chances are good that there would be many fewer companies going bankrupt (and laying off their entire workforce, defaulting loans, welching on accounts payable and other debts) than what we'd have / will have with many months of government mandated shutdowns.</p></div>		</li>
