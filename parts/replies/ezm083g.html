			<div class="markdown"><p>Although as I understand it, that's not always what you want. Because microwaves work efficiently on water but not on ice, and also tend to have hotspots, one of the purposes for the duty cycle is to heat up whatever parts of the food aren't frozen, and then turn off and wait for the heat to spread throughout the food, so you don't end up with certain parts being super-hot and other parts still frozen. A reduced-power magnetron isn't really going to fix that problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reduced power works just as well.  The heat spreading process (heat diffusion) occurs whether the microwave source is on or off.  It just takes time.  Running at a lower power also provides more spreading time per joule delivered.</p></div>		</li>
