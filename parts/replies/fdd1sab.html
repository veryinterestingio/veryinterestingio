			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah capillaries.</p>
<p>Think of arteries and veins as being combined into like a two-way road. The main arteries and veins are like the big interstate highway, with hundreds of exits/on-ramps branching off. Off the highway, the roads that connect to the exits and on-ramps are also connected, so if you get off the highway you can get back on. </p>
<p>And even if you blocked off some point on the interstate highway, the rest of the highway up to that point can still function as normal, it makes no difference. Cars will still exit on the exits and enter on the on-ramps of the surviving portion of the highway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From an artery it flows into many arterioles (very small arteries). The arterioles each supply many, many capillaries so small they may cause the blood cells to flow single file in a line. The oxygen bound to the hemoglobin is free to diffuse into the tissues here and carbon dioxide and other wastes diffuse back into the blood. Next come venules, tiny, tiny veins. Many venules feed back into each small vein and many small veins feed each larger vein until the blood reaches the right side of the heart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's valuable to point out that veins are not directly connected to arteries in a true 'closed-loop' circuit but rather are bridged by capillaries (the structure that does the exchange of cells and materials in the blood).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more like branching from big arteries to small ones to arterioles into capillaries then reconnecting into venules then veins.  </p>
<p>(at least as far as red blood cells are concerned. Some fluid leaks into the tissue 'sponge' and gets collected back into the bloodstream by the lymphatic system.)</p></div>		</li>
