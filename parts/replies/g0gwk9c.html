			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly why length is more important than special characters though.  </p>
<p>In your example, 36<em> 36</em> 36<em> 36</em> 36 for a 5 character password = 60,466,176 possibilities. </p>
<p>77<em> 77</em> 77<em> 77</em> 77= 2,706,784,157 possibilities. So adding the special characters gives you 44x as many possibilities for the same length password. </p>
<p>However, simply by making it a 6 digit password instead of 5, you end up with:</p>
<p>36<em> 36</em> 36<em> 36</em> 36* 36=2,176,782,336 - nearly equivalent to the 5 digit password with 77 possible characters being used.  At 7 digits long, you have now drastically exceeded the combinations possible with a 5 digit password using special characters, and that’s without using any special characters in your 7 digit code (78,365,164,096 / 2,706,784,157 = 29x greater possibilities than just adding special characters, and a whopping 1,296x as many possibilities as the 5 digit - again, without special characters).</p>
<p>Now, given the same length passwords, obviously having the option for special characters greatly increases your possibilities.  But overall, length of password affects things far more.</p>

<p>Edit #2 since this blew up : this is ELI5, not an Infosec sub.  I could go into a LOT more detail here but this post was for a high level layman's terms breakdown, not a &quot;WELL BUT WHAT ABOUT ACKCHTUALLY&quot;.  Chill out people.  I'm aware.</p>
<p>Edit #3 : go check out r/information_security or r/infosec if you’d like to delve into further detail than this here.  Stuff like this is literally an entire discipline / degree path, pays quite well, can be extremely rewarding intellectually, etc.  Also go check out the “<a href="https://talosintelligence.com/podcasts/shows/beers_with_talos" target="_blank">Beers with Talos</a>” Cisco podcast, or <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/" target="_blank">Unit42</a> from Palo Alto Networks.  If you already have a degree or can’t afford to get one, a CISSP / CEH / CompTIA Security+ / CISA certification is a great way to get your career going on that path.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, in a larger sense...  having people generally remember their passwords is a vital part of security.  If people frequently forget their passwords and have to do unusual stuff to reset them to the point where unusual password resets become normalized, that becomes another potential security vulnerability (one that completely bypasses the password's strength.)</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why the requirements for frequent password changes and unusual characters are misguided.  Requiring frequent password changes in particular adds almost no security and create considerable vulnerabilities because they encourage people to use simple, easily-remembered passwords.  Yes, it can help you if your password was compromised, but the goal of a password policy should be to prevent that in the first place.</p>
<p>And more generally, any security / password scheme should be seen as a trade-off between convenience for users and security.  Requiring constant password changes is a <em>pain in the ass</em> for users while providing only minimal security benefit, so it's a bad trade-off - you would be better off &quot;spending&quot; that annoyance elsewhere, like longer password requirements, encouraging / requiring a secure password manager, or using a 2FA app.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't.<br />
Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but what tend to happen is the following :   </p>
<ol>
<li>A database containing the association between mail and hashed (encrypted) passwords is stollen. (If the hacker is lucky, the website even store password in plain text. Don't trust website that can send you your password, that usually means that your password is stored in plain text.)  </li>
<li>If the hacker know how to hash a password, he can try every possible passwords, and see it the hash match one in the database.  </li>
<li>For each match, he knows the password of the account. He can even try it on other websites, as users tends to reuse their password everywhere.  </li>
</ol>
<p>So there is three things that can make life harder for hackers  :  </p>
<ol>
<li>Better security from the website, to prevent database leekage.  </li>
<li>More &quot;robust&quot; password : ones that won't be tested first.  </li>
<li>Something called &quot;salt&quot;. Take a look at this video that explain it :  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--tnZMuoK3E" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--tnZMuoK3E" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--tnZMuoK3E</a></a>.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We (hackers i guess) will still utilize brute force, but its more or less low hanging fruit. Typically we will try to enumerate the domain, gaining all of the usernames. From there. i kinda guess what the lockout is. I know I have at least 2 incorrect guesses before I get locked out. I then use a really common password like &quot;summer2020&quot; but I guess that across all accounts at the company. I just need to compromise one account. There are 15 users at every organization who have some stupid password like that. If I'm lucky, that account is root or domain administrator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't just try random characters. Most people do not use a unique password which means that you can expect to brute force a password pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Lists of passwords used in a brute force attack usually come from 3 sources:<br />
1) Previously leaked email/username and password combinations</p>
<p>2) Default passwords and usernames (especially when trying to gain access to routers/modems or network connected household devices)</p>
<p>3) Most common passwords</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These days, dictionaries are based on leaked passwords, and cracking tools make guesses based on common patterns, like adding the symbol to the start or end to a word, replacing a with @, etc. </p>
<p>So if anyone else used your password, even with a couple changes, it's still likely to get broken.</p>
<p>This is a real problem if you reuse passwords on different sites. someone will take username/password pairs that leaked from some frivolous site with poor security, and try them places that matter, like online banking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair though, if a given password requirement simply <strong><em>allows</em></strong> special characters you end up with that 36 character possibility regardless of whether or not a person makes use of them. </p>
<p>If I arbitrarily choose not to use the character set (a, b, c, 1, 2, 3) in any of my passwords that possibility is still 36 characters because it’s still <strong><em>possible</em></strong> I used them from an outsiders perspective. If we use the argument that my omitting then does reduce the character set, we can also only say there is one possible combination to any password since the fact the first character you picked is “a” excludes the other 35 from the set of possible characters. </p>
<p>The real advantages are gained by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The service simply allowing as many characters as possible, which like you said increases the pool of each character. </p>
</li>
<li>Your second point, which is that it means your password won’t be a dictionary word. Though things like “p@ssw0rd” might as well be dictionary words anyway. </li>
</ul>
<p>The best thing a user can do is have a long password, use a different password for every account, and use a secure password manager like Dashlane or LastPass. </p>
<p>I can’t stand when I create a password only to be met with a pop up that says “Password must be 16 characters or less” - like seriously? </p>
<p>Props to places like Minecraft which happily took my 160-something character password.</p>
<p>Bonus: STOP FORCING PEOPLE TO PERIODICALLY CHANGE PASSWORDS. </p>
<p>A password doesn’t become inherently less secure through age unless it leaks out somehow. Forcing users to change passwords just encourages easy to remember passwords. “Password1” <strong><em>password has expired please enter new password</em></strong> fine “Password2” now just let me log in so I can start working so I can send this document to Nick in accounting!</p>
<p>Beyond that, if an intruder does gain access, once the password changes they’ll have preeeetttyyyyy good idea where to start guessing.</p></div>		</li>
