<p>Not right. </p>
<p>Cancerous tumours can produce various of toxins, some as a side effect of how they produce energy and some as an apparently &quot;intentional&quot; means of stopping the healthy cells around them from competing for that energy. </p>
<p>A very large cancerous tumour can produce enough toxins to overwhelm your body and cause organ failures from a distance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of ways to die :(. Unfortunately. As others have mentioned, blood clots caused by hyper coagulability is a common issue. Also, there are types that if left untreated can cause large necrotic skin wounds that can get infected, which could lead to sepsis and death. We don't see that kind of thing much in places with health insurance.</p></div>		</li>
