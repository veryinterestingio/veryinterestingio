			<div class="markdown"><p>my chemistry is super basic but are Epoxides and Ethers &quot;stable&quot; ? I don't see any outbound arrows from them, and my mind feels like processing that like &quot;these compounds have no way of reacting to become other compounds&quot; </p>
<p>edit: extra word</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that flow chart just isn’t exhaustive. For example, strong acids dissolved in water will react with epoxides to form 2 alcohol groups. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Firstly, an epoxide is a type of ether (though they are considered different as epoxides are not representative of all ethers).</p>
<p>Epoxides are highly  reactive, owing to the strained 3 membered ring system they have. </p>
<p>Ethers however tend to be fairly unreactive, though they are more reactive than alkanes. They do not undergo reactions with bases or dilute acids, active metals, or the vast majority of oxidants/reductants. They can be hydrolysed however, using strong bases or mineral acids, to yield an alcohol and an alkane. They may also be converted to peroxides when stored in the presence of oxygen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's definitely the right kind of thing.  Mine was a bit simpler than that, I don't think we got into things like epoxides and acid anhydrides so spatially it was laid out closer to the bottom half of <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a0/85/07/a085078250f90db2b30e4d0edc01680d.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>, but yours is absolutely the type of content I was looking for (reaction conditions labeled along the arrows and so on).</p>
<p>Edit: I had to try recreating the layout, I think it was something like <a href="https://imgur.com/0Gl127d" target="_blank">this</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've pushed around the layout of some of the reactions in the map /u/skinbin posted, I'm pretty sure it looked something like <a href="https://imgur.com/0Gl127d" target="_blank">this</a>.  If you squint at it it kind of looks like a sailboat, the syntheses between alcohols and carboxylic acids makes the waterline and so on.</p></div>		</li>
