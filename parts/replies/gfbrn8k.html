			<div class="markdown"><p>My pleasure and I'm glad it was informative! </p>
<p>It's a tough balance to eli5 a complex topic that even experts don't have perfect information or agreement on.</p>
<p>I noticed a lot of people were answering with the chronic effects or treatments rather than the broad mechanism of damage. So I thought I'd give a crack at it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey</p>
<p>I work with a lot of power tools (ex: gas powered jackhammer) for a living and one thing they always warn us about is to take breaks/switch tasks if we start to feel that sensation because it could cause nerve damage and potentially tendonitis.</p>
<p>Just wanted to throw that out there. Stay safe about it. The tingling is not a sign of something great if you ignore it and keep going.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you very much for this heads up! Although it doesn't apply to me on a regular basis, there are occasions where I might be exposed to similar circumstances, and it's good to know that this is a serious warning of potential long term danger!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you spend too long and the vibrations are intense enough.</p>
<p>This is why people using jackhammers on the street have to take a lot of breaks. If you keep going for too long <em>not all</em> of that numbness will go away in the end. The damage tends to be light per-instance but will accumulate, and so safety protocols and regulations are in place to keep you from reaching that point. It's not always readily apparent when you're doing it after all, and your bosses certainly don't think there's a problem <em>ever</em> do they?</p>
<p>So having more insulation between you and the source of vibration (like thick padded gloves and rubber-foam handles versus &quot;just grab that metal thing to hold it steady there&quot;) will reduce the hazard and extend the time you can safely use it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're just doing your yard once in a while, you probably aren't inflicting enough damage to become permanent, but if you're doing more, like a landscaper or something,  this is certainly a source of nerve damage or repetitive injuries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, remember that the body heals itself from damage all the time. </p>
<p>So the amount of damage and duration of the injury isn't as cut and dry as permanent injury on every exposure.</p></div>		</li>
