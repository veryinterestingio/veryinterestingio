			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also because frozen water molecules are harder to put energy into than liquid water.  So when the microwave happens to thaw a particular area, that area will get disproportionately more of the energy put into it then the bits that are still frozen. Which is why your food can be molten lava on some parts and still frozen in others. Cooking at a lower power level lets thermal conduction happen between the hot and cold parts which can smooth out these differences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. I always defrost frozen meals at 50% power for 10mins and then stir and blip as required. Stirring moves the frozen bits in the centre towards the outside where they can get heated better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yep, this is why a lot of pre-packaged frozen meals say to do the same thing.  Heat as is, remove film and stir, replace film and heat some more.  Only some areas get heated, so you stir and let the heat spread on its own, before applying more.</p>
<p>On top of that, ice does not absorb the microwave's energy very well, so only the melted water gets it and it takes time for the heat to distribute and melt the ice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you don't have one, buy an inverter model for your next microwave.</p>
<p>It seems most people never change the power setting, but if you're someone that does then it makes a huge difference. The inverter models run continuously with less power instead of cycling on and off like non-inverter models.</p>
<p>This avoids the &quot;it's boiling/spitting everywhere — oh, now it's doing nothing&quot;. Lower power settings work amazing on them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not tuned &quot;specifically&quot; but water is particularly great at retaining heat and absorbing radiation in general. It also transfers heat fairly well between neighboring water molecules. As a result, when you use a microwave, it tends to work better on things that have a fair amount of moisture in it. Lipids do this as well, and my post was meant to be overly simplistic - since this is ELI5 and the poster was specifically asking about water.</p></div>		</li>
