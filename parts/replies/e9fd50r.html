			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that's true. So I guess it's really more about the longevity and severity of the trauma and those particular circumstances that made these symptoms so specific to WW1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where my mother grew up (mid- Atlantic states in the US, 1960s), there was a man named Percy. Percy couldn't talk. He never stopped twitching. He couldn't take care of himself very well. His parents had died, and his taxes sure never got paid, but the city never seized his house. He would sometimes sleep in his house, if he could remember how to let himself in... otherwise he was usually outside somewhere or on the porch of a sympathetic neighbor. The local drugstore would get a hot meal ready for him 3 times a day, but he rarely paid a cent for it. </p>
<p>Percy was a shellshocked WWI veteran. The town looked after him because the alternative was institutionalization, and without any treatment available, it was considered more merciful to let him be with his community. At least he could get fresh air and smile occasionally at the kids coming home from school. </p>
<p>He'd been a teenager when the war happened, and he simply never left it. It was half a century later! And remember, American troops were only in the war for a few months. If it could hollow Percy out in less than a year, just imagine what it could do to some Russian or French soldiers who were under bombardment for months at a time. </p>
<p>I think of Percy whenever anyone says a war ended on such-and-such a date. No. Wars last as long as the last life they ruined.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dan Carlin has done episodes on WW1 in which he discusses the novelty of so much sustained artillery fire and the misclassification of shell shock as a type of cowardice.  Hardcore History is the podcast title. Episodes 50-55 are Blueprint for Armageddon, the WW1 series. Long but worth it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Blueprint for Armageddon series is incredible and well worth the time. The way he presents the information really keeps you engaged and it's a great way to learn about not only how it was on the front lines but the geopolitics involved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard so much about hardcore history but I've never listened to it. I usually focus on comedy podcasts and only have so many hours I can devote to listening but this one really intrigues me. Do you know if that podcast is available on a app like podcast addict?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even the cold and brutal generals of the day eventually recognized that you couldn't let your soldiers sit under constant artillery for months and expect them to be even sort of functional at the end.</p>

<p>Oh, I don't know about that.  I'm sure Luigi Cadorna, Conrad von HÃ¶tzendorf, and Douglas Haig would've been happy to give the most weary troops a stirring speech, a sandwich, and then sending them straight back to the front.</p></div>		</li>
