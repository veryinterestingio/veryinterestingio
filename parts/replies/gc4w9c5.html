			<div class="markdown"><p>But logistically you're then faced with trying to get the vast majority of countries in the world to agree to that, and there isn't much we do agree on. All it takes is a few countries in important areas to see the tourism potential and allow them to dock, and you've a functioning industry again</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: most cruise ships have electric propulsion already: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azipod" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azipod</a></p>
<p>The main issue is how they make their electricity, with which fuel, and how dirty that fuel is. Efficiency is another issue; a large cruise ship carries 3000-4000 passengers plus another 1000-1500 crewmembers but uses 8 to 10 megawatts. This is as much power as a city of 30,000,  even when tied up at the dock. <a href="https://www.danskehavne.dk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/GP-CMP-Shoreside-Report.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.danskehavne.dk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/GP-CMP-Shoreside-Report.pdf</a></p>
<p>There is currently no portable electricity storage option that has even a fraction of that capacity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I come from a country that relies heavily on international tourism, and I think covid is a wake up call, that countries should try to diversify and not put all their eggs in one basket.</p>
<p>Not agreeing with OP, but if the industry were to die, organically, perhaps from a reputation damaged by covid, those countries would be forced to make changes.</p></div>		</li>
