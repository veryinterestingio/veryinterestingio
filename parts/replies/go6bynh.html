			<div class="markdown"><p>Thermal shock isn't rare. It's just some glass dishes are tempered, most aren't. And a lot of refrigerators have glass shelves. Thermal shock works both ways. Something very cold touches something very hot, which ever is weakest cracks or in some cases explodes.  It's why you don't pull a hot glass dish out of the oven and set it on a cool counter top or pour hot water on an icy windshield.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You use pads or something else that won't conduct heat away from the dish extremely quickly like a flat countertop will. Different countertop materials will be worse for it, stone counters are worse than wood since they will conduct more heat away faster. What happens is part of the glass cools much faster than another part and that causes it to shrink while the other part that's still warm is still expanded from being warm. This puts an extreme amount of stress on the glass and can cause a crack, and sometimes when that crack happens, all of the stress is released at once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use my sous vide device to circulate the water to keep the water moving and thus maximize the cool rate. Which is probably silly, this water method alone is enough to get the food through the danger zone in short enough time, but why not do it if you can?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, theoretically if it's summer time and the a/c is on it will have to compensate for the heat given off by the food into the house just like the refrigerator does.  Granted, it's negligible either way.
Regarding putting hot dishes in a cold fridge, surely most people are transferring leftovers to a different storage container anyway in the vast majority of situations.
The main reason I let things cool to near room temperature (1-2 hours on average) is for food quality.  If you enclose the food and refrigerate (or even enclose it and refrigerate after a little while) the steam condensates and drastically affects the product.  Of course, it depends on the type of food too. If it's something fried, i'll let it cool completely (3-4 hours) bc condensation ruins leftovers. If it's something i want to stay moist i'll cover relatively early bc a little condensation won't hurt and might even help.  Other things i'll cover loosely but then cover with a dry lid in a new container after cooled.</p></div>		</li>

<p>While we are being pedantic and precise, you'll have to move the heat twice if you stick it in the fridge.  Once from the fridge into the room, and the a second time from the room to outside.  I think?  Correct me if I am wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if you cool it to room temp, the a/c removes the heat given off to that point. Then you refrigerate, so the fridge removes the remaining heat and the a/c then removes that heat. If you refrigerate right away, the fridge does more work but there's less heat given off initially on the counter. The total amount of heat transfer should be the same ultimately right?  Idk, this is a silly conversation haha.  The only thing i care about is the condensation from putting hot food in a bag/ container.</p></div>		</li>
