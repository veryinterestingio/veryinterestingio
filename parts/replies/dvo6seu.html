			<div class="markdown"><p>If someone more qualified than me comes along, PLEASE correct me. To my understanding, Hawking proposed a lot of theories (both accepted and refuted) that have opened a lot of questions with cosmology and quantum mechanics. He did a lot of 'probing' per say, which inspired a lot of research and further investigation. Additionally (and more famously), he was a HUGE figure in black hole theory, and is comparable to the Issac Newton or James Clerk Maxwell of black holes.</p>
<p>Overall Hawking has been a gift to this world and we should be eternally grateful for his contributions. I don't like to jus go out and say &quot;X was the best/most influential physicist&quot; because the quantity and complexity of questions answered fluctuates wildly across the greats, but I would consider Hawking to within the top 50 or 40 physicists in all of history. A more accurate and better description is: he is one of the most, if not the most influential physicist following the modern era. For sure, though, he is a titan in the field of astrophysics and cosmology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More than likely the most influential since Einstein. Between his work in physics, the success of his book, and his battle with his disease his stardom in physics is something we will likely not see for some time.</p>
<p>Not to mention his public persona, his many appearances in pop-culture and the recent feature length film on his life which helped define him as a cultural icon.</p>
<p>Edit: I was referring to his ability to inspire the general public, not necessarily his work in physics alone. Which is why I included other aspects of his life. The success of his book alone has inspired a generation, and he was likely the most prominent public figure in Physics at the time of his death.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Personally I would say this would be Feynman, but Hawking was certainly up there. I would say most of Hawking's works were not very progressive or influential in the field of physics -- rather interesting or thought-provoking.  Mostly he was lauded for his tenacious dedication to his work despite his disability.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With all due respect to Hawking, there have definitely been more influential physicists since Einstein. If you are talking about the quality of physics, he isn't really on par with the likes of Dirac, Feynman, or even Oppenheimer. If we are talking about public influence, then you are speaking with an insane amount of recent bias I am guessing, and not fully familiar with what Feynman and Sagan were doing before years ago. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On Arxiv (basically the place where all high energy physics papers are published before being peer reviewed) you can see most of the recent papers Hawking worked on</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/find/hep-th/1/au:+Hawking_S/0/1/0/all/0/1" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/find/hep-th/1/au:+Hawking_S/0/1/0/all/0/1</a></p>
<p>You can see a lot of work with James Hartle, who wrote a good undergrad level book on General Relativity. To me the name Thomas Hertog jumps out, who is a professor at the KU Leuven in Belgium and who taught the courses I took in General Relativty and Cosmology. He was a PHD student of his.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hawking was an excellent scientist, and just about anyone working in physics today would be happy to have his record of accomplishments. His primary contributions were in the area of black hole mechanics, including the singularity theorems and Hawking radiation. He also did a great deal of interesting  theoretical work in cosmology, but we don't currently have any way of telling whether the models he proposed are correct.</p>
<p>With that said, I don't think we can call Stephen Hawking one of the all-time greats like Einstein, Newton, or Maxwell, who revolutionized multiple unrelated fields of physics. His work was significantly more localized in subject matter and theoretical, and most of it has not been empirically confirmed (although his black hole research is almost certain to be correct).</p>
<p>Of course, his contributions as an explainer of science to the public and as an ambassador for scientists as a group should not be neglected. But they do give some people the impression that he was even greater than he actually was as a physicist.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This will not happen again in physics though, due to the fact that each topic is so specialised its simply not possible any more. This is the problem with these kinds of discussions - in people's top 10 most influential physicists of all time, 'greatest minds', surely about half of them would have been working in the region 1900-1950. We didn't have a bumper harvest of great minds, there are a whole range of environmental and circumstantial factors at play.</p>
<p>Same goes with the fact that much of Hawking's work is not empirically verified. If two people each have an idea, and we have the technological capacity to test one and not the other, that doesn't mean the second idea is any weaker in terms of depth of intellectual thought or originality. That's just another arbitrary circumstance.</p>
<p>So while yes you are right, he doesn't have the sheer weight of impact across many fields that people like Maxwell and Einstein did, but I don't think that should necessarily diminish his right to be compared to those people as an original thinker. Science has changed since those days and if we only think in those terms we will never have another 'great' again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think thats really true. Edward Witten is probably very close to the same level of Einstein, Newton or Maxwell in that respect. He made multiple contributions to QFT and particle physics before initiating the String Theory revolution. I think you can include the Ads/CFT correspondence as its own field, which he also made many contributions to, even if it uses String Theory on one side of the duality.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree completely.</p>
<p>Einstein was at his most productive in the 1920s or so.</p>
<p>Von Neumann was at his best in the 40s-60s.</p>
<p>Feynman just kept going, and he was also all over the place.</p>
<p>We had some magic in the beginning of the century and during the wars, but nothing has really changed, we could see another Feynman or von Neumann in our lifetimes, but they would more likely be talented at using computers to solve models we never tried to solve before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll start with some of his accomplishments: He was one of the first people to propose primordial black holes along with Carr, Zel'dovich and Novikov, which if observed could give us a window into the early universe, and may even be dark matter. Perhaps his most well-known work is the proposition that black holes radiate as black bodies (ie Hawking radiation), generalizing the work of Unruh. This has led to the creation of the lively subfield of black hole thermodynamics and information theory. He is also one of the founders of quantum cosmology (the idea that you can have a wave function representation of expanding spacetime) along with Hartle, Wheeler and DeWitt.</p>
<p>As for how he compares against the greats... this is not to belittle his accomplishments in any way, of which there were obviously many, but none of his predictions have ever been experimentally verified. A lot of people here are comparing Hawking to the likes of Einstein, but honestly, from a working physicist who is familiar with his work, he doesn't even come close. Einstein's ideas represented a fundamental shift in our understanding of the universe, and have been verified over and over again. There are many others who have fundamentally altered our view of the universe (and have been vindicated by experiment) that many laymen have probably never heard of before (Maxwell, Dirac, de Broglie, Bohr, Heisenberg, Friedman/Robertson/Walker, Weinberg/Salam, Yang/Mills, Noether, Gell-Mann, and these are just some prominent theorists of the last century, there are many more great minds behind every groundbreaking experiment, like Wu, Hubble, Ruben, Weiss, Rutherford, Thompson, etc). Until his ideas are verified, they're just untested hypotheses (though nobody in the field seriously doubts Hawking radiation isn't real). Hawking's contributions, while very interesting in their own right, are not the ground-breaking game-changers that revolutionized physics.</p>
<p>That said, I'd say he's probably one of the most influential scientists of the century, not only because of his interesting work, but also because the man is an example of perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds. Not only did he manage to survive, but he pushed the boundaries of human knowledge. That's something we can all aspire to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pure theory should not be regarded as any way inferior to empirically verified proofs. Sometimes, it is far more impressive than the latter, because one can only use the mind to develop theory, whilst testable hypotheses can more readily be refined by observed errors in experimentation. </p>
<p>Pure theory is often the first step down a long road which eventually culminates in experimental verification, and can require deeper, more concentrated thought than most people are capable of. To construct theoretical models in the mind, without the benefit of being able to point to concrete examples of them in the physical world, is imho, among the most astounding things sentience has accomplished, and Hawking was one of the masters at it. </p>
<p>Think about how Einstein finally became a household name when an ecclipse experimentally verified his theoretical predictions. His predictions were only so far ahead that they could be verified within his own lifetime. Hawkings may take dozens or hundreds of lifetimes to experimentally verify or refute. That's how much further ahead his thinking was than most people's. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that we are comparing him completely on the merits directly to people like Einstein despite his disability says loads about him. I can’t even imagine having to work through complex problems completely in my mind like he did without being able to do something as simple as writing to help visualize it. </p>
<p>Did he accomplish as much as the other greats? Maybe not but certainly through no fault of his own. </p>
<p>Was his mind on par with them though? Absolutely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I think my point was that if you ignore the disability, the comparison with Einstein falls apart. He's still leaps and bounds smarter than the vast, vast majority of people, but Einstein is in another league. It's like comparing Chris Farley to Samuel Jackson.</p>
<p>They're both extremely well-known and liked actors, everyone knows their names, but Jackson is known for his roles in cult classics like Pulp Fiction, Star Wars, Jackie Brown, Die Hard, etc. Farley is best known for Tommy Boy, Coneheads and dying of a drug overdose. Chris was a good actor who excelled at his specific comedy niche, but Jackson's honestly in another league.</p>
<p>BTW I fucking love Chris Farley, so don't interpret this as me hating on him.</p></div>		</li>
