			<div class="markdown"><p>I wrecked a motorcycle , stood the bike up and moved it out of the road, and then 'walked it off' for \~4 hours before finally realizing I was pretty hurt and calling someone.  </p>
<p>I'd partially torn my LCL and MCL, broken 3 bones in my hand, and bruised my back and ribs up pretty decent.  </p>
<p>Adrenaline is a <em>hell</em> of a drug</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are quite a few actually. Meniscal tears, rotator cuff tears, complete ACL ruptures. They can all be painless and considered “a lot of damage”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a prime example of this. </p>
<p>I have centralised sensitisation. If my system gets overstimulated (by things like caffeine, too much sugar, or exercising too hard), instead of body parts telling my brain they're hurt, (if they receive damage of some sort), my brain sends signals to random parts of my body saying they're hurt. Even if I haven't done anything to hurt them.</p>
<p>I end up being exhausted, riddled with pain in random parts and there's not really anything I can do about it, but try and relax. Oh and do as little as possible, to let my system calm down.</p></div>		</li>
