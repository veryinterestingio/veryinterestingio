Former insurance agent here, and youâ€™d be surprised with how many people I sold insurance to that previously had state minimums for liability and property damage.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Deductibles are also a way to discourage  people making claims on small incidents , driving up the premium cost.</p>
<p>What people don't know is that insurance companies take your premiums and invest it to generate profit.</p>
<p>Also reinsurers exist which are insurance companies that other insurers pay in case of catastrophic losses.</p></div>		</li>
