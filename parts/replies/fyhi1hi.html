			<div class="markdown"><p>He's a chemist --- not a neuroscientist or evolutionary biologist --  this means there's more.  He's a chemist.  His nails are chemicals and concentrations, so it's no surprise that he hammers away at them.  To downplay the facts that certain smells are evolutionarily and neuroscientifically evolved to have greater importance based on .... evolution is like grabbing the elephant's trunk and thinking it's a snake.  Point being, don't dismiss that there are certain smells (putrescine, for example) that you will have a reaction to even if you've never smelt it before.  Any human that smells a rotting human knows that smell, marks it... and repels from it regardless of concentration.  That's a warning smell, one which doesn't require 'experience' to have an effect.  That's evolution, biology and neuroscience....not just 'chemistry' and 'concentration'.</p></div>		</li>
