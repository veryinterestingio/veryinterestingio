			<div class="markdown"><p>The question was not if the sock was wet, but rather if the foot was wet. As the only wet surface is the skin, the sock is therefor dry making this explanation interesting but not an answer to the question asked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the water is drawn from the foot into the sock , which results in the same effect explained above. Think paper towel on a wet table. Both the towel and table become wet via osmosis. The towel will then stick to the table. Same with the sock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree mostly, but just to pick one nit: what you're describing wouldn't be osmosis. Osmosis is a specific type of diffusion where a solvent passes through a semi-permeable membrane.</p>
<p>In this case the diffusion is caused by capillary action within the fibers of the towel/sock, rather than osmosis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hah. I totally didn't notice that until now.</p>
<p>A wet foot seems like it'd be a different story. Moistened skin changes its material properties. When wet skin prunes and wrinkles, I imagine the increased surface area and corrugations likely increase the coefficient of friction. </p>
<p>None of the previous effects in the reverse scenario seem to be especially pertinent.</p></div>		</li>
