			<div class="markdown"><p>I did a little research myself. Seems like the extra nuclei definitely stick around for months, probably stick around for years, and possibly even remain for your entire life.</p>
<p>The evidence is inconclusive so far, but has been shown that even when muscle cells die, the nuclei still stick around. They seem to be very, very difficult to get rid of, with claims that suggest teenagers should &quot;bank&quot; nuclei during their peak strength-training years to help support them in old age.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ok this is a loaded question then, but is short term steroid use then very useful?  like you for a short term use steroids to buff up and add more nuclei, then you stop taking steroids probably shrink but still have a lot more nuclei?  idk why i ask, because i have no interest doing it, but i am curious.  i know olympians and such use stuff to get stronger trying to avoid their testing programs, then stop before the olympics when you can't avoid testers; but i mean longer term permanence of increased ability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you are taking exogenous testosterone, your body stops producing it. When you stop taking testosterone, your body still isn't producing it. The amount of time it takes to recover your natural supply depends on many factors. Sometimes it stays fucked up and you need testosterone replacement therapy for the rest of your life. In any case, during this period, it will be difficult to retain all the muscle mass.</p>
<p>Once it is back to normal though, yes, you are in a better position to [re]gain muscle.</p>
<p>This is part of the argument for banning dopers permanently rather than the two year bans they often get.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to clarify that your body does continue to produce it after you stop taking steroids. Its a hardwired misconception but slowly and gradually the body under normal circumstances should bring serum back to original values</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was explained to me that the recovery is way quicker on steroids.  So you can pump
iron more often, increasing your gains quicker. </p>
<p>But I totally stand to be corrected</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>right, but that is not what is important to the conversation at hand.</p>
<p>the question is are the gains as permanent as once being that strong naturally OR are the gains at least more effective than never taking steroids and maintaining the same on then off regimin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no, it's everything.  strength, stamina, balance, even reaction time and mental clarity.  steroids work better than anyone would want you to believe.  testosterone is a performance enhancing drug in just about every way you could imagine.</p></div>		</li>
