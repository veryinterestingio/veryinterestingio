			<div class="markdown"><p>So is what we call &quot;the flu&quot; all one thing that mutates constantly over time? So a flu you get aged ten and one you get aged 20 are related but multiple iterations of mutation different?</p>
<p>I feel I got &quot;the real flu&quot; just once in my life, joint pain, headaches couldn't really stand up, body chills fever... Orders of magnitude different than just a regular cold... But people refer to basic cold symptoms as &quot;the flu&quot; a lot (especially in North America maybe?).</p>
<p>Is the common cold (that stuff you up and gives headaches etc) related to &quot;influenza&quot; any more than by lay people mis labelling it as such?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a family of viruses called Orthomyxoviridae that contain multiple types of influenza groups, and those groups have their own subtypes. So H1N1 is a serotype (distinct combination of antigens) of Influenza A, and Influenza A is a genus within the Orthomyxoviridae family.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm in Quebec and I often hear older generations called colds using the word for flu. But yeah, the flu comes from the name of the virus that causes it, influenza. </p>
<p>I don't know well how long immunity to the flu lasts but odds are that if you get the flu twice, it was two different strains, i.e. there was a mutation (could be a recent one or an old one you've never been exposed to). It's not something most people would get often too, I think I might have gotten it twice in over 30 years of life and I've never been vaccinated against it.</p>
<p>From what I've read, it's also possible to &quot;catch&quot; the flu yet not be sick. It's not clear if you're contagious when that happens. So it's quite possible we've caught it more often without knowing. The world of viruses is a very complex one that we don't know that much about. We know a lot about the viruses themselves, but we can't really infect a lot of people on purpose and study transmission very well.</p></div>		</li>

<p>its similar to what happens with bats and rodents. their immune systems work so well, they show no symptoms but still spread the disease (60 something viruses can cross over to humans) sometimes the human immune system works so well, the person never notices ever getting sick (there are people who have 'never' gotten sick, but they actually have, their body just didnt let them know)</p>

<p>yes, yes you are. which is how the virus spreads</p></div>		</li>
