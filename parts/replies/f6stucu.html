			<div class="markdown"><p>Even though photons don't have mass, they do have momentum. This can be found using  Einstein's equation E^(2) = m^(2)c^(4) + p^(2)c^(2) (this is just the full version of E = mc^(2)). We can set m = 0 for a photon and see that E = pc, where p is its momentum and E is its energy. To go one step further, we can say that E = hf, and so hf = pc, so p = hf/c or p = h/λ.</p>
<p>Photons can transfer this momentum to other objects, and hence exert a force on them. After transferring this force, the photon will have lost some momentum, and so shift to a longer wavelength. Scientists call this an &quot;optical force&quot;. These forces are very small from normal light sources - you're never gonna feel your torch pushing you away. However, when you scale it up to massive light sources, such as the sun, the optical force from all these photons is enough to move spacecraft.</p>
<p>In the case of solar sails, they're often made of mirrors so that they perfectly reflect the photons back to where they came from. This gives the photons the largest possible change in momentum, as they go from a p = +E/c to p = -E/c, so Δp = 2E/c. We can then use the equation F = Δp/Δt to find the force each photon exerts by reflecting off the mirror. The force from each individual photon may be very small, but when you add up the forces of millions and millions of photons from the sun, this starts to become a reasonable effect.</p></div>		</li>
