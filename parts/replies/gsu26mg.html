<p>Ha! Thanks for seeing where I was trying to go, though. Now part of me is tempted to go over to r/askmathematics (if it exists) and ask them if there's something about the number 56 that makes it prone to certain geometries (or something).</p>
<p>I guess what really knocks all this speculation into a cocked hat, though, is the fact that there are plenty of iron compounds that aren't magnetic and plenty of non-ferrous alloys that are. That's pretty damning. Oh well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They might not have much of an idea in askmath since even if 56 were some kind of special case, they would have to know about atomic orbitals and &quot;exchange interactions&quot; in a crystal lattice. Not to say that you can't try! But I wouldn't expect much haha. </p>
<p>But yes! Certainly there are plenty of iron compounds, and alloys that are not ferromagnetic. If you get into talking about (quantum) magnetism, the atomic number itself isn't too important because the bigger contributors to predicting magnetism is the local crystal environment, orbital occupancies, and the so-called &quot;exchange interaction&quot;. The atomic number (i.e. element) just kind of gives us what parameters we're playing with to initialize the understanding.</p>
<p>If I had to give some insight, the reason why associate Fe and nearby elements with magnetism is because they're the lightest elements (thus more common) that have electrons with non-trivial 3d and 4s orbital occupancies - the layman translation being there are enough electrons around that they like to spread out a bit more, according to more complicated &quot;rules&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Antiferromagnetic is kinda different from 'non-magnetic' tho. I would argue that most people would call any paramagnetic material &quot;non-magnetic&quot; whereas in antiferromagnetism the magnetic susceptibility does not change with temperature up to a certain point where the material loses its antiferromagnetic properties. </p>
<p>I am being a bit nitpicky here and your description with the spins aligning is absolutely correct. I just wanted to clarify that not every material that the layman would describe as 'non-magnetic' is actually antiferromagnetic (in fact very few materials are).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Has physics given up on the monopole concept, then?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really within my realm of research, but I think the concept of a magnetic monopole as an isolated phenomenon isn't an active area. I could be wrong, and I would guess that it would be either in high-energy particle physics or something wonky in ultracold atoms.</p>
<p>I will note that there can be emergent magnetic monopoles in spin ice systems, where &quot;emergent&quot; refers to it being a result of many-body interactions, and &quot;spin ice&quot; being a specific crystal type that frustrates electronic spins to make them behave weirdly.</p></div>		</li>
