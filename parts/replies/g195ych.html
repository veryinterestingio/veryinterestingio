			<div class="markdown"><p>Not my balls because I’m a chick, but when I had my kidney stones, my back (not where my kidneys are but everywhere else) KILLED me. I thought I was dying. Like, fetal position on the bathroom floor “well this is it then” dying.</p>
<p>Edit: I am so living for this thread. I feel like I’ve made so many new friends with traumatized urethras.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. People who've never had them really have no idea how bad they are. I've had a golf ball hit my elbow at full speed. Sprained ankles, but nothing comes close to stones. I even have heard women who had natural childbirth would take that again anyday over a kidney stone. I believe it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh geeze, why did I think only men get kidney stones?</p>
<p>They always tell guys &quot;It's the closest thing to child birth.&quot; So for some reason I just assumed only men get them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I passed 9 kidney stones AT ONCE while waiting to be seen in the emergency room. The doc said if I could handle that pain without passing out, I’d be able to do natural childbirth while doing a handstand. No thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have chronic stones. One time when I was at the hospital, no amount of pain medication helped. I asked for more and the doc said I already had the same amount of pain meds they would give someone who chainsawed their arm off.  </p>
<p>Two things:</p>
<p>1) A simple dose of Aleve helps me more than any narcotic.</p>
<p>2) I had a real bad case of hand foot and mouth disease I got from my son. I would rather have stones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And to add <strong>how</strong> they dilate: The walls of your veins and arteries are lines with muscles (specifically smooth muscle cells, or SMCs). These will relax (or stop flexing). Think of how when you stop flexing your abs, your gut bulges out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blood vessels are kind of like Chinese finger traps. As they dilate (become wider) they can also become more permeable and mesh-like, letting cells and fluids pass through the blood vessel walls and into the surrounding tissues more easily. This allows white blood cells, platelets, and necessary nutrients to be delivered to areas of the body that are damaged and need to be repaired.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I occasionally have a severe pain under my left collar bone that has no apparent cause and will only go away when I sleep. Inhaling causes the pain to get much worse. From what I understand, it’s referred pain from my diaphragm because there’s a nerve that runs up to your shoulder. I have lived with this for 30 years and I still don’t know what causes it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds a bit like <a href="https://www.webmd.com/lung/precordial-catch-syndrome" target="_blank">precordial catch syndrome</a>. I think I have it and the pain definitely coincides with breathing in. It's 100% no big deal though, so don't worry. Next time it happens, and provided it isn't too painful, try inhaling deeply against the pain. Some people believe PCS is caused by a pinching of nerves, tissue etc between the ribs, and inhaling deeply is supposed to expand the ribs to help release whatever got pinched. I don't get it as much anymore (more frequent when I was young) but it tended to occur soon after I would lay down. Weird. I also sometimes get a really quick, sharp pain in my left collarbone like I've been struck by lightning. Both these oddities happen maybe once or twice a year at most, and I've had them both for as long as I can remember.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That does sound familiar. I did research on it a while back but I’ve forgotten a lot of it. I figured it wasn’t a big deal. I tried to describe it to drs when I was younger but they always wanted to X-ray my shoulder. They didn’t listen to me when I told them what was going on.</p></div>		</li>
