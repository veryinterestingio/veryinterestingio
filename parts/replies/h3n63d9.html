			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this answer! Also to add, emission controls are better in power plants compared to cars, mostly due to cars having weight constraints, and that the filtering system in a power plant is better quality that the catalytic converter than a 1999 civic. So for the same amount of fuel burned, cars release more pollutants than a power station. So increased efficiency WITH decreased emissions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You‚Äôve got an error in your answer but a good one. Moving from a 25% efficiency to a 45% one is not a 20% improvement but ~44%. </p>
<p>I did a similar study for the exact same discussion and while your efficiencies are a little on the low side, they‚Äôre consistent with what I found. </p>
<p>As a bonus add, while natural gas combination cycle plants can reach low 60s for electricity generation this number increases to the low 80s if the ‚Äúwaste heat‚Äù is used. Definitely something we could do with future expansions that would be needed if we did a large-scale migration to electric transport.</p></div>		</li>
