			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a thoughtful summary of a phenomenon but I think it's on a different time scale than OP's question. You're talking about evolving musical tastes as you grow to consciously understand rules of music (like you start noticing how every song is 4/4, and become highly interested when you hear a 5/4 measure or song). OP is just talking about liking a song, having the intense desire to re-listen, and then quickly becoming tired. I think that has more to do with the brain's desire to relive patterns, curiosity, etc. What you're describing is more like changing perception over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly fair! But Ive noticed the same thing on a compressed scale also seems to happen to me. Esp with electronica. An example I like to cite is the song “wandering star” by portishead. Its extremely repetitive on first listen and seems like a song Id get bored with after 4-5 listens... but then it changes. The songs OP is getting bored with are probably just not real complex, and maybe overplayed as a result they dont really develop and op gets bored.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you say that a less complex song is actually more complex? Just looking tho I fully agree. Eventho I my taste in electronics has long evolved, to this day  David August moving day (the full version) always got me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And don't forget that people simply like some &quot;types&quot; of music better than other types. Folks might like complex musicality, they might be more interested in the lyrics, they might simply enjoy the beat. And some people like country.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the people I don't understand at all, are the ones who see music as just something in the background. To me, that's like saying 'i don't care what I eat, just give me some random shit and I'll swallow it!'.</p>
<p>Hearing a song in the background that I don't like can put me in a sour mood. Music is such a large part of who I am, that I can't really comprehend how someone could have only a surface level relationship with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m the same way. I hate jazz. Not because it’s ugly, but because it’s depressing. Literally, listening to true jazz makes me feel borderline suicidal, and it’s been that way since I was little. My mom is the same way, as is my twin. I can’t just let it keep playing, I have to switch it to something else. Though in response to the original thread text, I don’t actually get tired of a song even if I hear it a lot briefly. For example, I grew up with a lot of 60s/70s/80s hits (dad was a DJ at one point so he had a ton of music cds and cassettes). Recently, I heard Blinding Lights by The Weeknd. And it sounded so eighties to me. I loved it. I literally fell asleep to a loop of it, and didn’t get tired of it weeks later. My sister is the same way. But nobody else gets why we liked it so much!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people don’t respond to sound as strongly as others. They may instead have a stronger connection to the visual realm. People who are more visual might be bothered by certain colors or patterns, or a room looking disorganized. But they won’t notice if music is playing or if the kettle whistle is sounding off</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess this is a similar concept to gaming? You play a game for the first time and it’s incredible and you can do multi-hour sittings. Eventually, no matter how great the game, I seem to lose that excitement and slowly stop playing the game until I no longer have the desire to continue. It tends to happen once I’ve unlocked everything and I’m in the late game...</p></div>		</li>
