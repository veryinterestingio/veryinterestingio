			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe ye old distraction method? You start yelling you are using your senses and brain to overload the pain?</p>
<p>Kind of like a computer processor having to slow down something because new tasks come in.</p>
<p>Same way if you are having an ache you pinch another place really hard and it mitigates the aching part.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if this applies to screaming. But we rub injuries for this reason. </p>
<p>I.e. When you bump your elbow and instinctively start to rub the part that was hit. </p>
<p>IIRC It's called melzarks gate theory (out something similar). </p>
<p>Basically a finite number of sensations can be received by the brain... And touch (as a neuromessenger) travels faster than other sensations.</p>
<p>Therefore you get touch taking up a percentage of the available slots for pain. Somewhat reducing the amount that is felt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My theory is that it’s like deep breathing in a way. When I get tattoos I make this weird, long noise that really helps with the pain either because of the breaths I’m taking or as some kind of release of air and hormones. When I gave birth i did not expect to scream so much. It was more involuntary than the tattoo noise. But damn, did it help in the cathartic sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the pain gate thingy, sorry i've read about this long ago. It's a natural distraction method whereas your brain can only focus on 1 feeling at once, if you get hurt on a finger but then on the foot you'd be more focused on one rather than both. Please look it up, I'm way too generic given how long it has been</p></div>		</li>
