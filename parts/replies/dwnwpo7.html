			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the IR part is quite accurate on the photo. On the UV side you would see more somehow unsharp violettish (surprise ?) parts, as with black light.
In addition the lens in our eyes offers high chromatic abberations, hence IR/UV light do not only fade out by the seen intensity but by the ability to focus then, as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny that you say this because the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purkinje_effect" target="_blank">Purkinje effect</a> basically says that wavelengths closer to the blue end of the spectrum are easier to focus on at night. Has to do with the density of rods located outside of the fovea compared to the density of cones in this area. Cones are better at distinguishing color in high light whereas rods are better in low light. </p>
<p>This is why it's easier to &quot;see&quot; the light from a star if you look slightly to the side of it instead of trying to focus on it directly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing that happens with normal monochromatic light sources (even spectral lines) is that the emissions are a Gaussian distribution about the central spectrum point. For instance an <a href="https://www.thorlabs.co.jp/images/TabImages/LIU780A_Spectrum.gif" target="_blank">800nm LED</a>. Solidly in the IR, but you will see a dull red glow. There is still some light at the 700nm tail. This can make these devices harmful, because they don't look bright when you see them, but the main peak is very bright. There are similar effects for UV emitters. In addition, UV will make your cornea fluoresce. So you will see a general visible glow when looking at a UV source that is wholly in the UV.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You use a UV filter, the IR filter is built into your sensor. Well it’s actually in front of the sensor, it’s a little blue piece of glass that sits in the “glass stack” (can’t remember what it’s called) in front of the sensor - I wish I could find the one I pulled out of my old D70. Also you shouldn’t use a UV filter, it just degrades the quality of your images and doesn’t really protect your lens. Put a lens hood on instead. </p></div>		</li>
