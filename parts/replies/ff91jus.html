			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravitational waves are <em>extremely</em> weak, and also don't really cause anything like friction (rather it is more like thermal radiation than scattering).  Binary black holes only produce strong gravitational waves because they are <em>profoundly</em> dense and massive objects, and even then those gravitational waves are only strong very close to the black hole; on astrophysical scales they rapidly decrease in strength, so much that we can only even detect these  collosal gravitational waves by measuring the deflection of a laser by just a fraction of a proton's radius.  By comparison, dark matter is extremely thin and not dense at all, even though it has a lot of mass in total, so any gravitational waves produced by dark matter moving around would be utterly insignificant.  Two dark matter particles passing extremely close by to each other would only produce the slightest deflection of each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I follow you, but gravity is proportional to mass, which is proportional to momentum and kinetic energy. So a tiny light object like dark matter would lose the same fraction of its energy due to gravitational wave when bypassing a black hole as a second black hole would. Correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Echoing this sentiment. Dark matter may be slightly denser around conventional stars and planets but in general, most of the stars in the galaxy are likely swimming through a whole bunch of dark matter and the concentration at the stars' centers are negligibly denser.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can you put any numbers on this - e.g. what is the mass (in kg or Solar Masses) of Dark Matter located in the roughly spherical shell between the Sun's outer surface and an outer bounding sphere of radius 46MKm (~closest approach of Mercury's orbit to Sun centre) ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, to give a sense of the scales implicated, sort of the &quot;benchmark density&quot; of  we would expect dark matter to have locally is on the order of 1 kg per trillion cubic km (so about 1 kg of it in all the earth's volume, or about a million kg in the sun's volume). The **total** mass of dark matter to be found in the sun is like 10^(-25) as a fraction of the solar mass. I admit I couldn't tell you what fraction of this already vanishingly small number is expected to be located near the surface, but for all the reasons forte2718 listed, there is not expected to be much variation in this density.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, DM does not have <em>any</em> significant interactions <em>at all</em>, except for gravitation.  There is a chance that DM <em>might</em> interact via the weak force, but weak interactions are very, very short-ranged and are almost completely insignificant on astrophysical scales.</p></div>		</li>
