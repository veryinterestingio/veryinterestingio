I don't recall exactly what happens, but apparently there's a problem when someone has an unregulated game night and rakes money from poker players.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no the &quot;problem&quot; was that Molly wasn't raking money from her games but was staking her losers so lots of losing players owed her money. that's what the gangsters wanted: her markers/ledger of debts they offered to collect on her behalf but she refused so they got nasty</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So let’s say if the pot ends up as $100 and the house rule is 10% the dealer will just take $10 after the hand ends. Most casinos have different rules around the rake so none are comparable. For instance the old casino I used to go to would remove the rake if someone got quads on a table.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's slightly more nuanced. You can use probability/statistics in blackjack in the same manner as in poker - and should. There are optimal choices to make based on your hand. Card counting is different because your specifically taking advantage of the the casino's expediency in dealing multiple rounds from a single deck or fixed number of decks. In theory, the casino should use a fresh deck for every deal or reshuffle for every deal, and some casinos do. It doesn't seem like cheating but I cpuld see the case for it not being in the spirit of the game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most blackjack tables will use a minimum of 8 decks in a shoe, and will cut about 15% of those cars out using a cut card (a plastic card that signals the end of the shoe that is randomly placed in the shoe - usually by a patron at the table).  </p>
<p>There are also constant shufflers which is like an endless shoe. </p>
<p>And a variant of blackjack is a single deck game, but you’re not allowed to show the other players your hand. </p>
<p>I think, generally, poker is hand by hand and your are playing against other players.  The house takes a rake to make money. In blackjack it is against the house. </p>
<p>In poker you aren’t allowed to share your cards with other players - if you do the rest of the table gets to see them. If you show them to an active player in a hand it happens right away. </p>
<p>Source: used to deal both games at a casino.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Genuine question, my way of playing Blackjack is literally just win/loss ratio and betting accordingly. Say I play exactly like the house aka hit until soft 17, regardless of what the house is showing I should presumably average a 50% win ratio over enough hands. So instead of trying to improve my win ratio I just adjust my bets, if I win, I bet my baseline bet the next hand, but if I lose I double my existing bet the next hand. Is this legal or something that would get someone kicked out?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because of this, I would never feel bad about counting cards even in Blackjack. The only thing I'm muddling with is the casino's profits. If they kick me out and blacklist me then go ahead, but I still wouldn't feel like I had cheated in any way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I’m aware, casinos can’t, or generally don’t kick people out if they’re doing their calculations in their head. Mainly because you can’t really prove anything. As long as you have no outside help or tools.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not cheating, its just evidence that casinos are rigged. It should be illegal to confiscate any winnings due to being &quot;guilty&quot; of card counting.</p>
<p>In terms of ejecting there's not much to be done, a company has no legal requirement to continue serving someone</p></div>		</li>
