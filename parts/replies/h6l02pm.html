<p>Does she refer to coming into contact with the virus <em>at all</em>, or 'suffering any kind of noticeable symptoms', when she says 'getting infected in first place'?</p>
<p>I was under the impression that the vaccination does not do anything to prevent you from catching COVID, just that it neuters the risks and consequences of catching COVID.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it this way.</p>
<p>If you are not vaccinated you have a militia. If an invading army comes in they can easily take a big chunk of territory, fortify, and send units into other nations that border yours (infect other people) before you can muster your forces.  Once you muster your armies, you have to push them out of your lands, doing lots of damage to those lands and allowing them to keep sending forces to neighboring nations during the war.</p>
<p>If you are vaccinated then you have a standing army.  When the invaders come they may be able to force a small beachhead, and even use that toehold to send troops to neighbors, but the damage they can do is much less, there is a good chance your standing army wipes them all out at the beach, and they have far less time and far fewer troops to invade other nations (infect others).</p>
<p>The vaccine doesn't prevent the virus from landing troops, but there is a good chance any troops they land are slaughtered before they can get set up.  That is why <em>yes, the vaccine can prevent you from catching covid.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a common refrain,  but it's not true.</p>
<p>The efficacy stat that Pfizer used in their trials was reducing symptomatic disease.  You might technically be a carrier for a brief period of time if exposed,  but your viral load is very low, and you are contagious for such a short period of time if at all, that all intents and purposes,  you didn't really catch it.</p>
<p>This is also true for people who have immunity via covid-19 infection.  The immune system isn't magic.  It's just really really good at what it does, if given the chance to train.  :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;something relatively rare already&quot; - it's not that rare. There are hundreds of thousands of new Covid cases per day; as an extreme lower-bound, there will be several hundreds or some thousands of them in fully vaccinated people. That's plenty of data-points.</p></div>		</li>
