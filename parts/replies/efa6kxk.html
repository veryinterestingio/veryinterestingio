			<div class="markdown"><p>True. </p>
<p>But controlling for all those other factors, I’d argue that the transplanted organ has the age of the donor, not the younger recipient. If the donor lived the hard life, why would his organs not reflect that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am waiting on kidney transplant and I have run into a number of people who received transplants from deceased donors that have lasted 20 years. The normally life span from a deceased donor is 7 to 10 years. Age has nothing to do with the overall health of the organ. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was not referring to lifespan of the transplant. </p>
<p>I was referring to the status of the organ when first transplanted. </p>
<p>Lots of factors determine the life of the transplant — an important one is rejection. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hope you get your call soon.  I had a liver transplant in 2010.  I'm as healthy as anybody I know.  I work, play and just generally have a normal life.    No rejection episodes.   It really is a new life.  I hope the best for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I have. </p>
<p>Some donors have little known medical history. Their organs are harvested shortly after an accident. </p></div>		</li>
