<p>I have Hyperaldosteronism which causes my body to excessively swap out of Potassium (required by the heart and other electrochemical signalling) in exchange for Sodium (salt). This causes my blood to draw in too much water via Osmosis creating high blood pressure. I guess I become hyper-hydrated...</p>
<p>Drinking &quot;Sports drinks&quot; helps replace the electrolytes used to moderate water content (under the control of hormones in the Endocrine system).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Gatorade has to much salt and sugar to be useful. (Which they do for flavor, since they're trying to compete with soda)</p>
<p>Cut it by half with water and you've got the effect they advertise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it doesn’t. One of the major causes of hyponatremia (Low sodium which is the #1 electrolyte) is called Beer Potomania where someone is getting most of their calories and fluids from electrolyte poor beer so they’re not eating or drinking electrolyte rich things and their sodium over time gets low.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This just made me realize that drinking a glass of water in between beers on a night out wouldn't necessarily help (given you drink the same amount of beers) because you'll piss it out anyway. Interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it helps when you are drinking hard liquor, because that has basically no water and a very high content of alcohol, so drinking some water dilutes the effect, but with beer, it would have to replace one of the beers altogether (giving you a chance to recover for a bit) and then it would not be much different from not drinking anything for the same amount of time (except for the social stigma of sitting empty handed), or getting a coke (which is what I usually do). </p>
<p>The best practice though is drinking a glass of water after you get home, before you go to sleep, because by then, you would have probably peed out all the water from the beer and the water can hydrate you while you sleep and you won't wake up with a hangover (or at least not as bad one).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not true. It would help, because you're diluting the % alcohol in your stomach. It would slow absorption of alcohol, which slows its diuretic effect, and allows your body to absorb more water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t understand this comment.  Are you suggesting that the fluid you are ingesting is passing directly from your intestines to your bladder without passing through your blood stream?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course not, it goes to the bloodstream, but so does the alcohol and as your alcohol blood level increases, it makes you produce more and more urine, which dehydrate tou more than if you drank it over longer time and thus had the time to get rid of the alcohol from your blood. </p>
<p>I'm on mobile, so I can't draw anything, but imagine a graph that goes from 0 to 1 vertically, then slopes back to 0, then back to 1 vertically and again slopes to 0. The y axis would be alcohol level and the area under the graph is (more or less) the diuretic effect, when your body has the time to deal with the beer one by one. Now imagine the same graph, but it goes immediately to 2 and then slopes off to 0 at the same rate it did previously. The area under the graph is much larger now, because the body had to deal with, on average, higher alcohol level in blood... (I'm not sure, if I'm explaining this correctly, but the gist should be hopefully right) </p></div>		</li>
