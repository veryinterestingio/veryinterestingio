<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_star" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_star</a></p>
<p>If you look at current theories regarding the far future of the universe, one of the main puzzles is whether or not protons decay. If they do, all matter will just eventually decay, leaving only black holes (which eventually will evaporate via Hawking radiation) and radiation. However, if they don't, then the formation of structures called &quot;iron stars&quot; becomes possible.</p>
<p>Given enough time, all stars that don't collapse to neutron stars or black holes will eventually cool to become hunks of dormant matter near absolute zero. Iron stars form when you wait long enough for random quantum tunneling events to induce cold fusion in these hunks. Given enough of these events, all the matter will eventually fuse to iron-56, which has the lowest energy state. Then if you wait even longer, iron stars will eventually collapse into neutron stars and black holes due to even lower probability quantum tunneling events.</p>
<p>The timescales for iron stars are insane:</p>
<ul>
<li>The total age of the universe right now is 1.4*10^(10) years.</li>
<li>The largest black holes take ~10^(100) years to evaporate.</li>
<li>Iron stars would only start appearing after ~10^(1500) years.</li>
<li>Iron stars would collapse to black holes after ~10^(10^26) to ~10^(10^76) years.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some more details at this link:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically yes! This is one of the implications of &quot;heat death,&quot; but it does require a few assumptions. For starters, the cosnological constant has to approach a finite, positive value (for divergent values the stars would be ripped apart long before they cool to iron, and for negative values, the universe would collapse in on itself first), it also assumes no proton decay, no higgs field collapse, and no other untimely ends to the universe</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to the points you already made: Ferro-, antiferro- and ferrimagnetism are not atomic properties per se but due to interactions between different spin centers e.g. iron ions in a crystal lattice. They are therefore structure-dependent and also susceptible to external pertubations like temperature, pressure, light, magnetic fields, electric fields etc.
Some alloys are not ferromagnetic although they consist solely of ferromagnetic metals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, if you heat up iron over 768Â°C the kinetic energy overcomes the ferromagnetic interactions between the iron atoms and you get a paramagnet that can be magnetized by an external magnetic field but loses its' magnetization immediately after the field is turned off. This temperature is called the Curie temperature.</p>
<p>Furthermore many iron compounds are purely diamagnetic due to their lack of unpaired electrons. Many iron(ii) coordination compounds fall into that category.</p>
<p>Edit: you can also demagnetize an iron magnet by mechanical shock. If you then apply a magnetic field to it, it gets remagnetized because the electron spins realign again</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been quite awhile since I took a microstructure class, but...</p>
<p>In addition to simply heating past the Curie temperature, in theory non-crystalline iron would also not be magnetic (at all). Magnetic moments are a bulk mechanic of crystalline materials, where each grain has a small moment; ferromagnetism occurs when all of these are aligned. Remove the occurrence of grains themselves, and no more magnetism. Research in amorphous metals (aka &quot;bulk metallic glass&quot;) is AFAIK ongoing, but a quick search shows that some people have managed to make small quantities of amorphous steel, which is in fact non-magnetic. Doing so usually requires insanely fast cooling rates, or lots of alloying components to make crystallization slow (or both), though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>body-centered-cubic iron -- that which you're used to interacting with, presuming it's not been annealed weird with any impurities or anything -- will always have a magnetic moment, and will always be ferromagnetic.</p>
<p>However heat, strong shocks, dislocations, etc can make it so that different regions of the iron are magnetized into different directions and roughly cancel out, in different magnetic domains. This is what is referred to, with &quot;demagnetized&quot; iron, even though on an atomic scale it is still very ferromagnetic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the atomic properties are diamagnetism and paramagnetism, which are determined by whether the atom has unpaired electrons in valence orbitals or not. Ferromagnetism is a property of a material based in its ability to be permanently magnetized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify then, the fact that iron-56 is the lowest mass per nucleon has nothing to do with the structure of the atomic orbitals and their occupations (i.e. one isn't a result of the other)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing at all. The nuclear mass is so much larger than the energies involved in the electron configuration, they just don't affect each other. One way to see this is that iron has different isotopes, and its only 56-Fe that is the highly stable one (okay 58-Fe is also very stable but not quite as much and there can only be one 'most'), whereas they are all ferromagnetic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it has nothing to do with atomic orbitals, one should note that the protons and neutrons also fill orbitals in the nucleus. It's different because the potential is from the strong force and not the EM force, and also because protons and neutrons are different particles. But there are similar patterns of nuclear shells being filled and unfilled for the nucleons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I was thinking about this too. Both of these systems can be modeled reasonably well with a finite spherical well. The fact that N electrons in a finite spherical well have unpaired spin (i.e. completely fill the outer orbital in the theory if you discard hyperfine splitting on the valence shell) probably does say something about the N protons in the nucleus. They have the same orbitals. Of course, the protons have neutrons in there as well so that changes the calculus quite a bit as you really have ~2N strongly interacting particles, and the relevant pairing is due to isospin instead of regular spin.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's been too long for me to explicitly remember how all this works. I don't believe isospins can be thought of as coupling the same way electromagnetic spins do, even though they combine the same way... so maybe this is all a red herring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The mass per nucleon (equivalently, binding energy) is a result of the interactions between the nucleon, mostly the residual strong interaction, which on that scale is about 20x as strong as electromagnetism. Electromagnetism plays a supporting role in nuclear physics.</p>
<p>Then you have atomic physics, which describes electrons. Electrons do not feel the strong force, only electromagnetism and the weak force.</p>
<p>So imagine you change something in the strong force. Or perhaps you change something in the properties of protons and neutrons, or even the number of available stable nucleons. This will not affect the electrons directly. The electrons only care about the nuclear charge, and to a smaller extent the nuclear magnetic moment (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperfine_structure" target="_blank">hyperfine structure</a>)</p></div>		</li>
