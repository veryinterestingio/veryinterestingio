			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question.</p>
<p>There are many causes! If we assume someone does not have 1: a large prostate 2: a urinary stricture 3: a high riding bladder neck and 4: infection/inflammation, the general reason for the sensation of retained urethral urine can be couched as a flow / clearance / sensory issue.</p>
<p>Factors that can increase the sensation of &quot;not fully empty&quot; can be 1: dietary 2: psychological (stress and its effects on overactivity, bladder irritation, etc) and 2a: muscular. </p>
<p>1: dietary: the most common bladder irritants that can make someone feel as though they have retained urine or feel like they have to urinate all the time are caffiene, alcohol, nicotine, capsaicin (spicy foods), and generally speaking overconsumption of acidic foods/beverages. All of these can increase the sensation of urgency, but since they irritate mucous membranes in the urinary tract, they might increase the sensation of not fully emptying or having urine in the urethra. </p>
<p>2: psychological: this is me, lol. Some men carry their stress in the pelvis. A great book on the topic is &quot;A Headache in the Pelvis.&quot; </p>
<p>2a: Tightening the muscle of the pelvic floor can have a &quot;sling&quot; like effect on the urethra. Essentially, tight muscles (puborectalis, pubococcygeus, etc) can add a dynamic impingement on the urethra. Conversely, weak muscles can lead to incontinence. </p>
<p>Stretching, heat, stress reduction, and diaphragm breathing can all help reduce the stress / muscle impingement on the urethra. A good physical therapist can walk you through this, but for starters, I'd recommend the following:</p>
<p>1: Posture! We all slouch. This shortens the aforementioned muscle. Sitting on the bony part of the butt helps to passively stretch the muscles of the pelvis.</p>
<p>2: cat/cow yoga stretching, child's pose, hamstring stretching, and knee to chest stretching with the knees as far to each side as possible all help lengthen and release tension in the pelvis. Done consistently, many men find it helps with retention symptoms as well as urethral retention / &quot;one in the chamber.&quot; </p>
<p>3: diaphragm breathing: take a deep breath, while your hands are on your abdomen/belly. Do you feel your gut protrude? If not, you are likely expanding your chest, and not really increasing pressure in the abdomen.</p>
<p>While urinating, try to focus on breathing and letting your core relax, allowing it to expand and push your belly out. Sometimes its sore, many of us tighten or suck in our core / gut all day long. It's tiring. On the inhale, focus on allowing the belly to expand, on the exhale, focus on allowing the muscles in the abdomen and in the pelvis (think kegels, the muscles that stop urination) relax. This can really help with both starting urination as well as completely emptying.</p>
<p>NONE OF THE ABOVE is personalized medical advice, by the way. If symptoms are severe, persist, or otherwise worsen, it's always best to be checked by a good urologist. </p>
<p>I wish you the best!</p></div>		</li>
