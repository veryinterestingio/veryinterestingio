			<div class="markdown"><p>There's something nice about doing drill, where you can kind of just- flip your brain off and be an automaton while you're doing it. Granted, we do it way less now, and I'm 100% okay with that. </p>
<p>All we use it for now are ceremonies so some light colonel can talk about how fuckin' great he is and how his ceremony is really &quot;for all of you standing here on this field.&quot; Meanwhile you're at parade rest in an open field in the middle of July and it's 98°F out...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with turning your brain off is some people get too switched off. Once was being marched from billet to chow hall, we had a turn coming up and we knew it was a right turn to get to the food. We get to the turn and our sergeant gives us the order for left hand wheel, taking us down the other road, (wanted to have a chat with us before going in about our weapons and the guys who would be doing watch on them). Now two columns turned left, and the column on the right turned right because he followed his stomach. Holy shit did we get a bollocking. He kept kicking us looking for our on switch, he wanted to make sure we were switch on, turned on and not dumb zombie pukes. That was something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate that. We spent so much fucking time before deploying on drill and ceremony. When we got overseas we still couldn't March for shit but we certainly couldn't convoy, use radios, shoot, or even do our fucking jobs. Glad we learned how to rear march. God we are fucked for the next war.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree. You have a bunch of guys fully armed and capable of using these weapons. You better get them straight since day one before they start thinking on their own what they could do with all those weapons.</p></div>		</li>
