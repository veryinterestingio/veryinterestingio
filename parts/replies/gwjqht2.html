			<div class="markdown"><p>Slag is the byproduct of refining ores into pure metal. Since you extract metal ore directly from the Earth, it is surrounded by non-valuable rock that you need to get rid of, so you superheat the entire substance and separate them, which gives you the molten metal and slag. The metal is cast into something, such as a bar, while the slag is discarded.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One is from forging, the other is from casting</p>
<p>When casting metal, you melt the metal down to pour into a mold. Any impurities will float to the top as slag, and it's skimmed off in the same way you would skim fat off of surface of a liquid</p>
<p>Scale forms in forging. When solid metal is brought to high temperatures the metal reacts with the air to form metal oxides (rust) on the surface. The bonds between the rust and metal beneath are weak, so when the bar is pressed or deformed as part of forging the scale simply falls off and a new layer will form.</p></div>		</li>
