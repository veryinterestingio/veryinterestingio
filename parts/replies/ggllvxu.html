The trajectory of the asteroid will be bent slightly each time it passes near a massive object, and that 0.001 degree error on the first pass could mean a thousands of km closer pass the next time around, making the following pass even more uncertain.</p>
<p>This is the reason that when you hear news about an asteroid that may hit earth, it's almost always &quot;not this time, but X years out&quot;. It's also why if you read a little further, you may encounter the term &quot;gravitational keyhole&quot;. This is basically saying that given all of the uncertainty figuring out where an asteroid <em>might</em> go is really hard, so it's easier to figure out just the orbits that <em>will</em> lead to a collision, and then check the measured trajectory against those values.</p></div>		</li>
