			<div class="markdown"><p>To add: paint machines can only dispense certain increments amounts of colorant. Many can now do 1/128th of an ounce but not to long ago 1/32 ounce was standard. This, plus the tint of the base paint, limits the number of final colors available.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Behr/home depot machines have on them 1/364th if I remember.  I believe Sherwin Williams does as well.  Iirc that is something new in the past 5 years.  How often any of those increments are used, no clue, but just more random trivia for ya.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is 384ths, I have no idea where they came up with that number. I worked mixing paint when the machines were upgraded. It is useful when you want to make samples. It is impossible to make a barely off white color like Behr Swiss Coffee in a quart let alone a 6 oz sample unless you can accurately put 1/384 of an ounce of paint into a tiny container.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sherwin-Williams has increments in 1/32 of an ounce, so 32, 64, and 128. They've been using it for a very long time and still do.</p>
<p>Lowe's uses a 1/48 increment system.</p>
<p>Source: I've worked for both companies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What it doesn't explain is that they can match a paint sample, so it should be some trivial coding to match the color of a hex.</p>
<p>But I'm guessing the request is rare enough that it isn't with it.  </p>
<p>Print the color and tell them to match that sample.  Hopefully not too much is lost in translation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, sRGB colors are a very limited domain of colors compared to the complexity of actual real life ones, and even considering this limited space, it's actually hard to mix up exactly what you want with that degree of precision. </p>
<p>Plus, most people would complain that their RGB paint doesn't match the RGB color they saw on their uncalibrated OLED phone with burn in.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Exactly. They can match a physical reflected color because they're producing a physical product that reflects color, and RGB isn't that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The long and the short of it is that paints and inks have subsurface scattering and have complexity on more than three vectors (which is what RGB is designed for).... pigments are much more complex and match diffrently.... But you should be able to convert hex to the next closet pantone and match on that and get close... Unless I am missunderstanding the use case you are asking about</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are plenty of online hex-&gt;rgb-&gt;pantone converters. For most people in their day-to-day lives those are plenty good, especially since the color of your living room accent* wall will vary wildly based on things like the temperature of a light bulb or whether it's overcast or even the season.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot is lost. When you convert many RGB colors to CMYK colors, they often change fairly noticably. They become more dull/flat.</p>
<p>Also the idea of printing an RGB to then color match it, is a completely flawed idea. Because when you print it, the color has already been automatically converted to CMYK before it prints, so you would not be color matching an RGB color, you'd be matching CMYK, which it will be able to match just fine. </p>
<p>RGB accounts for light emitting from your screen, and when printing, it assumes the paper is white, and uses that as the &quot;light&quot; source. If you ran colored paper through, the printed colors would be all jacked up. There are however, the rare CMYKW printers, but very uncommon.</p>
<p>When matching at the paint store, they are able to add white paint to achieve the color you want. But even still, painting a wall assumes a white or nearly white base. If you ever tried to just paint over the previous wall color, especially if it was dark, your color would be all messed up as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't really have much to add, except that 5 station printers are commercially available pretty readily if you're willing to shell out for a production machine. While out of budget for most people, printing companies are increasingly purchasing CMYK + White machines.</p></div>		</li>
