			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm German. .com is quite common (or at least not uncommon), so is .org (slightly less) or .net (even less). Never knew they actually meant different things.<br />
However, the go-to internet domain for a German website is .de. For many international companies or websites, changing to country suffix would bring you to the other country's version of it or at least change the interface. (e.g. <a href="https://Wikipedia.de" target="_blank">Wikipedia.de</a> brings you to German wikipedia, so does <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org" target="_blank">de.wikipedia.org</a> but it's a different starting page. just <a href="https://wikipedia.org" target="_blank">wikipedia.org</a> is &quot;international&quot;, <a href="https://wikipedia.pt" target="_blank">wikipedia.pt</a> is Portuguese and so on)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Companies regularly buy up web addresses similar to their own, especially other top level domains as a defensive tactic. If you are IBM you want IBM.co.uk and IBM.org as well because somebody is going to type that into a browser and you want them to find you. Not a 404, not a counterfeit site, not get redirected to a competitor and not a site dedicated to “IBM sucks”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. A lot of websites have that.  I heard bobthebiulder was a porn site, as was Whitehouse.com</p>
<p>The first one was funny because chances are that a kid who doesn't use porn will end up there, which means it's pointless to pull that bait and switch.</p></div>		</li>
