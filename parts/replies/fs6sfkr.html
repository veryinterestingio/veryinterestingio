<p>when Venus is on our side of the Sun it has the closest approach to the Earth, this will coincide with the times where Venus is exceptionally bright in the sky.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Minor technical nit-pick: Venus is brightest a few weeks before/after closest approach to Earth. During actual closest approach to Earth, Venus is at its largest, but also its crescent phase is at its thinnest, producing competing effects. The resulting brightness looks <a href="https://i.imgur.com/bQw5QEa.jpg" target="_blank">something like this</a> over time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Brighter, in fact. Looking at heavens-above, I'm not seeing any ISS passes brighter than magnitude -4, even for passes directly overhead. At mag -4.6, Venus is 74% brighter than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should really go check out the sky in the evening now. Venus is the Brightest it's ever been in a few years due to the relative proximity of Earth and Venus's orbits.</p>

<p>It will last until August. I took a photo just through an Iphone and it was crystal clear the other day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just as a minor correction, Venus is not nearly as close to the Sun as Mercury. It is twice the distance from the Sun as Mercury - Mercury is 36M miles and Venus is 67M miles (for perspective, Earth is ~3x the distance from Mercury to the Sun at 94M miles).</p></div>		</li>
