			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I've always wondered something... Why are the blades so thin? Traditional windmills had much fatter blades. Were they wrong? Or did they serve a different purpose?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The chart I included has the old style wind turbine, <a href="https://www.renewableenergyhub.co.uk/images/design/pages/Old_Windmill.png" target="_blank">these guys</a>, listed as &quot;american wind turbine&quot;.  They work best at at a tip speed ratio around 1 and top out at a little over 30% efficiency. So they spin slower and are less efficient than the modern 3 blade style. However they are much simpler and easier to design and make  than the modern turbines as the blades are metal rather than carefully shaped fiberglass composites.  Also in terms of fluid motion they work on impulse (air molecules bounce off)  rather than reaction (lift from pressure difference of air passing the blade) but that is a whole other lesson. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's very interesting, thank you. I'm more used to seeing the Dutch style windmills - if those mills had a more modern style blade, would they be more efficient?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Efficiency in the sense of physics was not at all the most important thing of windmill design; the focus is not to take as much energy as possible from a certain diameter of atmosphere. Efficiency in the economic sense is what matters. For instance, maybe its only 5% more expensive to make the windmill twice as big; the relative efficiency can drop quite a bit before this becomes a bad economic decision. The question is, and has been, what can we make (with our current understanding of engineering) and what are the costs/benefits. Nowadays we are looking not just at designing individual windmills, but at entire windmill parks, the landscape involved, and the surrounding (energy) infrastructure. There are really suitable spots for windmills to be (and less suitable spots) and these spaces are limited. So efficiency in the physical sense of utilizing a certain area to the max is definitely important. Luckily, 'economical' engineering has also led to more efficient windmills in that sense. With all our modern production technologies we have so many options, and those who require less material, and weight, and energy to produce, tend to be more cost efficient when they are also more physically efficient. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, this makes a lot of sense. The question of efficiency always seemed pointless to me with renewable energy since the power source (wind, sun, water) is endless and free. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so the biggest factor is going to be how fast and how frequently the wind blows (available power scales with the cube of windspeed). This is primary depended on region and usually follows a Rayleigh distribution (<a href="http://www.nooutage.com/images/map-wind-annual-avg-us.gif" target="_blank">see U.S. map here </a> ). From there, there are a few things that can effect the wind speed like the ground cover ( grass land is best, shrubs, trees, buildings etc slow the wind) and height (wind blows faster further above the ground, but wind is also less dense at higher altitudes)  </p>
<p>In terms of packing density, the standard spacing is a distance of 10 x the turbine diameter in the direction of the prevailing wind, and 5 x the diameter in the other direction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apologies if this question is outside your expertise.
Could you potentially use a wind turbine on the windward side of a skyscraper to decrease the wind load on the structure? Since the velocity of the air is reduced by 1/3 behind the blade. Or would this just cause problems with increased turbulence?
Also, would having a non porous surface (i.e. A sealed building wall or a cliff face, etc.) behind the blades raise the Betz limit?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I'm certainly no expert, but I would think this would make the Betz limit <em>worse</em>.  The reason the limit exists is that the air has to go somewhere after passing the blades.  Placing a building behind your turbine blocks the main avenue air would normally take.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wind speed is indeed significantly decreased behind wind turbines, so a row of turbines could be used as a sort of wind break, but /u/dalr3th1n is correct, anything blocking the escape of the air on the far side of the turbine will decrease it's maximum efficiency. </p></div>		</li>
