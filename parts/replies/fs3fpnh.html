			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, there was a new study out this week that seems to now suggest it is quantity of food that makes the most difference, but you are right that they feed exclusively royal jelly to queens.<br />
Also, to answer OP’s question about drones, they are normally produced from unfertilized eggs and have half the DNA of females. There is an exception to this (there always is with bees), but only in labs.<br />
And, occasionally the old mother queen doesn’t leave but hangs around a few weeks, but usually the bees finish her off eventually as she is usually a failing queen in this instance, as opposed to the swarming example.

<p>How? Starvation? Stinging seems wasteful since they die. Does the queen fight back?</p>
<p>Edit - Thanks for the info on sting survival, does that mean they do sting the queen to death? Does she fight back?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, let me get this straight as an ELI5...</p>
<p>Normal bees feed the future queen baby nothing but the highest quality food. Normal bees children get some of the high quality food, but they get mostly peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. The Queen bee grew up cuz it got the best quality food, then it flies out to go find a husband, make a new home, and raise their own family.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nearly correct. They produce a new queen when the hive population gets too big. The new queen will take half of the hive with her and they will find somewhere else to live (this is called &quot;swarming&quot;). Beekeepers therefor have to regularly check for Queen cups so they can destroy them and split the hive themselves, otherwise they will lose hundreds of bees. </p>
<p>Queens don't have husbands. The male bees (drones) only exist to mate with the Queen and they can't even fly. Drones are created by the worker bees (female) as needed. All the males are kicked out of the hive when winter is coming because they're just a waste of food.</p>
<p>The bees will also make a new queen if they're not satisfied with their current queen (specifically if she's not laying enough eggs), and the new queen and the current queen will fight to the death.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Honey Bee drones fly to mate.  Apparently about 20 minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a bee documentary when I was a kid.  The first queen that emerges stings the rest. They can do that because a queen doesn't have a barbed stinger that a worker has that drags out It's digestive tract so it dies afterward. If two queens emerge at the same time, it's two queens enter, one queen leaves.  Maybe they kill the drones afterwards too.  I wonder how the beekeeper would split the hive...the other bees have to follow her...does he wait until she gathers some workers, then grabs her and puts her into the hive they want her in?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad is a bee keeper and I help him from time to time, so I’ve got the answer for once lol. There are two ways to split a hive:</p>
<p>1) If the bee keeper is inspecting his hives and sees that a queen brood has been laid, he can remove the board that has the brood cells and transfer them to another hive box along with other boards that have comb. When the queens emerge the rest of the game is on them and falls into place. </p>
<p>2) If the hive swarms (the queen lays her eggs and takes half the workers and fucks off from the original hive) the bees that leave will find a branch and all clump onto it and each other. They then send out “scouts” to find another suitable place to create a new hive. If the bee keeper notices this happening or sees the swarm attached to a branch they can do two things. 1) set a swarm trap. This is a mini hive box that is often baited with Lebanon grass oil to attract the scouts, and therefore the rest of the hives. Or 2) he can take a 5gal bucked, climb a latter, slip the swarm clump into the bucket, clip the branch, and clam the lid on that bitch. He can take the 5gal bucket to a new hive box and literally pour them into it. The only problem with this method is that if you don’t get the queen it’s all for nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Splitting a hive is normally done to PREVENT swarming from occuring, in which case, you take some bees out of the hive with current queen, put completely new queen you were able to isolate quickly or got from someone else, in the old hive. Put them a good distance from each other so they separate properly. Bam, two hives. Youd probably do that only in the first couple years, that way you still get some production out of the old queen.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The queen may lay in a queen cell (I don't know), but worker bees more often than not move eggs/larvae into the queen cells. So there isn't a &quot;queen egg&quot; there's just a fertilized (worker or queen) and an unfertilized (drone) egg.</p></div>		</li>
