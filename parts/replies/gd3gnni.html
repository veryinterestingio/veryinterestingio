			<div class="markdown"><p>Tell me about it.. I felt so connected with the phrase &quot;you love yourself&quot;, I have two cats, and they would definitely do very good if there was a worldwide competition for laziness.. But they are the happiest two souls I have ever seen, just hanging around, playing, eating and most of the time SLEEPING. I ask myself why isn't it acceptable for people to be this lazy and happy with just being? We are so programed to have a very narrow view of what success or happiness is. We just love ourselves, and our survival instinct is telling us all the time : you can just relax and take it easy, because whatever action you take is more risky than no-action (unless in a survival situation when you act automatically by surrendering the mind to the body without being conscious about your thinking)</p></div>		</li>
