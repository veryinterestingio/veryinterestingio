			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition, it is played on felt because it provides control when dealing cards. It also do not scratch the cards if there a speck of dirt or something. </p>
<p>I've also read in a quora, that the felt or &quot;Baize&quot; is used because that was what was used on pool/billiards tables.  So when illegal card games were being played, they were played on legal pool tables.  They could mark the tables with chalk and swiftly mark it away. </p>

<p>It is not actually felt.</p>
<p>Felt is gummy, balls up, rubs away, is delicate and, while it looks similar has basically all the opposite qualities you want in a card or billiard surface.</p>
<p>It's a high quality wool IIRC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Felt is the colloquial term, but Baize is the actual term for the material, which is wool or cotton (in cheaper instances).   Baize is woven vs Felt which is matted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. It's called baize. A more durable felt like wool or cotton cloth. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a dealer, can confirm. Nothing in the world beats felt for shuffling and dealing cards in terms of comfort, card control and speed. On any other surface it would be slow, janky, and sometimes just awkward.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. This is probably the main reason. If you've ever played card games on a hard top table, you know that you get those cards that you can't get under and have to keep picking at the corner or slide it to the edge of the table. The felt has a small amount of give, which is enough to let you get under the corner of the card. </p>
<p>On my gaming table, I actually use a thin neoprene mat instead of felt. Imagine a mouse pad as large as a table.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Also likely because most cards are Red/Blue backed and Red/Black suited.</p>
<p>The contrast helps.</p></div>		</li>
