			<div class="markdown"><p>This was a huge issue as Concentration Camps were liberated in WWII.  Well intended soldiers gave whatever rations they had, set-up food lines for the survivors.  Unfortunately, due to the extreme starvation that the survivors had endured, their bodies couldn't process the food, and many died.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For anyone who hasn't yet, I highly recommend looking into the starvation studies run by Dr. Ancel Keys at the University of Minnesota in the 1949's trying to figure out the physiology of starvation and refeeding. </p>
<p>It was fascinating, powerful and deeply significant work done by conscientious objectors during WW2! Definitely worth a deep dive (on mobile otherwise would link).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer guys. You simply feed with a low amount and gradually increase it, while monitoring and correcting electrolyte abnormalities.</p>
<p>You do not feed by NG if you don't have to, and you generally don't in simple malnutrition. You absolutely avoid IV feeding if you can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why not IV feeding out of curiosity? Logically to me, it seems like it would allow you to more closely control  electrolytes based on blood work and changing out differnt formula in the bag. I suppose if the patient is conscious it would be better to actually eat to restart the other processes of digestion. But wouldn't supplementing IV feed and oral consumption increase recover rate? Or is there a negative aspect of IV feeding that it should be avoided altogether if possible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Higher risk of complications with IV feeding,  metabolic, infectious, and physical/mechanical complications (from the IV access line). Things like fatty liver, low potassium/phosphorous/magnesium, fluid overload, etc. Interestingly, the body does a better job of regulating when using the normal system of putting food in the GI tract than when we try to anticipate correct amounts via IV feedings. Basically the mantra is “if the gut works, use it.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, but say for an amateur, whats's a TLDR of what you should do in practise?</p>
<p>You've been lost in Alaska for weeks, almost starved to death, and you stumble into a cabin in the woods stocked with sacks of potatoes (carbohydrates), tins of tuna (protein), a freezer full of vegetables, and a press full of centrum multivitamins, sugar and tea.</p>
<p>Whats best to eat on your first day or two?</p>
<p>Tea with sugar, a vitamin pill, a boiled potato or two and lie down so you don't exert the heart?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A very small meal with a mix of everything, maybe/maybe not the multi vit depending on what’s in it. Slow is key. Refeeding syndrome is not something to mess with.  Also avoid sardines if that’s what the cans of fish, cola, any diary products, beer (all higher in phos)</p>
<p>To some extent it matters if your more Marasmus or Kwashiorkor - but in your example you’d likely be total caloric malnourished not just protein.</p></div>		</li>
