			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition, not all mountains are peaked. Stratovolcanos like Mt. Rainier in Washington State are more like huge piles of debris, and have rounded tops. Longs Peak in Colorado is flat at the top because its top was once the bottom of the central sea in North America.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This also gets at a question of scale. Very few mountains, even those that we describe as having a 'peak' truly have a peak in the sense of a single, conical spire or something. Rainier, and most stratovolcanoes, are much closer to having a peak than something like a true plateau/mesa/butte.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is true, these examples will both eventually become peaks by the process described above. The reason they are not now is because they are relatively young.</p>
<p>Longs Peak will erode as described. Mt Rainer too eventually, even if it is replenished by new eruptions in the short term because it will move away over millennia tectonically from the hot spot below the crust that is causing the eruptions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mt Rainier is caused by a subduction zone, not a hotspot. Though there is evidence that the subducting slab is tearing which will eventually cause the entire cascade arc to go extinct, including Mt Rainier.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Very true. What we see today is merely an instant in time. Mountains age just as we do, but over a much longer time scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume you mean 'orogenic plateaus', like the Tibetan, Altiplano, Puna, Turkish-Armenian-Iranian, etc. These are often sustained through gradients in rock uplift (and funky geodynamics) that can promote their formation and keep them extant. However, on a geologic time scale, these are all ephemeral. </p>
<p>EDIT: As a more concrete example of the above, consider one of the models of formation of the Tibetan plateau, e.g. <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/367d/6b7d17094a135ac2e27431668472df545a6d.pdf" target="_blank">Clark &amp; Royden, 2000</a> which is arguing for uplift and maintenance of topography by flow of portions of the crust, basically keeping the plateau high and with material being 'fed' into the steep edges. There's no easier way to start a fight in a room full of geologists who study orogenic plateaus than to start talking about these 'channel flow' type models, but it is one way people have thought about the semi-long term existence of large orogenic plateaus.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that there are a lot of nuances (which is good, otherwise folks like myself who study erosion in mountains would be out of things to do!), for example, small, 'alpine' glaciers tend to form peaks and ridges, but larger scale glacial systems like what has existed on some of these orogenic plateaus can develop high elevation, low relief surfaces as most everything is basically planed off above the 'equilibrium line altitude' (e.g. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X16302734" target="_blank">Zhang et al, 2016</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's so cool! I never would have imagined that these plateaus would be ephemeral on a geological time scale. So basically they too will, over millions of years, erode and lose the table top.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey while your here could i ask you, bc you seem to have a handle on descriptors for topography. When a ridge itself becomes more vertical we often call it a flank or a ridge 'nose'. Yet the spaces in between, closer to the center of the mountain to me dont have a fitting name: wash, gully, ravine, and then what?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>for sure, maybe gully a little more of a u shape, or a little more shallow. but the water is essentially still coming at you. after \~45 deg, about and then, especially higher up on the mountain, between the 'fingers', youre not really 'in' the gully so much as on it. But even then, to me, they say 'on the north face' but that is more the aspect of the mountain more generally. but between the top, even below the peak you will have a bowl, or a chute, or a saddle, and the lower canyon type descriptors there is this sort of spot on the mountain i have trouble describing. maybe there is a word in french? say, if you were traversing the side of a mountain, and came around a ridge and decided to incline your route a bit- what is the plane called that you cross- crossslope? sidehill? i feel it needs a name. and as you follow this contour in space, from above the creek would appear as an apex or valley in itself (whereas to me 'slope' implies flat, like a big ramp but without the parabolic curve so many mountains have.</p></div>		</li>
