<p>Yeah actually.</p>
<p>So wait, you can't do screenshots or screenscast on Wayland ? How is that a thing ? IIRC I've already seen screenshots from Waylamd systems.</p>
<p>In any case, if that's true, that's a huge miss for the community, and actually a deal breaker to me. Screen capture is extremely important for communication reasons. Let people make their own security choices... Even on GNU/Linux now ??</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But in exchange, Netflix only gives you 720p on Linux <em>because</em> they can't lock it down so much.</p>
<p>Of course, other sites (the kind that doesn't charge money for movies) don't have that issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>instead of disabling it for the Netflix app, you have to edit your ROM specific files. There's a guide here but it only works for up to Android 9.<a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-smali-patcher-0-7-t3680053" target="_blank">https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-smali-patcher-0-7-t3680053</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm. I’ll have to look into this for iOS, as I have a jailbroken device and an app that lets me view all the root files of both the phone and all apps installed. A long time ago (I haven’t tried it recently) you could go into the files of games like Candy Crush and change values to “cheat” the game, such as giving yourself boosters and in-game currency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apps can attempt remote attestation, but then it becomes a cat-and-mouse game whether you're better at hiding the modifications than the detection system is at finding them.</p>
<p>Also, Netflix has to make a choice whether to run on rooted devices or not. If they do, you can bypass their security. If they don't, owners of rooted devices aren't going to pay for Netflix.</p>
<p>Most likely they will limit quality to 720p and call it a day, like they do for other platforms that aren't locked down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense. I do use another Cydia app that hides my jailbreak from other apps that lock you out if they detect a jailbroken phone. But when I go into the root file app, those apps that I’ve “No substrated” are still visible. So I wonder if I could use the NoSub almost like a VPN. Access the files but still be undetectable as a jailbroken phone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The stupid thing is, I can unlock my bootloader and Netflix will fail. I need to root in order to hide unlocked bootloader so that Netflix will run.</p>
<p>So I'm making my device less secure and opening up the possibility of circumventing Netflix's restrictions (by using root) to hide something that shouldn't even be a problem .</p></div>		</li>
