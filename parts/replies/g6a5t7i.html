<p>So we'll get more bang for our tax-payer buck.</p>

<p>Just to add to this, most people don't realize that NASA is profitable.</p>
<p>Studies suggests that NASA has generated a 700%-1300% return on each dollar of funding they get for the US economy.</p>
<p>This makes it ironic when people question why we spend money on NASA. It's like complaining about the cost of feeding a goose that lays golden eggs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very good reason to support NASA but I don't think most people (especially in business) think of profitability that way. Consider libraries: are they profitable because they enrich the community's knowledge and access to the Internet by a dollar amount that's more than the cost of running them?</p></div>		</li>
