			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be both. Babies actually have an &quot;accent&quot; when they cry. People of the same larger group can more easily distinguish the types of crying a baby is making than they can a baby from an outside group. Meanwhile, a mother can always identify the cry of their baby from other babies. </p>
<p>Language is a group's shared code, but language itself is something all humans do. Body language (and similar non verbal communication) is also different across cultures, but still a shared phenomenon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A man walks down the street
It's a street in a strange world
Maybe it's the third world
Maybe it's his first time around
Doesn't speak the language
He holds no currency
He is a foreign man
He is surrounded by the sound, the sound
Cattle in the marketplace
Scatterings and orphanages
He looks around, around
He sees angels in the architecture
Spinning in infinity
He says, &quot;Amen and Hallelujah!&quot;</p></div>		</li>
