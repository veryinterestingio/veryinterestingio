			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeep, I tend to think &quot;damn, this is a good strategy and I want to watch it unfold!&quot;
I should instead try to avoid it from happening as much as possible as the other side lol</p></div>		</li>

<p>If your strategy depends on your opponent not playing his best to prevent it, it's a pretty bad strategy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea that serious chess players actually compete against themselves is largely a fiction. You see it a lot in movies and stuff but I've never met anyone in my 10+ years of over the board chess play who plays directly against themselves with the aim of winning. </p>
<p>That being said, serious chess players <em>do</em> spend a lot of time at a board by themselves studying positions. Sometimes with books or a computer to assist but often just replaying a game you played recently and exploring all the variations to see what short term tactics and tricks you missed, or how you could have played better long term/strategically. From the outside that probably looks like you're playing yourself to someone who isn't that interested in chess, but it is a bit different.</p></div>		</li>
