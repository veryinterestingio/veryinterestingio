			<div class="markdown"><p>I've only ever had that happen once, I don't know what in the hell started the chain reaction but I went on a semi-marathon-thingie (was supposed to be jog/running for 3 hours consecutive with a 10-minute walk halfway through) and about an hour into it I had to stop for the bathroom. Combination of overheated + over exerted + something I ate apparently = exploding out of both ends, violently.</p>
<p>Only time it happened that bad, and I hope it never, ever happens again. I'd take strep or pneumonia again over that day.</p></div>		</li>

When holding it in your lap you're looking down and have no visual reference for the motion you feel. Holding it up provides the visual reference in your peripheral vision and will help you to not get sick. </p></div>		</li>
