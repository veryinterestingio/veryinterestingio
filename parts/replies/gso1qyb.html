			<div class="markdown"><p>Air movement is basically sound</p>
<p>Applying an 50Hz AC wave over speaker produces 50Hz out, as positive spikes push the speaker in and negative spikes pull the speaker out. This is because the changing magnetic field pushes/pulls on the magnet on the speaker membrane</p>
<p>Now image a speaker that has a metal piece instead of a magnet</p>
<p>At the positive spike, the speaker wants to go to the coil, and the zero crossing, the speaker returns to the original position, at the negative spike the speaker again goes to the coil, and at the zero crossing it returns back to the original position. This creates a 100Hz tone</p>
<p>Some components in the device &quot;act as a speaker with a magnet&quot;, and others &quot;as as a speaker with a metal plate&quot;</p></div>		</li>
