			<div class="markdown"><p>Not for me. I do not get any kind of rest from napping especially if it is the precursor to an event or alarm. I struggle to maintain a regular restful sleep schedule to begin with let alone being able to get a restful sleep via napping. Every time I've napped I've slept for like four hours, felt logy and been stuck awake through my normal sleeping time and ruin my precarious sleeping time. I've tried a variety of methods for napping, including the caffeine shot before the nap but I'd either sleep through it or wake still feeling like crap.</p></div>		</li>
