<p>Since the satellites are in low earth orbit they should descend and burn up if they go defect or decommissioned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, but LEO doesn't say anything about the rate at which they will descend and burn up. LEO covers quite a range of different altitudes, with pretty significant changes in air density. Depending on where exactly they are, it could take either a few years or several decades to burn up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard ~25 years for the orbits spacex is going. Their satilites are supposed to also have a system for descending sooner since each satilite is only going to have a life expectancy of ~2 years, but that return system has had a high failure rate in their launched systems so far.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In order to be able to fly, they would have had to prove that they can deorbit within 25 years after the end of life of the satellite. That is the case in European countries and I believe this is also the case in the US.</p>
<p>At 500km, they should be alright for this even without propulsion, you would need a very dense spacecraft or, given their shape be very unlucky and have the satellite flying in a very specific angle that minimises drag. Usually for that kind of computation we use a random tumble to get a descent rate.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, the altitude at which you start having to consider an active deorbit system is between 600 and 700km. Below 600km you should be fine if you spacecraft is standard. And above 700km you will very likely need propulsion.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Regarding how astronomy is affected, this is now changing because SpaceX has been taking meetings with astronomers and says that they will change some of the design and deployment of the satellites to minimize disruption (making them less reflective and so forth). We don't know how well that will be implemented yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're substantially lower than the ISS, and require ion engine reboosting to remain in orbit for their functional lives (a few years). I've heard numbers in the range of a few months. Less if they're DOA, since they need to use the ion engines to boost themselves after being deployed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of bad discussion in this comment's children about orbital debris decay.  Starlink sats are currently being flown at 350 km. The exact time it takes a spacecraft to decay from that altitude is highly dependent on solar activity and the specific design of the piece of debris, but long-term average for an intact but defunct Starlink sat should be less than 1 year.  </p>
<p>Edit: I'm wrong.  While that's the altitude for the ones they're launching currently.  In the final constellation, many spacecraft will be in higher orbits, with much longer (Millennia) decay periods. Ugh, now I have to go back to being worried about this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i’m all for star link; i think it’s gonna be amazing... but, here are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink_(satellite_constellation)?wprov=sfti1" target="_blank">the numbers</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>~1600 at 550km</li>
<li>~2800 at 1150km</li>
<li>~7500 at 340km</li>
</ul>
<p>i believe the issue is with the 1150km orbits, which, without active de orbiting will take &gt; <a href="https://www.spaceacademy.net.au/watch/debris/orblife.htm" target="_blank">1000y</a> to decay on their own? (550km looks to be ~15-20, 340km &lt; 1y)</p></div>		</li>
