			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a wide variety of factors which affect image resolution and sensitivity. Resolution is the ability to differentiate between different features in the image/part. Sensitivity determines the smallest detectable feature.</p>
<p>A general rule of thumb is to use the lowest kV possible to produce the required image. The higher kV you use, the more radiation is produced in general, and the more potential you have for radiation to scatter and strike your imaging plate from a different angle and mess up the exposure.</p>
<p>kV is one of the factors, another is the quality of radiation produced. The kV setting only determines the peak voltage, but the entire spectrum up to that peak is produced as well.   Filtering material such as thin sheets of copper or molybdenum can be used in between the part and the xray source to remove some of the longer wavelength radiation from the beam before it reaches the part. Those longer wavelengths are more easily scattered or attenuated and can contribute to some of the fuzziness you mention.</p>
<p>Other important factors are the xray source focal spot size and the distances between the source, the part and the film/detector. Radiographs are essentially a 2D projection of a 3D object. The focal spot is the part in an xray tube where the radiation originates. The smaller the focal spot is, the sharper your image will be. A lot of commercial xray tubes have focal spots from 1.5 to 3mm in size. The linear accelerator I use is 1mm.</p>
<p>The distance between the object and the film/detector determines the magnification of the part on the image produced. The farther away the part is, the more it will be magnified and distorted, creating a fuzzier image. You generally want the film/detector as close as possible.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to your source to film/detector distance. The farther away you're able to place your source, the less the edges of the part will be projected away from center and the sharper the overall image will be. The tradeoff here is that the inverse-square law applies to radiation, so doubling the distance means you need to produce four times the radiation to achieve the same exposure.</p>
<p>Then of course you can get a variety of different types of film which have different grain sizes. A D7 film has large grains and requires less radiation to create an exposure, but the image isn't as detailed. A D4 film has smaller grains and takes more radiation to expose, but the image will be sharper. </p>
<p>There are also phosphor imaging plates used for computed radiography, which are scanned into a digital image and then wiped blank with a bright light so they can be reused over and over again. The system I use has sensitivity down to 50 microns. And there are also digital imaging plates which function almost inverse to a CRT monitor, where they convert the radiation received directly into a digital image. The ones I've used have sensitivity in the range of 100-140 microns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You lose resolution in theory but that matters only for features approaching a wavelength in size. For this application it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>You generally work with a sensor, not a film so you can't really overexpose it and overexposure is causes by too many photons, not photons of too high energies.</p></div>		</li>
