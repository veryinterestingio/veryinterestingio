			<div class="markdown"><p>While symmetry and smoothness are things we might find attractive in a face, the reason the face is such an important feature comes down to evolution. Unlike any other animal, humans have evolved to identify each other by facial features rather than by scent, sounds, color etc. This makes the face the focal point of communication, and as the first place we look it becomes central to our perceptions of beauty.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the answers here are wild guesses. One thing that really annoys me is when folks use evolutionary theory to try to explain virtually everything when sometimes the better answer might be &quot;we don't know&quot; or &quot;it's just a random happenstance of existence.&quot;</p>
<p>There are plenty of folks who are deemed attractive, sometimes to a large consensus of folks and sometimes just to particular individuals, that do not fit the attributes described above and may not have any apparent survival/breeding/etc. advantage.</p>
<p>At the end of the day maybe there is an evolutionary reason for why we find attractive people attractive. But we haven't gotten anything close to a scientific understanding of that yet and be humble about our lack of knowledge in this area (and many others where we just tack on some evolutionary answer for why such and such must be the case).</p>
<p>ok rant over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be honest a lot of what we know about behavior really can be associated with evolutionary ideas. I mean we do it with every other species, why wouldn't we attribute it to ourselves as well? At the very least we can say more than &quot;we don't know&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory, you don't actively think it. But we know that, for the most part, sex is for reproduction. If we go by that theory, it would make sense that we would want to reproduce with those with good genes and thus create offspring that will have a good chance at also getting laid. </p>
<p>That said, I read a recent study that suggests that humans (as a species) do not have sex solely for reproduction. Like the bonobo, sex is largely a communication tool. We communicate to others via sex. Whether its having sex with them or not. So with that theory, it might support that we see other people attractive to show that we fit the norm? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;symmetric faces mean a greater chance of cute kids, which means a better breeding partner.&quot; Ah... the sexy son hypothesis. &lt;&lt;If that were all it were, everyone in the population would have a symmetric face and there would be no variation.  There is variation because health deficits can detract from that symmetry, which means the preference for symmetric faces is consistent with a preference for good health.  The sexy son hypothesis accounts for cases in which there is a preference for a characteristic that otherwise does not contribute to or reflect an individual's fitness (like ornaments).  A symmetrical face on the other hand acts as a signal.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In your opinion is facial asymmetry more a consequence of bad genetics or bad developmental environment? </p>
<p>My girlfriend is Asian, and her friends from Asia have lots of facial asymmetry, but her asian friends raised in US have less facial asymmetry. This to me is evidence that points to asymmetry being a consequence of developmental environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems circular at first but it's actually not at all. The easiest and most common proof is the peacock's tail - it's got no survival advantage, it's only use is attracting mates. There's no reason the same shouldn't be true of an 'attractive' face, it's not necessarily linked to a 'fitter' body. I'm not saying that's absolutely not the reason, but imo it's pretty unlikely.</p>
<p>The evolutionary reason for this is that genes which code for a more attractive face benefit from genes which code for preference for an attractive face and vice versa. Therefore, these genes have a competitive advantage over 'random' genes and will tend to proliferate in a population. It's not circular, it's a positive feedback loop.</p>
<p>Once again not saying this is the actual reason we prefer 'attractive' faces. In fact, I'm pretty sure all the top answers are pure speculation from people who have no relevant expertise (no sources....) and I certainly haven't done any research or read into the topic myself.</p></div>		</li>
