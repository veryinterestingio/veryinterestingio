			<div class="markdown"><p>The Han today are a single ethnic group and language, with subgroups by region.  But historically it's more complicated.  You'll notice that the Han line of succession is just whoever won the last war, even if languages and cultures change.  Calling the Han Chinese a single long-lasting empire would be like if we were still in the Roman Empire and called every empire back to 3000BC retroactively &quot;Latin European&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is wrong. it’s complicated, yes, but “claiming to be Chinese” is not something that happened with conquest dynasties. the Jin, Yuan, and Qing never claimed themselves to be “Chinese”, and certainly even during the Han dynasty, there was an understanding of unified “Chinese” culture as opposed to “barbarians” at the periphery of the empire. As people have noted as well, the cultural ties between say the Han and modern China are also much closer. I can still read Han-era scripts and somewhat make out their meaning though someone with a fluent understanding of chinese or better yet, a working knowledge of classical chinese would have a far easier time. no one with above a university of youtube education calls china a single continuous empire</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Historically, China is very resistant to foreign invasion and takeover until the 1600s. There are only two dynasties in all of imperial china’s history that people consider ‘foreign’. The Yuan Dynasty from the Mongols and the Qing Dynasty from the Manchus. Both of them were nomad/semi nomad invaders who ended up conforming to Han Chinese (in the concept of the ethnic group) culture, living in settlements, learning to speak mandarin, keeping Chinese practices and inheritance laws. For the time they ruled, they also considered themselves Chinese, just not ethnically Han- in fact, the Manchus are part of the 56 ethnic groups of modern China. </p>
<p>In contrast, the Roman leadership did not consider themselves Britons because they conquered Britannia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incredibly misleading. Modern Han are far more similar, both culturally and genetically, to their ancestors thousands of years ago than all other major ethnicities. It is not a label inherited through conquest by other ethnically different groups.</p></div>		</li>
