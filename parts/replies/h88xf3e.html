			<div class="markdown"><p>The Holy Roman Empire actually <em>didn't</em> have multiple kingdoms beneath it. There was only one King in the Empire: Bohemia. Which was such a big deal that when the Duke of Brandenburg-Prussia wanted to style himself King, he was forced to style himself King <em>in</em> Prussia to represent the fact that he was only a King <em>outside</em> the Empire.</p>
<p>If anything it'd be the German Empire that was like that. As it included the Kingdoms of Bavaria, Saxony, &amp; Wurtemberg.</p></div>		</li>
