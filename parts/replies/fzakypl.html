			<div class="markdown"><p>There is research being done and the concept of ultra-deep borehole disposal:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_borehole_disposal" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_borehole_disposal</a></p>
<p>And a somewhat pop-sci article about it:</p>

<p>Granted, those aren't in subduction zones, but it seems doable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As long as you can guarantee it diffuses into the core and doesn't just immediately exhaust back up the hole it's a fantastic way to dispose of extremely hazardous materials (this includes nuclear waste). For regular garbage though, it may be better to leave it semi-accessible for recycling in a few hundred years when our technology improves.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In terms of volume, there's realistically not that much nuclear waste in the world. Deep boreholes in tectonically relevant locations a long ways below the surface would mean basically putting it back where it came from.</p></div>		</li>
