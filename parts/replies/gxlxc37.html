			<div class="markdown"><p>They exist, more often called 'variable pitch propellers'. Not often used due to weight and complexity. </p>
<p>Most marine props are very, very optimized for a specific speed range, as are the vehicle hulls. This is super important if you're a giant cargo carrier and a percent or two change in fuel consumption adds up fast. </p>
<p>In that case the hull designer and prop manufacturer work very closely to it down. If the hull is optimized for 16.7 knots, then the prop is optimized for fixed engine RPM (those big diesels have a narrow powerband) and to give best performance at that cruise speed and that engine rpm. </p>
<p>But those ships spend weeks steaming at steady speeds. Variable pitch is something you might want if you run at hugely different speed regimes, or at very different hull loadings. I'd never thought about this but these guys mention it for waterskiing, which makes sense. Hugh difference between cruising, and hauling a ton of people. </p>

<p>Though this isn't a real-time adjustable prop, you have to pull it from the water and tweak it. </p>

<p>Hideous mechanical nightmares but they can literally make a boat dance in any direction. Often used on fireboats, tugs and other craft that need the ability to make zero-radius turns. Just expensive, and crazy, but really cooooool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked on a \~300' fishing/trawling/factory vessel in the Bering sea which utilized variable pitch prop.  Probably the primary reason was because the ship commonly had to stop and maneuver to effectively place and raise the net.  The ship also had a &quot;shaft generator&quot; which was directly driven off of the propeller shaft (spinning at constant speed) therefore reducing the load on the auxiliary generators.  I think VPP in my case was aimed at maneuverability instead of efficiency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once worked on design for a different type of ship with a similar set up. Direct drive, variable pitch, and a large shaft generator. It’s tough to balance multiple use cases with traditional set ups, so this was able to lots. VPP meant we could hit efficiency/range targets at both cruise speed and sprint speeds. The shaft generator and VPP combo meant we could power auxilliaries at various power levels at multiple ship speeds. </p>
<p>The one major issue was a low speed condition with high auxiliary use. You had to depitch the prop so much bc of the RPM need for the generator but low speed of transit required. Led to some very high cavitation, which could eat the props in no time. Basically got the prop experts to tell the customer that it’s just impossible to do everything. So either give up this, or range, or sprint conditions, or something, because you can’t have it all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The WSF ferry <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Suquamish?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">Suquamish</a> (and I think one of the kwa-di-tabil class ones) uses variable pitch propellers! It also has direct drive (not sure if that's the right word since there is a gearbox to switch between ends of the vessel) diesel engines instead of diesel-electric engines like most of the WSF ferries which might be part of the reason, but since the ferries have relatively short routes (less than an hour, minus Bremerton and the San Juans) and frequently deal with strong currents and winds during docking the variable pitch is pretty useful. When I did a tour of the boat before it went into service the crew definitely enjoyed the extra control, but we'll have to see if it's worth the extra maintenance lol</p>
<p>I appreciate your shout out to voith-schneider props, I always love when those get brought up!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Variable pitch and constant speed are two different things in aviation.  </p>
<p>Variable pitch are just what they seem to be:  the pilot controls the prop pitch, either in the air or, as you pointed outi for ships, on the ground (out of the water).</p>
<p>Constant speed props are a bit more sophisticated.  The pilot manipulates a control which effectively “asks” the engine/prop for a faster/slower rotational speed.  What happens (at least on little airplanes) is that the pilot’s control manipulates a valve that allows more or less oil into a piston in the prop.  As the piston moves in or out, it varies the pitch of the prop.  So far, so good:  it’s just a fancy variable pitch, right?  Well, there are flyweights attached to the assembly that the piston moves.  These flyweights  modify the pitch angles available to the prop.  The balance of the oil in the piston and the centrifugal force of the weights provides the constant speed.  A good schematic diagram would help understand this, I’m sure.  </p>
<p>If you’ve ever worked on an old car’s distributor, and you know how it automatically adapts the timing advance depending on engine speed vs manifold pressure, you might use that as a rough analogy.  The constant speed prop’s design is fairly similar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Constant speed propellers are designed to maintain a specific, desired rotational speed. The desired speed is set depending on what kind of performance you want.</p>
<p>In order to get the most amount of thrust (for best performance), usually the engine needs to run at the RPM where it produces the most power. Let's say that's 3,000 RPM. The propeller governor adjust the blade pitch angle so that the <em>engine torque</em> and the <em>tangential drag</em> of the propeller blades counter each other exactly when the propeller is spinning at the speed that corresponds to that engine RPM (some aircraft use direct drive, some have reduction gearing between engine and propeller, but I think all of them use fixed ratio between propeller and engine RPM).</p>
<p>Power is converted to thrust based on the propeller's efficiency, which depends on a whole bunch of things.</p>
<p>In order to get the best efficiency (for cruise), ideally you want to have your engine working at the RPM where it's at its most efficient, and also match this with a propeller RPM where the propeller is at its most efficient - this is one of the reasons why reduction gears are a thing, you want to make sure you can keep your engine at its optimal RPM range while also getting best efficiency from the propeller. Let's say that you get the best efficiency from the engine when it's running at 2,400 RPM. </p>
<p>Even if the aircraft comes with a fixed pitch propeller, like many general aviation aircraft do, you'd still reduce throttle to get that optimal RPM. In more complex aircraft you would have a separate throttle </p>
<p>So, you reduce the propeller pitch controller, until the engine is running at 2,400 RPM (or whatever it is for the engine), and reduce throttle until manifold pressure (for piston engines*) or turbine pressure ratio (on turboprops) is within cruise parametres.</p>
<p>All these factors combined should give you the optimal thrust at cruise power, which results in a certain cruise airspeed where the thrust of the propeller is equal to the aircraft's drag.</p>
<p>Climb power settings are usually higher than cruise power settings. Also, climbs are usually done at lower airspeeds than cruise, because each aircraft has a certain optimal climb speed where it has the most &quot;excess power&quot; available to be used for gaining potential energy (altitude). Then when you reach your cruising altitude and level off, you can set your power to cruise settings, which are usually designed to give the optimal (or close) mileage. And although the aircraft now produces less power and less thrust, and running the engine (and propeller) at lower RPM, it's still going to accelerate (until it reaches its cruise speed) because it's not climbing any more.</p>
<p>If you want to fly faster than cruise speed, you need to increase engine power to generate more thrust. But increasing the speed by 10% will increase drag by about 21%, so you need 21% more power just to fly 10% faster, and because the engine and propeller (and wing) are not working at optimal efficiency range any more, you probably won't get as far with the fuel you have.</p>
<p>So it's not necessarily just that you need less thrust during cruise than during take-off and climb, but rather you get the best mileage from a given amount of fuel when you're running the engine and the propeller at lower RPM.</p>
<p>Also, for high performance propeller-driven aircraft, they might encounter situations like propeller blade tips exceeding speed of sound which even in a best case scenario reduces propeller efficiency (because of shockwave drag) and produces a horrendously loud noise.</p>
<p>* Oh, and manifold pressure behaves differently for naturally aspirated vs. forced induction engines. With naturally aspirated engines, manifold pressure is measured as suction, since the engine is working as an air pump and each piston generates a low pressure that is filled by air rushing in through the intake manifold. Faster RPM corresponds to higher suction (or &quot;stronger vacuum&quot;). By contrast, in forced induction engines there is an air pump (supercharger or turbocharger) in front of the intake manifold, which pressurizes the manifold to some pressure above the ambient surrounding pressure. Sometimes this manifold pressure is announced as &quot;boost pressure&quot; (pressure difference compared to  standard atmospheric pressure), sometimes it's announced as absolute pressure. During WW2, when piston engine aviation was at pretty much at its peak, the established practice with the British was to use boost pressure in terms of pounds per square inch (PSI), while the Americans and the Germans used absolute pressure. Naturally, the Americans wanted to use their own customary unit of pressure - inches of mercury, or inHG, or just &quot;inches&quot; for short - while the Germans used a multiple of standard atmospheric pressure &quot;ATA&quot; (short for atmosphere absolute).</p></div>		</li>
