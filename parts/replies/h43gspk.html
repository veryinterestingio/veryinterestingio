			<div class="markdown"><p>Supraventricular tachycardia or SVT. The valsalva manoeuvre activates your parasympathetic (rest and digest) system and slows the heart rate. Other ways you can do this include dunking your head in a bucket of ice water, though understandably you may not always have one of those on hand.</p>
<p>And in case anybody isn’t clear on exactly how to valsalva: it’s what you do when you’re working real hard to poop</p>
<p>EDIT: missed the word “water”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;gently&quot; pressing on your eyes also lowers heart rate, I think the reason is also related to the parasympathetic nerves. Something I learned from a friend who also had tachycardia episodes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An important mechanism is that the increased pressure stimulates the Vagus nerve which causes the parasympathetic response lowering your heart rate. If done too harshly you can drop your heart rate to the point of passing out, which is why many people have died on the toilet from bearing down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heyyyyy nice to see someone else with this shitty condition. I had an ablation done a few years ago and luckily the episodes are a lot easier to stop when they happen now. It used to last anywhere from 3-4 hours and a time at 180-200 bpm. Unpleasant doesn't quite describe how it feels lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Former USAF aviator here.  The valsalva also helps equalize pressure in your sinuses, which can't be done by the yawning/tilting/jaw movements folks to do equalize pressure across the eardrum.  If you've got a &quot;sinus block&quot; and go higher in altitude, the pressure can be painful, but not as much as getting a sinus block in descent (especially a rapid one), and the second situation can actually cause bruising/tears in the linings of your sinuses.  This is one reason aviators get DNIF (Duty Not to Include Flying) if they get a cold, and why people frequently carry Afrin with their gear.</p>
<p>If your sinuses are just mildly blocked and the descent is slow enough, keeping up the pressure equalization is easy.  However, during one rapid <em>unpressurized</em> descent, I got a block that I couldn't clear quickly enough and ended up with severe pain for about an hour, along with throbbing in my sinuses any time I bent over for weeks afterwards.  The long story is that I was a B-52 Electronic Warfare Officer and we'd done a live drop from the internals, which requires the Navigator to check the bomb bay condition before landing (meaning unpressurized below 10K feet), but due to weather (or air traffic control, don't recall exactly why), we had to stay high for much longer than we wanted.  To help the time crunch, were able to get a 25K clearance, go on oxygen, and depressurize (so the hot bleed air ducts the Nav had to pass could get the required cooling time in for safety).  When we got clearance for 10K, the pilot started a rapid descent (spoilers up and gear down) and I cleared off to help the Nav.  However, I started to feel a block and couldn't clear it, so I started looking for my Afrin, but quickly recalled I'd given it to someone else on a prior flight.  By the time I realized I couldn't do anything, the Nav had already gone back, so I couldn't tell the pilot to climb so I could try to unblock my sinuses, and thus I was stuck for a few minutes.  I was finally able to get some Afrin from another crewmember and finally clear the block, so the pain subsided a good bit, but didn't abate.  Thankfully, it didn't cause me any long-term damage other than the aforementioned few weeks of occasional discomfort.</p>
<p>Sometimes, surgery is required to correct unclearable blocks, or to correct a defect that's causing them.  I knew a fellow aviator who had regular and severe blocks, so they did a fat transfer to fill up his affected sinuses (weird and gross, but it worked).</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm confused, wouldn't you just breathe out of your nose if you exhale out of your mouth but your mouth is closed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you valsalva for scuba diving or inner ear tests you have to also plug your nose, and this builds pressure in the head and ears (not the type op was describing).</p>
<p>When you valsalva for weightlifting you exhale against a closed glottis/trachea. This builds intra-abdominal pressure and can actually be done with your mouth open if you choose. The air is being blocked lower down in the glottis, so it doesn't matter what you do with your mouth or nose.</p></div>		</li>
