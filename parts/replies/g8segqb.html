			<div class="markdown"><p>There is so much left to discover! I am constantly amazed and what is discovered and our techniques are constantly changing and improving. But discoveries are not just about finding new specimens -- sometimes reanalysis of existing specimens and collections provide the most shocking discoveries. And while paleontologists increasingly use tools developed by other fields (e.g., computer science, physics), it is really important to have training within paleontology. For example, you can run a fancy machine learning analysis using fossil data, but without fully understanding the underlying fossil data, one won't be able to fully interpret the results/understand the limitations of the analysis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of us come to paleontology with a mix of biology and geology degrees. You need the background from each to help you piece together information from the past. It depends on what you want to do, also. You could be a scientific illustrator (need an art background) or a science communicator (journalism background).</p></div>		</li>
