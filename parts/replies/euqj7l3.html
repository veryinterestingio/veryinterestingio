			<div class="markdown"><p>Sound in air dissipates more quickly than light. Additionally, the further sound travels, the more it's reflected, so the less of a &quot;quick clap&quot; and more of a &quot;long rumble&quot; that you get. </p>
<p>You can see the light from a strike from around 100-120 miles away, but the sound of thunder only carries 10-15 miles. Sound travels about 1 mile every 5 seconds, so at those distances, the sound comes around a minute after the light (if you can even hear it).</p>
<p>Basically, a big strike 20 miles away and a small strike 1 mile away can look identical, but, will sound drastically different.</p></div>		</li>
