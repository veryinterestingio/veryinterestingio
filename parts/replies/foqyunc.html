			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that there's about 2000 lbs of atmosphere above any square foot of the earth's surface, including your head.  The same principle is why you can pick up a leaf without exerting hundreds of pounds of force.  If you seal off the area under an object and remove the air, the force appears again.  And that's how suction cups work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is sort of what is done to make artificial ponds. You dig a hole and lay tarp in it. The problem is that the tarp needs to cover the entire pond so that the water does not just flow around it. This have some issues on bigger lakes. But when you do this it will compress the sediments under the tarp and compact them as you expect. So if you dig up an artificial pond there is a big difference between the dirt over and under the tarp. The dirt over it is very loose while under it the dirt is packed together very hard.</p></div>		</li>
