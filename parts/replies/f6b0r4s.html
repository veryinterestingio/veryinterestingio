			<div class="markdown"><p>The easy answer is language. Think of a mother singing to their child. Every culture the language we use sounds different, and music such as singing is just talking, but prettier. Now add an instrument its just emulating singing in the language you know. Listen to the difference between English, Indian, Arab, Asian ect speech patterns and the &quot;notes&quot; we speak in. Then listen to the traditional music from those cultures. Bollywood for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're all making this way more complicated than it should be. It's supposed to be ELI5</p>
<p>Melody usually has the highest pitch, usually has the most rhythmic variation and usually only requires one person to sing it. Whichever instrument is doing the strongest combination of these is usually  what the melody is.</p>
<p>The most important thing is we learn to sing happy birthday songs and whatnot as children, so that shapes what our perception of a melody is. Our brains are tuned to it through years of training. If you want to sing it, it's probably the melody.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're right in the case of the average song of any genre, but there are certainly tracks where all three of these are false. There are barbershop quartet or a capella or choral tracks where the middle voices have the melody, for example. Usually you know it's the melody in those situations because of relative dynamics and a vague perception of the whole melody having a recognizably melodic arc, as opposed to the bass notes or higher harmonies which might have much less melodic &quot;logic&quot; in how they jump around or stay in the same place. </p>
<p>That also doesn't answer the question of, &quot;Why do we hear chords as chords and not as a bunch of notes played at the same time?&quot; The answer to that is that we DO hear them as a bunch of notes played at the same time, which is why lots of music theorists will include the melody note in the current chord despite it being played on a completely different instrument and having a really different purpose in the song. But those notes playing at the same time also interact with each other (because of the higher harmonics of those notes), and notes on similar sounding instruments sound to us like they're interacting more strongly (because they share more of those higher harmonics) so when similar instruments play multiple notes we hear them gel together into a chord. That's why a piano playing 4 notes sounds like a chord, while a flute, a violin, a synthesizer, and a timpani playing the same 4 notes sounds a lot less like a chord.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of dubstep is good evidence that harmony and melody aren't as important as rhythm for dance music, but most popular/good dubstep has at the least a nice melody in the form of a good and catchy bass line. Bass is often ignored, but it's the main musical element in bass music like dubstep, bass house, and drum and bass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the answer, as it's been said in other comments, is that a melody is predictable and familiar, which gets you high. Whether you know what a major scale is or not (do-re-mi...), you've had tons of exposure to it, and your brain knows that this grouping of tones go together, no matter which order they are arranged. Play any of the notes in the major scale in any order on a predictable beat and you make a very passable melody every time. We grew up with the major scale, so it's ingrained in our memory. There isn't anything special about the major scale other than it's established in the memory of our society. If someone plays musical notes that don't fit into a particular established scale, we won't recognize that grouping of notes and our brain will have a hard time predicting the pattern. If it's unfamiliar and we can't predict it, we will perceive it as random (as opposed to melody), and we won't get that high we get from correct predictions or familiar sounds.</p>
<p>My guess, but this may be why older people tend not to enjoy newer (unfamiliar) music, or why music you used to dislike grows on you later, because the pattern becomes more familiar and satisfying (or gains new positive emotional associations).</p>
<p>As well, certain tone patterns (scales) are connected to certain emotions by conditioning. For example, sad music playing during the sad part of a story or song. That grouping of notes is almost arbitrarily sad, in that it's only sad because we repeatedly associate it with sad scenarios. Also conjecture here, but certain patterns of music might also follow familiar patterns of emotional human vocalisations, such as long wails, or quick excited speech, triggering an emotional response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I can see, there are three central issues here (if we limit the scope of the discussion to the perception of melody, disregarding harmony):</p>
<p>The first issue has to do with the perception of melody as a discrete unit of musical structure. When we hear, let’s say, a suitably arranged sequence of notes from the major scale, we do not perceive that sequence as <em>merely</em> a sequence of notes—we perceive that sequence of notes as a cohesive <em>unit</em> (i.e., a melody). This is similar to how we perceive syntactical structure in language comprehension: A sentence is perceived not merely a sequence of words, but as a cohesive linguistic unit, held together by its constituent words. Hence, the question is: Why do we perceive melody at all (rather than just sequences of notes)?</p>
<p>The second issue has to do with boundary conditions for melody perception. Given that we are able to perceive melody, why is it that some sequences of sounds are perceived as melodic, and others are not? This could be expectation driven, as you suggest, but—and I mean this very respectfully—one would have to study the scientific literature on the topic to see what the experts say (I assume you are not an expert, but feel free to correct me if I’m wrong).</p>
<p>The third issue has to do with processing limitations of melodic perception. For instance, we can typically perceive multiple melodies playing at the same time, even when the timbre for each melodic part is highly similar. How does the perceptual/cognitive system separate one melody from another in such circumstances? How many distinct melodies can be perceived, and why is the limit where it is?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding the second point, definitely no expert. What I have read on the subject has either been in passing, or the result of midnight curiosity. It's also been awhile since I've read anything on the subject. And some of what I've said is wholly speculative.</p>
<p>Regarding your other two points, unfortunately, other than more speculation, I cannot add to the discussion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I’m not well versed in music psychology, I have taken quite a few music and psychology courses. From my very limited memory, I can recall that no one has a fucking clue.</p>
<p>We have a few (conflicting) ideas on how we hear certain sounds let alone understanding how we interpret them.</p>
<p>Now before I get blasted because “we have hearing aids so we obviously know how that shit works.” Let me say this. We do understand how sounds get into the processing stage, we just don’t understand is anything past that. </p>
<p>Psychology has a lot of catching up to do to be on par with other sciences. It’s only recently been accepted, comparatively speaking. From what I’ve gathered, this particular area of study lacks the funding that other psychologies have (i.e. clinical psychology).</p></div>		</li>
