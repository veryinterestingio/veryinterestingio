			<div class="markdown"><p>The 6502 had direct memory access for most operations, so you could say</p>
<p><code>load value1, $4002   ; memory address 4002. Address that stores y</code></p>
<p><code>add value1, #5          ; actual value 5. The number to add</code></p>
<p><code>store value1, $4010 ; memory address 4010. Address that stores x</code></p>
<p>Of course that's not actual 6502 assembly, but pseudocode for the operations.</p></div>		</li>
