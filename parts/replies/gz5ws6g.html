			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is correct. It‚Äôs a visual association. </p>
<p>When I broke my ankle several years ago I was having a lot of problems in the first year with numbness on the side of my foot. My orthopedist recommended rubbing things on my foot with very identifiable feels to ‚Äúwake‚Äù those nerves. Like, rubbing hairbrush bristles on my foot for example. But he was very specific in telling me not to watch tv while I do it but to watch the brush rubbing against my foot so my mind would make a clear association. After about 6 weeks of this i started getting feeling back in my foot and its 100% today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a common theme in brain plasticity, which is the concept that you can retrain the connections in your brain to accept new stimuli. The idea with the brush thing is to create an expectation: &quot;I see a brush on my foot, it should feel like this&quot; to then associate with a repetitive response: &quot;These nerves over here keep firing&quot; and form that link over time. </p>
<p>You can use the same concept to nap new sensory inputs onto existing nerves. Some cool  examples I'm aware of are mapping the grey scale output of a head mounted video feed (think go pro) to a tactile response on a blind person's back in real time, allowing them to see the environment and react to, for example, a ball being thrown to them. Or mapping a gyroscope to electrodes temporarily attached to a patient's tongue as a therapy for chronic balance or vertigo issues.</p>
<p>Norman Doidge's <em>The brain that changes itself</em> is a really good read on the topic if you're interested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if this is why my dad‚Äôs doctor told him to put a mirror in between his leg stub (he has a amputated leg) and his good leg. My dad suffered from phantom pain, and doctor told him to cover his stub with the mirror, so it reflects his good leg, making it look like both his legs were there. Possibly the same thing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a better explanation. </p>
<p>A warm soft cushion that feels like a human body doesn't mean a lot. </p>
<p>A warm human body giving off pheromones, scents and chemicals we don't consciously notice but our sensitive sense of smell, touch and taste can detect in minute detail without us knowing means everything. </p>
<p>If you were in a dark room or blind folded, anyone would be able to tell which one was the warm soft lifeless cushion that felt like a human body, and which one was the real actual living person. </p>
<p>And that's only to trigger the sense of any human body. That same sense is a hundred times more powerful when you are near someone you care about or cares about you. Think of your parent that you've sensed since the day you were born. The sibling you've lived with since you were babies. </p>
<p>Sexual attraction is a whole different connection. Imagine the invisibile chemical cloud we create when we meet someone we are sexually attracted to and they are attracted to us. You don't have to speak words to make yourselves aware that something powerful is happening between two people.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is why those padded, heated toilet seats are so creepy. I know it's not real flesh, but I can't dismiss the idea I'm sitting on someone's lap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're missing out on probably the most important factor: psychological effects. Mind and body are one on a biological level. Many of these effects are probably mediated by perceptual processing and the role of pheromones and chemicals might not be as important as it seems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. For some of us, touch is the closest you can get as a sign of social acceptance. To be allowed to touch someone means you are &quot;safe&quot; to them. They permit you in a space where they are vulnerable.</p>
<p>I don't know how that applies to babies. When my children were in the NICU, I and I requested their father do this as well, stripped off our shirts and put the newborns on our chests. Our bodies regulated skin temperature for the babies and their heart rates calmed - I think part of it was the babies could hear our heartbeats and that was what they were used to hearing inside of me.</p>
<p>I see touch as very bonding and accepting. I won't permit people to touch me nor touch them for fear of being overly intimate and too offensive. I really liked BDSM culture because permission to touch is very explicitly discussed about consent. You don't touch without invitation first. </p>
<p>It's considerate of others and to be given that permission to enter someone else's vulnerable space, skin to skin, is a strong statement of them not finding you a threat. And you can both relax and just soak in that you are accepted and welcomed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also had a child in the NICU - we did loads of skin to skin (or 'kangaroo care') and were also told it did a lot of good things for the baby (calmed them down, regulated temperature and breathing) and also helped with bonding. They also gave mothers little cloths to put in our bras for a few days that were then put under our baby's heads in their incubators, so that they'd learn our scent. I think some of this is psychological - but some is biology - scent, warmth, the rhythm of breath and heart beat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also note that mothers and to an extent fathers as well will regulate their own body temperature to warm an infant with direct skin contact. It‚Äôs definitely noticeable when your body sends more blood to the location to keep the infant‚Äôs body temperature regulated slightly above your own.</p></div>		</li>
