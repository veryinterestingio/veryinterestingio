<p>This is a very low estimate; sailing between Europe and the Americas would often take longer than that.  Even sailing warships, packed with men, often had an endurance of over 100 days.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Though it seems odd to me that the Admiralty, so exact and controlling in most things regarding stores, doesn't make a habit of having ships do this explicitly.  It seemed to be more of a thing some captains did, and some did not.  There could be some issues with the type of canvas (sails) used to collect and funnel the water.  If improperly stowed they could become moldy (before use makes for bad water, or after use making for worthless spare sails), or they could have been treated with toxic materials (sometimes painted, dyed, bleached, or tarred etc).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't  point to a specific official source, but have seen a number of mentions of rain collection.  I do not think it was common for filling stores, done only when stores were dangerously low, but you can bet individual sailors took advantage of being able to get some fresh water.</p>
<p>My statement about a month, was for planning, yes, I agree, a ship, if needed, could operate much longer, I have seen as long as 6 months, but it was still common to provision at ports along the way, or water at a river.  A ship of the line could take on in the range of 40,000 gallons of water, and another 20,000 gallons of beer or spirits.  I believe HMS Victory actually carried mostly beer rather than water, from when I visited there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's for responding.  The capacity of the <em>Victory</em> is interesting: 60&#8239;000 gallons and crew of 837 gives an endurance of 72 days at a gallon per day.  I also had useful responses from u/seicar and u/arkham1010 citing Patrick O'Brien and Captain Thomas Pasley.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't have any historical references to cite, but in the Jack Aubrey novels about life on British sailing ships during the late Napoleonic wars, the author describe how they would set sails horizontal on the deck during rainstorms to collect the water.</p></div>		</li>

As far as I’m aware there’s nowhere to stop in between - especially considering most of the islands in between were probably held by nations they were at war with (Spain and Portugal).</p></div>		</li>
