			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine the TV is a hard-of-hearing person listening for a voice they understand. The colours are described (encoded) in language (the signal) and if the person can't hear the language they're listening for, they just keep turning their hearing aid up louder and louder. But there is no one speaking their language so their hearing aid is just amplifying the sounds of the wind, animals, vehicles, and other background sources of noise. Like noise from sound, there's also electrical activity from other sources that isn't the signal you want called &quot;noise&quot; that can be amplified into the random cacophony that appears as static.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The TV expects a certain pattern for color information. Which it can’t find because static is random noise.</p>
<p>The same reason why crossing old NTSC and PAL hardware might give you a picture, but it can’t find the color information.</p>
<p>Edit: googled a bit and I think <a href="https://youtu.be/3JFt6t6ijLs" target="_blank">this guy’s series</a> might help if you’re actually interested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An antenna that's longer or shorter than the wave length is less efficient, but cal still pick it the signal. Generally the signal gets fed through a filter to remove anything not at the specific wave length, but if the receiver is cranking up the gain because bit can't find a signal, that can ruin the filtering.</p>
<p>Also the CMB covers a lot of the spectrum, it's just most strong in the microwave. IIRC it peaks around 160 GHz. However it still extends into the radio spectrum</p></div>		</li>
