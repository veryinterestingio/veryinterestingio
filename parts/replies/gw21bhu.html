			<div class="markdown"><p>Same design just different size. All watches began as clocks they just shrunk the movements to fit. A mechanical watch escapement works exactly the same way as a clock. The power might be stored or provided in a different way depending on movement but the escapement is one thing that doesn't really change</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I 3D printed one of these just to learn how they work.  It functions but is loud as shit.  It's very cool to put together and really understand with your hands how the kinetic energy is released in a regulated way, using the natural force of inertia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes after I hear the &quot;natural&quot; tick and tock sounds (mainly when falling asleep), I will try to reverse the sounds in my head. It feels like it works, like the tick will become the tock, and vice versa. So is there an actual difference in the sounds, or is it just a mental thing that I'm hearing two distinct noises? How can that be if I can &quot;flip&quot; them if I focus on the sounds?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Language is context dependent. If you grew up in a language where, for whatever reason, “tock” was the first word in the phrase, you’d probably “hear” tocks before ticks</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sounds are at mostly equal intervals so it's like hearing someone say a b a b a b vs b a b a b a.  They're identical as they continue on, just the start is different.</p>
<p>Whichever you start with is how you're going to hear it unless you interrupt your brain to start on the opposite letter.</p>
<p>If the sounds had uneven intervals it would be a b pause a b pause. Vs B a pause b a pause. In this case, the long paise actually makes a difference.</p></div>		</li>
