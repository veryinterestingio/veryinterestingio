<p>In tunneling, whatever passed through the 'barrier' doesn't break it but ends up on the other side. That would be like falling through the trampoline mat without leaving a hole. That's tunneling!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite honestly, without taking about some maths, that's about all there is to it.</p>
<p>When a particle hits a barrier, it will either bounce off or tunnel through it. Each has a probability of happening. The thinner the barrier, the greater the chance of tunneling and so smaller chance of bouncing off</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would love for an actual physicist to back me up because I'm a layman, but this is my understanding: particles aren't like billiards balls, they're a bit more smeared out over space, and they end up in one place or another when they have to interface with something else. One of the practical effects of this is that for very small particles, if point A and point B are close enough together, they may as well be the same. Even if there's a barrier between them, if it's thin enough there's a chance that the particle's smear of existence will cross over it then collapse into existence on that side. Basically it can jump through a wall because it forgot which side it existed on for a moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A truly accurate ELI5 is kinda impossible, because quantum tunneling is a wave-particle duality thing, which is fundamentally weird.</p>
<hr />
<h2>ELI5:</h2>
<p>People are opaque.  You can't see through them.  Put a strong flashlight up against your hand though, and a bit of light gets through.  If you have a smaller flashlight, you might need to use your a couple fingers stuck together.</p>
<p>Quantum tunneling is like that.  When you don't have enough stuff in the way, some electrons can leak though.</p>
<hr />
<h2>ELI UG:</h2>
<p>First, electrons are waves.  So is everything else.  For most purposes, this doesn't matter; this isn't one of those times.  We have a function, called a &quot;wave function&quot;, which describes a given particle.  That function is related to the probability that the particle is in any given location -- though it gives more information than just that.</p>
<p>Now, this wave function has two behaviors.  When the particle has more energy than is required to be in a plce, it oscillates.  The equation's solution gives you sin() and cos() functions as solutions.  Frequency depends on how much extra energy it has.  When it has less energy, it's a decaying exponential (again, decays faster the less energy it has compared to the required minimum).  It's not discontinuous though -- the function smoothly goes to zero at a finite-energy boundary.</p>
<p>Thus, let's consider if we have two places the particle could be, separated by an energy boundary, and we put it on the left side.  <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RkbTd.png" target="_blank">The wave function is mostly contained on the left side, but there's that decaying edge part that goes through the wall... leaving a little bit that leaks through</a>.</p>
<p>Thus, while classically, the particle can't cross the wall, quantum mechanically, the wall is a bit leaky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in what way do we check on which side the electron is? It doesn't forget where it's at, we just don't know until we check right?
But isn't that where checking makes it just be on a side, so how do we know that the 0 is a 0 before we check?
Or I just mix up too much stuff again.. would love some comment to this...
Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may not be obvious, but this is actually a two part question:</p>
<p>1) At what point does the electron stop being somewhat in both places at once, and actually make a decision about what it's going to do with its life?<br />
2) How do we, the humans outside, find out what's going on in there?</p>
<p>These are both somewhat challenging, and <em>are</em> two very different things.</p>
<p>For the first, it's something something known as &quot;wave-function collapse&quot;.  Basically, if it bumps into something (i.e. interacts with it), that causes it to have to pick.  If the something in question is small enough, and isolated enough, instead they two can get mixed up and stay coherent, but that's a separate topic (entanglement).</p>
<p>Note that it doesn't exactly &quot;forget&quot; where it's located -- it more spreads out.  In the extreme case of photons, you can have <em>one single</em> photon hit a beam splitter, and go down both paths.  That sounds totally insane, but it has been done experimentally.  (I've done that experiment, actually, although it was with a double-slit rig instead).</p>
<p>For the second, that's an engineering question.  Usually some kind of charge multiplier, or an electrostatic effect thing, where the particle's existence changes the nearby voltage a slight bit.</p>
<hr />
<p>Note that for a SSD, we don't really have either of those effects going on much.  We push a <em>lot</em> of electrons up against the wall, and (due to previous experiments) know how long to wait to be sure that enough end up going through.  It's just a law of large numbers thing.  Also, because the electrons are in a material, they're interacting a lot with many things, and won't sustain a coherent quantum state for long at all.</p>
<p>When we want to check if there are electrons in the bucket, we try to push a few electrons right by it.  If it's full, they get repelled and don't flow through.  If it's empty, they flow on by with no problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no, ELI5 for the essence of quantum physics is an age-old problem which is unsolved, ie. there's no good simple analogy or way to explain it as of yet. The best thing I have is the fact that the state of all stuff is really described by a wave function, which is an imaginary quantity whose square tells you the probability of finding the particle you're looking for in a certain location. A particle doesn't just exist at a point, its probability distribution is spread out over a small region. This is the 'uncertainty principle' that you might have heard of. Wave functions must be continuous since they are the solution to a differential equation, so even if there's a region of space that would require an infinite amount of energy to get to, like the top of an infinitely tall hill (or for a more relevant example, inside a perfect crystal), as long as there is some probability of finding a particle right next to the hill there will be some probability that the particle runs up the hill a little ways and bounces back, and some probability that it makes it all the way through and keeps going (aka 'tunneling through the hill').</p>
<p>It's literally like throwing a tennis ball at a window and the tennis ball comes out the other side, there's no classical way to explain it because it's like the tennis ball didn't really go through the window, it's just that you though it was on your side but it actually ended up being on the other side because it position is kind of like a random variable.</p>
<p>the physics of wave functions can be derived from Schrodinger's equation, which was essentially a guess supported by experiment and hinted at by the bohr principle (E=hu), which itself was a completely usupported guess at solving the 'UV catastrophe' paradox in classical thermal physics, but both turned out to be correct and now we have a theory of quantum physics which isn't really derived from principle or fundamental theory, its based on these kind of weird guesses that are hard to explain for, but are mathematically consistent and completely supported experimentally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want more and have calc and physics background I can give you the shrodinger equation and some explanation for why it's there! It's really not that far out of reach for someone willing to believe that particles are really waves and that energy is discrete, both of which are experimentally verified. Once you believe that and develop a little bit of math around the Schrodinger equation, everything else starts to seem in reach and it gets easier to open your mind to other results in QM</p></div>		</li>
