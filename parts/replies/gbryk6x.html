			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really a garage project. By retrofit he means they took an existing drivetrain and modified it for this purpose with new parts, new controls systems, all sorts of bits rather than designing a new powerplant for it from the ground up. It's a lot easier than starting over for them but it gets really into the electronics and somenother quirks your average garage wrench spinner isn't ready for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The systems do indeed save fuel compared to a normal start, but it's worth noting that a modern, fuel injected car takes very little extra gas to start the engine when it's warm anyway. The computer can read the engine coolant temperature and interpolate the engine temperature, then from that it calculates the exact (ish) amount of fuel required. They need to have a very lean burn at all times in order to avoid burning up the catalytic converter.</p>
<p>A fuel injected car from the 90s uses more gas idling for 7 seconds or so as it does starting once. And that doesn't take into consideration direct injection. Newer cars use even less fuel to start.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much, as the bigger the engine, the more fuel it will save. Most fuel being used on cold start as it dumps a good deal of fuel for catalyst light off, then when sensors indicated, will begin dialing back fuel.
Its crazy how far weve come in the last 40 years with this stuff</p></div>		</li>
