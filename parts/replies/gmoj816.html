			<div class="markdown"><p>It was the other way around for me. I really was hoping for biggest, didn't really care about brightness. It was cool that I got both :) </p>
<p>It was also somewhat disappointing, because I always imagined other planets having these huge moons that take up great swaths of the sky, but it turns out that's just not the case, except for Pluto. On the flip side, it's cool knowing we have such a superlative moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you mean by greater gravitational effect? If you mean absolute strength of gravitational field on the parent body, then Io wins by about 2% compared to our moon. Though it's orbit is slightly higher than our moon, it's sufficiently more massive to make up for it.</p>
<p>If you mean strength of gravitational field proportionate to the strength of the parent body, then Charon wins that one. It's so large compared to Pluto that the barycentre is actually outside of Pluto. Tidal forces are so strong that they are both tidally locked to each other, unlike only the moon being tidally locked to Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The moons of mars are <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/PIA17351-ApparentSizes-MarsDeimosPhobos-EarthMoon.jpg" target="_blank">relatively miniscule and irregularly shaped</a>. Deimos resembles a bright star and doesn't cast appreciable light, Phobos is a fraction of the size of our moon, is about half as reflective, and sunlight is less than half as bright at the orbit of Mars, so it wouldn't be terribly bright. </p>
<p>What's more, Phobos orbits so close to mars that it experiences a total lunar eclipse almost every night, meaning that seeing a full moon (for maximum moonlight) is almost impossible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Amazing. I figured it would be less bright, but that's considerably dimmer than I would have guessed. So, &quot;high noon&quot; on Mars is like twilight on Earth?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we can believe Wikipedia, Phobos at full phase has apparent magnitude -9, while Deimos comes out to -5. Compared with Sirius (-1.5), that's actually pretty impressive!</p>
<p>When comparing to the full blast of Luna, you might be underwhelmed, but it sure would be more convenient for astronomers, who have to work around that full Moon week every month...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mars has tiny satellites, ~12 km (Deimos) and ~22 km (Phobos) in diameter, but they get quite close to the ground. Mars has a radius of about 3000 km, and Phobos orbits around the centre of Mars with an orbital radius of about 9000 km, so it's only about 6000 km off the ground - that's about the width of Canada. 22 km at a distance of 6000 km is almost half the size of the full moon. However, it's very dark coloured, so I don't know how easy it would be to see by eye.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos, aren’t really moons in the normal sense. They’re large chunks of rock that likely got fired into orbit by a major impact on Mars. This is actually something that happens. We’ve gotten meteorites from Mars and the moon that were launched to escape velocity by impacts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that how our moon is thought to have formed?  I don't know what definition of &quot;moon in the normal sense&quot; you're using but I'd count a naturally occurring rocky satellite in a stable orbit, bigger than a meteorite and too small to be half of a binary system, as a moon</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The moons of Mars are actually quite typical as they have nice round orbits and are about the same mass fraction in relation to their planet as the moons of Jupiter, Saturn and so on. This indicates that they did form together with Mars in the protoplanetary nebula. The &quot;odd&quot; moons in the Solar System are Luna and Triton as they originate from a giant impact (Luna) or were captured into a retrograde orbit (Triton).</p></div>		</li>
