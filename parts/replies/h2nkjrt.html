			<div class="markdown"><p>Noise is created by the alternating blocks and sipes in tires, and the tread block pattern determines how much noise a tire will make. The road surface determines where the sound waves go,  whether or not they will be scattered,  etc. </p>
<p>On a recent road trip,  there was a road in Florida that reflected no noise from my all terrain tires. They were as quiet as my snow tires. Was a weird experience as I'm used to,  like everyone,  hearing more noise on older road surfaces, and that road had the appearance of being well aged. Happened when I crossed into Florida from Georgia. The Georgia road looked equally old, but the second I crossed the border, the tires went silent. The tires have never been silent above 25mph, even on new pavement,  and I was doing 75.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also asphalt tech has improved - I know the Israelis are very proud of their quiet asphalt that sends less noise pollution into the surrounding environment. Whether that tech is widely in use or not I have no clue though. But I imagine when a really old road gets repaved, the compound going down is probably a bit different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a tech where they <a href="https://apanm.org/scrap-tires-in-asphalt/" target="_blank">blend in shredded tire rubber to the asphalt</a>. It make a very smooth ride. Kills two birds with one stone. Reduces oil needed for new asphalt and recycles something hard to dispose of.</p></div>		</li>
