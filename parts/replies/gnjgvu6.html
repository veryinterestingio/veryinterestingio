			<div class="markdown"><p>You can apply the same principle to the Moon's orbit around Earth to explain the tidal cycle! A point on Earth that's directly underneath the Moon will be experiencing high tide. The Moon's orbit is about 27 days, so by the time Earth has spun around once (24 hours) the Moon will have moved ahead in its orbit a bit, meaning the point that is directly underneath the moon is another 1/27th of a day ahead â€” a bit less than an hour. This is why the full tidal cycle ends up being 24 hours and 50 minutes, and is constantly drifting slightly out of sync with the day/night cycle.</p>
<p>(Also, before anyone yells at me, there's <em>another</em> high tide precisely halfway through this cycle, when the Moon is on the opposite side of the planet, so it's 12 hours and 25 minutes between high tides.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plant a cypress tree (or any other arrow-looking tree) on the equator. Imagine that, in your coordinate system of choice, that tree points exactly &quot;left&quot; at noon today. The sun is due left. Everyone is happy.</p>
<p>23 hours and 56 minutes later, at 11:56 AM tomorrow, the tree will again point due left. But the earth will have moved around the sun, so now the sun itself will not exacty be to the left of earth any more. So the tree will not be pointing at the sun. Four minutes from then -- at tomorrow's noon and 24 hours after today's noon -- the earth will move and rotate just enough that the tree will be pointing at the sun again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you based your noon (or midnight) on a star that is far away, it would be 23hours and 56 minutes apart. But since we base it on the sun we need the extra four minutes to be exact.</p></div>		</li>
