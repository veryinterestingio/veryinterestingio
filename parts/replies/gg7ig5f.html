			<div class="markdown"><p>It's how our cells divide. We have a lot of DNA that needs to be copied, but we lose a couple codes at the end of each cell division. Think of it like a shoelace, with the plastic cap at the end. As time goes on, the plastic degrades and the lace unwinds. Same with our DNA, meaning that some code is damaged and won't function correctly. Prostate's no different and it just functions less efficiently, either the muscle loses it's elasticity or produces less fluid. </p>
<p>Lobsters on the other hand have an enzyme called telomerace and it repairs the DNA. They can live forever and keep growing!  Need me a lobster prostate to keep busting nuts that hit the ceiling!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the bigger question is: why do cells age at all? Is cellular senescence programmed within our DNA? If cells can divide and divide billions of times without much of an issue over a few decades, why then after 50 or 60 or 70 years do they start breaking down?</p></div>		</li>
