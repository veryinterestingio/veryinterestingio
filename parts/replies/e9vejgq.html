			<div class="markdown"><p>Not saying it's you, but that's a symptom of many people with sleep apnea. They don't really sleep well during the night and don't even realize it, except they often wake up and they're still tired. They also will fall asleep a few mins after getting in bed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This can't be it me and my wife been sleeping together for about 7 years now, my wifes always been a light sleeper, just the slight graze of my arm against hers will wake her up, meanwhile I'll sleep through almost anything. Even when we had a kid, the only thing that would wake me up is my kid yelling 'daddy!' in the middle of the night, I'd jump up in a instant like a zombie, help out my kid and go to bed almost without remembering the next day, if my wife gets up in the middle of the night she can't sleep for atleast an hour or two. </p></div>		</li>
