			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that I'm aware of no, generally speaking it was thought to be good to have more of them, because it would allow people to more precisely allocate risk to those people who were willing to take it in return for higher payouts, meaning that more people who needed it could get loans, productivity in the economy could improve etc. But it was also obviously a central part of the last financial crisis.</p>
<p>It's not a problem in principle, so long as everyone can follow the chains and cope with potentially things going wrong, but there's also a lot of potential for fraud somewhere along the line cascading into something else, which can result in paralysing uncertainty as people start to loose track of how much money all these contracts are now worth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back when these were regulated as insurance they had rules that required a certain percentage of cash on hand to pay out claims. </p>
<p>Let’s say you want to insure a $100 loan against default; you would need $90 or cash set aside just in case you have to pay. The insurance companies didn’t like this rule, so the “rebranded” loan insurance into “credit default swap contracts”.</p>
<p>Now they don’t have to keep any cash on hand and can “insure” a billions of dollars in loans... FREE MONEY! The loan industry essentially did an end-run around the fed and ginned up billions of dollars that didn’t exist. </p>
<p>Except when sub-prime loans started defaulting in 2007 AIG didn’t have the cash to pay its “contracts”.
The options were, have the taxpayers bail out AIG and pay off their private third-party contracts or watch the entire banking system possibly collapse. </p>
<p>Now if the regulations had been in place on this insurance, the situation wouldn’t have exploded the way it did. AIG wouldn’t have been offering insurance on loans that it couldn’t pay, but that would have meant that those loans wouldn’t have been offered in the first place. </p>
<p>So the question arises: is it better to inflate prices by offering more loans backed by insurance that can’t pay out and possibly have the taxpayers bail out the financial market every once in a while; or is it better to let the market stay relatively flat and have people be forced to live within their means?</p>
<p>Since 2008 it seems the Senate has chosen the former.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, one benefit compared to the imperial era is that people are at least getting paid to externalise costs, with a few less battleships involved. So particularly egregious attempts to get someone else to hold the bag should be particularly expensive. Obviously that doesn't account for getting away with selling them dishonestly, but you can always rationalise that the other guy should have done his homework better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not that bad. I’ve worked in investment banking on derivatives desks - people here don’t really understand the complexity of these products and are sensationalist about it. They’re honestly not that evil and most things are calculated properly. 08 was a freak event</p>
<p>Most people aren't making crazy speculations with these contracts. Its things like big pension funds trying to gain some (relatively risk-less) money from structured debt or trying to hedge other risks in their portfolio.</p></div>		</li>
