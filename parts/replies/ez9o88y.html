			<div class="markdown"><p>So it's down to your microbiome? Sorry if TMI, but you know how spicy food makes your mouth burn? My boyfriend swears he gets the same feeling in his butt when he's excreting it. I've never experienced this in all my god given days (I was raised on scotch bonnets) - if in some awful bizarro world I arranged a faecal transfer would he stop getting that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this, I thought I might be slightly allergic to jalapeños for a long time because I can eat spicy food just fine (largely Indian food here) but those fellas will make my lips tingle, stomach churn, and burn the whole way. Eventually realised it's because they're the only peppers I eat as-is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it helps, if my husband has too much really spicy food, he gets a burning asshole as well. I think it's more to do with lingering capsaicin interacting with the skin there, the bile that your body used to break the fat down, and any possible issues like fissures and hemorrhoids. Unless there's gut flora that will break down capsaicin and any other involved irritants before it gets too the end of the road, I doubt a transplant would help. (Bubble guts and burning butt are different issues)</p></div>		</li>
