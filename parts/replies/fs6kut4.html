<p>Over the course of the next few billion years, the sun will already grow significantly and even to the point where the earth will fall outside of the ‚Äúhabitable zone‚Äù of the sun, which is the distance to the sun where habitable planets are to be found. Before the subgiant state, the sun will already double in luminosity, which can broadly be understood as the amount of energy from the sun that falls on the Earth per amount of surface area. </p>
<p>But once the luminosity has doubled, we and the earth are already way past our due date. In about one billion years, the luminosity will have increased by 10%, at which point we‚Äôre already dealing with a ‚Äúmoist greenhouse‚Äù situation, which means as much as that the Earth is net losing water as the oceans evaporate and the water escapes into space. And in cosmic terms, the amount of water present on Earth is... tiny. The oceans will run dry in several hundreds to thousands of years. </p>
<p>In already 300 million years, due to the sun growing, the average temperature on Earth, all other things taken out of the equation, will rise with 5 degrees. That‚Äôs not even taken the greenhouse effect present on Earth into the equation, which will probably more than double that effect. So in a few tens of millions of years, we already have some serious issues to consider. </p>
<p>But, let‚Äôs not worry about that too much yet. We have very serious issues on this Earth today. Because from the very first civilized humans up until now, is only 1/2500th the time that it takes for us to reach a point where the growth of the sun may become a serious problem. But we‚Äôre well on our way to recreate whatever will happen then with our climate crisis today. </p>
<p>At the cosmic scale, human existence is tiny. But, we have the ability to engineer and we can definitely find ways to survive if we need to. If so desperately required we would find a way to harness an evaporating ocean. But that‚Äôs unimaginably far away in the future. There will not be such a future is we don‚Äôt deal with our artificial solar growth right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don‚Äôt know about the first question, as for the second I can answer a little. The sun overtaking Earth will not be as quick and painless as people think. First the sun will be close and hot enough that plant photosynthesis halts completely, no plants grow and no new oxygen is made. Later on the oceans and water completely dry up and all life as we know it will die out about 1 or less year later if everything wasn‚Äôt dead from severe burning or heatstroke long before. But with photosynthesis dying out there is a large chance that Earth‚Äôs entire ecosystem will die out slowly as with humans because we‚Äôll have nothing to eat. The depressing truth is, everything that defines or distinguishes Earth right now, will be long gone before the sun even reaches Venus. Glad we won‚Äôt have to live through that, but someone will have to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is of course all speculation, but I‚Äôve read that the general consensus is that airborne and land animals will die out first, as for the reasons you mention (there will be no photosynthesis, thus no oxygen, and land animals will suffocate). </p>
<p>However, for another good while (read: probably a couple of tens of millions of years), marine life and underwater plant growth will remain possible. </p>
<p>At this point, I‚Äôll talk about life on earth and not so much about mankind. Land animals will die when the plants start dying, which won‚Äôt be a lot beyond the point where the average temperature on earth rises beyond 25 Celsius. That may seem low, but at that point most plant species have significant difficulty to handle the water evaporation due to the heat. Growth in such climates is barely possible. Just look at crop growth in California or mediterranean Africa: without irrigation it‚Äôs completely impossible to grow anything substantial there. As temperature rises, dry summer after dry summer will eventually cause fires and kill the plant growth in that area for good. This is something we can already see happening in areas in the world because of climate change. </p>
<p>This is a very delicate tipping point which we as humans may even be able to trigger if we‚Äôre not careful. However, if we manage to save that destruction from happening, in about 100-300 million years (which, in terms of the timeline of animal life on land is not even that far away from us) the sun will catch up with us anyway. </p>
<p>(It‚Äôs not impossible for humans to survive this stage. We may be able to relocate humanity closer to the poles where the climate will remain more friendly for a bit longer. Also, who knows what we could engineer in several million years. It would require some impressive global engineering though.)</p>
<p>If finally life on land becomes impossible and the last land plant species let go, then marine life is where it‚Äôll be at. And marine life is in for one hell of an evolutionary ride. As the sun gets warmer, the greenhouse effect grows and the sea temperature (right now: around 3 Celsius on average) will increase. Just like there are reptiles on land that do not have a mechanism to warm their own bodies because of their environment (lizards, snakes, etc. Those species need the sun to maintain their body temperature), that trait is probably going to be reinvented among marine species. Warmblooded fish are going to be a thing! </p>
<p>In the ocean, plants and algae probably will be fine. Above the ocean surface, the sun is a deadly laser that burns anything in sight. But water keeps a lot of the harmful radiation away and allows for better temperature management. And as long as they produce oxygen, marine life is fine as long as oceans exist. Which is going to be the case for about another billion years after land life went extinct. </p>
<p>After that, when the wet greenhouse will start to evaporate off the oceans and deep oceans stop being so deep, that‚Äôs when life on earth probably stops. Maybe some extremophiles find a way to maintain theirselves in some underground cavern, but the surface of the earth will be toast. And even the extremophiles aren‚Äôt safe, as the surface of the earth will melt when the sun turns into its first version of a red giant. Right now, about 1000W/m2 fall down on the Earth on a sunny day and that‚Äôs already enough to make black tiles unpleasantly hot (70 Celsius is no exception if there‚Äôs little wind). Imagine the sun covering about 10000x more of the sky than it does today. That‚Äôs going to be pretty toasty and will melt rocks without much trouble. The entire Earth kind of turns into a melting ice cream made of rock. </p>
<p>If humanity still lives to see that day, which I honestly doubt, that will be the time to check Saturn‚Äôs moon Europa out if its hospitality rating has increased yet, since Earth is no bueno. There are no manmade structures that are going to be able to keep Earth habitable. Not because we cannot handle that heat, we can make brilliant solar shields to deal with that kind of radiation, but everything around us is not able to. And a building doesn‚Äôt keep standing straight when the foundation is melting. </p>
<p>There are definitely some crises for our great- great- great- .... grandchildren to take care of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love how you answered every relevant question except the original one posed. How fast do these transitions happen? Is it semi linear between states? Logistic, where it's slow to start and slow to finish, but fast in the middle? Is there a trigger that causes a fast transition?</p>
<p>For example, when a star goes supernova, it takes a few hours (minutes? Idr. Stupid short amount of time) from the moment iron starts to form in the core until the collapse, and a few seconds after that for the supernova to occur. IIRC the collapse will happen at about a third of the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the original question is when the inner planets are to be devoured, which I did answer in the last two paragraphs. </p>
<p>Our sun will not go supernova, it is not heavy enough for that. It needs to fuse heavier elements beyond carbon to be able to do that. The unstable period before a star goes supernova is short in cosmic terms, but it‚Äôs still not within a human lifetime. At this very moment we‚Äôre keeping a close eye on Betelgeuze, the bright upper right corner star in Orion, as it is expected to go supernova ‚Äúsoon‚Äù (which means: could be in our lifetimes, could also take another few hundred years). The exact amount, especially when we‚Äôre talking about stars that go supernova, depends largely on the mass of the object (especially because supernova stars can be from 8x solar mass to any size beyond, and the more massive the star, the shorter it‚Äôs lifespan and the faster it‚Äôll go supernova). </p>
<p>The transition to a subgiant is a gradual one over a period of two billion years. The change to the first red giant phase is also quite gradual as it is not caused by an immediate event, but by the core that‚Äôs depleted of hydrogen and collapses and starts hydrogen fusion outside the core. That process takes some time to ramp up so it is fast, but not like ‚Äúyou wake up one morning and suddenly the sun is 100x as large‚Äù fast. </p>
<p>The helium flash is extremely short, literal minutes to hours at most. Imagine the core as a ball of fireworks and it suddenly ignites at some spot. It really goes as fast as that, one fusion event gives so much pressure and energy so that it will trigger the next fusion event, and it goes on like a wildfire like that. The transformation towards a red giant takes a while, which is comparable to the first red giant phase. It is caused by fusion starting to take place outside of the core which pushes the outer shell of the sun out a lot, and this process is fast but it takes some time to ramp up. </p>
<p>As for the exact transition times, it‚Äôs difficult and it‚Äôs not exactly my field of expertise so maybe someone more knowledgeable in this specifically is able to shed some more light on that. What I do know, is that it is incredibly difficult to know for sure. </p>
<p>Realize that we‚Äôre talking about periods of billions of years, while we‚Äôve been studying the stars as a species for only about 2000 years now, and only a couple of decennia with the deep space telescopes. Imagine that we would make a movie of 2020, we record 24/7, for an entire year, at 30fps. If that movie was the lifespan of a sun-like star, we‚Äôve only seen 4 frames of the movie so far. So we need to base our knowledge based on expectations, calculations and the remnants of these events that have happened in the past, and try to theorize what has happened that caused what we see now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, it‚Äôs quite difficult to give a simple answer to that. </p>
<p>On one hand it seems as simple as it could be: more hydrogen, means more fuel, means a longer lifespan for the ‚Äúregular lifetime‚Äù of our sun before it would start to act weird and grow. </p>
<p>But it‚Äôs not as simple as that, because by adding more matter to the core, you supply it with more fuel but the increased mass also causes more fusion reactions to happen at the same time because more fusion reactions are caused at once, so the rate increases and the heat of the star increases. As for sub-supernova masses I‚Äôm not sure how this works, but masses that will go supernova follow the rule: the higher the mass, the shorter the lifespan of the star and the hotter it will burn. If we would extrapolate this logic, adding hydrogen to our suns core would likely have the opposite effect and would only make the lifespan shorter, while also making the sun burn even hotter. </p>
<p>Interestingly, stars smaller than our sun won‚Äôt create a core like our sun does. Those stars become red dwarfs and they will probably burn for billions and billions of years to come. Red dwarfs will likely last longer than the time since the creation of the universe until now, and that time times ten. So there‚Äôs also proof for the other end of the spectrum that a lower mass will actually be beneficial for the lifespan of the star. </p>
<p>So to answer your question: probably the opposite. Increasing the mass of a star usually makes the star burn faster and hotter.</p></div>		</li>
