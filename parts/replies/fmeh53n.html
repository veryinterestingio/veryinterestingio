			<div class="markdown"><p>The modern V8 in my car uses 5.0 liters with an 11:1 compression ratio. So it compresses 5.5 liters down to 0.5 liters. However, that 5 liters is spread across 8 different cylinders, so each cylinder gets 1/8th of that. Each cylinder compresses approximately 0.69 liters down to 0.06 liters.</p>
<p>The compression ratio of 1.5:1 (3 liters / 2 liters) is the unmentioned horrifically inefficient aspect of OP's example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not really about the displacement, it’s about how you go about making the boom.</p>
<p>Gasoline engines usually have a ratio between 8:1 and 12:1. Mazda managed to find a way to increase the compression ratio up to 14:1 for their gas engines(and can actually run in some conditions without a spark )</p>
<p>14:1 is where Diesel engine ratios start. they can have compression ratios up to around 25:1.
Diesel engines don’t have a spark plug because compression generates enough heat that fuel is applied at the right time instead of a spark. </p>
<p>Looking at this number alone I’d argue that diesel engines will always have the efficiency upper hand but, displacement ratio is only part of the game. lately it seems smaller forced air engines have been winning on efficiency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not the most meaningful measure of <em>engine size</em>. The literal size of the engine depends on the type and features. </p>
<p>A 5.7L pushrod is significantly smaller (physical dimensions and weight) than a 4.0L DOHC, or a 3.6L twin turbo DOHC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean size in the context of ability to produce power. If you give a horsepower rating, you may be talking about a big engine loafing along at an output it can sustain long-term, or a little engine screaming along on the verge of coming apart -- depending on the state of tune.</p></div>		</li>
