			<div class="markdown"><p>This is such an interesting occurrence to think about. Words are natural in the sense that we made them via our development and evolution but they are not inherently natural. We all have to learn words in a specific way to adhere to another made up system. </p>
<p>So our brain taking a word for what it is... just a sound we make (we attach the meaning individually based on what we learned), is like the inherent brain we were born with overriding the parts of the brain we developed to operate in this modern world. The primitive side of our brain simply hearing the sounds without a real meaning being attached to it, an unfiltered word being heard as just a strange sound lol</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's why you don't see black spots in your vision from your optic nerve, and why you see after images if you stare at something too long.</p>
<p>Like was said, we don't know the exact mechanism. But most theories suggest that it's a similar phenomenon.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Now I can't stop looking at my nose and breathing manually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something similar to this is also why when you suddenly look at an analog clock, that the second hand for that first second you’re looking at it seems to tick super slow.
This is because your brain blurs your vision when you’re moving your eyes, but our brain doesn’t want us to see that blur every time we move our eyes, so it fills that blur up with a snapshot of whatever it is we are moving our eyes to. So when locking your eyes into the clock, your brain actually fills that journey your eyes took to get to the clock with a frozen image of the clock itself (once you look at the clock) and this gives the perceived effect of time seemingly being slowed down for that initial second. The more you know!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, <em>massive</em> grain of salt here.</p>
<p>But one explanation I heard that <em>I like</em> is that when you hear a word, it activates whatever neurons happen to encode the word and lets you properly understand its concept. However, after constant, repeated stimulation, the neurons in question kinda get exhausted and don't fire/don't fire correctly causing the word to &quot;lose&quot; meaning until the neurons &quot;regenerate&quot;. And since your memory is like &quot;hold on, we <em>knew</em> this fucking word a few seconds ago.&quot; you get that weird &quot;off&quot; feeling.</p>
<p><strong>Again</strong>, massive grain of salt. I likely heard/read this in passing and it's <em>probably</em> completely off base. I ain't even <em>close</em> to being educated in this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzEwXIGv32w" target="_blank">Fatboy Slim's &quot;Build It Up Tear It Down&quot;</a> is a the best example I've heard of a recording that induces this phenomenon. It includes a very short sample of a man saying the word &quot;build&quot;, which is looped at different speeds. At most points it's unrecognizable as a word, let alone the specific word it is, until you listen to the beginning of the song and hear it for the first time again.</p></div>		</li>
