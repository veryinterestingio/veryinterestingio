			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ll eat pretty much anything. I like new flavors. Very open. Not picky.</p>
<p>Except grapefruit. It tastes like bile and makes a muscle in my jaw spasm and cramp. </p>
<p>My wife loves it and insists I can (and should) love it too, but there’s some basic biophysical reaction that happens that’s above and beyond learning to appreciate a taste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Grapefruit tastes like poison to me, or like... similar to rubbing alcohol and aspartame? I don’t know how to explain it. It’s painful to eat. Yet I like a lot of other bitter foods, although some people don’t even think grapefruit is bitter which confuses me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am the same way.  Whiskey tastes sweet to me too.  I severely restrict my sugar intake (1 tsp in my coffee is my only cheat), so my sense of taste is probably different than average Americans that consume huge amounts of sugar daily without realizing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the detailed reply, but it doesn't really answer the question I asked. I was specifically asking why humans enjoy eating things that have flavors that deter other creatures from eating them. For example spicy peppers are spicy as a defense mechanism to prevent animals from eating them and most creatures will not eat them, yet humans actually enjoy the taste that was meant to be a deterrent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, keep in mind that spicy peppers evolved that way only to prevent certain animals, not all, from eating them.  notably, birds can eat them and not feel a thing.  this helps the pepper plant by spreading their seed to distant locations via the bird droppings.</p>
<p>Humans may enjoy spicy foods, simply because we know the pain is only temporary and it gives us a &quot;rush&quot;, similar to what DeeEffTeeBeeEh said.  Like how not all humans enjoy sky diving, not all people enjoy spicy foods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also let's not forget the health benefits to spicy and bitter foods.  </p>
<p>Capsaicin has actual anti-bacterial and even anti-viral properties.  </p>
<p>Most bitter foods that are not poisonous tend to have antioxidant or other longevity-promoting properties.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that straight cut really. Capsaicin for instance tastes 'spicy' to humans but birds can't taste it at all and will happily eat peppers.</p>
<p>The capsaicin itself isn't even meant to be a flavor based deterrent but is likely an antifungal compound to keep seeds healthy that just happens to taste spicy to humans. Along the same lines, a lot of plants produce anti-fungal and pesticide compounds that are just flavoring to us.  </p>
<p>Flavors don't work the same across different species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is being left out is the history of preservation.  Or covering up the smell or taste of spoiled meats. Super spicy, super salty, super fermented are all things that generally would taste awful.  But they were all ways of preserving food.  Our ancenstors, depending on where they were from, preserved foods in these manners based on what was natively available.   Which is why really spicy foods tend to be associated with specific regions. Various Fermented things with other regions. </p>
<p>A lot of those flavors are acquired tastes. If you are fed those things from early on you’ll tend to like them.  But even if you don’t, you know you’ll be fed and not starve to death and just have to put up with a burning mouth or awful bitter tastes.  Once upon time eating was about survival more than pleasure. </p>
<p>After generations of eating preserved foods, these flavors become part of your culture. You’re used to them. And they persist today because of culture even though they aren’t necessary for preservation any longer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm from a culture that doesn't eat spicy food, and I never really ate anything spicy before I became an adult. I later married an amazing thai woman and was exposed to spicy food. I eat it all the time now, to the point where my wife is like &quot;dude, maybe dial it back a bit&quot;. I just like the taste itself, it's not a rush thing or anything. Something without spice at this point tastes bland. So idk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is still being researched, but we know the tongue contains some olfactory receptors, so it's likely that your tongue is able to &quot;smell&quot; metal rather than taste it. While this is nonsense in practical terms, it's an important distinction in scientific terms.</p></div>		</li>
