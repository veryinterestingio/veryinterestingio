			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The behavior of electrical resistance is completely dependent on the material in question. There is no &quot;rule&quot; that it increases with temperature. In fact, I would guess that for most materials it actually is <strong>decreasing</strong>.</p>
<p>We can consider a few classes of materials (this is by no means all of them):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pure Metals: Most pure metals increase their resistance by about 0.4% per degree Celsius.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ionic Materials: Decreasing resistance with increasing temperature (often an extreme decrease). This can be considered to include most natural materials, like water, glass, earth, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Semiconductors (bipolar): Decreasing resistance with increasing temperature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Semiconductors (MOSFET): Slightly increasing resistance with increasing temperature.</p>
</li>
<li>Semiconductors (Metal-interface): Rapidly decreasing resistance with increasing temperature.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are referring to the <em>theoretical limit</em> of computation. However, real computers are nowhere near that limit (we are off by a factor of over 1 million if I recall correctly).</p>
<p>Edit: Actually the Wikipedia article mentions that:</p>
<p>&quot;At 20 °C (room temperature, or 293.15 K), the Landauer limit represents an energy of approximately 0.0172 eV, or 2.75 zJ. Theoretically, room‑temperature computer memory operating at the Landauer limit could be changed at a rate of one billion bits per second with energy being converted to heat in the memory media at the rate of only 2.85 trillionths of a watt (that is, at a rate of only 2.85 pJ/s). Modern computers use millions of times as much energy per second.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
