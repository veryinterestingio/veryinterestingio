			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a tumor that turned out to be a cyst removed from my leg a few years ago that was about 2/3rds the size of a ping pong ball. It had been there for well over 10 years, but my old doctor said it was probably fine, and then he left our hospital and I got who a new doctor, who took one look at it and promptly said &quot;Get that shit removed immediately.&quot;</p>
<p>I got to read the pathology report after the surgery and they said that it was filled with a white, &quot;cheesy&quot; liquid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No problem. I even got the surgeon to take a picture of it with his phone after they cut it out, and then he showed it to me like 4 times because the anesthesia hadn't quite worn off yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The smell from those is much worse than vile. I had to remove one that was about 3 times larger than the one above. It required actual general anesthesia to do. Even though I didn't break the cyst open removing it, the smell was so awful they were unable to use that operating room for the rest of the day</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically like others have said a blackhead is a pore filled with material clogging it. That solid stuff is the clog. I had talked about a pimple being a clog with some infection behind it. What we call a blackhead isn’t quite there yet and doesn’t have the infection/pus behind it yet. What some people call a “whitehead” is similar. Little blocked pore that may have some of the oil from the blocked gland behind it but doesn’t have the infection aspect, so it’s not red and swollen and painful yet. Sometimes these will develop into a big inflamed pimple with pus and sometimes not. It just depends on your skin biology etc. </p>
<p>Some people do colloquially refer to blackhead/whitehead as pimples. It’s an area where medical terms and lay terms don’t always line up, and even among what we would call pimples there are different types medically, but again this is ELI5.  In general when I’m using lay terms I tend to call blackheads and whiteheads as “clogged pores” which could predispose to pimples depending on the person, and define pimples as “there is enough stuff accumulated behind the blockage that you could pop it”. Again, that’s not a medical definition but it fits with how most people look at those terms</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blackheads are basically oil and fat that got compacted inside a pore because it got stuck and couldn't leave the pore. The outside is black due to the dirt outside the body.</p></div>		</li>
