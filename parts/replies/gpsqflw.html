			<div class="markdown"><p>I personally worked on a case where the hydraulics actuator on the stabilizer failed, and got stuck in the raise position. The crew had to cut the breaker for the hydraulics and manually push the plane back to level flight and then land.</p>
<p>It takes a lot of force to do this. I've moved the stick with the plane on the ground and the hydraulics off. There's foot rests on the console so you can get leverage. You better believe that they were fighting the controls on that flight. </p>
<p>The fun thing was that once the plane landed, everything worked correctly. It was decided to strip out the entire system, since no pilot wanted to touch that plane anymore. (If the actuator had got stuck the other way, they would have been paste). I got to do the wiring. It was pretty bad, corroded and with illegal splices, and probably at the root of the failure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I install electronics on vehicles. Some of the wiring jobs I’ve seen is horrendous. I’m pretty new to the field and once I started realizing how important proper wiring is, it’s scary when I come across a botched job. It’s crazy what people think is ok when dealing with electricity when they don’t fully understand the science (or they know just enough to get things to work but not properly). </p>
<p>I’d hope on an aircraft the people installing would be highly trained. Then again, if you’re military, that goes out the window.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was military. We do have standards, but we had recently acquired the plane from another unit that apparently didn't have standards. </p>
<p>For example, it is illegal to have any splices at all in the yoke wiring. You are supposed to replace the entire wire if there's an issue. I found dozens, and had to replace the entire wiring harness. </p>
<p>Later on, after a maintenance, one of the props caught on fire. The prop de-icing control has a connector that can normally go only one way, but someone had filed a second notch so that it could be reversed. When they reconnected it, it went on backwards and caused a short circuit. The connector is in an access bay where you have to stick your arm down a hole to connect it, and you can't see what you are doing, it has to be done by feel. Normally not a problem. I still think about that one 20 years later...why in the world would anyone file a second notch?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Outstanding explanation. To add a bit... many aircraft often use a combination of all three “types” of flight control system, taking advantages of the pros/cons of each for each type. Some Sikorsky helicopter variants are a prime example where the tail rotor pedals are controlled through direct linkages (ie cables) but are also boosted by hydraulics. However the boosting is only really necessary at high/low speeds when tail rotor forces are highest, otherwise the pilots leg muscles are enough to take over. The main rotors on the other hand are ALWAYS hydraulically powered. Control forces and feedback are just too high for anyone to fly through without hydraulics. On top of that, the aircraft control systems can include a computer that will perform a variety of functions from controlling a horizontal stabilator to maintain optimal pitch attitude at various speeds to sensing / damping oscillations throughout the aircraft (of which helicopters have LOTS). But the flight control computers can be turned off and the aircraft is perfectly safe to fly otherwise - it just helps make the whole thing fly smoother.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can’t say for certain so I haven’t ever seen their designs or manuals, but I would highly suspect that they do. The forces required to move a control surface (ailerons/elevators/etc) are related to the size of the moving surface and the speed of the air. Bigger surfaces + faster air = harder to move. Most control surfaces on a modern airliner would have to require more force than a human could produce. For the computer - controlled components, there would almost certainly be hydraulics involved too for the same reason - it allows for greater force output with a smaller force “generator” (in this case some sort of moving component controlled by an electronic output). Hopefully that answers your question, although admittedly more in the realm of speculation from my end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw the best example of your description in Man of Steel.</p>
<p>The plane is massive, almost split in half amd being dragged towards a massive gravitational anomaly.</p>
<p>What does the colonel do? Slide that stick forward like a hot knife through butter, no fuss or anything.</p></div>		</li>
