			<div class="markdown"><p>The shelf life is almost always accompanied by a storage condition. 99% of drug storage conditions will be one of ‘store below 25 degrees’ ‘store below 30 degrees’ or ‘keep refrigerated’. These are regulated global storage conditions and must be agreed by the market before a drug is sold into that market. If a drug is stored above these conditions ( say at 40 degrees) then that is outside of the approved conditions however drug companies will always have temperature excursion data and accelerated study data (40 degrees/75% humidity) to refer to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same kind of stability testing is also done for paint, albeit at different temperatures. It tends to undergo freeze thaw stability, room temperature stability, and high temp (110F) stability before products are shipped out. These are to replicate the worst conditions it could be stored at in a factory setting where the paint may be used to coat bulk parts </p></div>		</li>
