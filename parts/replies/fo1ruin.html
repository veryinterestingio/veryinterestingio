			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it’s also got a lot to do with the fact that this type of pain isn’t ‘damaging’ in the sense that tissue isnt being destroyed. Nobody likes burning their mouth with the lava that is inside a hot pocket, but they’ll nearly send themselves to the hospital for a dozen ghost peppers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth mentioning that the world of BDSM is HUGE. It is a big tent.</p>
<p>Within the range of activities and behaviours involved there very well could be something that 'does it' for you. You could be watching a regular, non-sexual, scene in a movie or TV show and find yourself aroused by something. You might not even quite acknowledge it in the moment.</p>
<p>It could be something as simple as a manner of speaking/being spoken to. It's not all meat hooks and whips.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has a psychological and physiological component. Pain activates your fight or flight response, it produces a number of physiological effects that enhance your sensory perception (Because that response was supposed to allow you to deal with danger better...And danger, like predation, often accompanies pain.)</p>
<p>However, its entirely possible certain reactions overwhelm the ability to enjoy the heightened experience. All humans have a variety of extremes in their reaction and some people just aren't wired to be able to activate some of those responses and still experience pleasure.</p></div>		</li>
