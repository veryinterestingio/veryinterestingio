			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm on generic propecia and it's worked magic. I've been on it for 4 months with zero side effects whatsoever. My dermatologist was telling me that he only hears bad things like 5% of the time and that he's actually been on it himself since he was young (he was like 50 with a full head of hair)
Edit: I'm sorry it didn't work for you, I just feel like maybe the medication has such a bad rap because horror stories are much louder than success stories </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about Bimatoprost? It's an intraocular pressure, eye drop, that causes hair growth. It been used to grow lashes and eyebrows. I've been using it for my lashes for years. <a href="http://www.skinfusionbh.com/assets/img/lattise-before-after-pictures.png" target="_blank">http://www.skinfusionbh.com/assets/img/lattise-before-after-pictures.png</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally I can't comment on it as I don't know. However, body hair works different to head hair so perhaps that's why it hasn't been picked up?</p></div>		</li>
