			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, mRNA vaccine tech is just hitting its stride. Inactivated virus tech is a mature method. </p>
<p>Regardless, testing takes a great deal of time, and should be similar in both. Did Sinovac use the military to speed up testing, or was that another vaccine?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory it can be more effective, since it mimics the actual pathway viruses use in infection - mRNA coding protein, protein expressed on surface of various cell types.  Less risky because it's just one or a couple different immunogenic antigens. </p>
<p>It depends strongly on the appropriate choice of antigen(s), however. In the case of coronaviruses, the spike protein is a perfect target. Other viruses - retroviruses, bunyaviruses, etc the choice is not so easy and may require multiple antigens.</p>
<p>I worked on an African Swine Fever vaccine project that used multiple different DNA and protein components and was only marginally protective.  We are lucky covid-19 is a coronavirus and not something more complex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the other hand, maybe the reason it got so widespread is because it was a coronavirus for which everyone had a blank state of immune protection. If it was a virus relying on multiple antigens, chances are more people would have predispose immunity against it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be more effective on average because it can be so specifically targetted. Safety is going to be one of those &quot;sometimes safer, sometimes less safe&quot; situations—vaccines are already so safe that improvements will tend to be marginal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The BioNTech and Moderna should be more effective because they use the trick with substitution of uridine for 1-methyl-3’-pseudouridylyl in 5'UTR which tricks your immune system into not attacking it too early and instead force it to create antibodies.</p>
<p>Preliminary data suggest that it is true, however it will take more time to be sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a common bio-marker for exogenous mRNA. The hope is it primes the immune system to target the mRNA as well as the proteins our cells make with the mRNA from the vaccine.</p>
<p>It’s actually a really clever mechanism and it seems to actually be effective.</p>
<p>Endogenous RNA is capped very differently and should never have its 5’ end uncapped unless it’s being actively transcribed.  This is to prevent the premature degradation and false recognition as non-self.</p></div>		</li>
