			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this as well — it’s ridiculously loud because of frequency. That’s all there is to it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Although sometimes it's easier than other times-</p>
<p>Learned this from a Dee Bradley Baker interview 5 or 6 years ago. Used to do this in class with my head down, leaving a small opening for the sound to get out. Walls were pounded 10/10.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Frequency only affects pitch no? I believe amplitude is what would cause the cricket’s noise to be loud. Am i wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of complex mechanical factors at play when talking about sound. It’s possible that what is being referred to here is the frequency dependent nature of sound attenuation of air. Other things could affect the attenuation are the temperature, composition (moisture and/or other compounds), density, and amplitude itself.</p>
<p>Edit: human perception of the sound matters too. The frequency response of the human ear is also important, and is most likely not flat, meaning that certain frequencies are experienced as louder or softer than others despite the sound waves being the same amplitude</p></div>		</li>
