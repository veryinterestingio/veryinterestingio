			<div class="markdown"><p>By the way, there's an interesting follow-up question: what happens when Wigner and his friend compare their experiences afterwards (i.e. after Wigner measures his friend)? </p>
<p>I haven't seen it discussed in these terms before, so I can't link an authoritative source, but from what I understand, first of all their records must match exactly, so if Wigner lets the friend to keep track of where the electrons hit while remaining in a(n increasingly complicated) superposition, the interference pattern disappears because all friend's measurements end up being entangled.</p>
<p>So Wigner has to measure his friend after each photon/electron, and then it's the friend that's surprised that his measurements end up showing a statistical interference pattern because he measures/entangles with Wigner himself after each step. It's weird but at least symmetrical.</p>
<p>There are other setups like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed-choice_quantum_eraser" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed-choice_quantum_eraser</a>, where a single bit is allowed to be retained (instead of a complete history) and this results in one party being able to recover two  interference patterns while the other sees an overlapping-blobs sum of them, but I don't see how it applies to the experiment at hand.</p></div>		</li>
