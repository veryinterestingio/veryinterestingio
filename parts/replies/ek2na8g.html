			<div class="markdown"><p>Very rarely. People getting paid that low will be laborers or low to mid level team members who are only present for the shoot itself, so like 2-3 months tops. Those types of jobs typically will have several movies in a year.</p>
<p>High level people who are there for pre and post production get paid vastly more.</p></div>		</li>
