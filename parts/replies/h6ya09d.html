			<div class="markdown"><p>There must be a small window for this, wouldn't be surprised if the fact that it's a small landmass compared to the States/Australia means they want to be extra careful. One good wildfire could have a lot more cultural/economic impact in a location like that.</p>
<p>This is pure speculation, I'm from an region that gets regular wildfires</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Australian ecosystem needs small fires regularly to keep the fuel levels down. We had a bunch of years of shit fire management, plus a real hot dry summer. </p>
<p>With that much built up fuel there's only so much a fire break can do</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same in the US (and probably many other places). Decades of forest policy being no tolerance for fires let us get to this point. Now more and more places are doing controlled burns to manage fuels</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We had a conservative government that cut funding to fire relief services for almost a decade and a half.</p>
<p>Fire breaks weren't properly maintained, and fire towers fell into disrepair.  </p>
<p>Bushfire experts had been warning the government for years that our fire prevention infrastructure was in absolute shambles but the Liberals will sacrifice any amount of human life to shovel a buck into their pals pockets.</p></div>		</li>
