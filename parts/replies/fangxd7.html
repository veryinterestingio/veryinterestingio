			<div class="markdown"><p>I love this answer! Most everyone else seems hung up on the concept of a &quot;middle number&quot; as the fundamental misunderstanding, but you answered the question that was really asked while also answering other possible followups at the same time. Thank you so much!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oops. No, because I can still find a way to map the set of positive naturals plus zero to the set of negatives. </p>

<p>This hammered the point home, couldn't have said anywhere near as good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find it easier to think of infinity as some kind of a horizon. What's the difference between something a km or 10 kms beyond the horizon? I don't know if it has any merit, but the idea makes infinity more concrete to me. As concrete as a horizon anyways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you are telling me that a set of all numbers is as large as a set of just all the positive integers that end with... Let's say number 7? üò≥</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Change &quot;numbers&quot; to &quot;natural numbers&quot; or &quot;integers&quot; and that's exactly right. The set of all real numbers or all complex numbers is larger than these sets.
The first set of numbers we say are countable because you can count them: the first positive integer ending in 7 is 7, the second is 17 and so on. The other sets of numbers are uncountable. Look up Cantor's diagonal argument to see why they cannot be counted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, as a rule of thumb, any number set which you can begin listing is the same size. The squares, powers of 100, factorials, even the rationals (start 1/1, then 1/2 and 2/1, then 1/3, 2/2, 3/1, etc). To compare, imagine counting up from 1 to 10. Easy, right? Now count up from 1 to 10, but including ALL of the numbers, decimals and irrationals too. You'd start 1, obviously, but there is no &quot;next&quot; real number like there is a &quot;next&quot; integer. You couldn't even count from 1 to 1.001 without skipping over an uncountably infinite amount of numbers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This comment is all correct but I just wanted to elaborate that you don‚Äôt need to count things in an obvious way in order for things to be countable. The rationals (fractions) are countable, for example, but you can‚Äôt count them ‚Äúin order‚Äù, like going from smallest to biggest. You can list them another way, though, and if you were able to count infinitely it would be exhaustive, and that‚Äôs all that matters. I‚Äôm on my phone and can‚Äôt demonstrate easily but maybe someone can chime in with how you make a grid and go diagonally back and forth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The set of all <strong>integers</strong> is as large as the set of all numbers ending with 7, which can be shown using the bijection x=10n+7 as an example mapping the naturals to this set. However the teams are a much larger infinity, there are more numbers between 0 and 1 than the total number of integers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also because of this there's no well defined way to say that the infinite sized set has an even or odd number of elements.</p>
<p>Even and odd are only properties of finite numbers. Infinity isn't even an integer (or real number) itself.</p></div>		</li>
