			<div class="markdown"><p>Larger stars like the sun actually die long before they run out of fuel. The problem is they are too massive to be able to cycle in fresh hydrogen to the core at a fast enough pace. Smaller stars like red dwarves on the other hand can more efficiently turn over their cores with their outer layers through stellar convection, keeping the ratio of hydrogen high enough to continue fusing it for a lot longer.</p>
<p>Interestingly there have been proposals for surprisingly simple ways that we could interfere with stars to remove heavier elements, so we are likely to be able to keep the sun dialed where we want it, and even extend its useful life immensely by gradually turning it into a dwarf star. Look up starlifting if you're interested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically we would only know for sure if we waited trillions of years, but based on our understanding of math and physics we can reasonably predict how long it will take a star to run out of fuel based on its power output (luminosity) and its mass. Plus we can see how larger, shorter-lived stars die and we can apply those observations to smaller stars, with some minor tweaking.</p>
<p>A basic estimate can be made with the following equation.</p>
<p>T â‰ˆ 10\^10 * (M_sun/M_star)\^2.5 yrs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you come into a room. In the middle is burning candle. You have no idea how long the candle was burning, or how tall the candle was at start. But you can observe the candle right now. You can measure how long it takes to go down an inch (10 minutes). The candle is 6 inches long. It's easy to calculate how much candle/light you have left.</p>
<p>We know what powers stars: a dance between fusion and gravity. We know how those processes work (irony: we seem to know more about fusion than about gravity). Figuring out how much star we have left is easy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can estimate the mass of the star, we can measure its composition by studying the light it emits, and it's size from the mathematical models we have developed.</p>
<p>From that, we can estimate how much hydrogen is in the star, and how quickly it is being fused together. Divide the mass of hydrogen by the rate of fusion, and you have an approximation for the lifespan of the star.</p>
<p>The age of the universe doesn't matter in this approximation.</p></div>		</li>
