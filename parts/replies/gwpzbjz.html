<p>I made a joke (which didn’t land especially well) that I could not prove whether the program would end. I got the job, LOL.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Tough crowd. either you were the 5th person that made that joke that day or they were just utterly humourless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a problem because we observe a trend/pattern that seems to consistently occur across all numbers, but we haven’t found an elegant way to describe this pattern in a comprehensive way that holds true for all numbers (OR, found a refutation or the pattern).</p>
<p>It implies that there is some yet-unknown relationship between these numbers and these operations, which could yield insights that could be useful in other situations.</p>
<p>It is actually very exciting to think about; it is like the earlier days in science when people observed things in nature and tried to come up with concrete explanations for their observations, then tested them to see if they were consistently true. This is the scientific method being applied to mathematics.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For now. There's a definite possibility that this &quot;fun for mathematicians&quot; math will be applicable to some future branch of the sciences you mentioned, we just haven't discovered them yet. It's pure research at this point, but pure research has found itself useful many a time before.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oftentimes we don't reach the point in physics where we need the math until decades or centuries later.  Group theory is a good example, it makes certain high energy physics problems much simpler, but it took awhile to get to the point where we even knew we needed to solve those problems.</p>
<p>Also Boltzmann's work and some related mathematicians.  Ridiculed to the point they were driven to suicide, but they were right all along... and we need their work for many of our coolest modern gadgets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You missed the &quot;multiply by 3&quot;. What is this overshoot the next power of 2? How can you be sure it will not continuously overshoot them? (And in practice it will overshoot a few of them  quite often).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Late to the party but this one really doesn't seem unsolved just difficult to actually write in accepted mathematical proof form.</p>
<p>It's not hard to see that &quot;if odd, multiply by 3 and add 1&quot; always ends in an even number (it is given that odd x odd = odd and that odd+1 = even), and therefore can also be expressed as &quot;if odd, multiple by 3, add 1, and divided by 2&quot; without changing the premise.  Expressed this way, any odd number N will perform an operation that increases the result by 100% at the maximum (N=1), and the % increase decreases towards +50% as N is larger. It can be mathematically proven that this operation, for every N greater than 3, will result in an increase of 60% or less. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the &quot;even&quot; equation can equivalently be expressed as &quot;if even, divided by 2, and repeat until the result is odd&quot; which does not change the premise either. Now we can mathematically express this equation and prove that even number N will result in an average decrease of 67%  (50% of the time it will only divide once, 25% of the time twice, 50% of the time three times, and so on. This equation produces a probability of 66.667% decrease). </p>
<p>So now that we can see the average even # results in a decrease of 66.7% and the average odd # results in an increase of 50-60%, and the fact that there is no upward limitation, and the fact that we can prove the downward loop exists, we can conclude it will always reach the downward loop eventually, and the question is just a matter of how many iterations it will take. </p>
<p>The objections seem to be able to be re-phrased as &quot;well how do you know there is NOT some special upward loop?&quot; and since when do we get in the business of proving negatives lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 'proof' seems like it should be simple; however, it gets complex very quickly.  The issue with your proof is x=7, 3x+1 = 22, divide by 2 and you end up with 11 - another odd number, so it gets larger again (34... which divides by 2 to 17 and then once again gets larger (52... but that gets divided twice before turning into an odd number).</p>
<p>So the question is then, is there a number, if hit, which would lead to pattern where x is on a continuous rise and never enters a pattern where x approaches 0.</p></div>		</li>
