			<div class="markdown"><p>The way they are arranged and how they stay in place.</p>
<p>This is an example that is really far from the real world so don't read to much into it.</p>
<p>But some materials are made of magnetic particles that are like lego bricks and others are like marbles. When the Lego bricks are just jumbled about they cancel eachother out. But push them together in the right way and you are gonna put some together so they are aligned.</p>
<p>Do the same with marbles and they will just not care and orient themselves any which way anyway.</p>
<p>Now there are so many things wrong with this explanation but I just wanted to take some everyday objects as examples of how they behave differently.</p>
<p>It is really complicated how electrons move and are free to align themselves in different materials. How the molecules and the atomic structure works etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m having trouble finding a source so correct me if I’m wrong:</p>
<p>Electron spin (spin up and down) only contribute a minimal amount to magnetism. The action of the electron orbiting around the atom is what causes the magnetism we observe macroscopically. </p></div>		</li>
