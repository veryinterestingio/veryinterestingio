			<div class="markdown"><p>If you don’t already, try eating slower, having a big glass of water and then waiting five minutes before you go for seconds. Also think about whether you’re really truly hungry, or if its more of a mental thing. Some people find certain foods addictive and eating them can make you instantly crave more and more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I’ll be eating and then just BAM! No longer hungry. Meanwhile everyone else is sitting there eating still and saying “I’m so full” and I’m like “if I take one more bite i will actually throw up”</p></div>		</li>
