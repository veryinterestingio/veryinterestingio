			<div class="markdown"><p>Explain to me then why people say I dont sound anything out loud like I do on recording. Are other people perceiving my voice differently then the recording as well. I also feel this way when I hear my older brothers voice on a recording. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>Regarding to others hearing a record of your voice</strong>, I'd say that's because of the nuances that are picked up by the microphone, like breathing into it, little noises of your mouth and resonance of the room you're in, between many other factors, such as mic quality, audio compression, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Regarding when you hear a record of your voice</strong>, what you hear when you speak it's practically your voice with the resonance of your head added to the mix, but when you're listening to your recorded voice, you strip away the head resonance and that's like the &quot;pure&quot; version of your voice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Microphones, like speakers are transducers. This means they turn sound into electric currents, or they other way around. Since they have to be made out of materials that allow them to move based on what sounds they hear or need to replicate, a lot of models end up sounding different. The material, housing, stand, environment and even the way it's recorded can affect the sound. Not only that but, speakers can completely sound different because of these factors. I'm sure you've heard good vs. bad speakers. Imagine that but the other way around. This is called the response curve, how much of a certain frequency the microphone picks up. This can affect the tone of anyone's voice, especially when it's a microphone that can't record below 150-200 Hz. This is the fundamentals of the human voice, or where our voice starts in the frequency range. That means all of the bass would be missing and you would just sound all nasally and annoying. This also occurs because the vibrations your voice makes in your throat can be heard through your bones and your brain perceives it as sound, so this basically doubles that effect. Hope that explains it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a great explanation.  My voice over the phone recordings at work sound like a sterotypical gay guy...  My work buddies bursted out laughing when they heard it and said It sounded like the gay guy from family guy.</p>
<p>It was definately a shock to them when they heard it and to myself. I Had heard myself before so I knew what to expect. </p></div>		</li>
