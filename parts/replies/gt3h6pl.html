<p>If you are repeatedly exposed to viral loads of coronavirus that are too small to get you sick, is your body more likely to build an immunity to it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, development of antibodies requires antigens (small bits of virus presented to immune cells by infected cells or surveillance cells), as well as danger signals. When presented with antigens without the danger signals there is no antibody development.This is why vaccines are two parts: antigen and adjuvant. If you are exposed to a single viral particle that doesn’t manage to infect, replicate, and kill cells, thereby generating danger signals then no antibodies will be made.</p>
<p>This is to prevent your body from developing antibodies to any foreign antigen that is harmless. You can see in the case of plant pollen why developing antibody responses to harmless foreign antigens is not good. Allergies are a case of this failing and are highly detrimental.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I seem to recall that the terminology you're using here is a bit off. Viral load would denote, given a sample from a person, how many viral particles were present per volume.</p>
<p>However what we're talking about here, the amount of viral particles ingested to cause infection, instead would be called &quot;Inoculating Dose&quot;.</p>
<p>Here's a study that uses the terms and also hits on the OP's question. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7686757/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7686757/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7686757/</a></a></p>
<p>Quote from the article:</p>
<p><em>We postulate a dose-response relationship in COVID-19: the “dose of virus in initial inoculum” relates to the severity of disease and intensity of transmission. In our opinion, it is plausible that:</em> </p>
<ul>
<li><em>1. At an individual level: “viral dose in inoculum is related to severity of disease (dose-response relationship)”.</em></li>
<li><em>2. At a cluster level: “severity of disease is related to transmission potential”, leading to clusters of mild cases and clusters of severe cases.</em></li>
<li><em>3. At a community level: “in certain contexts, chains of severe cases can build up through intensive transmission with high inoculum to severe local outbreaks, which can result in large-scale intensive epidemics; while this is less likely in other contexts”.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>This theory plays out in practice on these three levels:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>a) Individual level: A person infected with a small dose viral inoculum will on average develop milder disease than a person infected with a high viral inoculum and vice versa. This is independent of other well-known risk factors for severity of disease, mainly old age, and co-morbidities, such as diabetes.</em></li>
<li><em>b) Cluster level: A person with asymptomatic infection or mild disease, will on average spread lower dose of the virus, and is less likely to transmit disease; and when the person transmits, the newly infected person is more likely to have mild disease compared to a person infected by a severely ill person, who spreads on average higher doses of the virus. This causes clusters and chains of milder cases or more severe cases.</em></li>
<li><em>c) Community level: In certain contexts, such as dense urban centres with a moderate climate, during the season that people live mostly indoors, the potential for intensive transmission and explosive outbreaks is higher than in rural areas, or in regions with a hot and humid climate where people live mostly outdoors. Hence, a cascade of intensive transmission is more likely in certain contexts than in others.</em></li>

<p>To be clear, this is hypothesis. They do cite some cluster data that supports their hypothesis but it is still hypothesis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>With respiratory viruses like COVID19 the infectious dose correlates with how sick you get.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is <em>theorized</em> that infectious dose correlates with severity of Covid. However, there are no peer reviewed papers on the topic. Instead, there are only old opinion and &quot;note&quot; style papers in journals <em>theorizing</em> a relationship.</p>
<p>The reason is that without an experiment it would be impossible to know the infectious dose an infected person recieved in the real world. Since Covid can kill you or cause long term disability, intentionally exposing people to different loads of the virus is unethical and the experiment can't be performed.</p></div>		</li>
