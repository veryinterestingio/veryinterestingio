			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, there are many particles in the beam that come in bunches. When collisions happen there is no way to control the collisions of the individual particles. It just happen however it happens. Then, after a concert of particle detectors pick up the aftermath, what happened in the collisions can be reconstructed. It's a very complex process, but we've gotten pretty good at it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just like a light beam, an electron or neutron beam helps study how large and what shape ‘shined upon’ objects are. A simple thing that can be done with beams is to study the structure of materials at multiple length scales ranging from nanometers to a few microns. The smaller the object, the greater the angle with respect to the horizontal at which the beam diffracts. And vice versa. This specific use case is named ultra small angle scattering for the limited range of angles at which the beam intensity bouncing off is detected. Knowing the angle and intensity, one can calculate the average size and shape across hundreds of millions of particles. One can also generate very accurate estimates of the texture of the surface of particles and their aggregates. Such measurements offer an excellent point of comparison with microscopy imaging techniques that tend to focus on much smaller cross sectional areas of a sample. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What kind of particle amount are we talking about with the focused beams? Still in billions? Isn't this also needed to make sure the particles actually hit each other? Or eg. something hits a nucleus?</p>
<p>How certain can you be that eg. beam of <insert particle here> is exactly that and that something else isn't being accelerated by chance or by accident?</p>
<p>I suppose that's the reason why the validation part and being able to reach certain Sigma significance is so important?</p>
<p>Repeat something enough; the outcome becomes clear?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anywhere from a few hundred particles per second to many billions per second. It all depends on the accelerator and how the beam is being produced.</p>
<p>You can be very sure that the beam is what you want because you can filter out particles that you don’t want by their charge and mass. With some beams, you still have some contaminants, but it’s very easy to get rid of those in software if you have detectors that can tell them apart from the particles you really want. Contaminant beams then give you extra data for different reactions that you can analyze in addition to whatever you really wanted to study.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure the numbers of particles in the beam, but millions or billions seems reasonable. There are a TON of collisions that happen in these runs. In fact, so many that much of the data is thrown out (because there physically just isn't enough storage) and there is still so much data that it takes years to get through it all (this is what grad students do). </p>
<p>As far as contamination, sure it happens because no system is perfect. But there is so much actual collision data that anything accidental is not statistically significant and would be subtracted out as background, if it even makes it to the data that is actually analyzed.</p>
<p>But yes, the statistical significance is important and even though data is thrown out there is still enough to prove that a rare process has been observed, such as the Higgs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends a lot on the detectors and what they’re being used for. Some can last decades until an upgraded version is purchased (and then the older ones can still be repurposed and used). Or if the detector is not very radiation-hard and it accumulates a large dose, it can die pretty quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome great answer thank you! I think most people like me have a complete misunderstanding of what particle accelerators can do.</p>
<p>It's difficult for me to properly get a full understanding on one thing regarding particle accelerators, because to truly understand one part, you have to have a pretty good or at least basic understanding of many other parts. You did a great job answering my question and explaining part of the process to someone who isn't currently capable of understanding exactly how it works given my lack of research and understanding.</p>
<p>When I try to learn about something regarding particles and particle accelerators, I end up running into an endless rabbit hole of &quot;Needing to learn what this one thing so I cant understand the next thing, then the previous thing.&quot; but then I need to learn about another thing and another thing until I eventually forget what I'm even trying to understand in the first place lmao. For example, now im looking into plasma, and exactly what plasma is. I didn't even realize it was actually one of the fundamental states of matter until recently.</p>
<p>Do you have any good resources you can recommend for learning about these types of things? I found its easier to understand things by going to the very beginning. (Like most I imagine) And do you follow any &quot;physicist news&quot; type thing? How do you stay on the up and up with new discoveries and research?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know of some good books on accelerator physics, but they require some knowledge of electromagnetism and relativistic kinematics. The types of literature available are unfortunately just textbooks/publications and popular science. There isn't really much out there for the casual reader who wants to go deeper than pop-science. There's also Wikipedia rabbit holes, but like you said, the number of things you want to learn just grows exponentially.</p>
<p>Accelerators are very complicated machines, and they're used for many different things. No single person is an expert in every aspect of the machine. At accelerator facilities, you usually have entire groups of Ph.D. scientists and engineers who are in charge of the source, in charge of the magnets, the cavities, the cryogenics, etc., and finally the end users who are the people setting up their detectors to measure things. It takes subject matter experts in each individual part of the machine, totaling to tens or hundreds of people, in order to make everything work.</p>
<p>As for &quot;physicist news&quot;, I just follow the peer reviewed literature, but I'm a physicist, so I speak that language. It can be hard for a casual observer to follow what's going on in papers. For example, you can browse pre-prints in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/list/physics.acc-ph/recent" target="_blank">accelerator physics section</a> of arXiv.org. This is what people are working on on the cutting edge of accelerator physics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm getting my PhD in particle physics. A great resource is the website of the various particle accelerators. They're funded by the government, so they have an interest in educating the public in order to maintain or expand their funding support.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s hard to define a temperature for a system so far out of equilibrium as a particle beam. There is a related concept that we call the “emittance”, which is like the phase space volume of the beam. Smaller emittance is generally better, so sometimes accelerators have beam “cooling” implemented in order to reduce the emittance of the beam.</p></div>		</li>
