			<div class="markdown"><p>Offices in Japan are still run very much on pen and paper compared to the West. For a country that embraces technology as much as Japan a lot of what they do in business and government is decades behind much of Europe and US in terms of computerization.</p>
<p>The vertical nature of the bureaucracy means that the various systems of the different parts of government are rarely compatible.</p>
<p>Japan is also plagued by Conservative attitudes stemming from the old boys club that runs the companies and government. They don't like change and still run things like 'in the old days' and these kinds of attitudes hold up real change.</p>
<p>But the biggest hold out is the use of seals. You don't sign documents in Japan like in North America, you use a wooden stamp called a Hanko.</p>
<p>The insistence on using this archaic former of signature on documents results in bureaucracy that's mostly based on paper trails with no sign of it ending, despite a major push from the government to computerize in the past decade.</p>
<p>They also have very serious problems with work culture but that's a different topic</p></div>		</li>

<p>this was more apparent with those that were of 35 or older.  The younger generation, naturally, seemed to be okay with tech for the most part.</p>

<p>That's true here in the US as well though. I've seen very few people older than me (late-40s) that have much in the way of computer skills at all. Double-clicking the icon to open Edge (or, if someone else set up their computer, Chrome/Firefox) and hitting links is about the extent of their ability; even saving/downloading stuff is beyond a lot of them. And a fair number of folks around my age and slightly younger grew up with computers around, but never bothered to learn because computers were only for geeks, dweebs, and nerds. </p>
<p>It wasn't until relatively recently that things like cellphones and the internet became mainstream instead of something only executives and professors used that the skills to operate them became something kids learned at an early age. </p>
<p>Look at the demographics of Japan; nearly 30% of their population is over 65 while less than 17% of the US is that old. Conversely, roughly 30% of the US is under 25 while only about 21% of Japan is that young. Put those together, and the net result is that you have a higher percentage of people in Japan that do not have the sort of tech skills that Americans born after 1980 do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have found the contrary to be true in my (Asian) country. I am a teacher and mostly work with teenagers,  ages 16-19, and what I notice is that they really struggle with computers and the more advanced features on their phones. I'm in my early thirties and I always have to help them when we are using computers in my class. They feel much more comfortable on their phones than on computers. Using Chrome, email, Google Docs and Slides is about as far as their competencies go. If something like the wifi or printer is not working they almost instantly give up and don't have any idea what they can do.
Older folk that I work with, mostly people in their 40s, seem to be much better at using computers from my experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is a consequence of how technology has progressed. If you were using computers in the 90's you needed a decent degree of technical know how to run programs and connect to various platforms. In the 2000's this simplified a bit but there were so many platforms and programs and games that needed a fee tricks to work properly you could still figure out a lot of basic tricks and tactics.</p>
<p>In the last decade theres been a push for fewer more streamlined platforms with a lot of U.I. crossover and for companies to make everything more convenient. But that means kids who've never had to manually run a program or mount a file or navigate a more complex online environment never had to learn a lot of specific skills and expect a more real time version of tech support to come in with answers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Me and my friend talk about this all the time. The younger generation took a step back as far as being computer savvy.  Back in the late 90's/early 2000's it was the wild west days of the internet. There were super intrusive ads, pop ups, bloatware/adware being installed with every program, ransomware was super common, antivirus software was worse than some of the things it was protecting against. Don't even get me started on things like limewire and Kazzaa.  It was trial by fire for a lot of us where you either learned to fix your computer yourself and navigate the minefield or risked having to spend days reinstalling your software from discs and downloading massive amounts of patches on shoddy internet. </p>
<p>Nowadays everything is digital and streamlined. All your settings are saved for you, bookmarks, saved games are all cloud based. Ublock and adblock make ads irrelevant. Everything is significantly safer, and there's a multitude of pre-built manufacturers now that are relatively competitive price wise with building your own PC. A lot of the problem solving/troubleshooting tech skills aren't organically gained anymore like they used to be.</p></div>		</li>
