			<div class="markdown"><p>Space in a black hole forms a kind of duality. There is space in the black hole and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_space" target="_blank">dual space</a> on the surface of the black hole. Everything inside of the black hole is encoded on the surface of the black hole. This is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle" target="_blank">holographic principle</a> and PBS Spacetime just made a video on that. </p>
<p>In any case talking about the singularity inside the black hole is difficult. Essentially the singularity is a point where our math stops making sense. Think about dividing by 0, thats a singularity mathematically. Our current models of gravity and quantum theory simply cannot explain what this is exactly. Many physicists believe that a singularity itself cannot exist in reality and that it is simply an artifact of our models and that better models will resolve the problem with the singularity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I've never been able to grasp about the holographic principle is: If everything falling into a black hole is imprinted onto the event horizon, shouldn't all of the light from all of the (in the case of M87* billions) of years be imprinted there too? If so, shouldn't that edge then be visible to an outside observer?</p>
<p>Edit: Nope, I forgot about red shift. It would all just red shift away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was struggling with the same or similar paradox and asked in the r/space question thread. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/baifa6/week_of_april_07_2019_all_space_questions_thread/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x" target="_blank">My Question</a>.</p>
<p>u/thereisnocentre pointed me to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNaEBbFbvcY&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">video</a> (which I need to watch a few more times) and while I can't say I fully understand yet, I can at least see how my view of a black hole was too simplistic.</p></div>		</li>
