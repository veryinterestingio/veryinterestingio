			<div class="markdown"><p>In order for resolve, or tell the difference between, two things, the lens through which the light travels had to be sufficiently big. The equation is θ=1.22λ/D where θ is the angle formed at your lens (eye) between the two things you're trying to see (the edges of the microbe), λ is the wavelength of the light, and D is the diameter of the lens. Using the small angle approximation (sin(θ) = tan(θ) = y/L), we can rewrite this equation as y/L=1.22λ/D.</p>
<p>We want to know how big the ant's eye has to be to see it (since that's really the only thing we can't Google easily) so we solve for D. D=1.22λL/y. Assuming an ant's eye is at the top of it, there is 0.64 cm to the microbe. Rickettsia Rickettsii is 2 micrometers wide. The smallest visible light is 400 nm. Put it all together and your ant's eye diameter must be at least 1.5616 mm in order to see them. </p>
<p>Keep in mind that this is just the very smallest wavelength of light. To cover all of the wavelengths, the eye diameter must be 7/4 as big, or 2.7mm. That's about a third of the height of the ant required to be just the eye in order to see the microbe.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that this is just to be able to BARELY resolve the microbes like you would between two individual pixels on the newest iPhone. Possible but not practical given the size</p>
<p>Edit: Here's Katie Bouman talking about taking a picture of the black hole which would require a single lens the size of the Earth: <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BIvezCVcsYs" target="_blank">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BIvezCVcsYs</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whoah, thanks, my actual three-year-old easily grasps the terms equation, theta, lambda, wavelength, microbe, sine, tangent, nanometers, and the concept of rational or real numbers. /s</p>
<p>Seriously, though, he does sometimes ask &quot;AM I TWO AND HAF OR AM I FREE?&quot; and he also knows that things can be &quot;germy.&quot; The other day I tried to teach him diameter and circumference because he likes tape measures. Good job backing up WRSaunders answer with the legit Rayleigh criterion equation, so you get an upvote. I just think the &quot;explain this like I’m three&quot; person was maybe not the optimal comment to reply to.</p></div>		</li>
