			<div class="markdown"><p>Granted all that you've said, the real problem is the ever shrinking net energy we're getting from the oil we extract. When it takes a barrel of oil's worth of energy to extract a barrel of oil, we're done. Actually, we're done a long time before that.</p>
<p>Measuring this, however, is difficult. I expect we'll try and get oil out of the ground for a long time after it's worth the trouble.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is largely where the economics comes in. The simplest way to consider it is as long as (1) there is oil and (2) it is profitable to extract (i.e. integrated cost of extracting is less than the price the market is willing to pay), we will likely continue to extract it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just about sheer energy. Oil is extremely energy dense and easily transportable in a stable form, which will justify spending quite a lot of energy to produce if batteries don't progress significantly. Especially when you consider that legacy technologies will still need it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly why it's key in military operations.</p>
<p>Strategic reserves and the ability to secure oil/gas reserves will be vital to to militaries for the foreseeable future. WWI and WWII were both wars largely determined by who could secure which resources and how they could extract, transport, and utilize them outside of their own territory.</p>
<p>WWII would've been completely different if not governed by the need for energy resources. Japan couldn't wage war on the mainland United States because they couldn't had trouble refueling across the Pacific. Much of Hitler's success in his power grabs was because Germany is rich in natural resources and he could quickly lay railroads anywhere and get any resource (fuel, building materials, vehicles, metals) to the front lines. Any hiccup in his ability to secure fuel for these operations would've completely disrupted his war campaign dead in its tracks.</p>
<p>Renewables are great for energy independence, and energy independence is vital if another world war breaks out and international trade falls apart, especially for those countries who do not have many options within their own borders for extracting oil/gas in their own territory. Renewables are not (yet) worth much though if you are trying to move your military around within someone else's borders in an environment where front lines are shifting every day and mobility is key.</p>
<p>This aspect is all completely tangential to the OP's question, but is very interesting nonetheless. I don't know when we'll see another WWII scale conflict or if it will look more like cyber warfare instead of a ground war, but the winners and loser of any sizable ground or naval war will largely be decided based on availability and access to energy resources and the ability to get it where you need it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect we may need it for certain applications for a long time. Will cranes and excavators ever be converted to run on pure electric? Seems doubtful. They’re too often needed in settings far from the grid. And on their own they won’t destroy the environment. If we’re smart we will move off of oil as much as possible so we can conserve it for the few applications where it continues to make more sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can use more energy to produce oil than you derive from it as long as oil is not the energy input to production (e.g. natural gas is commonly used to refine Alberta oilsands oil, at a net energetic loss but a net monetary gain.
There was talk of putting a nuclear plant in Alberta for that purpose around 2006, but it never came to be.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another interesting aspect is that if oil gets rarer it will get more expensive, which suddenly makes deposits, that were already found but too expensive to utilize, worthwhile. And much more importantly suddenly fracking will become economically viable which basically introduces a new endless supply of natural gas as a fossil fuel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oil extradition decreases and products that don't have a non-fossil alternative become more expensive. I can imagine that a limited extraction of oil will continue for a long time for very specific uses that have no alternative to oil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oil can only continue to get expensive as far as the market (the consumers) can support the increase in price. At a certain point, it'll price most people out and demand will drop - which will cause a drop in price and therefore many wells will need to be abandoned.</p></div>		</li>
