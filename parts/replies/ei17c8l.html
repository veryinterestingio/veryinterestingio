			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. If you're in a survival situation, there are plenty of potential scenarios in which you may have non-diseased dead people. Hypothermia, fatal (but not infected) injury, or maybe you're just fatter and they starved first. Your point is valid, but there are enough options that I'd categorize it as not much more unlikely than the original scenario of needing to eat a buddy to keep from starving.</p></div>		</li>
