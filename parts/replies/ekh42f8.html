			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah as much as people want this to work or feel like it does when they do it in there kitchen, there’s no explanation or special mechanism at work here, at best it’s a combination of some sort of placebo effect and the friction and water from rubbing your hands on wet metal. The smell on your hands is garlic oil which a lot of regular bathroom hand soaps don’t remove well, it’s not surprising that physically rubbing some of it off reduces some of the smell. </p>
<p>I’ve always seen dish soap recommended, since it’s made to cut through grease and oil. You have to specifically get under and around your nails too or it’s gonna linger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>listen buddy, I've seen it with my own two eyes.  I had stinky garlic hands and this person rubbed the metal thing on them and they were good as new.  It really blew my shit.  It's real man.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All it takes is to get garlic on both hands, then rub one of them on any stainless steel surface.</p>
<p>My own experience shows the stainless steel works very well, if not perfectly due to all the crevices around one's nails.  Soap and water alone is far less effective.</p></div>		</li>
