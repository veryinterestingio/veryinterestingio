			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like I might have an understanding of what this person is saying, so here's my take if it helps.</p>
<p>There was a group of researchers that worked with native people who had never seen an urban environment before. They were used to the dwellings they created which were made of natural materials in their environment and were largely devoid of sharp angles. The researcher's showed them a series of 'abstract' images consisting mostly of lines of various kinds. One was two angled lines connected to a verticle line. </p>
<p>Urban dwellers might identify this shape as a corner, perhaps the point of a cube or the corner of a room. The native peoples by and large saw something completely different--I don't remember what. They had no lived experience with sharp right angled objects that looked like that.</p>
<p>Similarly, I imagine, if you had never before seen a photograph--which is literally a 2D exact replication of the light from in front of the camera (barring lens aberrations and such)--you wouldn't have the same frame of reference. You would have no lived experience of photo-realistic 2D replication. This would mean that functionally, any attempt at recreation of 3D life on a 2D plane would inherently be different as all the necessary art 'tricks' to create the '3D' effect would be done based on trial and error, experience, judgement, and so forth without any ability to compare it to an exact 2D replica.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think he meant that people didn't see the plane of the canvas as a window into art, they saw it as the art themselves.  The thought that it could be like a window was the conceptual leap that didn't happen for a long long time--before then, it seems artists just weren't interested in realism for its own sake, they had different priorities.</p>
<p>And to be clear: techniques like &quot;vanishing point&quot; and &quot;foreshortening&quot; happened hundreds of years before the moving image or even photography.  (I'm certain the PhD guy knows this, but I think his explanation left this point a little confusing.)  In &quot;The Day The Universe Changed&quot;, James Burke says the first use of vanishing point perspective was by Filippo Brunelleschi in 1424.  He painted the Florence Baptistery from a specific spot using a mirror and geometry, and then by using a mirror and a hole he could have onlookers stand in a specific spot and he could switch them between looking at the real building and looking at the painting.  They were the same!  It was amazing!</p>

At the end, the presenter said something like &quot;By measuring things we can control them&quot; and it's kinda put me into an existential crisis!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I try to take a picture of a gorgeous landscape, I can get a good looking picture, but it’s never a substitute for “being there”.  This is because there’s context missing: everything around the captured image. </p>
<p>Prior to photography, that’s all artists had to work with. What results is a painting of the context, not a 1:1 rendition of the light that hits a sensor.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Could it then be argued that El Greco did not Have an issue with his vision, but merely made a stylistic choice based on the lack of one to one renditioning, It being a stylistic choice?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my opinion, it's easiest to see in comparing sculptures and paintings of the crucifixion. The caveat is you have to look at them in person because the computer screen is just adding another plane.</p>
<p>For example, when you are in Stiftskirche and look up, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kreuzigungsgruppe_13._Jh._Stiftskirche_Innichen-1.jpg" target="_blank">this sculpture</a> exists in the same space as you. There is no plane. </p>
<p>If you compare it with <a href="https://www.lindenau-museum.de/tl_files/italienische%20tafelbilder/014.jpg" target="_blank">this painting</a> by Bernardo Daddi, maybe you can see how the scene looks more like it is existing in our realm rather than being a world of its own on the other side of a window (i.e. pane).</p>
<p>There was absolutely no need for linear perspective in Daddi's painting because if the scene were to look like it were happening in the space right front of us, it wouldn't need orthogonal lines or a vanishing point. </p>
<p>I hope that is helpful!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if this is relevant to your point, but I'll never forget coming around a corner in the Kelvingrove in Glasgow and coming face to face with Dali's painting called I think 'Christ of St John on the cross'. It felt like I was going to fall right into it, I actually reached out and out my hand on the wall to 'steady,' myself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really interesting topic you're discussing, the comparison you made helps explain it. But one question,</p>
<p>Are you saying that the ability to start directly translating 3D into 2D (photography) changed how people see the aforementioned optical illusions, or that it's how the nuances of the translation itself became more noticed and studied?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference isn't in the canvas or the movie screen or the frame. The difference is in <strong><em>you.</em></strong> </p>
<p>You have seen so many 3D representations projected onto a 2D surface that you don't know what it would be like to see something hand-drawn on a 2D surface without all of those images in your memory to compare them to.</p>
<p>Do you remember 3D games from 20 years ago? People would ooo and ahhh over Gran Tursismo on Playstation 1. Now we just shrug and think that those graphics are kind of meh.  </p>
<p>Basically this is the same with art history. Once the graphics got better, you suddenly realized that the previous graphics were kind of shitty. But at the time, you were blown away! lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to recommend people go back and watch the original Toy Story. Especially since we've seen the same world depicted much better since then, seeing how bad the first one looks nowadays really puts things into perspective.
