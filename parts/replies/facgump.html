			<div class="markdown"><p>A professor mentioned that supercritical water is non polar and as such is used to dissolve organic compounds and matter. And it says pretty much everywhere online that it behaves as if it is non polar. I'm simply curious as to why. Thank you though!</p>
<p>Edit: Poor phrasing on my part. The individual molecules of water still are polar. But why, as a bulk fluid, does it behave as if it were non-polar?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry but you have been misinformed. Just because it acts as a non-polar solvent does not make the molecule itself non-polar. Nothing about the bonding of the molecule changes just because of a change in temperature or pressure. As other have stated, it is only because the polarity of the molecule becomes insignificant enough under high temperatures and pressures that it can interact with non-polar molecules as if it were non-polar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not how water molecules are interacting with the non-polar substance to dissolve it in the supercritical phase, it is how they are not interacting with each other. Since they cannot interact with the nonpolar substance, they interact more efficiently with each other becoming more orderly ( -ds ) which nature doesn't like. The number of molecules made more orderly is reduced by forming micelles, or a new surface dictated by density.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe I should clarify. You're likely right that the individual molecules of water are still polar. However, in bulk, (which is what really matters for practical applications - no one uses just one molecule) supercritical water behaves as if it is non polar. That's my question; not about the singular molecule itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure what you’re background is but is there any chance you could direct me towards a stat-mech description of this? I’m a physics student so don’t know much about polar molecules but could probably get a vague understanding if I could see a partition function based explanation, understandable if not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The molecules the water is made up of are definitely still polar. Technically things that are often called non-polar such as hydrocarbons are slightly polar. The reason they are called non-polar is because they are only very slightly polar. Water doesn't normally dissolve non-polar things well because the water molecules are attracted less to the non-polar molecules than the other water molecules. In the case of supercritical water there is no longer as strong of a bond between water molecules. This allows for non-polar molecules to dissolve in much more easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there's a missing distinction between macro and microstates here though.  My guess is individual water molecules in supercritical water don't have significantly changed dipole moments vs those of water at STP; molecules of the supercritical water just have so much energy that they overcome intermolecular interactions that they can dissolve low surface tension liquids.</p></div>		</li>
