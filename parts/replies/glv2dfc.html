<p>Terminology issue, but the &quot;pandemic&quot; will go away... just not the virus. It will likely become &quot;endemic&quot; instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this answer is missing an important difference between Covid-19 and influenza, which is that the influenza virus is specifically adapted to mutate quickly. This is why we get new variants every year, and are unable to comprehensively vaccinate our population against it. We've seen a few notable mutation in SAR-CoV-2 so far, but those should be significantly less common once the infected population is smaller. We don't know how long immunity lasts after vaccination, but we should have a much easier staying on top of Covid-19 immunity than immunity to the flu.</p>
<p>The most compelling theory I've seen about the future of Covid-19 is that it will turn into a disease that children pick up at school, when the effects are relatively mild, like a less aggressive version of what chicken pox used to be.</p></div>		</li>
