			<div class="markdown"><p>Long ago on a chat forum (remember those? lol) there was a user who i conversed with semi-frequently. In their signature line was a quote &quot;Entropy isn't what it used to be.&quot; I have struggled to understand what it means or from where it originated. Does this phrase mean anything to someone who knows what Entropy is? Is it an understandable joke to anyone who is not the writer? I thought this particular thread may have sometime who could possible shed some light for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a play on words based on the 2nd law. Entropy is always increasing, therefore current entropy is never equal to entropy from a prior time; therefore it &quot;isn't what it used to be&quot;. </p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like I said, entropy measures how unavailable a system’s energy is. As time goes on, more and more of a system’s energy becomes unavailable for use. To picture this, think of a difference in temperature causing the flow of energy from hot to cold. Once both items are the same temperature, there is no longer a difference that causes energy flow. </p>
<p>So back to your buddy’s signature line. The entropy of a system (and the entropy of the universe, if we consider the universe to be a system) is always increasing. So it’s just a tongue-in-cheek joke about that :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Entropy is generated whenever any real process occurs, anywhere. In this way, the entropy of the universe is continually increasing. The line may refer to that. To my knowledge, it isn't a widespread joke or saying, and I've been reading about and discussing thermodynamics to a greater or lesser degree for 30 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the notion of unavailability of energy. My favorite way to explain entropy has always been burning wood to keep warm on a cold night. That burning log will warm your house up for a little while, but in a couple hours you'll be left with a small pile of ash, and over time the temperature inside the house will match that outside the house. The end result is that the world around you will be an immeasurably small amount warmer. Energy that was once contained in a neat, organized package (the log) will be thinly spread throughout the environment, and there's not a whole lot you can do with it anymore. That's entropy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It costs more energy to put the fire back into the log than it did to burn the log in the first place. The reason for that is entropy</p></div>		</li>
