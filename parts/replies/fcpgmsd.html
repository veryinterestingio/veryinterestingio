			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, most platforms have OS features, like achievements, friend invites, and online save storage which must be accounted for.</p>
<p>Much of the game content can remain unchanged, but there are specific &quot;hooks&quot; each OS uses which can require different implementation across platforms for the same title.</p>
<p>For example, PSN requires a premium account for online save storage, Xbox does not.  A multi-platform title will respond differently to the users' profile when save data is written because of this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Seriously, I've had to reinitialize our PS4 a half-dozen times in the past 18 months. Granted one of those was a dead hard drive.</p>
<p>3 days ago my wife and son are playing Borderlands 3 when the power goes out. Reinitialize... (right after finishing Pain &amp; Terror boss fight)</p>
<p>2 months ago son unplugged PS4 while in sleep mode. Reinitialize...</p>
<p>There's no reason for a Unix-based filesystem to be that fragile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A very popular engine is the Unreal engine, the backbone of EPIC. Unreal is free to use and in the end only cost 5% of the games revenue, which is usually a lot less than the cost of developing your own engine from scratch. And if you put your game on EPIC online store then they will refund you that 5%, meaning you only pay EPIC like 7% for the engine and the store. Meanwhile Steam wants 30% just for the store.</p>
<p>Even Kojima doesn't make his own engines anymore, he uses the same third party engine that Horizon Zero Dawn used, just heavily customised, and that customised engine will probably be the backbone of his next game. Reusing and licensing multiplatform engines is why it feels like a game can be on any platform with ease these days. Back in the old days Sony and Nintendo would keep a lot of the engine built into their consoles secret, supposed microcode which takes better advantage of the hardware. Wasn't enough processing power for a big multi use engine back then. Porting a game between consoles back then took some skill, ports were sometimes given to entirely different companies to handle because it involved much retooling of the game just to get it to look the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Free to use means no up-front cost. You can develop your entire game without paying licensing fees. The 5% kicks in after your UE-built game makes actual revenue past a certain dollar amount.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're being incredibly dishonest by saying &quot;just for the store&quot;,</p>
<p>Steam has far more to it than just being a storefront. Groups, Workshop, all sorts of community features that any game on steam gets access to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It turns out that just the store is enough. Maybe social features would be a deal maker, but Steam couldnt' do that either, which is why Discord is the number one social place for gamers, displacing even Teamspeak. For most gamers they just want the games and social, and if they are communicating over Discord anyway then it doesn't really matter what they play their games on, they will still be in constant communication with their buddies anyway. Groups, workshops, etc. didn't mean shit when in less than 24 hours Borderlands 3 sold more on EPIC than Steam staple Borderlands 2 ever did on Steam to date.</p></div>		</li>
