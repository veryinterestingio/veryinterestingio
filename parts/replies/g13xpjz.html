			<div class="markdown"><p>What makes music interesting is the expressional and creative aspects that speak to the specific time they where relevant to. There isn't a single composer ever who didn't do something inovative and the same can be said of pop musicians. Comparing Bach Beethoven or Debussy is a lot more logical to the likes of the most relevant and interesting musicians of our time than to anybody doing classical. In fact, you can trace the ideas right through those names to jazz, rock, electronic, pop, etc. Current classical is not in that line of relevant music. It's niche music, while the old greats are famous because they are relevant to everyone. And I agree, you can probably point to immense gaps in certain types of complexity but that argument doesn't matter her, what makes someone famous is relevancy, not complexity.</p></div>		</li>
