			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially yes. There are several phases that go into that transition and we don’t understand exactly how all of them work, but basically the low dose exposure triggers immune reactions that stabilize your allergy responders, turn down the volume on the allergic response, and hopefully eventually train the immune system to tolerate exposure to the allergen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hol'up, so what you're saying is: there is a treatment for dust mite allergy? If so, I need to get on this right away. My antihistamines (Aerius) work with varying effectiveness, and sometimes I need to take a quad dose to keep things in check.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just describing the building phase though, which for me took less than a year. I'm now on year 3 or 4 of 5, which means I do 1 year of building, and 4 years of maintenance shots.</p>
<p>So I guess the op question still stands doesn't it? My dose hasn't increased in years, but I'm still taking it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One way to think about it is that unlearning is harder than learning.</p>
<p>If you learn how to play the trombone wrong, it's going to be harder to teach you the right way than for someone who didn't learn the wrong way first. </p>
<p>So when you get a vaccine, you're teaching your immune system for the first time. Whereas with allergies, your immune system already learned the wrong way.</p>
<p>Another way would be prevention (vaccination) vs treatment (allergy shots). It's almost always easier to stop something from happening at all than to stop it when it's already started.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The immune system is one of the most complicated systems in the body, and there's a lot we still don't know. So we take into account what's been shown to work, as well as what we understand about the systems at play. It's established that after successful desensitisation therapy, there's always a gradual rebound towards baseline. The longer you take a maintenance dose, the slower the rebound is. It's not entirely understood why this is.</p>
<p>Part of this is that most antigen exposure we experience in our daily lives will cause an increase in allergic reaction - ie. sensitisation, instead of de-sensitisation. An allergen therapy protocol has to be very specifically controlled in order to de-sensitise the immune system - regular doses, specific amounts etc etc. This means that once you're no longer taking the maintenance dose, most exposure to whatever you're allergic to is gradually contributing to the rebound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have seen some observstional data and it seems others get worse and majority feel no change. Perhaps de mrna amount in the vaccije is too high and might be a good strategy to do what they do with alleegies. Add little doses in several times apart. Does it has a name btw??</p></div>		</li>
