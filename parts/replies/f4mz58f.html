			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the absolute pitch of notes that makes things sound good, it's the relative distances in  between notes. If you mess with those things will start sounding out of tune. </p>
<p>Only a very small percentage of the population has absolute pitch anyway so they can't even tell the difference between music with A4 at 440 hz or music with A4 at 420 hz unless you give them a reference point first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, I also do not believe in the frequency of the universe; plus microtonal differences can only be heard as low as to 16 cents of a semitone. However if one instrument is tuned to 432 and another at 440 and they play together, some people could actually hear the dissonance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have pretty good pitch (I can hear any note and tell you what the note is) but I couldnâ€™t tell you if something is tuned to 440 or 420 etc.  only if I heard both tunings side by side could I try to tell you the difference</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds better is pretty subjective. You could test it out yourself but Adam Neely did this great <a href="https://youtu.be/ghUs-84NAAU" target="_blank">video</a> on this very subject. Much easier and I think it illustrates pretty clearly exactly how music like this would sound</p></div>		</li>
