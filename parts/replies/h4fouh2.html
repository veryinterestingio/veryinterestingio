			<div class="markdown"><p>What’s really interesting is just why peak phosphorous mining has occurred. It’s because we used to get virtually all of it from fossilised guano deposits which are now virtually non-existent. We used them up as soon as we could. </p>
<p>The remote Pacific island of Nauru once had the highest per capita income in the world due to it having thousands of years worth of bird poop on it. Now it's a deeply scarred environment with diminished potential for future economic growth through eco-tourism; it’s very poor because the guano industry is no more, and a lot of the investments were from outside companies which externalised most of the profits anyway. In order to deal with having nothing left, Nauru accepts aid from Australia in exchange for hosting an Australian immigration detention centre, so the island has also become known as “the place that hope goes to die” in Australian refugee camps. </p>
<p>It’s useful to look at those sorts of scenarios when considering how much we should plan to escape our dependency on oil. If something is non-renewable and we don’t properly plan how to move away from it, total collapse with long lasting effects is inevitable.</p></div>		</li>
