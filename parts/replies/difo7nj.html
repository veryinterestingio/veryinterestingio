			<div class="markdown"><p>For me and my girlfriend it's this goddamn fucking bird who insists on chirping his little jerk ass beak off every fucking morning for like a billion hours straight and I can't close the fucking window because otherwise the room becomes eighteen thousand degrees in the morning because I live in a town that might as well be called Devil's Asshole during the summer, so I get to choose between fucking burning alive like a piece of bacon on the surface of the sun, or listening to that little fucker go &quot;cheep cheep bloody fucking cheep&quot; every goddam morning with this terrible fucking stop and go pace that makes it damn near impossible to sleep and makes me genuinely wish the thing would just jump up its own ass and die already, as cute as I'm sure he is if I actually went out to see him</p>
<p>A white noise machine really helps drown that out, is what I'm saying</p></div>		</li>

<p>I feel you. I feel you on a level you can't even imagine. Get this shit:</p>
<p>Lived in a city. Beautiful city. The best city. Except we had a mimic. Some kinda little bird that loves to mimic shit. You know what the little shit liked to mimic most? Fucking car alarms. </p>
<p>So, 5am rolls around. 5am every morning from April to September, this little fucking car alarm goes off right outside our window. For hours. No rhyme or reason to his blurts and warbles or squeaks and squaks. That little fuck drove me crazy. We moved. Not because of the bird, but it was some icing on the cake. </p>
<p>We get to our new apartment. New city. Better city. Actually the best city. But, the Curse of the Bird followed us. We have a new bird. A louder bird. He's not my friend. I hate him. The only saving grace is we have a longer period of cold or shitty weather here, so the bird is just as depressed as the rest of the city and doesn't sing for like 9 months out of the year. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel sorry for laughing but this was absolutely hilarious to read! 😂</p>
<p>Seriously though, rather than white noise, if it's bothering you that much you should consider getting either A/C so you can keep your window closed, or an Ultrasonic bird repeller to keep all birds away.</p>
<p>Something like these for instance: <a href="http://www.bird-x.com/ultrasonic-bird-control-pages-103.php" target="_blank">Bird X</a> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Air conditioning costs about thirty dollars a second here so that's out. </p>
<p>But I'm actually gonna look into the latter. I had no idea they made devices which simply scream at birds all day. I need twelve of them so this one straight up leaves the country. Thanks for the advice</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add something. For my boyfriend, he NEEDS the tv on to fall asleep and it needs to be something innocuous like an old sitcom.
For him, it's a distraction. If he tries to fall asleep in a quiet room he says he can't shut off the thoughts in his head (his stress and anxiety are a problem, yes I know). The tv gives him something else that's benign enough to occupy his thoughts as he falls asleep.
It's sucks for me because I have to lay there wide awake until he falls asleep so I can then shut the tv off and finally get some peace and quiet and darkness in order to fall asleep. 🙄</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about those who don't wake from noise when they sleep?</p>
<p>When I sleep I don't wake for anything. Fire alarms go off outside my room and I don't wake, I had a prank played on me which my rather large stereo would turn on full blast at 5am. Woke my housemates up and the neighbors but I didn't stir. I only woke when my housemate opened my door then I was on my feet trying to fight him half asleep and naked.</p>
<p>I am not sure who was more freaked out by the end of the night.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know a guy (friend of a friend, we wound up at the same July 4th party a few years back) that his ears literally turn off when he sleeps. It's the strangest thing. He fell asleep while we watched a movie as the night wound down and someone out there has a video of us banging kitchen utensils on pans and screaming in his ear and he doesn't so much as twitch. </p>
<p>The lightest touch on his foot wakes him up like a gunshot going off though. So strange. He uses one of those alarm clocks for deaf people that shakes his bed because otherwise he can't be woken by an alarm clock</p></div>		</li>
