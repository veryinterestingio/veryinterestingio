			<div class="markdown"><p>Close. SOLID breakdown/example with the Bee Gees tune and caps for emphasis; just replace &quot;downbeat&quot; here with &quot;backbeat&quot; and you're on the money. </p>
<p>Re: stomps &amp; claps: Backbeats would be the claps. Stomps, however, are usually felt as the downbeats. Think of We Will Rock You. Stomp stomp clap ~ stomp stomp clap.</p>
<p>I'm oversimplifying, but even the use of the word oversimplifying might make this fit for a six year old, and the target audience is five ðŸ˜‹</p></div>		</li>

<p>I tend not to clap or stomp to music, so I'll try to incorporate that into my music-listening experience. </p>
<p>I must say, you all are far more helpful and encouraging than the people on Reddit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That said, the posters above have given you really good background info. The drums are usually key when it comes to understanding the time of a song. Part of it is the meter - 4/4 time is most common in popular music, but 6/8 is pretty common too. 3/4 time is like a waltz - 1 2 3, 1 2 3. Part of it is also how fast or slow the song is...beats per minute. Trance music has a lot of beats per minute, while a slow blues song has low bpm.</p>
<p>It's easy to hear in older songs...listen to the drums on a Beatles song, for instance.</p></div>		</li>
