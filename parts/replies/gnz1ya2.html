			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but our outages are less to do with the grid collapsing and more to do with lines being taken out. Texas lost the ability to generate power, and because of reasons related to saving money they were cut off from the National grid, unable to purchase power from out of state. They definitely lost transmission and distribution lines as well, otherwise they'd be running rolling blackouts. But they have far more system failure than what Manitoba went through fall 2019.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>unless you live in Montreal  where the waterlines were built before there was piping regulations. Causing water-pipe to burst which leads to a road cave-in which leads to having to rebuilt 1 road part &amp; a section of the piping &amp; Traffic jam because Montreal traffic is too finely tuned. All of this in the winter so the repair cost is 2x more expensive because digging in frozen ground is terrible and the construction compagnies have nowhere to set-up since everything is cramped on the island.</p></div>		</li>
