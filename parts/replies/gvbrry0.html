			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your question! As a student, I think that younger generations naturally understand the importance of the environment. Kids really appreciate wild animals, forests, the ocean, and more. Sometimes it shows through by hoping to major in an environmental field, and other times it shows by making memes from nature documentaries. The issue facing younger generations, I believe, is misinformation about the forces driving environmental degradation. The individualization of guilt about the climate crisis tends to remove pressure from companies and governments whose decisions have much more impact than any household, and who also already have the power to change our course. Furthermore, if we don't understand that environmental issues are structural, and requires structural solutions, it can lead to overwhelming anxiety about the future, feelings of helplessness, and a decision to disengage. So I would teach about our work by first educating youth about why people and the planet are being harmed, and from there, educate about the existing initiatives and organizations doing good work. Youth may already understand the importance of our work, but not believe in their own role in that work. Youth need to be told, and shown, that they can make a difference by getting involved---and then they will. - Rosie</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have rainforest education programs that haveÂ  taught students at many different ages, particularly in our home base of Austin, Texas.Â  First, we reach them through fun and the wonder of rainforests, their wildlife and vastness. Then we help them see just how connected they are to rainforests, although they may seem very far away and distant. They understand the stakes-- for themselves and for people around the world. Most importantly, we show young people that they have an absolutely critical role to play in the work. They can engage, participate, and lead in forest protection. By making spaces for young people-- from children to college students, we empower young people to lead and use their energy, creativity, and unique commitment to justice to create a better world-- all through the lens of rainforest protection. - RP Team</p></div>		</li>
