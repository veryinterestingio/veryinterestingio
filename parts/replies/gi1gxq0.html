<p>Did guys really do this? I heard about it once and tried it but the top of my dick just hangs out still.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well... ok lol, even if it doesn't reach your belt you can still lay it pointing upwards against your zipper right?</p>
<p>Then again idk, mine naturally points upwards so maybe I'm just ignorant as to how other dick angles work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its an option.  Typically I'll just have the wife stand in front of me!  She gets a good laugh and I don't have some random stranger looking at me in disgust cause I just shoved my hand down my pants to adjust my phantom boner.  </p>
<p>edit:  still wanna know why this happens lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, there's no shoving your hand down your pants required. You just make a quick adjustment when you feel yourself getting hard and it flips up towards your belt. I usually do it in a motion that makes it look like I'm &quot;itching&quot; my upper thigh combined with a simultaneous slight bow forward to give it more room to move in my pants</p>
<p>You can also stick your hand in your pocket and adjust that way if you're sitting down</p>
<p>EDIT: Method 2: with your hand in your pocket while standing, push your pocket out forward and flip your boner up with your fingers in a &quot;scooping&quot; motion</p></div>		</li>
