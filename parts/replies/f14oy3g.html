			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true for radio interferometry, certainly. If you're also an astronomer and have knowledge of optical interferometry, I'll defer to you. But I don't think it takes much computation to render optical interferometric images, since the interference is being done by nature, and observed by us. Whereas, for radio telescopes, you correlate the data after-the-fact, having recorded the amplitude, phase, and arrival time of the radio waves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. We often call arrays &quot;telescopes&quot; for shorthand even if they have multiple elements. Like the VLT (very large telescope) array.</p>
<p>And yes, it's similar the Event Horizon Telescope in principle, but very different in operation. Since the EHT uses radio wavelengths, they are able to measure and record the phases and amplitudes of the radio photons received (as well as their arrival time). They save this to a bunch of hard drives, and ship them to a computing center which looks at the data and combines it all after the fact. By contrast, we don't have the ability to measure optical photons in this much detail. Therefore, to do optical interferometry, you need to look at the actual interference pattern from the photons. This means you need a special dedicated facility that combines the optical photons from each telescope.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your link doesn't discuss the CHARA array at all.</p>
<p>Such a sparse array of telescopes can work for point sources, but it won't work well for bright objects on a relatively bright background, like astronauts on the Moon. The side-lobes will make it very difficult to make out the astronaut.</p>
<p>ELT will have a worse resolution, but it is a single mirror. It should find the lander as bright object and maybe see astronauts as brighter spots, too, even though it can't resolve them as single objects if two astronauts are two meters apart.</p>
<p>As we will look at astronauts from an angle, 1 meter is probably a better estimate for their size.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Whoops, sorry about that. Had a bunch of tabs open about it and linked the wrong one. Will update.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>That's a good point. I did think of that, but didn't do all the calculations, because I couldn't quickly find out the albedo of a spacesuit. The moon's albedo is actually pretty low: only 0.12 of the optical light is reflected. Spacesuits are generally very white to help regulate temperature. But I'm not sure how white they are quantitatively. I think it's plausible that the astronauts could be several times brighter than the background though.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>True. CHARA's resolution can barely resolve that too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have formulas ready for that, but is it true that the effective solid angle an interferometer is sensitive to scales with the inverse area? Everything apart from the astronauts will be roughly similar in brightness (as everything around them is the surface of the Moon), in that case raw area would be the main factor, and then ELT wins by a big margin.</p></div>		</li>
