			<div class="markdown"><p>Your sweat will just sit on the top of your skin. It will combine with the oils and dead skin cells and just sit there, insulating you, preventing heat from evaporating from your body. You will feel it on your skin all day long, it will stick to you like glue, you will feel physically dirty all day long until you get into air conditioning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also from Florida... love living here but the weather in July/August can drive you batshit crazy. You can walk outside at 2 in the morning and the air be so hot and thick that you sweat like it’s 3 in the afternoon.  Dark af outside and you’re wet with sweat. For 4+ months you never get a break from the heat/humidity . It smacks you in the face the second you open the door. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How humid it feels depends on the relative humidity, which depends on temperature. Without removing ANY water from the air, cooling the air makes it more humid, and heating it makes it less humid.</p>
<p>So if you were to simply (magically) lower the temperature of all the air in your house, it would actually increase the (relative) humidity. However, A/C effectively removes humidity because it cools smaller amounts of air down at a time, to a significantly lower temperature than the dew point, which makes the humidity condense, and then a significant amount liquid is removed. When this cooler air mixes and becomes slightly warmer with the rest of the air, it's relative humidity decreases and is now less than it was before.</p>
<p>That mechanism is a bit more complicated than heating the air - which ALSO decreases the (relative) humidity. But heating works directly, because hotter air can hold way more water. That's why you need a humidifier in the winter if you're heating your place - because you literally have to ADD water to the air to maintain the same relative humidity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That’s what drives me nuts about weak AC systems. If the heat exchanger inside is above the dew point, it just makes the place clammy. I’ve really only seen such systems in hotels (probably crummy ACs) and colleges (the heat exchanger isn’t evaporative. It just has cold liquid in it. Probably water)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was trying to think of how rare it seemed that ACs made it clammy, since I felt like it would not always be the case that an AC system pulls enough liquid out of the air. But... yup, you got it. Hotels. That's definitely exactly what's going on there and why the air in the room always feels so terrible and... hotel-y!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great ELI5, thank you! I’ve been trying to figure out why my dorm room (built in the 40’s, renovated several times) is so damn cold yet somehow so humid that I don’t even keep my suits or nice clothes there anymore. I had to transfer most of my wardrobe to my girlfriend’s apartment! It’s been humid in the dorm since I moved in back in August. </p>
<p>What does this say about the way the dorm is heated and cooled if it’s literally always humid? I’ve been perplexed by this greatly. This is Connecticut we’re talking about - it’s not a humid climate year-round. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. While I hate being cold, I hate being hot and sweaty more. I always say I'd rather freeze to death than die in a desert because if you're cold you can run around and warm your body up (and eventually hypothermia makes you think you're hot anyway). If you're hot, there's nothing you can do to cool down - you just bake to death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your own house is one thing - at least you will have warmer clothing there. Going out is much worse - it's impossible to dress appropriately because it's 105 degrees outside and 60 degrees in every shop, restaurant and movie theatre. So you have to bring a sweater and scarf on a scorching summer day so you won't freeze your ass off when you stop for lunch and the all the tables are directly below AC vents</p></div>		</li>
