			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting. Why do you think there won't be a vaccine by 2021? Don't they already have a SARS vaccine from the 2003 outbreak? I thought that starting with a previously approved vaccine makes it much easier to verify safety/efficacy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a few reasons.</p>
<p>While we do have some of the work from SARS-CoV1 vaccines, most of the studies never made it past Phase 1 before the epidemic was mostly over, so they are not currently available for use. The data gleaned from these studies is quite valuable but despite the similarities, there is no guarantee that these two viruses will respond in the same manner.</p>
<p>We do not currently have any approved human coronavirus vaccines available on the market. This presents a number of challenges, one of the biggest being the lack of established protocols for safe, large-scale manufacturing. cGMP protocols, which are necessary for any vaccines used in humans, do not exist for coronaviruses, and will need to be created new or heavily amended from current protocols. This has to be done even before initiating any large clinical trials.</p>
<p>Another challenge is finding an appropriate animal model for initial testing of any vaccine candidates. I've read a few sources that suggest that some of our traditional animal models may not be suitable for SARS-CoV2. In some cases, different animal models may not present an immune response or the virus simply may not grow/replicate well in other species.</p>
<p>I'd like to add that a few of the proposed coronavirus vaccines are based on novel platform technologies that have not yet been used in the production of an existing human vaccine. Some examples are Moderna's (mRNA-based platform) and J&amp;J's candidate vaccines (adenovirus vector platform). These platforms are new technology that will have to be themselves tested for safety, and will have to have manufacturing and safety protocols developed completely from scratch.</p>
<p>Here are some publications that summarize some of the issues (I believe they should be freely accessible):</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are potential SARS vaccines from the 2003 outbreak but from what I’ve read, they didn’t complete the gamut of Phase 1,2 and 3 trial. The 2003 SARS epidemic was contained, at that point interest and therefore funding withered to nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard an interesting point on the internet regarding vaccines for Covid. Why don't we develope vaccines for regular colds/flu? These are respiratory viral infections, so why not prevent the tens of thousands of annual deaths using a vaccine for regular flu? Or does it mutate too rapidly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They make flu vaccines every year and constantly try to get more people to actually get flu shots.</p>
<p>It's not worth developing a vaccine for &quot;the common cold&quot; because a) you'd have to come up with a vaccine for a bunch of different viruses because there's not just one kind of cold and b) people don't actually get very sick from colds so there's not really much point.  I mean we already can't get many people to take flu shots and the flu is way worse than a cold, there <em>really</em> wouldn't be a market for common-cold shots</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You bring up the good point that unfortunately, the market entirely dictates pharmaceutical and research development in the US. I do think that the main reason we don't have a common cold vaccine is simply that we have not been successful at making one rather than economic reasons. I think there probably would be a market for one if it were technically possible and reasonably effective. </p>
<p>I would say the real victim here is antibiotic research and development, which has almost completely fallen by the wayside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question. It really depends upon the virus in question. Certain viruses are very difficult to develop an appropriate vaccine for. </p>
<p>As an example, rhinoviruses, which are the predominant family of viruses that cause the common cold, have to date, eluded our attempts at the development of a vaccine. </p>
<p>This is in part due to the large number of different strains in the family (making it difficult to pinpoint a target that provides immunity against all) and the difficulty in finding an animal model that accurately reproduces the infection process and response that we see in humans. (This is a bit simplified, do forgive me).</p>
