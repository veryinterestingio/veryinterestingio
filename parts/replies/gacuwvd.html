			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily, only because the issue with dwarfism is essentially that the bones themselves are shorter in whole, which is unrelated to HGH. </p>
<p>It’s more related to a genetic mutation, which cascades into issues stunting overall bone development and growth. HGH would specifically help the bones’ growth plates fulfill their growth destiny, but the issue lies within the long bone/entire bone body itself not being fully created in the first place. And even with HGH’s help, the body has issues with bone upkeep/maintenance anyway with dwarfism unfortunately, so it wouldn’t help as much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do people take it, like bodybuilders and sports people, when this is a known thing? Does it supposedly give you more muscle mass, like they believe it's the New Steroids or something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, HGH grows everything, including muscle. it even grows bones other than long bones in adults, which is why people who take a lot of it can have their skull noticeably grow. because it boosts cell replication it also really helps with recovery after workouts. </p>
<p>that's also the downside, it grows everything, the same conditions that end up killing people with gigantism prematurely exist in them to a lesser degree. if they take too much hgh they can have issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it even makes your internal organs grow. That’s why a lot of bodybuilders have stomachs that stick out even though they have almost no body fat, it’s from their intestines getting bigger and pressing out their abdomens. I think it’s referred to as pop-gut.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It increases recovery time of muscles significantly. This allows body builders to lift more frequently without overworking themselves, which allows them to get significantly larger. HGH is natural in your body - you make a little whenever you’re injured or exercising.</p>
<p>HGH is expensive, though.  Significantly more so than steroids. It also has a fairly short half-life.  The way it was described to me is that it’s as if your body went back in time to when you were 15 and everything healed extremely fast.</p></div>		</li>
