			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually untrue. Venezuela is fucked right now... because of China. They essentially fund certain groups (sometimes rebels, sometimes extreme political parties (like communists, or 'socialists', or extremely right-winged maniacs)) to get into power and when they get into power, they owe China, and China gets them to do stupid shit to repay them, like borrow a shit ton of money for pointless projects, then China comes in and claims land/resources to repay the debt.</p>
<p>So China directly causes the issues in the first place, pretends to fix it, then causes even more issues 'fixing it', then you end up with somewhere like Venezuela is now... completely fucked. </p>
<p>It's basically the same strategy the US tried to use in Libya... the problem was, the rebel party the US backed couldn't hold power, so now Libya is in a civil war between conflicting powers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. At least with China, countries actually build shit like airports, roads, ports, refinieries etc </p>
<p>China has, for all its faults and for all the criticism, done something the West never could: lift Africa out of the excruciating poverty it was in.</p>
<p>The Africa of today is nothing short of miraculous compared to the Africa when I was a kid. I used to wonder if Africa would ever even come close to where it was today. The World Bank, FMI and other neo-liberal organizations only further indebted and impoverished these countries. They used to have to bend over and grab their ankles just to get a couple million to build a fuckin bridge.</p>
<p>China comes in and gives billions for roads, bridges, tunnels, rails, ports, airports you name it. Doesn't force them to slash social spending. Doesn't require them to privatize their few remaining precious resources like water and their last remaining state owned power plants... Again, not to say Chinese investment doesn't bring its own world of predatory behavior, unholy debt and other problems.... But I gotta give credit where credit is due. China did almost single-handidly what the West couldn't (or didn't try to).</p>
<p>If I had to choose between a payday lender and a loan-shark/pimp who was gonna come break my legs if I didn't pay..... I'm sticking with the payday loan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point but please don't frame this like it's some kind of Chinese phenomenon. Debt has been the underlying mechanism in colonialism since the very start, and probably no entity has been as ruthless in carrying it out than the US-backed World Bank. </p></div>		</li>
