			<div class="markdown"><p>It is also not completely correct. Some intervals do <em>not</em> intrinsically sound better than others. We learn our taste in music culturally; for example, tribes completely separated from western music have a completely different idea of what intervals/harmony sound nice.</p>
<p>I do have a citation for this, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature18635" target="_blank"><em>Nature</em> 2016</a>... I think. Going to take me a few minutes to find it though. Edit: found.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of?<br />
The general idea that overall, small integer ratios make more harmonius intervals is probably more or less a human universal.  </p>
<p>OTOH, western ears are more used to 12-TET and would usually find a 7:4 ratio much more alien than a 9:5. (unless they're into blues or barbershop)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's kind of what most of functional jazz harmony is about. There's this interval called the &quot;tritone&quot; which is really tense and sounds pretty bad. But jazz people used it to make a nice contrast between tension/resolution in a song.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://youtu.be/G8dsvclf3Tk?t=162" target="_blank">Mr. Blue Sky</a>: Without being aware of it you know the notes a song is supposed to have (that's they key the song is). When they repeat the phrase &quot;I'll remember you&quot; they use a modal interchange so they borrow notes from another scale (it's technically the same key, but different mode). They also seem to be preparing to get to the root (F) by doing VI-VII but instead modulate to its minor relative Dm. In other words, it seems they are going for a triumphant feeling (major chord) but instead resolve to a melancholic chord (minor chord). They got two awesome surprises in a very short amount of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plenty of people recognize individual notes. However, what makes those notes turn into music is the patterns of intervals, as said by top commenter. A good example of this being true is eastern music vs western music. Western music is dominated by A440 tuning and Major/Minor scales. Eastern music, specifically the little I know of Indian music, is totally different tunings and totally different scales.</p>
<p>Even if you just take A = 440 Hertz and change that to something like A = 432 Hertz all of the resultant changes in frequency across scales and Octaves will make a piece sound totally different. </p>
<p>It’s worth mentioning that those SLIGHT variations in frequency are what makes instruments like a guitar or piano pleasant. Just like a circle is never perfectly round, a vibrating string is never perfectly in tune. For a guitar, the scaling of the frets and the length of the string is never perfect either, creating slight variations in frequency that can sound pleasant or harsh depending. Contrarily, if you make the intervals absolutely perfect and there is no variation in frequency or overtone, it tends to sound cold. That is why old analog synthesizers are so sought after as their electronics has introduced a variability due to age that makes it sound more alive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd wager it's far more common than that. I have no evidence beyond personal experience. Also, many people can recognise individual notes without perfect pitch (we practice).</p></div>		</li>
