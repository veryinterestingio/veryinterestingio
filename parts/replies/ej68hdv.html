			<div class="markdown"><p>My ex’s mum catfished a guy online. She pretended to by her daughter (my ex) when in reality she was an overweight 40 year old white trash type. Oh and he was also 17. </p>
<p>When he finally travelled the 6 hours down to visit, he obviously found out immediately, but just thought “oh fuck it” apparently because he ended up moving down straight after and they lived together for 5 years. I mean that should have been a huge red flag for me, as my ex turned out to be equally as trash as her mum and the rest of her family. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That'd be my guess. As a layer to obfuscate the origin of the stolen cards.</p>
<p>If you get a bunch of random people around the world to use them to sign up for your dummy service. A decoy legal entity that takes the fall. Then that decoy legal entity transfers some of that money to another entity that you own. When all the chargebacks eventually happen, most of the money in the decoy legal entity is gone, but some of it might be recoverable or whatever. However, you've managed to siphon off say 10 to 30% of the stolen credit card funds.</p>
<p>Since the vast majority of cost for the scammers doing this kind of stuff is in the setup of the automated system to get random people to use the stolen details and thus assume the legal risk, once they get a list of stolen card details, they just hit go on some on some software and money will come in. Some percentage of the people using the stolen cards will use them for other purchases too, not just on your site, which helps hide the fact that the aim of the scam is to get money onto your site.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Credit card number generators have been available for decades and in 2002 they were easy enough to find for 12-year old me. It's just numbers that fulfill the specifications of a credit card number, so that they have a valid checksum. They <em>could</em> be real, just like any number you come up with <em>could</em> be real, but most likely aren't.</p></div>		</li>
