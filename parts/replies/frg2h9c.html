			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't tell you the engine failed. It'll be something similar to a loss of rpms and a high exhaust temp. It's all raw data and the engine failure must be interpreted from that data. If it's anything like my I dustry there will also be faults that instead of saying the exhaust temp is above normal the fault will say the left wing fell off and you have to somehow interpret that as the exhaust temp on the left wing was above normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just did some car diagnosis today, and I am pretty sure I found the issue... What the code say?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>oxygen sensor 1 low or open</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>oxygen sensor 2 low or open</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lean bank 1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lean bank 2</p>
</li>
<li>random misfire</li>
</ul>
<p>Other issues not in code: lack of power, rought running, backfire, hard to start...</p>
<p>... the problem was the mass air flow sensor. It do not account for all the air that flow by, which cause the oxygen sensor to report the proper values, but the computer think it make no sense due to the amount of fuel it dumped compared to the amount of air that went in. But it is right to say that it is indeed lean (too much air/not enought fuel) which also lead to issues to burn the fuel, which lead to the misfire, lack of power, backfire and cause it to be hard to start...</p>
<p>And it is the same with an airplane. After all, it is just an even more complex engine with even more sensors and things that can fail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You reminded me of an issue with the Volkswagen Sharan (Ford Galaxy). The aircon would fail. No obvious issue. Ecu would report throttle position failure. So the aircon would fail because it wasn’t able to read the throttle position which it needed to do to enable the aircon compressor via the canbus.
But why was that failing? Canbus connections were ok.
Issue was spark plugs. Yes, indeed. The specific spark plugs this guy had in his car were causing a frequency to be induced on the canbus that stopped the aircon from being able to read the throttle position signals. As soon as they replaced the spark plugs the issue disappeared and the aircon worked perfectly.
That will have been months of work and troubleshooting (and probably hours staring at signalling on an oscilloscope) to work out wtf was going on there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. And is it a faulty MAF or maybe a vacuum leak? If it’s a vacuum leak then where? Oh, by the way, the engine hit the ground at 600mph and is in 600 pieces, but I still need to know where the vacuum leak was.</p>
<p>A lot of shade tree airline mechanics in here, apparently.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I said why not?...he said you can get thrown out the car if you had a accident while driving down hill without a gear when the drivers window is open--Not wearing a seat belt!....OMG i said anything else?....he said let me check!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Extra data isn't the problem. Black boxes record everything that can be recorded. Switch positions, engine data, fault codes, etc. All the info is there, they need to put it back together, and examine what its telling them. To determine what actually happened. The issue isn't the tech, its the pure mass of information that needs to be interpreted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a teacher who worked on F-16s. One time he told us the story of decoding a black box from a crash. The crash: an air force pilot took his marine friend on a flight to have fun. Shortly after going into a dive the plane veered sharply to the side and crashed. Both died. </p>
<p>Now I should note that air force flight suits inflate on the legs and arms of the pilot to reduce the affect of Gforce. Air force suits inflate the legs on the front and back of the suit while marine suits inflate on the sides. My teacher and his team discovered that the marine's flight suit inflated on the sides and pushed the control stick to the side, causing the plane to crash. All this from the data in the black box. Pretty impressive imo. </p>
<p>Also, not sure if it was a marine, just a different force member because of the suit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds like what is commonly referred to as &quot;a crazy lie&quot; or &quot;bullshit.&quot; USMC/Navy pilots and USAF pilots do use different anti-g suits, but neither one expands externally to any significant degree. That would defeat the point. </p>
<p>The pilot in this video is just wearing a flight suit, not the &quot;trousers&quot; of an anti-g suit, but at this point in the video you can see how much clearance there is between the side stick and his leg. The anti-g suit would have to blow up like the Michelin Man to even come in contact with the side stick.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The teacher wasn't the kind to embellish stories or anything of the sort, and someone else even posted articles correlating to these events. Maybe it has something to do with the date. My teacher worked at Lockheed over 20 years ago and that video is from 2009. Maybe they increased the space because of this very incident.</p></div>		</li>
