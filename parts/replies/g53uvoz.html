Sodium lauryl sulfate is the active ingredient in almost every off-the-shelf shampoo, yet in higher concentrations is found in industrial degreasers and cleaners.

As a straight and greasy haired woman my hair definitely needs that level of cleaning to stop my hair being  horrid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and also gives that &quot;clean&quot; feeling, which is really your hair being stripped. It's in skin products too. It can take some adjusting to get used to the feeling of SLS free products.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have used shampoos with sls that are incredibly gentle, and sulfate free ones that stripped the color right outta my hair and made it like straw.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what's the difference between shampoo and a different degreaser, like Dawn?  I feel like Dawn would be very bad for my hair, but now I want to know exactly why. </p>
<p>If it's just stripping the oils, could I use Dawn and then Conditioner and have a pretty similar experience to Shampoo and Conditioner?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, Dawn is made of the same key ingredient (beyond water obviously), sodium lauryl sulfate. Which is basically just coconut/palm oil mixed with a base to add the sodium to the fat molecule to make one end attract fats and the other end attract water. This is what makes it bubble as well as clean geese. This is a detergent that is safe for contact with human skin, but doesn't leave scum like a bar of soap. It's in pretty much any liquid soaps you can touch, from hand dishwashing liquid to toothpaste. If it can touch your hands it can touch your scalp. </p>
<p>However, concentrations are different and there other ingredients in dawn that make it better for aggressively cleaning dishes where as shampoo to try and avoid damage to hair. It would work, but likely wouldn't be ideal for healthy hair and would probably cause more irritation on the eyes. </p>
<p>Definitely don't attempt it with dishwasher detergent, that being the stuff that goes in the dishwasher, or anything else like laundry detergent. Stronger concentrations and different more aggressive detergents that can be used as they aren't meant for contact with human skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a truck driver, I always have Dawn and Gojo in the shower. I don't notice any difference between Dawn or shampoo in the way my hair feels afterwards, but I always use conditioner. I use Gojo as an exfoliant on my face or plain Dawn and I've never had dry skin from it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>a bit more aggressive than soap</p>

<p>I always thought it's the other way around and using regular shower gel on your hair would damage it by removing too much oil or being too aggressive. Is that not the case?</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/irxjw2/eli5_what_is_the_difference_between_shampoo_and/g545o7m" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/irxjw2/eli5_what_is_the_difference_between_shampoo_and/g545o7m</a> explains it is the case but has to do with pH and not oil removal.</p></div>		</li>
