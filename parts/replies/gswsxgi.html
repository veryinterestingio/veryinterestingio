<p>Super interesting, though. I was actually aware of her (it pretty much has to be, as similar as the beginning of the stories are) as far as the food washing (wasn't aware of the grain separation, though), but I had no idea that the learned to swim. That's crazy. </p>
<p>Sort of related, I used to watch animal planet every morning while I wake and baked (woke and boke?) and mentally prepared for the day. Big Cat Diaries, Escape to Chimp Eden, and Orangutan Island (I think that's what that one was called). Never did see anything spectacular from the chimps, but on one episode they showed an orangutan probing and testing the water with a stick, then wading/half assed swimming across to a neighboring island (or something like that). Orangutans don't do that, or at least they shouldn't.</p></div>		</li>
