			<div class="markdown"><p>EDIT: My original comment is currently being debated by scientists. There is some older research that shows that stressors degrade fine motor control but there is also newer research that finds this may not be true. There seems to be some situational differences in what stressors degrade fine motor function: For example, well trained people may not suffer loss of fine motor control under stressors. And some studies have found that psycho-social stressors (as opposed to physical) INCREASE fine motor control.</p>
<p>Original Comment for Posterity:
<del>This response makes it easier to make big movements (pushing a tiger away or running away from the tiger) but it makes it harder to do fine motor movements (gouging the tiger in the eye.)</del></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please explain why you think that activating the sympathetic nervous system would affect the pathways that control fine motor control of the hands, which is a skeletal muscle pathway.  The sypathetic nervous system is simplified to fight , and the example is always running away from a predator, but you might as well say driving a car or dancing, becasue exercise activates the sympathetic system also, as does novelty , sex and any arousal (not in the sexual way at all).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for questioning me on this. The generally accepted idea is that in fight or flight situations, fine motor control degrades. For example, emergency services are taught that because of the degradation in fine motor control during stress, they should prefer motions to be gross motor skills.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2.1 Physiological effects of stress Siddle [3] refined reported effects of stress to physiological measurements, linking the deterioration of fine motor skills and cognitive functioning and the enhancement of gross motor skills to increasing heart rate: • &gt;115 bpm: loss of fine motor skills • &gt;145 bpm: loss of complex motor skills; visual system decreases the peripheral view and attention 152 • &gt;175 bpm: gross motor skills only; auditory exclusion; tunnel vision; &quot;freezing&quot;; deterioration of depth perception; deterioration of information processing skills This relationship between performance and heart rate can be explained by the Inverted U Hypothesis, which states that performance increases with arousal (e.g. heart rate) up to a certain point, at which time performance starts to deteriorate. Levitt's research supports both this hypothesis and Siddle's findings, defining this point of descent at 145bpm, with optimal performance between 115 and 145 bpm;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, when I started looking into newer peer reviewed articles... there's little evidence of this &quot;commonly accepted&quot; idea! For example, this meta study: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6856650/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6856650/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6856650/</a></a> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, there are little data that document the direct impact of stress physiology on skilled motor performance at the central (brain and spinal cord) or peripheral (neuromuscular) level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, there are even questions in the emergency services community if this commonly held belief is true or not: <a href="https://www.itstactical.com/warcom/firearms/do-we-really-lose-fine-motor-skills-under-shooting-stress/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.itstactical.com/warcom/firearms/do-we-really-lose-fine-motor-skills-under-shooting-stress/" target="_blank">https://www.itstactical.com/warcom/firearms/do-we-really-lose-fine-motor-skills-under-shooting-stress/</a></a></p>
<p>So, it certainly seems like this issue is less cut and dried as I had originally read. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No - the speed of a muscle contraction is fixed.  It is the time it takes for a signal to travel from the brain to the nerve terminal, the time it takes for acetylcholine to travel across the neuromuscular junction, the time it takes for a muscle action potential to occur and calcium to go into the call and allow the contractile proteins to contract.  That all occurs according to physical principles that are not changeable in the short term (how myelinated the nerve is, how long it is, how big diameter it is etc).</p></div>		</li>
