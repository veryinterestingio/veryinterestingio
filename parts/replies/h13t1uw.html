			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, my understanding was when you lose weight you don't actually lose fat cells, they just get smaller, the actual number of them stays the same.</p>
<p>People who get liposuction will sometimes get fat in weird places, since the cells that would typically expand due to a weight increase are now no longer there so the fat cells in other parts of the body will then expand instead.</p>
<p>edit: spelling</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading/hearing once that once a fat cell has been made, it stays with the person forever, which in turn makes it easier to someone to regain the weight, hence it's best to not gain weight in the first place. Is there any truth to this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apart from storing energy in the form of fat, is there any other bodily function provided by the fat stores? If liposuction is physically removing fat cells, what's to stop someone removing the whole layer of adipose tissue? Does it grow back?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesingly, a few techniques that replace liposuction are based on just killing the fat cells and letting the immune system get rid of the dead cells.  One of the techniques was actually the fitst step of liposuction, before the actual cutting and suction.</p></div>		</li>
