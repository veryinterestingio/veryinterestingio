<p>Typically there is some industry somewhere with a large slowdown that is triggering the reduced spending, causing the cascade.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the case of the Great Recession, the industry was the  the home financing industry.</p>
<p>Basically, home financers were giving home buyers $200 to buy homes worth $100. The home financers then claimed to have $200 of assets and used that $200 to guarantee or fund other deals.</p>
<p>So, the home financing industry (backed by investment banks) artificially increased spending by booking home values at more than they were worth, infusing the whole economy with a lot of moving money (on the books at least.)</p>
<p>When home buyers couldn't pay their mortgages the true home values were revealed and the supposed $200 dollars worth of home reverted to the real $100. But the banks had already spent the extra $100 and now they needed to make up the $100 from somewhere... But they couldn't get it from the homebuyers who declared bankruptcy and the home itself was only worth half what they thought.</p>
<p>So money stopped moving. The homes were the spring of the money, but the spring suddenly dried up so the water downstream stopped moving.</p>
<p>Covid19 recession is going to be different. Using the previous example, the actual amount of homes being built is lessening. The true amount of valuable things being created in the world is lessening, so the economy is shrinking. (Great Recession was caused by people misperceiving the amount of available wealth. Covid19 recession is caused by fewer valuable things being created.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought it was cause they sold homes for what they were &quot;worth&quot; more or less as always, but did ARM loans, and only charged interest for a few years. When peoples loans starting costing their actual cost per month, they couldn't pay. The interest was around 300-500 a month, but then they had to pay full of around 2000-2500 a month. So people starting defaulting on the loans. And the banks sold the loans for less than they were worth, and they did this back and forth, slowly selling 200 dollar loans for 100 dollars then 80 then 60 then 40 and so on.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's a lot of semi-correct things in here, but is not how it actually works. For starters, adding an asset to your balance sheet (a mortgage) doesn't create capital for you to lend more, it reduces your available lending capacity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oops sorry. I said &quot;Great Recession&quot; which is slightly wrong in two ways:</p>
<p>1) &quot;The Great Recession&quot; refers to 2009's economic growth (which is considered a Depression or Deflation not a recession.) The name is terrible, but not my fault completely, since it's the commonly used name: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession</a></p>
<p>2) I equated &quot;The Great Recession&quot; with the 2008 Economic Crisis. &quot;The Great Recession&quot; was more a result of the 2008 Financial/Economic Crisis. It was the economic outcome while I was describing what led up to it.</p>
<p>So... I should have called it the 2008 Economic Crisis in my comment. It's not quite the same thing as &quot;The Great Recession&quot;. Thanks for pointing that out.</p></div>		</li>
