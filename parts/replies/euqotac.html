<p>When you are troubleshooting a ticket and need to make sure what the root cause is, you really need to check that stuff.</p>
<p>Like someone being like &quot;oh, excel just hanged&quot; and after an hour of wasted time you find out it was her stupid wireless fucking mouse and keyboard shit bundle, running out of battery.</p>
<p>And people usually say stuff like &quot;Of course I checked if the computer is plugged, don't worry, I'm not an idiot &quot;. WTF, I'm not saying you are, I'm telling you to go check. Now. Please </p>
<p>So you just have to trick them into checking.</p></div>		</li>
