			<div class="markdown"><p>Oxidative stress is the stress your body is put under when dealing with the free radicals (reactive oxygen species; little oxygen atoms with too many electrons) produced by metabolic processes. Dogs and cats have a lower threshold for handling this stress than humans do, and their inability to deal with it appropriately leads to their red blood cells dying (hemolysis) and anemia as a consequence of that (insufficient oxygen carrying capacity of blood).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oxidative stress: Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) like superoxide radicals (O2^(-)), hydroxyl radicals (OH), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are very chemically reactive and can in excessive amounts cause damage to cell structures (including DNA). This is what antioxidants do: these radicals bind to them preferentially, rendering them harmless.</p>
<p>Hemolysis: Red blood cells dying and rupturing, releasing their contents into the blood. Bad thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the chemistry joke, two men walk into a bar one says I'll have some H2O the other says I'll have some H2O too. The second man died.</p>
<p>Is mechanism of free radicals that can kill dogs and cats the same mechanism that kills the second man (i.e that makes hydrogen peroxide toxic to humans)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I first read Oxidation on this thread I first thought of oxidation part of redox reaction in Chemistry which means a loss of electrons (either partial or full). It looks like the term is also used for something that actually involves oxygen. Thanks for sharing the info.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oxidative stress generally involves the creation of compounds called free radicals which are highly reactive species that have an unpaired valence electron. They react with the cellular macromolecules such as proteins and lipids and damage/destroy them. When they react with the lipids that hold the red blood cell together they weaken it and can result in the red blood cell rupturing (hemolysis). Because normal cell metabolism generates huge amounts of free radicals cells have endogenous systems to combat oxidative stress. The principle protective compound is called glutathione. At least two compounds in Allium plants are relevant. Di-propyl-disulfide and allyl propylisulfide both can cause oxidative stress leading to hemolytic anemia in susceptible animals. Dogs and cats are both susceptible. Dogs have low levels of the antioxidant enzyme catalase in their red blood cells. The hemoglobin in cats is 3x more susceptible to oxidative damage compared to other species.</p></div>		</li>
