			<div class="markdown"><p>You could certainly do that, but you would be making a series of assumptions (that might not be valid). First, you would be assuming that the increase in temperature (whether we're talking about annual or seasonal means or maximums in some block of time) over the last 20 years is representative of the way it will change in the future (e.g. if there is a linear pattern for the last 20 years, that the relationship will remain linear with the same slope). One of the issues with this is that many aspects of climate are subject to feedbacks and/or thresholds, i.e. relationships can change through time, sometimes suddenly once a particular parameter increases or decreases beyond some threshold where a different process / regime takes over.</p>
<p>As highlighted in my answer in this thread, you would also be assuming that distributions are staying the same. Imagine doing your exercise but that each year was represented as gaussian of temperature, even if the pattern in the means were a fixed model (e.g. linear increase), to get at the maximums, you would need to some how try to account for how the distributions around those means are changing as we are ultimately interested in the maxima.</p></div>		</li>

<li>well said, I definitely over simplified this one!</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I recall, we should expect an &quot;exponentional&quot; increase in climate.  So the real climate will diverge from your linear representation.  Meaning that the longer you wait, the more wrong your prediction will be.  And because the climate fluctuate in such a &quot;random&quot; way, your short sight prevision will also mean nothing. </p>
<p>The truth is we dont really know how the climate will change. It depend on many variables that we dont know how they gonna change over time.  We cant predict the human production of co2, deforestation, natural disasters  and many more.  Also, the current observation we made are from the current climat and situation.  We dont know what new variable might become relevant once the climate change start to modifying our environment.  For exemple : the melting of the ice will most likely change the oceans currents in some way.</p></div>		</li>
