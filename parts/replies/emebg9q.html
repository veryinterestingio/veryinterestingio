			<div class="markdown"><p>It's suggested that pregnant women should be drinking 100+oz of water each day, in order to supplement that which is lost to making more blood, brewing the baby, etc.</p>
<p>I hate this.</p>
<p>First, it's really hard to do that when your stomach is in your rib cage, being shoved there by your growing child. Think you're hungry? Take two bites, you'll be full in no time. Thirsty? Have a sip, but don't stray too far from the john!</p>
<p>Second, it's difficult to get comfortable, so you may be shifting for ten minutes trying to find the &quot;sweet spot&quot; where your shpeilkis actually doesn't hurt, <em>only</em> to have to get up five minutes later (and good luck with that) to pee, because you've realized you're only at about 48oz and you should probably have at least 12oz more before you take that nap you're inevitably going to take, no matter how hard you fight it.</p>
<p>Third, your squeedily spooch is constantly pressing on your ganecktegazoink, so you have to pee every twenty minutes <em>anyway</em>, only to be compounded by the three bottles of water you just drank because the last time you peed, five minutes ago, you were still, clearly, not well hydrated.</p>
<p>Fourth, by the time you've washed your hands and managed to get your maternity pants settled back into a comfortable position, and your shirt covering the expandy band, and begun to exit the restroom, you have to pee, again, because you really <em>were</em> thirsty half an hour ago, and had two sips of water from your 24oz cup, and no, it's not a little dribble, it's a full-on, really did have to go, pee.</p>
<p>Six more weeks. Just six. more. weeks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had an ultrasound once where you do the full bladder then empty bladder routine, and when I went to empty the tech told me to pee, wait a minute, and pee again to get a truly empty bladder because when it's really full your kidneys will drain more in as soon as you empty it. She was right, and now I use this trick on road trips to cut down on stops. Since your bladder has less room than usual you are probably extra susceptible, I recommend you try the dual-stage pee and just browse Reddit in the meantime. Might let you space out the trips a bit!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was such an incredibly awesome insight to pregnancy, replete with Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy words that idk if you made up or just slang I’m not aware of, keeping it PG.  I hope you have a day of rest and such between the rough patches there will inevitably be in the next 6 weeks. After all, it is the most incredible feat of biology that you are performing right now! Good news is you can handle it.  You’re made for it. Man, as a male I envy that ability you have. I’m unfortunately not made for it so I will never experience what you get to, growing a freaking human inside of you, if that makes it easier to swallow. </p>
<p>Keep your head up, homie. Ez pz</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit: I am stand corrected. Please read u/cthulhubert’s comment below </p>
<p>Great answer! Just a small correction: the receptors are mostly in your aortic and carotid bodies, rather than in your brain. These are bundles of nerve-like cells along two of your biggest arteries - keeping an eye on your blood pressure and blood solute content right as it comes out of the pump.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A small correction (²): at least according to the anatomy and physiology text I kept, the front line in hydration detection and regulation is made of osmoreceptors in the hypothalmus; the vascular baroreceptors in carotid and aorta are an important supplement; and then there's also a hormonal regulation system built into the kidneys (while it isn't explicitly stated here, if I recall correctly it's a big part of increasing thirst when the body has to eliminate excess toxins from the blood).</p>
<p>Googling for some key words found this site that a quick skim says agrees with that: <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/anatomyandphysiology/chapter/26-2-water-balance/" target="_blank">https://opentextbc.ca/anatomyandphysiology/chapter/26-2-water-balance/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats why drinking salt water makes you more thirsty. More salt and your body says 'This meat skin has soooo much water its fine'</p>
<p>Then your body does not have enough water....</p>
