			<div class="markdown"><p>I got stuck thinking about the 10 degree cone as it was novel to me. After thinking about it, I don't think it's a cone. Sure, it's a 10 degree triangle behind them, but the 3 dimensional shape would be the negative of their two cones of vision (one from each eye). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're assuming that one eye can see past 180°, but not far enough to see directly behind the rump.  It's probably more like they can see 175° in which case it is indeed a cone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also I once heard that because of the shape of a horses eyes they perceive you as being bigger than them which helps in the whole them being submissive to you process. But I’m also partly posting this to see if anyone will debunk it for me...</p></div>		</li>
