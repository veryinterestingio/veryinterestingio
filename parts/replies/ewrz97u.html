			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, there aren't really set places for the intestines. They move around as you do. If you roll over or do a handstand (don't try to learn how to do a handstand while pregnant...), the intestines shift. In pelvic and abdominal surgeries, the beds are tilted. This allows the intestines to slide out of the way and helps prevent damage (in addition to making the target organ more accessible).</p>
<p>After giving birth, there are all sorts of changes throughout your belly, and one of those is that your intestines will have more room to go where your full uterus was. So yes, they go back, but the place they go back to is always changing. Our bodies are generally great at adapting :) Docs are there for the percent of times things don't work out.</p>

<p>EDIT: Good luck with the rest of your pregnancy!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting. How many degrees would surgical tables be tilted in order to have them slide?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's an example.  In order to see the gallbladder (it's tucked under the liver), it's typical to tilt the bed about 10-15 degrees to the left and 30-45 degrees head-up/foot-down (a position called Reverse Trendelenburg).  The intestines fall toward the lower left, leaving more room around the liver.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We tilt to 32 degrees head-down for hysterectomies. That’s usually enough for everything to slide up towards your liver. Sometimes we still have to grab some intestines and yank them back though. Slippery little buggers they are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A woman's organs do not, can not, just fall out after pregnancy.  What would they fall out of?  The bottom of the pelvis is already full of stuff and held together with bone and muscle.</p>
<p>Technically a cesarean section is abdominal surgery so if it went wildly off-course then maybe other organs would be exposed, but doctors are pretty careful go straight for the uterus (which is right out front at the end of pregnancy) and close up afterwards.</p>
<p>So no, a woman's organs don't fall out after pregnancy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ummm, uterine, vaginal or rectal prolapse would be the closest thing to having your organs “fall out” and these don’t typically happen until women are much older.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The closest is that sometimes during a C-section, if it's a teaching hospital, they might pull organs out to show the students. Like with any procedure, though, you as the patient can refuse anything you don't want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>don’t worry, your intestines will just relax back into place. Also your diaphragm and your lungs. Though, pregnancy and childbirth are still somewhat dangerous to the health of mother and child the human body beautifully adapts to it.</p></div>		</li>
