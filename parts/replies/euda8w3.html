			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure but changes to something like skin tone happen fairly readily (you're generally just changing the amount of melanin). So over evolutionary timescales it's fairly reasonable changes or lack thereof to have an underlying cause other than chance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mutation is random. Natural selection is not. Less-useful mutations are filtered out, and clear patterns emerge across many different species. The resulting process of random input and non-random output can be safely said to be directional, IMO. If you say evolution is random, you might as well say everything is random.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Natural selection does not drive mutation. Mutation drives natural selection. Natural selection can only select for traits that present through mutation, which is random. Just because the environment will give advantages to certain traits IF they appear, does not mean that those traits WILL appear. That part is, in fact, random. </p>
<p>Creatures do not decide to mutate as a strategic response to the environment, they mutate randomly. And natural selection doesn’t even necessarily “select” the best-adapted trait unless that trait causes its bearers to actually reproduce more than non-bearers. Which is not guaranteed, even with an advantage. Probability is not a guarantee.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just want to add to your comment that these randomly-mutated traits (beneficial or not) must help the species reproduce in some way (or help us live long enough to reproduce) in order to for the trait to increase in frequency.  Or so according to evolutionary theory.  Being light skinned may have helped some folks to make more vitamin D and therefore, maybe, live long enough to reproduce.  Also, such novelty in skin tone might have been seen as &quot;sexy.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
