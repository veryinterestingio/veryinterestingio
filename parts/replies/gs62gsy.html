So, in this case specifically, you had what is called a provoked DVT or PE – provoked by surgery, injury, or something else. If there is no other reason to continue your blood thinner, you may be able to take it for a period of 3-6 months and then might be able to stop it. There are different approaches or reasons for your healthcare team to decide to stop it. But, as a reminder, once you’ve had one blood clot, you are always at risk for the rest of your life to have another blood clot. So if you have another operation, you are at higher risk than the average person to have another blood clot.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does the first blood clot <em>cause</em> the increased risk? Or is it that, statistically speaking, people who have had one blood clot are more likely to have already had predispositions for increased blood clot risk in general than people who haven't yet had any?</p></div>		</li>
