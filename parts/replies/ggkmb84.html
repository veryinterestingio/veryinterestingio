<p>The &quot;comoving frame&quot; is the reference frame at rest in this concept, for which the CMB is red-shifted the same in all directions.  Note that because of the expansion of the universe, two objects in different places each in their comoving frames for those locations will be moving away from each other.</p>

<li>The motion of an object relative to the comoving frame is its <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peculiar_velocity" target="_blank">&quot;peculiar motion&quot;</a>.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not strictly relevant here but I find it fascinating that CMB is so universally similar - the universe is approximately 14 billion years old, and yet two points in space 30 billion light years apart have evenly distributed CMB. It's impossible for information to have travelled between them at that distance. This tells us a lot about the expansion of the universe; at one point in time, those spacial points must have been much closer together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not a qualified expert but I will try. For what it's worth, I am a university student getting a degree in physics. </p>
<p>When you open a bottle of perfume, at first, the smell is very strong right where you opened it. Then after a few seconds, the smell moves a little further away from the bottle. If you leave the bottle sitting open for long enough, eventually the smell will spread evenly throughout the room, so that all points in the room smell equally of the perfume. This process is called <strong>diffusion;</strong> particles of the perfume enter the air and diffuse throughout the room until they are everywhere.</p>
<p>You can also think of diffusion basically as an exchange of information. One point in the room says to an adjacent point &quot;hey man, you have a lot of that perfume over there and I have none. Think you can give me part of yours?&quot; The point with more of the perfume then gives some to the point with less. This process gets repeated for each pair of points, constantly, until the perfume is evenly distributed. </p>
<p>This principle doesn't only apply to smells. This is true of putting a dye in a liquid, heat into a piece of metal, or radiation in a lab. In all cases, the dye, or heat, or radiation will gradually diffuse throughout their medium until eventually all points in the medium are about equal.</p>
<p>Now let's apply this to the topic at hand. Cosmic microwave background radiation (aka CMB, or CMBR) is a weak form of radiation. Think of it as a very faint sort of static that we can see throughout the universe. Whenever we look at empty space - with a radio sensor, not just a telescope - we find this static everywhere we look. No matter how far away, no matter which direction, it's precisely the same everywhere.</p>
<p>For the sake of explanation, let's assume for a moment that the universe is fixed in size and position. Ie, all points are exactly where they have always been. Now modern scientists are pretty confident that the universe is about 13.8 billion years old. I won't go in depth on how we know this, but take it to be true. We also know that the speed of light is constant, and no information can travel faster than that speed. This means that if someone turned on a light 13.8 billion light-years away from us at the beginning of the universe, we on Earth would just be seeing it right now. Points further away than 13.8 billion light-years would have no way of knowing that the light was turned on. The only way to find out would be to wait until that light reaches them.</p>
<p>Here's the weird part. Let's pick two points - one is 13.8 billion light-years away from me, due east, and the other is the same distance due west. Those two points are a total of 27.6 billion light-years away from each other. Since this distance is further than light can travel in the age of the universe, there's no way those two points could possibly have exchanged any information, ever. It's simply not possible.</p>
<p>And yet this radiation seems to have already diffused thoroughly between those two points.</p>
<p>It's important to understand how radical that is. According to the assumptions I've stated, these two points have never been able to exchange information even <em>once.</em> For radiation to have diffused over a space as large as 28 billion light-years, those two points at the edge would need to exchange information oodles and oodles of times. In other words, the process would take billions of billions of billions of years. </p>
<p>Obviously, one explanation of how this is possible is that the universe is much older than 14 billion years. But physicists are quite confident in that age. And a better-fitting answer is that those two points, the ones 27.6 billion light-years apart, were once much closer together. Maybe 10,000 times closer together. This hypothesis states that at one point in time, the entire universe was much smaller, and all points had enough time to exchange information and diffuse radiation. Then the space between them expanded, leading to our apparent problem.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other reasons this explanation works. For example, astronomers have observed galaxies that are 30 billion light-years away from us - despite the fact that the light has only had 14 billion years to travel. This is because those galaxies were much closer to us at the time the light started traveling. </p>
<p>I hope this helps! It became a bit longer than I expected but hopefully it makes at least a little bit of sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>370 km/s in relation to the CMB makes sense, but what does &quot;in the direction of the constellation Leo&quot; mean?  A vector from our current position to Leo's current position?  Where Leo was however many years ago when it emitted the light we are seeing now?  I would assume Leo is moving differently with respect to the CMB than we are, so is this vector only relevant for this snapshot in time?</p>
<p>I guess I would have a similar question to OP, but instead of speed, is there a universal reference direction we can use?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm guessing we are moving towards where we see Leo's constellation. If you are in a car you tell the driver &quot;stop by that car&quot; and not &quot;stop by where that car will be in 6 hours&quot;.</p>
<p>So it's only relevant for this period of time. And the period in which we move towards Leo could be millions of years.</p>
<p>For your second question: another user answered that the CMB looks the same billions of years apart, so you can use a &quot;map&quot; of the CMB to convey direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would think that a cosmic map we're making would take into account the fact that what we're seeing has already moved. But it probably wouldn't matter much anyways because on a galactic scale we're going to continue following the swirl towards leo even as it moves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no universal direction the we know of.  But &quot;from here to that over there&quot; is a perfectly reasonable way to describe a direction, which is what you do when pointing.</p>
<p>It can get a little complicated though due to gravity bending spacetime as exemplified by strong gravitational lensing.  <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/sdss-j1004-4112-crop.jpg" target="_blank">There can be multiple directions that lead to the same object.</a></p></div>		</li>
