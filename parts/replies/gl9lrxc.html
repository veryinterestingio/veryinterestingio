			<div class="markdown"><p>Do ya like cars? Cause I can do a car analogy</p>
<p>A sports car has tighter, shorter suspension than a normal car and especially a big van or truck.</p>
<p>This means it's stiffer, which is good for traction, but bad for comfort.</p>
<p>So, a carbon fiber 1 piece skate will have near 0 flex/deformation. This means that any energy you transfer to it, will be transferred through it, and not absorbed by it.</p>
<p>A leather/metal/cloth composite has plenty of vectors for flexing and deformation. This is lost/wasted energy as it is not being directed where you want it to go. But will be more comfortable.</p>
<p>So your carbon fiber skate is like your sports car. Hard, stiff, built to put that power DOWN and get you MOVING. You're gonna feel every pebble in the road, every crack in the ice.</p>
<p>Your rented skating rink skate is your Hyundai. It's soft, easy to use, it'll get you moving but in a gentle way. It'll absorb those bumps, you'll glide over pebbles and cracks.</p>
<p>Now for some BONUS info. Carbon fiber is the best of both worlds, hardness, and flex. This is what we strive for in a building material. We want it strong enough to hold up, but flexible enough not to shatter/break. The original material? Wood. What's wood? Carbon and resin. What's carbon fiber? Carbon and resin TO THE MAX. In between these two construction giants lies most of the metal alloys we've invented. And all of these materials must be both HARD but FLEXIBLE. For if it's too hard, it'll shatter, if it's too flexible, it'll just flop over and not hold shape.</p>
<p>Carbon fiber has the super mega benefit of being LIGHT WEIGHT too. Which metals struggle with.</p>
<p>This has been your super basic guide to materials we love that are hard and soft in all the right ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why carbon fibre driveshafts are amazing. Less mass but ALSO significantly less rotational inertia which is HUGE when constantly changing speeds. It takes less time to spin it up or down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't speak for skating specifically, but the energy transfer largely comes down to how elastic an interaction is. Objects deform when you apply a force, and exert an equal force back trying to retain their shape, springs are the obvious example. That's simple when you think of forces, but it gets a little more complicated when you think of energy: it takes energy to deform an object, but only some of that energy is available for pushing back.</p>
<p>The simplest example is bouncy balls, drop a rubber ball and a foam ball from the same height and obviously the rubber ball bounces higher; that's a largely elastic collision, nearly all of the kinetic energy is retained and redirected upwards. The foam ball on the other hand loses most of that energy to internal friction and barely bounces at all. </p>
<p>Now think of a golf club, say one is aluminium and the other carbon fiber. You can easily make them both as stiff, so they require the same force to bend them, but the carbon fiber will be more elastic. So as you hit a golf ball the clubs bend back, then they spring forwards again transmitting some of the stored energy into the ball; the carbon golf club will lose less of that energy as friction in shaft, and the ball will go further.</p>
<p>Now, finally, we get to the skates. As you're skating there's a lot of force going through them, so some flex is inevitable, obviously it'll be better if that flex doesn't lose energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The flex is an interesting topic.  If you consider figure skates, which go higher up the ankle and the boot has to hinge/flex where your ankle joint is, getting the CF to flex was a difficult but fun challenge.  I can't say how we did it but it works in ways thats created some very interesting positive side effects!  Most notably the CF after flexing sure wants to return to an upright position creating a vastly improve &quot;spring back&quot; to assist when jumping.  Something traditional skates could do this but at a very limited level.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually, no. High speed photos confirm the club shaft actually rebounds <em>before</em> impact, and that when you strike the ball, the club face is ahead of the shaft, not lagging behind it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Goalie here.
Since switching from plastic cowlings to a carbon fiber one piece boot, I’ve had to dial down my sharpening (3/8 to 5/8). I’ve noticed less flex under my feet when compared to a cowling.</p>
<p>Not the most scientific answer, but hopefully a practical one</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does that affect the loads you put on your joints while playing? Like, do your ankles feel that they're under more pressure, less pressure, or maybe just different pressure? Has it affected your form and techniques?</p>
<p>Sorry for all the questions. I'm a hockey fan who has never played so I'm super curious.</p></div>		</li>
