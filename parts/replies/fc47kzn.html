<p>Fast on geological timescales, that's why we don't have a relevant helium concentration in the atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The truth is a bit in between, gases mix, but on larger scales there are significant concentration differences. At higher temperatures the mixing will be more perfect. It's statistical physics. Gravity tries to separate gases, I.e. the lowest energy state has all heavy gases down and light gases up, but as temperature increases, the thermal fluctuations cause them to mix more and more.</p>
<p>In fact, in a pressurised vessel at high enough temperature, even water and oil will mix.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They also mix better at low temperatures. This is why when you heat (but don’t burn) crude oil it separates out into various hydrocarbons (heavy at the bottom and light at the top).
It’s kind of counter intuitive but it requires energy to get to the low energy state as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really accurate. It's a layer because ozone absorbs uv, so if doesnt reach lower levels. Ozone is created when uv light splits o2 int atomic oxygen which can recombine into o3, ozone. This process normally only happens in the upper layers bbn of the atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't correct. The thermal velocity of helium at STP is 1,250 m/s*. It needs another 10,000 m/s to escape.</p>
<p>* This will be lower in the upper atmosphere due to lower temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is only the mean thermal velocity. Due to the fact that it is spread out over the Boltzmann distribution, there will always be some fraction, albeit very small, that will have escape velocity.</p></div>		</li>
