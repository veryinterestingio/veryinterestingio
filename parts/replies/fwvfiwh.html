			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re probably thinking about transposing instruments, where an instrument doesn’t actually play the pitch written on the staff. In this case, a Bb clarinet would actually play (what’s written as) a C while everyone (specifically concert instruments, like low brass and flutes) would play a Bb. In the end, both the clarinet and other instruments would play a Bb.</p>
<p>What the commenter meant by transposition is probably when the composer writes in straight up the wrong key for your instrument (like for a Bb clarinet, but in concert key without transposing). Then, you’d have to transpose into the correct key, either by rewriting everything (takes longer but is easier to read) or transposing in your head (takes more brainpower but faster for experienced musicians).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, as a keyboard instrument player this is wild for me. So the reason is the composer wants a Bb, he writes a Bb, but for some reason all the players of the given instrument call that same exact pitch a C? What is the reason for this discrepancy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>“when the composer writes in straight up the wrong key for your instrument”</p>
<p>I’m assuming you’re just simplifying why we transpose, but this phrasing bugged me. Competent composers don’t write in the “wrong key” for instruments, they write for standard equipment in the ensembles of their time. Clarinets in C were once common, for example.</p></div>		</li>
