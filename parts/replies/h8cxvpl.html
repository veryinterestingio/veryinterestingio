			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct.  In essentially all of the cars sold today, the &quot;throttle&quot; is actually just a torque request sensor, and the ECU decides how much pedal angle = how much torque.  In normal mode, it might be linear, in eco mode it might be softer at the beginning and catch up later, and in sport mode, it will likely be more aggressive earlier in the throttle range to make it feel more responsive.</p>
<p>As mentioned, many other areas can be adjusted to suit, but throttle is almost always the main area you will notice.</p></div>		</li>

<p>will hold a gear until higher in the RPM band</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To help connect the dots for the non-gearheads out there:   </p>
<p>Internal combustion engines (e.g. gasoline/diesel/etc) produce more power as they spin faster (aka higher RPMs) - as they burn more fuel per second. However, that's usually less efficient. Keeping an IC engine in the higher RPM area is a common way to trade efficiency for performance.   </p>
<p>There's also a number of design choices that can make various RPM bands more powerful, more efficient, etc, depending on what the design goals are.  Big semi-truck diesel engines are usually designed to produce lots of power at very low RPMs, meaning they can efficiently haul heavy loads long distances.</p></div>		</li>
