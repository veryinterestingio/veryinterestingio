<p>And it definitely relates to Guillain-Barre syndrome as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, although Strep throat is caused by bacteria.  The more commonly known heart-related complication of Strep is rheumatic heart disease, which affects the valves of the heart.  </p>
<p>Many viruses and bacteria can precipitate heart disease of some kind.  The chances of those complications happening will vary from case to case, and from pathogen to pathogen.  In some cases, they’ve found correlations between certain treatments and a lowered chance of disease complication.  Strep is one of those—last I looked into it—antibiotic treatment doesn’t necessarily help an otherwise healthy person recover much faster from the infection, but the chance of developing rheumatic fever afterwards is decreased (and the length of time when the patient is contagious reduces too).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Odd question, but would the same be true for strep...ear?</p>
<p>I had strep about a year and a half, two years ago, but it never infected my throat, it was in one of my Eustachian tubes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. I had issues with this when my step throat was misdiagnosed as the flu. Without antibiotics I ended up with a type of arthritis that could damage my heart. The doctor put me on methotrexate (a chemo medication that is given to some arthritis sufferers) for six months. I also just got better from COVID19, but I'm not sure if people with more mild symptoms (just fever, cough, minor breathing issues) are experiencing organ damage.</p>
<p>It's kind of scary that a couple bad infections during my life could damage my heart when I've lived such a healthy lifestyle otherwise.</p></div>		</li>
