<p>Tried to keep it sfw but I’m sure you get what I mean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The skin has a layer of dead cells on top that protects the living skin cells underneath from a variety of things that can damage healthy living cells. </p>
<p>The anus has many micro incisions from well, opening and closing and the friction related to that, so the capsaicin in your stool gets in the tissues and burns. </p>
<p>If you rubbed the skin on your arm slightly raw, then poured hot sauce on it, I can guarantee it will burn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your anus is far more sensitive to the sensation of burning than your arm, because it has more TRPV1 receptors accessible on the surface. Try heating up a spoon and touching it to both and see for yourself. Your arm is still pretty sensitive, if you rub a hot pepper on it you'll feel the burn. It just isn't as sensitive as your anus.</p>
<p>If you ate a meal that upset your stomach, your intestines get rushed and there might be a lot of stomach acid mixed in, which also hurts on the way out.</p></div>		</li>
