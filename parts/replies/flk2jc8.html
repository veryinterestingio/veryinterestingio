			<div class="markdown"><p>Like the coolest thing no one has observed <em>yet</em>? I can barely keep up with the cool stuff people <em>do</em> observe! That sounds like a better question for the crowd: what's the coolest species you cannot find an observation of on iNat?</p>
<p>My collaborators had better ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mary Ford: <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/253699-Bathyteuthis-abyssicola" target="_blank">Deepsea Squid</a></li>
<li>Kelly O'Donnell: <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/58405-Riftia-pachyptila" target="_blank">Giant Tube Worm</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So you know, if anyone happens to be hanging around some hydrothermal vents, make sure you snap some pics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of herps and fish don't have any observations. For example there's a fruit eating tree frog that lives on part of Brazil's coastal rain forests yet there's no observations or even any information and pictures on the internet despite it being such a remarkable animal. It's name is xenohyla if anyone is curious</p></div>		</li>
