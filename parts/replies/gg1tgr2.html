			<div class="markdown"><p>Your emotions are really just another evolutionary adaption. There's no advantage to boredom if your survival strategy relies on doing nothing.</p>
<p>Boredom is essentially the inability to articulate what is a meaningful activity for you right now. It motivates you to change whatever it is you're doing and find something meaningful or productive to do.</p>
<p>That lizard isn't questioning what it should be doing. It's surviving by doing nothing and not wasting energy. Humans on the other hand have so many needs that doing nothing is nearly always the wrong thing to do, so you get bored.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on that, what sorts of sensations and feelings do you have when you start getting bored? Maybe you start being really sensitive of your physical body, things itching, being hot or cold, in a way you don't notice when you've got something on your mind. You also frequently start noticing you are hungry even when you don't really need to eat, or sleepy when you've got enough sleep, or are more conscious of your bladder. And of course if you're bored it's really easy to get horny too.</p>
<p>That's basically running down the entire survival and reproductive needs checklist right there, and it's pretty much hard coded to run in all of our heads as soon as we're not focusing our physical and mental power on something else. Once you're idle again then it's our brain's evolutionary job to once again get us to start taking care of ourselves... or fuck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting tidbit - the climate around a mass extinction event 252 million years ago likely selected warm blooded animals for survival. When there’s no external heat, cold blooded animals can’t survive long.
Our temperature of 98.6°F protected us from fungus and could have been a selection factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a coincidence that dinosaurs and synapsids were the most diverse group of vertebrates after the Permian extinction. And today, modern dinosaurs (birds) and modern synapsids (mammals) keep rulling supreme. </p>
<p>Crocodiles are apex predators, I'm not looking down upon them. But comparing them to the range, survival strategies and behaviour of lions, hyenas, vultures, falcons or orcas? Miles away. But at the same time, force a famine and then see who's standing after six months: the croc or the hyena. </p>
<p>Extinctions are wild.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Crocodilians are trapped big.  Long ago, they were diversely sized, like the critters you mention.  But extinctions.  The croc species which remain, all use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlLuC7257pc&amp;t=2m22s" target="_blank">infrasound calls for mating</a>.  Low frequency, long wavelength sound, that caries for miles.  Great for meeting girls during an extinction event.  But you can't make long wavelength sound if you're short.  So now, shrimpy crocs can't get girls.  Forcing adult male crocs to remain big.  Which rather limits opportunities to diversify lifestyle.  Poor crocs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're mixing a few things up. The rise of warm blooded animals had little to do with the temperature of the world. Plenty of cold blooded species survived.</p>
<p>It once again had to do with the fact that warm blooded animals are faster, more energetic and can operate longer than cold blooded ones as long as they have food. Competition after an extinction event is extremely high because specialists are the first to die during an extinction event.</p>
<p>That means there's a lot of opportunities now vacated for animals to evolve and specialise into. Since a small number of species were already warm blooded, they were better able to compete for these niches and as a result any new comers would have to be just as fast and energetic (ie. warm blooded) or they wouldn't be able to compete and phased out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Their initial development and current status are different topics and happened under very different circumstances, that's true. Though I believe the endothermic resistance to environmental effects is one of the key components a successful generalist/cosmopolite species needs. The rise of human dominance would have taken a lot longer if they had evolved exothermic and been pushed out of their range regularly by the ice ages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard an interesting theory on why warm blooded creatures really took off after the dinosaurs. Basically the planet was colder after the asteroid and with so many dead plants and animals, fungus' had a huge boom. Most fungus' can't infect a warm blooded creatures because they die at ~35C and above but they can infect cold blooded creatures if they don't warm up enough. So fungus decimated the cold blooded animals with infections which severely slowed their rebound from the asteroid. No idea how much validity there is to that theory but interesting nonetheless.</p></div>		</li>
