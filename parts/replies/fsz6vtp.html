			<div class="markdown"><p>You know why I hated chemistry? This right here.</p>
<p>It's not really their fault. The deeper you go into it, the closer you get to the boundary of what we understand. We still don't <em>really</em> know exactly how subatomic particles work, we just have a bunch of models.</p>
<p>This is why I went into Mathematics. You can always trace a line from assumptions to results.</p></div>		</li>
