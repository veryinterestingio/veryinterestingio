			<div class="markdown"><p>And this principal (less stretch = more efficient = less heat) also applies to tires.  Tires deform when a load is applied to them creating a slip angle or slip ratio when a lateral or longitudinal load is applied, respectively.  The higher the stiffness of the tire in these directions, the lower the slip angle/ratio that's generated, and the lower heat generated through friction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It just occurred to me this might be a factor in why increasing tyre pressure increases fuel economy.  I previously thought it was solely a function of amount of rubber on the road (with increased pressure changing the contact profile)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First a terminology thing, conversely to how we normally use the word &quot;elastic collisions&quot; are ones in which <del>there's no deformation and</del> net momentum and kinetic energy of the colliding objects stays the same (think two perfect pool balls colliding and rebounding on a frictionless pool table in a vacuum).</p>
<p>Inelastic collisions are ones in which some of the energy is lost to the surroundings. This can be in many ways, sound, heat, deformation, and fracturing. Fracturing is actually an extremely good way of dispersing energy, this is why part bullet proof vests are made up of hard ceramic plates that are designed to fracture when struck by a bullet (if they instead underwent a perfectly elastic collision all of the force of the bullet would still be transfered to the body, spread out over the area of the plate) and why cars have &quot;crumple zones&quot;- parts of the car (usually the front in front of the driver) designed to crumple under impact dissipating the energy of the crash (also a reason why people seem to think modern cars are made more cheaply cause they always look super crushed after accidents)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Elastic collision doesn't mean no deformation, just that the deformation is... elastic. The &quot;elastic&quot; regime of deformation of a material is the &quot;small&quot;, linear, &quot;lossless&quot; region near the start of the stress/strain curve. Generally, the more you deform something, the more losses you will incur. If you had an ideally linear elastic material, you could deform quite a lot and still e lossless.</p>
<p>There is no fundamental definition for how much energy needs to be lost for an interaction to be considered inelastic. Even two point charges colliding will lose some energy to Bremsstrahlung radiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you mean by &quot;compression characteristics&quot; if not pressure? The force resisting deformation of the ball's surface, and hence contributing to its rebounding, <em>is</em> the pressure inside the ball.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not especially so, until you get into bounces where the speed of sound in the material and interior gas happen to have some synergy.</p></div>		</li>
