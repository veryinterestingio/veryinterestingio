<p>it's about taking a copy of oneself and being able to effortlessly place it in the past present and future, create a narrative, and generate emotions and feelings. Lack of this mental time travel ability is part of the reason why chimpanzees take so long to learn things, is that they can't ratchet up their knowledge so to speak. Many things have to be relearned again and again before they stick whereas humans tend to remember effective strategies a lot more efficiently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dr. Julian Jaynes referred to this mental copy of the self which can be excerpted and placed in an analog space as the Analog I. It's an essential part of abstract thought, or perhaps the reason abstract thought is possible. Jane Goodall, who is considered by many to be the leading expert on chimpanzees (which are the closest living relative of humans), has studied primates extensively over half a century and had this to say about the usage of language by chimps: “What’s the one obvious thing we humans do that [chimps] don’t do? Chimps can learn sign language, but in the wild, so far as we know, they are unable to communicate about things that aren’t present. They can’t teach what happened 100 years ago, except by showing fear in certain places. They certainly can’t plan for five years ahead. If they could, they could communicate with each other about what compels them to indulge in their dramatic displays. To me, it is a sense of wonder and awe that we share with them. When we had those feelings, and evolved the ability to talk about them, we were able to create the early religions.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Who decided 3 years old was the age? I understand certain human tasks they don't do but in my opinion they are still smarter than 3 year old. If you leave a 3 year old in the jungle they probably wouldn't be able to survive. They have more complex abilities in their own way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there's no &quot;opinion&quot; to measure smarts, think of it as the stats of dungeons and dragons. Intelligence is a measure of someone's direct book smarts, how much they can recall learnt information and use it, wisdom is the ability to pick up on things, assess situations and figure out the best way forward. An ape as you say is able to pick up on the situation they are in and how best to survive, because of its survival instinct, or &quot;Wisdom&quot; that doesn't make them smart, as a plant is not smart for absorbing energy from the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would wager that a 3 year old human who had been raised in the jungle would do just fine there by himself. Certainly at least as well as a chimp of the same level of development. (I don't know enough about chimps and their lifespan/development schedule to know what age that would be).</p></div>		</li>
