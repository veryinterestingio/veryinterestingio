			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact! This is the precise reason you shouldn’t stand for long periods with your knees locked, with your knees bent a bit you’re constantly readjusting your weight, causing your muscles to help to push blood back towards your heart.</p>
<p>If you stand with your knees locked blood pools into your lower legs, eventually starving your brain for blood and causing you to faint, but once you’re on the ground the blood isn’t fighting gravity anymore and you quickly regain consciousness</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being in a uniform group in my secondary school days, this happens a lot as we would need to stand at attention for prolonged periods. What we teach juniors is to wriggle your toes to get some blood moving and it really helps as that gets the muscles moving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Soldiers kinda sway side to side a tiny bit to avoid the blood pooling thing but like you said, wiggling toes works fine too. You really don't need a lot, just a tiny bit of muscle contraction will start moving the blood through the body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, muscle contraction squeezes blood in the veins in the legs against the force of gravity. If you were to stand still for a while, you would definitely get circulation problems.</p></div>		</li>
