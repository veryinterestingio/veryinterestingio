			<div class="markdown"><p>Star Wars: The Old Republic struggles to this day because they chose the Hero engine prior to its formal release. They got early access to the code and made such immense changes to it such that they can't use the release version of it anymore.</p>
<p>Can't find a great reference right now on mobile but there is a good writeup about it on the internet. I'll find it if there's interest.</p>
<p><a href="http://dulfy.net/2018/08/22/swtor-former-developer-daniel-erickson-talks-game-development/" target="_blank">SWTOR Former Developer Daniel Erickson said</a> &quot;Hero Engine:Â That engine. Whew. When I wrote the book on the making of the game I tried to get our original lead engineer, Bill Dalton, to talk about HeroEngine and the lawyers removed every other word he said so I had to ditch the section.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, the story I've heard was not only that they were heavily modifying an alpha/beta version of Hero engine before its release: They were expressly warned against doing it by the creators of the engine, since it was never designed for something as expansive as an MMO. They were told to shut up and take my money...</p>
<p>So Bioware basically made their own bed and shit in it.</p>
<p>To this day, the optimal way to play the game is in a RAM disk, and there is a utility that automagically adjusts the Symlinks to the necessary files before running and after exiting the game.</p>
<p>As opposed to Anthem where some blame can be laid at the feet of Bioware, but they were essentially Voluntold to use Frostbite and every iteration of the game was found to be unfeasible in the engine after a moderate amount of time investment.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's wrong. Hero Engine was designed for MMOs from the start: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeroEngine" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeroEngine</a></p>
<p>HeroEngine is a 3D game engine and server technology platform originally developed by Simutronics Corporation specifically for building MMO-style games.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that Frostbite was unfeasible, is that the game had no direction or scope. They kept mucking about with concepts and features for years until EA had to reign them in.</p>
<p>I would've given them a tiny pass for the engine troubles if they hadn't developed the gargantuan Mass Effect Andromeda beforehand. Anthem is like a tiny baby compared to that. There's no way they weren't familiar with the engine at that point. Plus, plenty of multiplayer projects were already done on the engine, so it's not like they were reinventing the wheel.</p>
<p>Once again, &quot;Bioware basically made their own bed and shit in it.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SWTOR graphics make me cringe. I mean it looks alright but I tried to get back into it after playing KOTOR 1 and 2 again but the graphics didn't make it feel like star wars instead it felt like generic sci-fi mmo with story.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! I played the original Star Wars Galaxies back in 05-06 (before the huge update that changed everything). The graphics sucked compared to what we have now and it was hard! I had already left the game by the time the first Jedi appeared and I played the game for a while!</p>
<p>I tried to play TOR about  years ago or so and I just couldn't get into it <em>at all</em>. Nothing like the old KOTOR which I loved. Very generic mmo as the above me stated</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was cool when devs would write .plan files where they would actually document the day to day development including huge engine issues like this. This was only companies that were mostly self-made like id, and 3drealms. I don't follow gaming enough today, but I would imagine those kind of posts are much more sanitized nowadays.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Crytek had a similar problem with crysis 1. They expected 10ghz CPUs and expected GPUs to get 300%+ faster by the time of their release. Instead we got multi-core CPUs at lower frequency and it took years before single GPUs were fast enough to handle it at 60fps with max settings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you sure they expected that? If so they were seemingly not very understanding of the hardware, as it was clear that CPUs would not hit 10GHz.</p>
<p>Also most of the speed increases have come from die shrinks and better architectures. CPU frequency is pretty useless at comparing anything but CPUs on the same node and architecture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC several big games from this era bet on powerful single core setups instead of multi core. EQ2 and WoW both did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was back in the 2000s, when CPU frequency was increasing rapidly. It wasn't until nodes started getting much smaller that serious power leak problems started showing up and massacring efficiency as frequency increased. Intel infamously claimed they would have 10ghz chips shipped out by 2005.</p>
<p>Crysis released right around the time frequencies dropped and more cores were added in with core2duo and Phenom, so not only did the bet not pay off, they basically timed it right as next gen CPUs turned to parallelization.</p></div>		</li>
