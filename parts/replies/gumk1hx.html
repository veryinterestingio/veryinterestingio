<p>It was a software compatibility issue that Sony quickly updated in 2013-2014, after some serious complaining by the customers. The same “software” issues are also to blame for the lack of compatibility... and yeah, it’s a money thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're thinking of it wrong. It's not like they purposefully crippled the ability to read CDs. The spacing between the &quot;tracks&quot; and between the pits (representing 1's and 0's) are very different between CD's and say, DVD's for instance.</p>
<p>Spacing between the loops of the spirals:</p>
<ul>
<li>CD = 1.6 micrometre</li>
<li>DVD = 0.74 micrometre</li>
</ul>
<p>Spacing between the pits:</p>
<ul>
<li>CD = 0.834 micrometre </li>
<li>DVD = 0.4 micrometre</li>
</ul>
<p>So you would have to proactively add another laser diode capable of reading that format, plus including the proper programming to make it work. Very little financial incentive to do so, when CD is pretty much a dead format.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The spacing isn't really a problem, if you can read smaller, you can read bigger as well physically. The issue is the laser wavelength, which is why blueray won't register CD pits at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>because the colour of the laser used to read the disc is different. the laser used for blurays and dvds is different (usually a UV or blue light laser) than the red / IR laser used to read CDs</p></div>		</li>

<p>While <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/forbiddensnacks/" target="_blank">all of this</a> <em>looks</em> edible, none of it is. A CD and a Blueray are, for all intents and purposes, just as technologically different as an VHS and an SD card, even though they might look similar.<br />
And yes, while there may be devices out there that can read all CDs, DVDs and Bluerays, Sony has no interest in backwards compatibility (especially if it <em>increases</em> production cost). Any small bit and bite they might feign is just marketing, they don't actually care.<br />
Also, as another poster here mentioned, <em>reading</em> the medium isn't the biggest problem. The device probably wouldn't know what to do with the data anyway, since it was written for another platform entirely and would either have to be ported or emulated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it doesn't because it can't. Personally I clicked on this because I wondered why they haven't done it. I would like to know if it's (mostly) because of additional hardware costs or because there is money to be made selling old games again.</p></div>		</li>
