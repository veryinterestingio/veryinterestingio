			<div class="markdown"><p>this is a pretty good explanation.</p>
<p>The reason materials reflect different wavelengths of light has to do with what energy levels it's electrons are at - because electrons can only exist at certain discrete energy levels, only photons of energy equal to (and to some extent above) the difference between the electron's energy level and it's next available level can be absorbed. All the other photons will pass through because the electrons can't use them to jump to a valid energy level. </p>
<p>Materials you think of as transparent are generally only transparent <em>in the visible part</em> of the light spectrum, and are opaque to many other wavelengths (and the reverse is true too).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Google transmission spectrum of fused silica, silicon, ZnSe, and sapphire. Each has a very different &quot;band gap&quot; that determines it's &quot;band&quot; of transparency. The areas of absorption are where the light is interacting with electrons. Visible light is ~400-750nm (when you're young your eyes will detect ~380-810nm or so but still mostly in the other area), UV has shorter more energetic wavelengths, and infrared the higher less energetic wavelengths, for reference.
Reflection is a different story (they're interested but to keep things simple). Reflection is based on a material's indeed of refraction. All materials have one and it changes with wavelength. It's only when a material is polished that you can see something that looks like a reflection. This is why granite countertops can look like mirrors. It's essentially glass (material wise) but it has a lot of dissolved and suspended contaminants that interact with visible light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answers! If you want to dig a little deeper on colors vs. opacity, note that colors have several causes other than absorption (for example the color in soap bubbles and rainbows is from interference, not atomic/molecular absorption). If you are interested, read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color" target="_blank">wikipedia page on color</a> and you can follow deeper links from there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good answer, but incomplete. This explanation only explains the behavior of prefect single crystals, but opacity is also a function of extrinsic properties such as thickness, because all materials have some light absorption. </p>
<p>Furthermore, scattering plays a big role in opacity. For example, you will see that a plastic bag is opaque but if you stretch it it becomes clear. This is because the polymer chains become more aligned when stretched and &quot;crystal&quot; like.  When they are disordered, the disorganized polymers refract and scatter the light even though the light has poor absorption. Each incident absorbs a bit of light, until now you have a polymer which light cannot pass through (for its thickness).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your question has plagued scientists for centuries. </p>
<p>If you are prepared to put some time into understanding how light actually works, I recommend watching Feynmans lectures on QED. Its hard to really convey how weird light really is, but Feynman does an amazing job.</p></div>		</li>
