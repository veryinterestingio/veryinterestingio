			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ll defend it to the end, brown is my favorite color. It’s the color of poo, sure, but it’s the color of chocolate. It’s the color of tree bark, healthy soil, beautiful wood furniture, leather, and coffee. I like brown clothing. I just find the color comforting. That being said, there’s something about brown ink that is unappealing, maybe it looks like poo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My 4-year-old nephew informed me a few weeks back that brown was his favorite color. My first thought was how unusual that was, before realizing that I too think it's a really cool color. It had never even registered to me as an option for &quot;Favorite Color&quot; until he said it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe because black is associated with seriousness, funerals and the morbid? Whereas brown is still a serious colour, but not <em>that</em> serious. Plus brown also comes in more shades so you get more variety</p></div>		</li>

<p>Could also be related to faxes and scanners. Black scans the best.</p></div>		</li>

<p>According to a nurse friend, blue pens are used in the medical field to identify originals of forms, since copiers will turn it black when copied.</p></div>		</li>
