<p>What people don't realize is that antibodies bind to their targets partially even if they aren't a perfect match, but are close. Effectiveness fades gradually before it falls off a cliff to 0.</p>
<p>Now if a mutation causes the virus to bind to ACE2 more efficiently, enter the cell more quickly, or replicate faster, then the spread within the body will be faster and the viral load higher. But the immune system of a vaccinated person will already have a close match, so if that is the starting point for the somatic hypermutation to generate new antibodies, the immune system should ramp up more quickly than someone who has never been exposed.</p>
<p>It's an arms race.</p></div>		</li>
