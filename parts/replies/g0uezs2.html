			<div class="markdown"><p>The question isn't sample size, but how u obtain it. Imagine I ask u to sample the ocean. A large volumetric sample could be statistically valid, but if ur only sampling the North American shores, ur gonna miss a lot of stuff</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't prison inmates be a reasonable sample? In some prisons they did testing of the whole population. It's not ideal since it has strong gender and age bias, but those are factors that are easy to control for if you have a large enough base. Gender bias would be much harder to control for, given how few non-segregated prisons exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s funny because we don’t even really look at testing as a statistical sample. In the US yesterday roughly 600,000 tests were done and we found 55,318 positive tests.
If you looked at this more as a statistical sample, with such a high positive result you would assume that there are a lot more new cases out in the broader population not being tested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a high probability that the real number of cases is several times higher to the confirmed number. Spain’s seroprevalence study found antibodies in around 5% of the population (~2.45 million people), and there were around 270.000 cases back when the studio was published.</p>
<p>In the US, it was reported that there are <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2768834" target="_blank">six to twenty-four times more people with antibodies </a> than confirmed cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe this extrapolation is limited by the population being self-selected. I imagine motivations for getting a test would include not feeling well and recent exposure to an infected person, which would increase the probability of a positive test. However, motivations might include non-biasing ones like needing one for work.</p></div>		</li>
