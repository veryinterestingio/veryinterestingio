			<div class="markdown"><p>That is sort of the premise of the movie yes, that language itself may be limiting our way of thought, which is true to some degree. For example, if there weren't two different words for jealousy and envy, we would have a hard time figuring out they are different feelings (most people still find it hard to pinpoint the exact difference between the two) and plenty of other examples exist, especially when comparing vocabulary and syntax between distinct languages. However, Arrival goes very science-fiction with the abilities the new language would bring (seeing the future), and that is meant to be taken symbolically, not literally ! Don't expect superhuman abilities from learning new languages :D</p>
<p>Edit: spelling</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's already a lot of interesting studies regarding this:</p>
<p>Russian has different words for a lighter blue and a darker blue color. To an English speaker, they're both classified as blue, but to a Russian, they're completely different colors. Seems insignificant, until it comes to varying shades of blue, where a Russian can more easily spot the difference between two similar shades compared to an English speaker. </p>
<p>Aboriginal people in Australia don't have words for &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot;, instead they use cardinal directions as reference. So, &quot;the tree is west of the rock&quot; instead of &quot;the tree is to the right of the rock&quot;. Because of this, they have a sense of direction that is superior to speakers of other languages. They just have an innate sense of which way is north/south/east/west that other people don't have. </p>
<p>These are all relatively small differences, though. It's hard to say we'd become &quot;super humans&quot;, but that's effectively the premise of Arrival. A language so advanced, that it goes beyond what we can currently comprehend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Japanese used to call green blue. Like, the grass was just blue to them until they came up with the word midori, which translates properly as green.</p>
<p>Even today some will stil use aoi (blue) to describe things that are clearly green instead of midori. Dictionaries will also translate aoi as blue and green simultaneously. I have no idea what this means, but its pretty funny.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Frame of reference is really cool, and one of the domains of language considered to be Whorfian (where people's thinking is influenced by their language). I knew I was going to be a Terry Pratchett fan when I found out that people on the Discworld don't use compass directions like we do on our globe. Instead, their absolute frame of reference is Hubward (towards the centre of the Disc), Rimward (towards the edge of the Disc), Turnwise (in the same direction the Disc turns) and Widdershins (the opposite direction to the way the Disc turns).</p>
<p>This blew my mind because some languages of island-bound people have this kind of frame of reference, like &quot;coastward&quot; and &quot;landward&quot; as directions, so it's completely natural that people living on a disc-shaped world would have a frame of reference that relates to a spinning disc. It's such an amazing detail that makes the Discworld feel real, and an example of how much care Terry Pratchett took in his worldbuilding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im someone who moved to the NL from poland at the age of 11 (21 now) so I can kinda answer that.</p>
<p>Its because things you say and listen to in a specific language shape how you use it and it was shown that cerain actions change how you feel. For example if you do something while smiling you will have better time than doing it while frowning despite doing the exaxt same action (mindfield from vsauce michael on yt had episode about it, great show). </p>
<p>I was always super self concious about my ability to speak dutch so I was always saying things pretty quiet and fast when I talk dutch. Now everyone says that I am super nice when I speak dutch and very polite (like, to the extreme)</p>
<p>So TL;DR you learn to speak a certain way and it makes you feel a cerain way when you talk. If you learned to speak english in a very polite way the chances are you are very polite when speaking it, and the other way around too</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I notice I often use the language that is most practical in the audience. For example, English is my most advanced language and the one I use for thinking about myself or something academic. However, if I am anticipating something involving my family, I will switch to my native language and think about the context in those terms. I don't think this is some firm rule though and probably a product of my own way of categorizing thoughts and people.</p></div>		</li>
