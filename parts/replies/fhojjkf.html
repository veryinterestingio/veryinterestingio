			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of mammals do this as well. Wolves especially. Humans copied that evolutionary trait to make really efficient heat exchangers. You have the warm fluid go one way and the cold fluid go the opposite way.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. It’s called a counter current system, same principle that kidneys rely on.</p>
<p>Basically they let their feet get cold, and use the warm arterial blood supply to warm up the cold blood from the feet before it cools down their whole body.</p>
<p>That’s why they can get frozen toes if they stand on cold surfaces for too long.</p>
<p>A lot of polar birds like snowy owls have heavily feathered feet to add some insulation. Penguins don’t because it would make them slip on the ice too much so they just use restricted blood flow and counter current systems to keep their feet just above freezing temps</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since that’s been brought up, it’s ‘veins’ in English, and English quotation marks are like “this” or ‘this’ - but I suppose that’s more of a pain to switch from a non-English keyboard. But nobody really cares, and they’ll realise what you mean. Interesting answer!</p></div>		</li>
