			<div class="markdown"><p>At the undergrad level, likely molecular biology, though that class often mostly focuses on the molecular biology of DNA and RNA. In biochemistry or plant biology classes you may also hit on transport molecules and aspects of amino acid metabolism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of these processes you describe, sounds like the cell just sometimes replaces sulfur with selenium, if it is around, like in the amino acids. I assume because it behaves somewhat similar and is just kind of there. Is that fair to say, or are there specific known functions for seleno-cysteine and seleno-methionine?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Selenocysteine is a much stronger reducing agent than cysteine, and it's an important component of some antioxidant enzymes. Replacing the Sec codon with cysteine can make these enzymes nonfunctional. Cells carefully control how much of these amino acids get into proteins though,  because they're very reactive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The incorporation  of selenocystein is not random, it follows a specific mechanism. It is formed not by direct replacement of S in Cys, but rather by the selenation of Ser bound to a specific tRNA, which then needs some rather peculiar mRNA acrobatics to actually get incorporated. In the case of Met, it's more random, but doesn't matter as much.</p></div>		</li>
