			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the excellent summary. A few years ago I was in therapy for sleep-related reasons and one of the things that turned me off was the claim that lucid dreaming doesn't exist.</p>
<p>It can be fun (whee I can sort-of fly!) but what sucks is the false awakenings and teeth falling out nightmares...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to Lucid Dream all the time as a kid. I would choose if I wanted to hang out with the Ghostbusters or Ninja turtles that night.</p>
<p>Mamaged to do it once several years ago, briefly. Managed to turn a nightmare about crashing a car into flying, which was cool, but then I woke up shortly after. Sigh...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I spent a few months training to have lucid dreams. The training had 2 parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Recording/reviewing dreams in a journal as soon as you wake up while the memory is fresh.</li>
<li>Mentally tracing your body while falling asleep, until you get a tingling sensation. Then imagining pulling yourself outward/upward by climbing an imagined rope anchored at the belly.</li>
</ol>
<p>The pulling motion usually only 'kicked' me directly into dreams with vivid recall, but usually without conscious control. As I practiced my dreams became so vivid they felt real.</p>
<p>The lucid dreams I had basically every night usually began as normal dreams and then I'd notice a detail that <em>can't</em> be real and with a slight jolt, I would gain conscious freedom to explore the dream.</p>
<p>Flight was really common in mine. Really easy to fly horizontally, but losing/gaining altitude always took so much effort ;-; I tried phasing through walls or ceilings a few times, and that was fun but extremely difficult! Transforming things was easy, but they usually still followed the dream's script so interaction was kinda dull.</p>
<p>Very glad that I seem immune to teeth dreams. But anyplace that was basement-like was ominous. So many dreams interrupted when creatures lurking in basement areas caught up to me...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding some anecdotal onto this:</p>
<p>I am very aware of the process of falling asleep. My control over individual trains of thought begin to slip away as though my brain runs on auto pilot. Time starts passing strangely, where one thought takes a couple of minutes to consider, but I can feel that many minutes, up to an hour or more, have passed.</p>
<p>It's exactly as you say, it's not like a switch flips, it's more like the symptoms of sleep gradually get stronger until you lose consciousness entirely.</p>
<p>It's also why lucid dreaming is hard. You can influence the dreams with your choices, but your thoughts are so strange that your normal wills and desires kinda get mixed into the dream version.</p></div>		</li>
