			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to this, especially for smaller sharks like a dogfish, octopuses are very strong for their size and are venomous. It'd be very easy for a GPO to grab, restrain and chomp down on anything smaller than them. It depends on how sensitive the shark is to the venom as to what kills them first: drowning, venom, or just straight up getting eaten alive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Octopi &amp; squid beaks are extremely hard and resistant to fractures, even more so than many industrial metals. Though bite damage depends mostly on the species- Humboldt squids have large beaks that would cut through a few inches of flesh and bone with ease. Where as a pet cuttlefish for example likely wouldn’t break the skin unless they’re threatened </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the bite that's strong, although the bite isn't 'weak' ,and they do have a hard beak... It's just their entire body is muscles, suction cups, brains and a beak, so it's reasonable to think they're crazy smart and strong for their size as the entire body is just basically eight arms.   </p></div>		</li>

<p>On the other hand, I've seen several times where an octopus has forced its tentacles into the sharks gills... What's that about? It that a method of drowning?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Their nervous system is much more spread out than most other creatures, 2/3rds of their brain matter is in fact in their arms, so it's likely that the central brain is telling all the arms to &quot;strangle&quot; and the arms themselves are determining how to follow that order by feeling alone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you seem pretty knowledgeable about the octopus life..</p>
<p>Do they kill the sharks to eat or is this more of just playing to them to entertain themselves? Are there “bullies” in their species? I would imagine these ones in the aquarium could potentially get bored in captivity and could contribute to killing something just to keep them mentally stimulated?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really good question. I almost included in the original post that I thought it was likely the octopus was just bored, not actually “hunting” in the sense of appetite fulfillment. I am not aware if the octopus ate the carcasses of the sharks, but I would hazard a guess that they did not. Aquariums that put different species together in shared tanks keep the animals really well fed to minimize instances of them snacking on each other. Octopuses are extremely intelligent, and most intelligent animals display unusual behaviors in captivity. Sharks are not the normal prey of octopus (they eat clams, mussels, fish, fish eggs, etc). It’s also not the first time an octopus has displayed extraordinary behavior while in captivity: <a href="https://www.peta.org/features/5-times-octopuses-made-headlines/" target="_blank">https://www.peta.org/features/5-times-octopuses-made-headlines/</a>
PS sorry to link to PETA, they’re ridiculous, but it is a fun article</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the wild most instances of such behaviour are the other way around; an octopus defending itself from sharks trying to hunt it. </p>
<p><em>Blue Planet II</em> has an episode on kelp forests which features an octopus trying to escape sharks. Neither species is especially large within the broader scientific family (the sharks only maybe 4-5 feet long, the octopus smaller), so not quite the giant Pacific octopus for example as above. </p>
<p>First the octopus wraps itself in rocks and shells to try and appear as a fixture of the reef, and it confuses but doesn’t entirely deter the sharks, so the octopus inks and moves away quickly to break line of sight. </p>
<p>When one of the sharks find it again it wraps its arms around the shark’s head and puts one arm into each of the shark’s gills to block all flow in/out, preventing it getting oxygen. The second the shark lets go of the octopus, the octopus does likewise and jets off again while the shark is momentarily stunned catching its breath. </p></div>		</li>
