<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>That thermal energy is then gradually lost into space as black body radiation, which if the collission was not very energetic will be infra red light.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have a kind of weird hobby where I make working scale models of black powder artillery. Anyway, I was testing a model down at the gun range that shoots aluminum bullets of about 3/4&quot; in diameter. I shot one at a steel plate to see how it would deform and when I found it, it was so hot I couldn't hold it. The bullets recovered from the dirt berm were completely cool to the touch, so it wasn't heat from the gunpowder. A pretty neat first hand way to see how deforming metal causes it to get hot.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Contrary to what many people seem to think, infrared light has no exclusive relation to heat or temperature. It's just that blackbody radiation is mostly on the lower energy spectrum, and that for most everyday temperatures (&lt; 1000 K) there's no significant energy being emitted in the visible spectrum or higher energy/lower wavelength, so it's mostly infrared.</p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Black_body.svg/1024px-Black_body.svg.png" target="_blank">See this graph</a> for a clear depiction of this. Energy increases towards the left and decreases towards the right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is why things tend to start glowing when they get hot enough, like in a light bulb, because the spectrum has shifted enough towards shorter wavelenghts for the light in the visible range to be detected (by our eyes).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Infrared light is commonly thought of synonymous with thermal because of blackbody spectra near room temperature. The sun peaks in the visible. The cosmic background is microwaves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, I can work with this. So &quot;heat&quot; is given off in part through infrared, but not entirely, and diminishes to a microwave wavelength, but is all emitted through the electro-magnetic spectrum? Do I have this right?</p></div>		</li>
