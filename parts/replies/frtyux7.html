			<div class="markdown"><p>it’s interesting to think about the body’s ability to self regulate when there is an excess/lack of certain components in the blood, and how some of these regulations can backfire. using COPD as an example, the body actually induces right heart failure because the patient chronically has low blood O2 levels, and the body doesn’t stop producing red blood cells because of this, as tissue oxygenation is extremely important. chronic polycythemia= right sided heart failure if left unchecked. this reaction from the body makes perfect sense, increase oxygen carrying capacity in the blood to increase blood O2 content, but there is too much of a good thing, and the body does not stop creating more RBCs despite the resulting heart failure.</p></div>		</li>
