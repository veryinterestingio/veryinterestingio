<p>ELI5 translation:  Every pound you put on a rocket for lift-off costs a LOT of $$$.  When you add up the weight of a rover, plus the junk (rockets, balloons, parachutes, etc) to get it down to the planet or moon you want to land on, and <em>then</em> add in a way to slow down enough to reach the planet safely - tons and TONS of extra rocket fuel - it's anywhere from about 6x-20x more expensive to do a landing and rover than it is to just flyby and let some good sensors do their job from far above.</p>
<p>Plus, a lot of places we want to learn more about don't have good surfaces for landing on.  Venus is crazy hot, for example and landers only last a few minutes.  It's hot enough on the surface of Venus to melt iron!</p>
<p>The other thing is that it takes years to get to some of the planets from Earth, so we have to send some eyeballs first to check things out so we can decide if and how we can land on some of the more interesting places.  Lots of landings and probes are coming, but we still don't know enough about some of the planets and their moons to decide how to land there yet.</p>
<p>Some probes we already have out there will let us plan more lander missions, but for now, we have to do our best with being a lookie-loo at the planets and moons we can get to!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, slight correction.   The surface temperature of Venus is an average of 462C. It can, in places, melt lead (467C), but not iron (1538C). Still very hot though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add a miniscule correction. Much like the World Trade Center buildings, steel (or iron) doesn't need to reach its actual melting point before it structurally fails. Once it gets hot enough to start bending under the weight above it, it's all over.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is quite important.</p>
<p>When Cassini went to Saturn, it had a bunch of research objectives involving Saturn, its rings and some of its more interesting moons. Enceladus wasn't even on that list. (This is not an exact analogy because Cassini entered orbit and even put the Huygens lander down on Titan, but it can be considered a &quot;flyby&quot; in some respects because Saturn is an entire system in itself with a bunch of moons - we didn't just fly to Titan and land there to the exclusion of all else).</p>
<p>But it quickly became apparent from the more general survey (and particularly the magnetic field instruments) that Enceladus was doing something really odd. The mission was significantly rebuilt, basically on an orbit-by-orbit basis to do fly-bys as close at 49km to Enceladus, where they discovered a liquid ocean beneath the icy crust and plumes of water being jetted out into space (probably forming Saturn's E-ring).</p>
<p>The point is, if you don't know a lot about where you're going (and we <em>don't</em> know that much about the outer planets), it doesn't do to be too specific too early and pin the entire mission on landing a specific vehicle on a specific moon to carry out three specific experiments or something. Use that mass for a much broader range of experiments and instruments and leave yourself with lots of manoeuvring fuel to go check out anything wildly interesting that didn't become apparent until you got there.</p>
<p>Sending out pathfinding missions like that is far more efficient to recce suitable targets before you send dedicated missions to boring places (okay, there are no boring places, but some places are more interesting than others!).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, you should give The Kerbal Space Program a try if games are a thing for you. It gives you a great appreciation of what it takes just to get to orbit or the Mum (Moon) let alone a planet or do a lander mission. </p>
<p>I once sent two probes to a planet in the outer solar system. I sent them within two days of each other but the second probe was late and missed the transition window.  (My bad) It ended up slowly chasing down the planet and took nearly 3x the time to get into orbit as the first probe. Point being, one small mistake = huge consequences.</p></div>		</li>
