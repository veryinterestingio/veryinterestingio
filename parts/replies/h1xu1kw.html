			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually think this is one of science's biggest  challenges in the world today. The level of knowledge in this is so far above the level of comprehension of an average human that trying to explain its concepts simply is too hard. I think it takes a great level of genius to simplify such a complex theorem, I'm really impressed ( I'm not a physicist and I understood what he said)</p>
<p>We have such a problem nowadays with fighting misinformation about things like climate change, vaccines etc. I think people are more convinced by simple lies they hear on facebook than hearing complicated facts from scientists. Maybe if we dumbed things down for people, they may actually listen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a 2018 MIT opencourseware lecture from Patrick Winston where the speaker highlights how strongly we humans are story-tellers. I was a bit surprised that an A.I. researcher is telling some very bright engineers and scientists that, when they have big ideas, they still also need to know how to weave those ideas into a story so that other humans will appreciate them. (At least, if you want recognition in Your lifetime)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many people break down scientific disciplines into primary research, applied research, and extension.</p>
<p>The extension scientists are the ones who are supposed to be taking the knowledge and applications to the masses, communicating and finding the ways to make science work for people. They are the story tellers, they are the educators. They brighten the dark corners of the world.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>you're asking newtonian physics questions for quantum- physics phenomena.</p>
<p>your question doesn't really mean anything.</p>
<p>even in newtonian physics we have inertia. an object in motion will continue that motion forever unless there's an external force that changes the motion.</p>
<p>so in the absence of friction for example, if you spin an object it will continue to spin forever at the same rate. it doesn't need any energy to keep spinning.</p>
<p>and concepts like friction don't really exist at the quantum level.</p>
<p>these are the fundamental particles that make up all matter.</p>
<p>if they stopped &quot;spinning&quot; or their speed changed in time, we wouldn't be here. the universe as we know it wouldn't exist.</p></div>		</li>
