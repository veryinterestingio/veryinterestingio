<p>I believe this is done so that fast bowlers don't get sauce stuck in their moustaches.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>actually modern sauce bottles have an anus-like opening which allows you to decently dispense the contents</p>
<p>you don't really need a nozzle</p>
<p>Edit : I refrained from using the word sphincter as its not really in the shape of a sphincter, more like a cardiac valve as some said
The intended functionality of those dispensers is identical to our anus is what i meant</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can attest to the mustard volcano. I got some organic mustard recently that's packaged like normal flip top ketchup. I had it top down (because it's designed as such) and when I turned it over and opened it, a lot of mustard decided to say hello to the world and I wasn't even squeezing the darn thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I don’t dispute the mechanics in your post, the rest makes no sense at all. </p>
<p>1) you don’t have to refrigerate mustard, so we’ve already come to an impasse</p>
<p>2) even if that were true you’ve not given any reason that mustard is uniquely susceptible to this temperature phenomenon or why it alone still posses this trait</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have to reject your answer as it does not adequately answer the question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess in my haste to finish the comment quickly I missed that part. It's not that it's uniquely susceptible to the problem, it's that mustard was uniquely packaged differently from other condiments sooner. Ketchup and mayonnaise and relish and other condiments prone to spoilage couldn't be placed in the same plastic that mustard was because they would spoil, the plastic lets oxygen through and that was a big No-No for other condiments. The ketchup bottle was an impressive feat of packaging engineering in the 1980s because it controlled the damaging effects of acid, the movement of oxygen into the container, and was tough enough to survive handling. It's a relic of a bygone era now, modern packaging design is more than capable of controlling microbes and keeping oxygen and anything else out of the bottles where it shouldn't be.</p>
<p>Interesting enough, there was an incident not too long ago where some enterprising criminals attempted to repackage bulk ketchup into smaller containers and it ended up fermenting and exploding. I'll go find a link.</p>

<p>There's a lot of engineering that goes into packaging design to make sure food is safe by the time it gets to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i for one would much rather have ketchup be granted some sort of thermally safe cap, the number of times my kids have opened ketchup up at the dinner table and rocketed that shit everywhere (as a room temp bottle has higher pressure in it) is fully infuriating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha yeaaaaa that sucks.  What I'd prefer them to solve, however, is the watery separation that occurs 100% of the time, but that you will only account for 50% of the time (by shaking or squeezing elsewhere).</p></div>		</li>
