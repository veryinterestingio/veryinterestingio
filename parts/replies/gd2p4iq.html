<p>If you hear the whistle from your house there is a sign like that along the railroad close to you likely because of a level crossing as mentioned above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can also be chance. The line behind my place has no crossings at all, evrything goes via bridges and underpasses. I still get whistling every morning, basically. That's largely because the local deer consider that stretch their personal crossing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It was really annoying when I lived close to a crossing. On the other hand, there are a lot of drunk college students not paying attention to crossing lights.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the city I used to live in there's an old stone post with a 'w' engraved into it. The post is in a bush beside an apartment building. The railway was removed 35 years ago and the whistle stop sign is all that's left.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's remarkable how quiet a big train can be headed downhill.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, it's backed off power so you don't get diesel sound.</p>
<p>Often though, it produces a seismic signature that you can feel through your feet.</p>
<p>It's a lesson I gave my kids by going out and experiencing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was an accident in Spain, I believe, where a fast train killed a few people. They saw the train incoming but didn't account for the incredible speed.</p>
<p>300km/h is 85m per second. If you see a train half a kilometre away, it will hit you in 6 seconds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in a railroad switching yard. It’s amazing that a train even while throttled up at 60 miles per hour doesn’t give you much of a sound warning. </p>
<p>Sure if you’re standing next to an idling engine it is loud, but coming at you at speed they’re quiet until they get to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on where you are. A train may not get above the noise of a city. I was far out in the country in the quiet of night and I could hear an 80mph train approaching several miles away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trains are really unpredictable. Even in the middle of a forest two rails can appear out of nowhere, and a 1.5-mile fully loaded coal drag, heading east out of the low-sulfur mines of the PRB, will be right on your ass the next moment.</p>
<p>I was doing laundry in my basement, and I tripped over a metal bar that wasn't there the moment before. I looked down: &quot;Rail? WTF?&quot; and then I saw concrete sleepers underneath and heard the rumbling.</p>
<p>Deafening railroad horn. I dumped my wife's pants, unfolded, and dove behind the water heater. It was a double-stacked Z train, headed east towards the fast single track of the BNSF Emporia Sub (Flint Hills). Majestic as hell: 75 mph, 6 units, distributed power: 4 ES44DC's pulling, and 2 Dash-9's pushing, all in run 8. Whole house smelled like diesel for a couple of hours!</p>
<p>Fact is, there is no way to discern which path a train will take, so you really have to be watchful. If only there were some way of knowing the routes trains travel; maybe some sort of marks on the ground, like twin iron bars running along the paths trains take. You could look for trains when you encounter the iron bars on the ground, and avoid these sorts of collisions. But such a measure would be extremely expensive. And how would one enforce a rule keeping the trains on those paths?</p>
<p>A big hole in homeland security is railway engineer screening and hijacking prevention. There is nothing to stop a rogue engineer, or an ISIS terrorist, from driving a train into the Pentagon, the White House or the Statue of Liberty, and our government has done fuck-all to prevent it.</p></div>		</li>
