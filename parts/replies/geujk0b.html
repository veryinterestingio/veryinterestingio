			<div class="markdown"><p>There are lots of strains of measles actually. I should also note that the measles vaccine is extremely effective (97% with both doses), whereas the influenza vaccine efficiency really varies each year depending on the dominant circulating strains and which strains the vaccine is targeting. After getting vaccinated or infected with one strain of flu, people can have some protective immune response to a similar strain of flu due to antibody cross reactivity. The measles strains are all so similar that after vaccination or infection, the antibodies generated react with all measles strains and protect from infection.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a question related to this, if you don't mind.</p>
<p>I was vaccinated against measles as a kid in South America. I went back home to Europe and got measles as a teen, but it was a very mild case (no fever or cough, just the rash). I always thought that the reason it was mild was because I was vaccinated against a different strain of measles, so the vaccine only &quot;partly&quot; worked (hope that makes sense).</p>
<p>Is this possible? Or was I totally wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The name that describes how viruses mutate is called antigenic drift. I am guessing that the reason why the flu has more antigenic drift than measles is because influenza is a zoonotic disease. In other words, it is a disease that is found in animals and can be transmitted to humans. And as such, it has a huge reservoir, which is primarily found in China, in the form of poultry and pigs. A lot of flu strains start in China and then spread to the rest of the world, and the reason why is because there are so many people living in close proximity with poultry and pigs (i.e., lots of people in rural communities have a few animals in their backyard being raised for food). Those animals give the virus a lot of room to mutate.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, measles is not zoonotic. So, there is not this vast reservoir of animal hosts where it mutates and then infects humans. There is just not as much measles in the wild as there is influenza.</p>
<p>It's been a long time since I have taken public health, epidemiology and microbiology classes, so take what I say with a grain of salt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right about the antigenic drift: Measles has a highly conserved, stable genome with a low rate of mutation and only one serotype. Influenza, on the other hand, has a high rate of mutation, four serotypes (A, B, C, D) plus, it has significant seasonal antigenic drift as well as less frequent antigenic shift (abrupt, significant genomic change). Influenza also has two antigenic surface proteins: Hemagglutinin, which has 18 subtypes, and neuraminidase, which has 11. These are the basis for the influenza naming convention, thus H1N1 (2009 pandemic), H5N1, H3N2, etc. There are 120 or so known combinations.  </p>
<p>Both measles and influenza are RNA viruses, which have high mutation rates in general because they lack the proofreading capabilities of DNA viruses, but it's not clear why there is such variability in mutation rates between different RNA viruses. </p>
<p>Finally, you're on the right track regarding zoonosis too, with a couple of caveats: Both measles and influenza are of zoonotic origin. Influenza A has various animal origins, primarily birds, pigs, and horses but also bats, and even marine mammals. Measles is closely related to the cattle pathogen rinderpest virus, so cattle are the suspected source. Most human pathogens - 60% or so - are of zoonotic origin, primarily the result of human domestication of livestock and poultry. The percentage of novel emerging diseases that are zoonotic is much higher, something like 75%. Asia is the primary geographic source of avian flu strains, but North America is the source of most swine flu. There are geographic hotspots, but zoonosis is globally distributed.</p>
<p>I don't know how long it's been or what you've done since you took the classes you mentioned, but your post is pretty solid. I hope that doesn't come across as condescending; it's meant to be a compliment. I'm a microbiologist by training, and the utter lack of even the most basic scientific literacy and the sheer volume of disinformation over the past 11 months or so has been excruciating to the point of despair. So, 21-pipette salute to you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Based on my very limited understanding, things do get complicated and dynamic when mixing and interacting with various animals. Makes sense. If the &quot;seasonal&quot;  flu kills so many people, why don't we take steps to halt travel? A virus is only as good as it's hosts...stop the hosts...stop the virus yes?</p></div>		</li>
