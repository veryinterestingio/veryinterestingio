<p>Did a PhD in quantum spin control and only ~kind of~ started to understand spin physically in the last few months. If you're able to understand it physically in one wiki hole then I'm not sure whether to be impressed or skeptical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are just as many things that are hard to understand about non magnetic materials… it’s just that we’re more “used to” the fact that objects can’t interpenetrate each other and occupy the same space, and we find it more intuitive so don’t question it. But it’s also hard to understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As the other people said. Ferromagnetism is named after the element iron.
Interesting side note: Ferroelectricity is the similar effect only with electronic charge polarization rather than magnetic polarization. Used in solid state drives and similar. Ferroelectricity is named after ferromagnetism, which again is named after iron. Ferroelectricity has really nothing to do with iron at all. You also have ferroelasticity with strain. The common denominator for all ferroic materials is that they show a hysteresis in some properties. You have some directional property which can be switched by an external influence. You have a remnant polarization that will switch by application of the coercive field in the opposite direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anyone got the time to eli5 this? Is the ferro- in Ferro electricity named specifically after the process of ferromagnetism, but happens only with a different set of elements or compounds, and that works came from iron originally is incedental? What's hysteresis? Is there peizomagnetism?</p></div>		</li>
