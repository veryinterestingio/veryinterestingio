			<div class="markdown"><p>Certain processes can change the rock from its solid state to liquid state (lava/magma). These processes revolve around changing the melting point of the rock by either reducing pressure (decompression melting) or by adding certain elements to the rock (flux melting). This results in volcanism, as the molten rock is less dense than its environment and rises.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the topic of volcanos, with lava/magma coming from deeper in the earth and erupting or flowing out onto the surface, is that being replenished through some cycle or is the density of the lower layers slowly lowering as material shifts layers?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whether a rock can melt is dependent on both pressure and temperature. We can see this by looking at a (very simplified) phase diagram for <a href="http://www.tulane.edu/~sanelson/images/decompmeltpet.gif" target="_blank">perdiotite, which is basically the rock that makes up the mantle</a>. The curves for solidus (where a rock starts to melt and/or completely crystallizes depending on direction) and liquidus (where a rock completely melts or starts to crystallizes depending on direction) downward slant reflect the dual roles of pressure and temp on melting (i.e. it requires a higher temperature to melt a rock at a higher pressure). The curve marked 'geothermal gradient' is a normal temperature profile through the Earth within the mantle, and you can see that it is usually completely below the solidus (i.e. the mantle is solid). At a given pressure, if extra heat is added this can drive melting or, more commonly, if the pressure is reduced by moving the material up rapidly (needs to be rapid because the material will also start to cool as it rises, so pressure reduction needs to outpace temperature reduction) then it can melt, producing magma/lava. The latter is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igneous_rock#Decompression" target="_blank">decompression melting</a> and is one of the more common ways rocks can melt. The shape of the solidus/liquidus curves can also be changed by adding fluids (water, CO2) to cause melting at lower temps/pressures (which is how melting occurs in subduction zones).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are different types of lava that form in different ways.  </p>
<p>One of the most common is decompression melting. Mantle rocks are under a very high amount of heat and pressure.  If you remove the pressure, the molecules are free to expand and are hot enough to melt into a liquid. This occurs at tectonic plate boundaries where the plates are spreading apart, leaving a gap so that the mantle rocks underneath are under reduced pressure. So they melt and rise up to the surface. Example: the midatlantic ridge.   </p>
<p>Another way to get lava is through mantle hotspots.  Plumes of extremely hot mantle rock can rise up and bring heat from the core-mantle boundary all the way up to the surface. The heat is enough for the rocks to exist in liquid form, even under high pressures. This lava is particularly hot and has a low viscosity. Example: Hawaii.   </p>
<p>A third way to make lava is by hydration melting. When a tectonic plate is subducted below another and into the mantle, some of the rocks may have H2O incorporated within them. As the water molecules are released under the high mantle temperatures, they mix with the mantle rocks and change their chemical compounds. This can generate rocks with a lower melting temperature, so they are able to liquefy. The liquid rocks are less dense then the surrounding solid rocks, so they slowly rise like a balloon to the surface.  Example: The islands of Japan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add.</p>
<p>All objects experience the tidal force. The amount the object deforms (if at all) depends on the rheology of the object (as well as the strength of the tidal force). </p>
<p>As to if there would be earthquakes or other such things. The tidal force is large scale and the deformation is also small. As suck the change in curvature is small enough that the &quot;solid&quot; interior can deform easily. The crust is somewhat like a piece of uncooked spaghetti, bend it a small amount and it is fine</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The tidal 'force' is actually Delta-F which goes as one over distance cubed. As it turns out the Moon's tidal force is about twice that of the Sun's. When there's a new or full moon the tidal forces work in alignment and the high tides are extra high and the low tides are extra low (compared to the rest of the month) and that's called a spring tide; when the moon is near quarter phase then the two tides work perpendicularly and the high tides are not as high and the low tides are not as low and that's called a neap tide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also 'smaller' means nothing- mass is what counts.  The Mass of the moon is 5.94 x 10^22 kg and the mass of the Sun is 1.88 x 10^30 kg.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation" target="_blank">Newtons law of gravity</a> is anti proportional two the distance squared and proportional to the mass.</p>
<p>Now it does depend on how you define &quot;smaller&quot;. You can calculate the impact of the size on the mass by using the density * volume. The density of the sun is 1.41 g/cm³ and the density of the moon is 3.34 g/cm³.</p>
<p>I'll let you do the math ;).</p></div>		</li>
