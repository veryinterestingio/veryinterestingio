			<div class="markdown"><p>I really think there will always be a place for large single-dish observatories, and the reason is that while interferometers can be fantastic instruments and get you exceptional resolution (the best resolution of any telescopes at any wavelength), there are things interferometers are not inherently good at.</p>
<p>For radio telescopes, the resolution you get goes as \~wavelength/diameter. The bigger the diameter, the smaller objects you're able to see. Interferometers simulate huge telescopes, effectively with diameters of many miles (or thousands of miles for the Very Long Baseline Array / VLB Interferometer). The problem for interferometers is that while you can have excellent resolution and see very tiny objects, you typically are not sensitive to large scale emission. Interferometers &quot;filter out&quot; diffuse emission, so if you're trying to observe large clouds in the Milky Way or the giant gas reservoirs surrounding nearby galaxies, you wouldn't be able to see that with interferometers. You would need a large single dish to see that large scale structure. This is called the &quot;zero spacing&quot; problem. ALMA in Chile has tried to get around this with an array of smaller antennae at the core of the main array, but the best option is a large single dish.</p>
<p>Large single dish telescopes also typically have good &quot;dynamic range&quot;, so you're able to see both very bright and very faint objects at the same time with large single dishes. We're starting to make &quot;arrays&quot; of antennae that go on large single dishes like the GBT and Arecibo, so instead of just looking at one part of the sky, you can look at multiple nearby spots at once. The most ambitious project we currently have for the GBT is a 144 element receiver operating at our high frequency end (74-116 GHz). This will be a great complement for interferometers like the VLA and ALMA because we can map out large areas of the sky very quickly, compared to interferometers.</p>
<p>Another thing about large single dishes is that we tend to be good at detecting pulsars. At our low-frequency range, (\~150 MHz to a few GHz), you can see a degree or so of the sky at one time. Since the telescope is so sensitive, its a good way to track down transient objects in space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy heck I’m currently working on ALMA to try to do exactly this and it’s SO frustrating.</p>
<p>To the original question; It’s also worth noting that while interferometers can get extremely high resolution, the light collecting area is what determines sensitivity. It you want lots of photons you gotta use a big dish. ALMA has like ~50 12m dishes, with a total light collecting area of ~5600 square meters. Green bank has a 100m dish and thus ~7800 square meters of light collecting area. That extra collection means more photons faster, which lets you catch fainter objects with shorter integration times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, thanks for adding this! For large interferometers, there's usually a discussion of adding a large single dish that can be dedicated to the instrument. That can be cost-prohibitive, though, and for high frequency arrays (ALMA), building a large telescope with good enough surface accuracy at 1 mm is another huge technical challenge. The GBT has a very good surface for up to 3 mm observing, and we've talked about trying to push that even higher. (A test 2 mm / 1 mm receiver, for instance.) I don't know that we're there, technical-wise, though. The LMT and IRAM 30-meter (and the future AtLAST telescope) are good trailblazers here, but their collecting areas are much lower than the GBT's.</p></div>		</li>
