			<div class="markdown"><p>Chiming in as another parent of a child with Ds (7-years-old, hello, fellow parent!). Strangely enough, I also studied de-institutionalization and education inclusion as a graduate student before I had my child. Inclusion, de-institutionalization, and the antiquated belief (myth) that people with cognitive disabilities could not learn or stopped learning at some point are prevailing reasons. </p>
<p>Life expectancy is a big reason, too. And longer life expectancy is one of the contributing factors to the deinstitutionalization movement. It’s very hard to ignore a population that survives and thrives. Back when I was born (in the early 1980’s), the life expectancy for someone with Ds was about 25-years-old. In the 1920’s it was 12. Many doctors believed, and parents were told that their babies would not survive infancy and certainly not to adulthood. About 50% of people with Ds have a heart defect. With the perfection of heart surgeries, these defects are very successfully repaired and the current life expectancy is now only slightly lower than the national average. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was pregnant in the mid-1980’s, I worked in an institution for developmentally disabled. </p>
<p>I asked my OB if two people with DS were able to conceive, and he told me that “they don’t live that long”.  I knew that to be false because I worked with plenty of people in their 50’s and 60’s with DS.  </p>
<p>Even people born with regular abilities often become stunted when they are housed from infancy/childhood in the type of institutions used in the past. Too few staff to provide the necessary teaching and stimulation people need to develop properly. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I went to high school with a girl who had parents like this. She was no genius but she wasn't DS.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, until advances in heart surgery occurred, many would die quite young.  I’m reaching back a long ways, but if I remember correctly 25-50% of DS kids have cardiac malformations so severe that they would die in infancy without surgery. </p>
<p>Also, DS kids are part of a selected group. With prenatal testing more than 90% of kids with DS will have been diagnosed in utero. Most of these are aborted, so the ones who survive are born into families that want them and presumably will care for them well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the percentage, but there are people born w/ DS whose parents did not know about the DS til after the birth. So it should not be assumed that all w/ DS were born into families that would not have had abortions had they known. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. But when you have society and schools that used to (And still try to, to some degree) shove you in 'special needs' and leave you there.... </p>
<p>edit: This has blown up a bit- my point was recounting the schools I attended and how they walled off those children with special needs. Locked in a single classroom, special lunch, no socialization. Then the other extreme was full integration, same requirements.</p>
<p>My nephew has Downs and I'm glad to see where things are today. Not perfect, no, but far better than it was.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If handled well, &quot;special needs&quot; classrooms can augment general ed. learning and catch students up within any deficit areas (social/behavioral or academic).  However, when not handled well, the system can perpetuate learned helplessness, ostracize students, or create deficits that would not otherwise exist.  Like most areas of life, it completely depends on the people around you.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>'Special Needs' has come a long way, and I'm sure it varies from school to school.</p>
<p>Regular classroom teachers just aren't equipped for what some children need to learn efficiently, and at the same time, to keep the rest of the class where they should be too. Most children are integrated in their peers' classrooms to varying degrees based on their abilities. They also get addition classes with specialized teachers who are able to give more time and attention to each child. They are also able to come into the classroom and work with kids to help them there.</p>
<p>Getting specialized care isn't &quot;othering&quot; in itself, and &quot;shoving in special needs&quot; is not the same as shoving a kid in an institution. To completely ignore disabilities and pretend kids can keep up is definitely not going to help either. This happened to my daughter. She is a senior, only last year she started getting specialized care because I didn't know her rights, and no one told me they suspected autism until the doctor mentioned it. (She's 'borderline'). Though she seems normal, and has normal intelligence, there's reason to worry she may not be able to support herself for a long time, and we've already given up on collage for the time being. Compare this to my son (11 years younger) Who has been getting the right care from the beginning of his school career. He has a school provided Physical Therapist, Occupational Therapist, and occasional assessments by special ed. They have discovered problems and suggested treatment his pediatrician may not have caught until much later.</p></div>		</li>
