			<div class="markdown"><p>Cable boxes (at least the ones my cable co uses) just turn off the front lights and blank the hdmi out when turned off.  They are a laptop pc that is on all day long.  My cable box draws 200va in &quot;off&quot; mode and 250va in &quot;on&quot; mode.  That's why no cable box has an energy star sticker.</p></div>		</li>
