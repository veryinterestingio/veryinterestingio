			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm guessing you live in the US. Different countries have different models for emergency medicine. In many European countries there is no separate EM speciality, and &quot;critical emergency medicine&quot; for unstable patients is part of anaesthesiology. In other countries (like Ireland where I work), EM doctors exist, but do not always have the skillset or currency to provide advanced airway management, CVC placement, running vasopressors or other interventions, so we often end up running the resus bay anyway.</p></div>		</li>
