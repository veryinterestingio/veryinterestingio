			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, same as when you by &quot;Frozen Dessert&quot; that is essentially just whipped palm or other vegetable oil and sugar with some flavouring added. Looks enough like ice cream that people will buy it and call it ice cream even though it has significantly less milk and/or cream and tastes a lot worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ice cream is never good for you so it's why I only buy the stuff that's actually made from cream. For me that means buying from a local dairy chain but that's not an option for everyone. </p>
<p>Some other ice creams have a lot more air whipped into them to give the illusion of being cheaper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn’t make any sense to me. You churn dairy to make butter, and similarly you churn peanuts to get peanut butter, surely the process of making peanut butter resembles cheese making very poorly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/8/31/17760738/almond-milk-dairy-soy-oat-labeling-fda" target="_blank">thing that's been going on for a while</a>. In general, the reasoning is that no one confuses &quot;almond milk&quot; with cow milk, whereas people certainly confuse &quot;cleansers&quot; with soap all the time. But the milk industry's argument is that the nutritional profiles are very different and people may think that they are similar. Of course, the milk industry also very much would like to prevent soy milk and the like from using the word &quot;milk&quot; for commercial reasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, is the milk industry right? Are the nutritional profiles very different?</p>
<p>I haven't read many nutrition labels for things like almond milk, but from those I have seen, they don't seem to contain much of anything, except carbs and water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The term 'milk' has been used for emulsions of fats in water for ages. 'Soy milk' is older than the United States.</p>
<p>So, it is called 'milk', because that is what it is.</p></div>		</li>
