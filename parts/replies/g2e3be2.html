			<div class="markdown"><p>Tell that to the little bastard who's been flying around my house for 3 days now. It's literally just flew past my view while typing here... I swear it was trying to communicate to me before by dive-bombing my ears and landing on one hand... then instantly flying to my other arm and landing on the exact opposite hand whilst on the computer. I've left windows opened this while time... only to watch it walk on the side of the open window then fly back in. About time to break out the fly spray methinks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Flies also live in high speed, so they see all our movements like in slow motion. The trick to catch a fly is to move faster than the human eye can see, which you can do with some practice, then you have a chance at being faster than a fly (just a chance, it doesn't work every time).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually dislike the concept of flies seeing in &quot;slow motion&quot;. Yes, their eyes process 10x the number of frames per second compared to humans, so them watching a television screen <em>could</em> look choppy, but real movement wouldn't. It's more akin to us watching a tv with 400 pixels and then upgrading to the same size tv with 4000 pixels. </p>
<p>I would instead say that they see with less detail since they don't have pupils but have a faster reaction time. Even though they are near sighted, their brains process chambers of light very quickly. I found a 4 year old reddit post explaining it in much detail, but it's a little long to copy it here.</p></div>		</li>
