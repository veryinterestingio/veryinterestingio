			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it depends on the spice level too. I know people who think some of the food I consider to be spicy, sweet. They regularly eat much spicier food. So it's not always just that they can tell that it spicy, sometimes the spice level is so low people just register another taste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always eaten spicy food.</p>
<p>While in uni in another country, I once invited my foreign (low spice tolerance) friends to my place for dinner  where I cooked some traditional food from home. I intentionally drastically cut down on the spice and made what I thought was a very mild dinner.</p>
<p>They still thought it was quite spicy but eatable and kept wanting me to agree that it was spicy food. To me it was just a well seasoned, flavourful meal but they definitely felt the heat.</p>
<p>They enjoyed it but I definitely realised my tolerance for spice was so much higher than theirs that what seemed seasoned to me was fire to them.</p>
<p>Really made me wonder what they'd have thought if I had cooked my normal meal for them but I guess thats too cruel an experiment to investigate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of my mom. She used to remark that certain family dishes were too spicy but since literally none of the ingredients contained by sources of capsaicin, I never really understood what she meant. </p>
<p>It wasn't until years later that we figured out she only really enjoys bland food and that &quot;spicy&quot; to her is what most folks consider flavorful.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A well spiced and flavorful meal is already great. And when you're with the right kind of company that you can dial it up, that's the best :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moving in with a housemate several years ago was an entertaining experience.</p>
<p>I loved spicy food. He grew up on classic English fare and never ate anything hot. Everything I cooked made him break out in a sweat. I legitimately couldn't understand it. Because I knew he didn't like hot food, I'd add just a pinch of cayenne or a little sliced chilli to big dishes for flavour and warmth. It was like seasoning to me - I couldn't detect any heat at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to smile when OP was saying 5 jalepenos is an &quot;exaggeration&quot; lol.  I get that in this context it can be seen as a humble brag, but Ill snack on Jalepenos because I like the taste and it just leaves a slight tingle.  Maybe not 5 at once, but over the course of an hour or so, sure.  </p>
<p>I tap out on ghost peppers, and reapers kick my ass, but jalepenos are like 3k scovilles compared to the 350k+ or something stupid with those.  Some people can pop habs like candy as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well they taste like bell peppers before the capsaicin kicks in, so they are sweet for everyone. Just depends on their tolerance for how long the sweet will be a prominent taste.</p>
<p>But it's not like jalapenos are especially spicy anyway. They are like the 'standard' in regular grocery bough chili sauces. </p>
<p>So yes definitely spicy, but also tolerable by most people with an average western diet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is also biological though, childrens taste receptors are different from adults. They are more sensitive to bitter tastes and less sensitive to sweet things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If your eating spicy peppers that burn in your stomach drink a large glass of milk and roll around on the ground so your stomach gets lined with milk.</p>
<p>I ate a ghost pepper raw once. I handled the heat in my mouth ok but when it got to my stomach it really got uncomfortable so I rolled around on the ground. Wife, my 7 and 4 year old daughters had a good laugh. Whats dad doing?</p></div>		</li>
