			<div class="markdown"><p>Buffets also have a much simpler temperature safety control measure that is easy to forget -- food in the danger zone is rotated out and removed (or at least should be) inside of food safety time windows.  So as the food gets to 3-4 hours total time spent in the danger zone, it is disposed of because it is no longer safe.</p>
<p>It's not JUST about temperature.  It's about how long the food spends at that temperature.  It is a totally controllable risk in a well-managed establishment.</p>
<p>Oftentimes the buffet service doesn't even last long enough for the food to be unsafe by the end of service, so it's just fine.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Time/Temperature controls are one of the primary control points in food safety. Food ready to be served may be kept at or above 135degrees F or discarded after 4 hours if temperature controls are not used (not preferred but still allowed under many state food codes) however documentation on time controls including a time log must be on-site and in use</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not entirely true, although you have parts that are correct. As long as you cook foods to their <em>recommended</em> temperatures you can hot hold them at 135F+. Fish, eggs, and whole muscle meats only need to be cooked to 145F; ratites and ground meat to 155F; commingled meats and poultry needs to be cooked to 165F.</p>
<p><em>Reheated</em> foods--regardless of protein source--need to be heated to 165F for hot holding. Not all foods in general.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder just how likely it is that food will go bad and make you sick if left out for too long, and how long is actually too long?</p>
<p>A little background: In my younger years I used to live in a janky fraternity house.  We were more the animal house, budget fraternity type than the blazer wearing type.  We had a cook/handyman/crack-fiend that would come and cook some days and not other days. </p>
<p>To the point: I can't count the number of times, either after a party, hungover, whatever, when we'd go into that dirty ass kitchen pick at food that had been left out for a day, sometimes two days!  This food was sitting at room temperature and completely uncovered.  None of us ever got sick from it.  Things I remember eating frequently in these scenarios were grilled chicken, brisket, and mac n chese.</p>
<p>So what I want to know is... were my friends and I just incredibly lucky?  Possible I suppose.  But still, my rule of thumb for most food is: if it smells fine and looks fine then it's probably still good to eat... not that I have really had any need to put that rule to use much in my adult life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on where you live, humidity and temperate.  If in a dryer and colder place, cooked food can probably sit out at home for 24 hours and be, 9 out 10 times, safe to consume.  Cooked food tends to be salty and dry, and all the bacteria innately is killed out during cooking, so it’s only exposed to bacteria on the surface. </p>
<p>That said the 4 hour standard is for professionals, where you need much better than 9/10.  It needs to be more than 99.999% safe or 1 restaurant in a million making people sick is still too many.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are too many variables. Your own health, the type of food left out, cross contamination, if it was cooked properly, outside temperature, how long it's out...all matter for foodborne illnesses. You could eat cold pizza left out overnight every week of your life and be fine, until finals come along and you are stressed to hell so your lowered immune system lets you get sick.</p>
<p>Health inspectors and food laws exist because professional food providers don't know the health status of who they are serving; they have to protect everyone and act as if they can easily make <em>anyone</em> ill. It's a numbers game.</p>
<p>What you do at home only matters for you, and inspectors understand that. I make sure all of my operators thaw food properly, cool foods rapidly for storage, and operate cleanly. At home? If I'm in a hurry I'll absolutely thaw a fish filet in warm/hot water for my own dinner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just leave the burner on low. I make ribs in the oven all the time when I'm at work. Just leave the oven at 225.</p>
<p>When I was a kid there was a kind of stew (pepperpot) we made at christmas that usually lasted a couple weeks. It wasn't constantly hot, but you'd heat it up to eat, then replenish with some meat or water, or seasonings, whatever, cook it for a couple hours then turn the stove off until the next time someone wanted some more.</p>
<p>This is a little different in that one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassareep" target="_blank">ingredients</a> is a vegetable extract that is a natural preservative, but it's a similar concept.</p>
<p>I also make garlic pork from time to time. It's basically small chunks of raw pork shoulder submerged in a jar of vinegar with lots of garlic and thyme left out at room temperature. It keeps for about a week or so.</p>
<p>To eat, you take out some of the pork and a bit of the liquid, add it to a frying pan with some water and cook until the liquid is boiled away then it fries in the pork fat. Absolutely delicious: very garlicky and vinegary, but my wife won't touch it :-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having done quite a few gumbo-adjacent stews that lasted for a week+ - I just ate them a couple times a day and allowed the stew to heat to boil for a few minutes at least once a day. Definitely didn't keep the burner on all of the time.</p>
<p>I did that in a fairly cold flat in winter, but I imagine that if you did just put the pot into the fridge you could easily go infinite (or more realistically, unti-you-get-bored-te). I know that it doesn't have the mystique of &quot;housefire always on with a warm meal always on it&quot;, but it was fairly close with &quot;housefire can just be turned on and a meal is ready and will be warm in 10&quot;.</p>
<p>inb4: yeah, I realise that it's probably not super safe, people just kinda seem to go overboard on food safety topics. Though in more humid/warmer climates I would be more strict.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I have. I’m Southeast Asian so it’s just a stone’s throw away from me.</p>
<p>I was pretty turned off by the stew build up on the outside of the pot. We’re talking at least 5 cm (2 inches) of stew build up and it was almost solid (or gel) -like. As with all things, I had to try it before I knocked it. </p>
<p>In all honesty, there is a depth of flavour and some element of smokiness to the stew. But, I couldn’t get past the mental barrier to think it was delicious. I wouldn’t say anyone’s missing out on much to be honest.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sourdough cultures can change dramatically depending on what kind of flour they’re fed, different wild yeasts present in the air and many other factors.

<p>One of Maring’s sourdough cultures was a gift from chef Harris Esparza, who acquired it from a starter he used while working at the then-La Mansión del Río hotel downtown more than 15 years ago.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Subway line shouldnt be a danger zone tho. It’s sitting above/in a cooler. Should be between 30-40F. When subway gets their monthly inspections, the inspector takes temps of food on the line. Subway employees should also be temping the food at least twice a day on the line to ensure everything is working properly. This is also why you shouldn’t be overfilling pans, because the food at the top is too far away from the cooler. The dates for the food are just subway’s policies on freshness, in addition to some food safety. If food is in the danger zone, there are procedures for when you should throw away and when it’s safe to bring it back to proper temp.</p>
