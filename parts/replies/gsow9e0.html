			<div class="markdown"><p>Former semiconductor engineer here. You're not entirely wrong, but the way you stated it isn't quite correct either.</p>
<p>When processors come off the production line they go to a testing stage that characterizes every aspect of the performance of that particular CPU (we're talking large automated machines costing millions of euro, and each test taking several minutes). Due to imperfections in the manufacturing process, all processors will come out being capable of slightly different speeds. The output is roughly normally distributed - so most processors can manage moderate speeds, some can manage high speeds, very few can manage really high speeds... and these all go into bins accordingly. The middle bin (the normal speed ones) are plentiful and are sold at a moderate clock speed for a moderate price. The top bins are given a higher clock speed from the factory and sell at a higher price (and they are relatively rarer). The topmost bins get even higher clock speeds and sell at insanely high markups because they are very rare.</p>
<p>Now, because the number of chips being sold of each type doesn't necessarily align with what comes out of the production line (and because continuous improvement means that imperfections get ironed out and the curve tends to shift to higher performance as they get more experience with a particular model), they might need to label the awesome CPUs as mediocre ones to fill demand for the cheap mediocre CPUs (without cannibalizing the profits of their higher-tier products). And that's why overclocking exists - partly because the factory bins are a bit conservative, and partly because you might actually have a CPU that's quite a bit better than it says it is, either because it's at the top of the bin for your tier, or it's a whole higher bin because they were running short on slow CPUs when they happened to make yours.</p>
<p>Now, on multi-core CPUs (and especially with GPUs where you have hundreds of cores), you might get defects from your process that make only one or more cores unusable. So what some companies do (especially NVIDIA) is they design say 256 cores into a GPU, then create products with some cores disabled, so say you have the 192-core model and the 128-core model. Then, the ones that come out of the production line with all 256 cores functional get sold at full price, and the ones that come out partly-defective have the defective cores disabled and get sold as the lower-tier products, and that way they can utilise some of the partially-defective product that comes out of the line, thus lowering cost and reducing waste. A prime example was the <del>Playstation 2</del> (correction) - Playstation 3 where the cell microprocessor was produced with 8 cores but they only ever used 7 of them (of which one was OS-reserved - correction courtesy of /u/TheScienceSpy ). Once again, Nvidia or AMD might find themselves running low on defective chips to put into the cheap GPUs so they might end up labelling GPUs with all cores fully functional as the cheap ones to meet the demand and not affect sales of their more expensive higher-tier product.</p>
<p>Another example (courtesy of u/rushi40): the 3060Ti is same chip as 3070 but toned down. Because of the current pandemic Nvidia is selling as many as 3070 possible since there's extremely high demand for both of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard it more of the different models of a certain line. For example, the i5 11400 and the i5 11500 were released in the same line of processors, however in the creation there could be imperfections, so those would be shut off and put into a 'lower' end processor on the same line</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's really no known solution. Transistors will likely reach their minimum size in the next few years. There will still improvements to be made by using better architectures, but these improvements will be slower and slower.</p>
<p>The answer would be some new technology to completely replace silicon transistors, but it hasn't been found yet. There's some possibilities listed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_CMOS#Some_areas_of_investigation" target="_blank">this article</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP (nor a working computer engineer, but I am a CSC grad and have read a fair bit about the problem) but there's essentially four directions left.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Keep going as is! For now this is actually the one getting the most love. Yes going smaller adds error due to quantum tunneling, but error is something we're &quot;really good at handling&quot; so meh?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quantum Computing; Also a lot of love! This isn't as &quot;direct&quot; an answer as you'd like for your home computer because quantum computers generally STILL NEED classical computation to be useful so in and of itself it doesn't solve anything in the classical computing world. That said, anytime you can offload work from the classical computer you've gained power at &quot;no cost&quot; to the classical architecture...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternate materials. Getting more love slowly. At some point we likely ARE going to have to move off of silicon and every year or so we seem to find new and better candidates for materials that COULD be used as a replacement.</p>
</li>
<li>Reversible Gates. Crickets mostly. When you first read about these they sound like the golden ticket to everything. They're like an upgraded version of standard gates (they can do everything they can do PLUS can be worked backwards to solve some niche problems that are otherwise <del>NP Hard</del> &quot;Hard but not NP Hard&quot;) AND they don't destroy bits. Why would that matter? Because destroying a bit creates heat! The fundamental limiter of chips at the moment.</li>
</ol>
<p>So why so little love for 3 and 4 despite them sounding arguably the most promising? Because of EXACTLY what /u/TPSou originally posted--Our chip design is an iterative process where the last generation creates the next generation which will create the next generation and so on...</p>
<p>If you wanted to create a CCNOT gate classical computer on Carbon Nanotubes not only is the theory already well established, <strong><em>so is the tech</em></strong>... to make like a 386. Let that run for 25 years and that process would almost certainly surpass silicon. How the HELL do you keep it funded and running along at full steam for 25 years though when it has to compete with what silicon can already do?</p>
<p>Thus the problem.</p>
<p>EDIT: Heat is also created by simply the process of electrons moving through copper so CCNOTs aren't &quot;cold&quot;, they're just &quot;cooler&quot;. In theory however, if you had a room temperature superconductor version of a CCNOT/Fredkin Gate/whatever computer it would neither generate heat nor require power at a &quot;base level&quot; (you'd still ask it to perform actions that would generate heat and thus require power but you'd be talking orders of magnitude less heat and power than current models)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can get a bit farther by coming up with more efficient designs.  Or keeping the same efficiency, but finding a way to add more cores and get them to work together, or some other clever workaround.  But the actual electron jumping thing probably cannot ever be totally solved - it's actually a quantum tunneling effect, almost like teleportation, because the CPUs are getting small enough that the rules of the quantum realm have a noticeable influence.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electrons are like clouds, you can't know exactly where the electron is in this cloud and this concept goes so far that even physics doesn't know where an electron exactly is. So if there is very tiny wall which is even smaller than this clouds size then electron can just pretend the wall doesn't exist and appear on any of the two sides.</p>
<p>(For this it needs energy, which it gets when its on the other side of the wall and then it sends that energy back in time to it's younger self so it can cross that wall - or so does math explain it)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Processors are made up of billions of tiny electrical gates called transistors. These gates, as the name implies, can be opened or closed to control the flow of electricity. One of the ways we see performance increases is by shrinking these gates, which are called transistors, so that we can fit more of them in a chip without making the chip bigger or making it consume more power. The problem we're seeing now is that the gates are so small, that going much smaller causes a variety of issues we've yet to overcome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like delivering mail on a conveyor belt. Envelopes used to be able to fit with room to spare going from one checkpoint to the next. Eventually, the conveyor belts needed to get closer to each other, and not all of them are going the same direction, similar to <a href="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/bul7HYvm_KmlTWixAMguDQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTg4MA--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/a66c4ce0-fc9a-11ea-b3e7-452972509370" target="_blank">this</a>. Eventually the conveyors (transistors) get so tight that the envelopes have to be placed on them vertically so they fit and don't get caught on the wrong line. Every now and then, an envelope (electron) will fall onto another belt and go to the wrong destination, causing Mr. Smith to not get his jury summons and making a larger issue out of it.</p></div>		</li>
