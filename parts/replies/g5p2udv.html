<p>I’ve read about how glaciologists have found that undercut seawater is leading to much faster calving and glacier melt. How much have these processes sped up loss mechanisms in glacier fronts?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s exactly right. Most of the glacier retreat in Greenland over the past several decades can be attributed to warmer ocean water at the glacier fronts, which melts ice more rapidly and increases calving rates. Sometimes, depending on the slope of the ground underneath the ice, only a small amount of initial retreat can nudge the glacier out of balance and trigger additional retreat. </p>

<p>Your paper in Nature discusses how most glacial loss happens due to the retreat of glacier fronts. Is there anything we can do to mitigate this loss? Either technology or process wise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, in order to mitigate ice losses we need to both restabilize the glaciers (halt current retreat) and also build up more snow and ice in the interior so that the glaciers have the material to “regrow”. This is possible, but requires a long period of a cooler, stable climate. There is also some lagged response time to how climate impacts these big ice sheets, so our actions today are, in a way, controlling the state of the Greenland Ice Sheet even hundreds of years into the future. There have been some geoengineering strategies applied to small alpine glaciers (like covering the glacier surface with bright reflective plastic to reduce melt), but I don't think geoengineering strategies are practical for the large ice sheets. It would be better to focus our efforts on curtailing emissions and rates of atmospheric and oceanic warming.</p>

<p>Most of the talk I hear of climate stabilization revolves, IIRC, around holding it somewhere above the preindustrial age. Not decreasing it to the preindustrial age, or lower.</p></div>		</li>
