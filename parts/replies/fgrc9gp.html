			<div class="markdown"><p>loss of proprioception (at the wrong time) is the reason why we jerk in our sleep, especially when very tired or falling asleep in unfamiliar places. when losing/regaining consciousness, if proprioception does not return fast enough or shuts off too early, the nervous system interprets this as loss of gravity (a.k.a falling, since body/limb weight is what acts on the nerves involved in proprioception of stationary limbs), and springs the body into reflex.</p>
<p>sleep is such an interesting part of life. there's another aspect of sleep that controls GABA neurotransmitters in your brain that essentially paralyses your skeletal muscles while you are unconscious in REM sleep (presumably to protect you from acting out your dreams and hurting yourself). this is also one of the reasons why your arms and legs feel like jelly when you need to move fast in your dreams, for whatever reason. the kicker: when this neurochemistry goes out of sync with your actual state of consciousness, you end up with sleep paralysis. fun times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sleep paralysis was terrifying before I understood it.</p>
<p>I did not know about the forced sluggishness though. I can lucid dream fairly consistently and I always thought that was because I was actively trying to force the dream or something, not because of neurotransmitters screwing with my head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve had sleep paralysis fairly regularly for almost 20 years and it still freaks me out. I always end up thinking “what if this is the time I get stuck like this?” The occasional bout of hallucination thrown in doesn’t help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had no idea it was an actual condition with a name until about ten years after having it. It usually happens when I am very sleep deprived and taking a nap. I almost always hallucinate upon “waking” and I want nothing else but to move a limb or even speak but I just can’t. I think it’s also the source of my returning nightmare of not being able to run or scream in my dreams. Yuck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you ever are in a higher level of awareness when you’re falling asleep, you can actually notice loss of proprioception as you start to drift off. An example I’ve felt is it feels like my hands have either disappeared, or have a strange sensation almost like they exist in multiple places at once. This happens most often when I have my hands together as I’m falling asleep, sometimes it feels like they’ve fused into one!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to sleep funny on my arm from time to time and pinch the nerves. When I would touch my face with that arm, I could feel the fingers on my face but not the face via the fingers (aka &quot;The Stranger&quot;).</p>
<p>Going back to sleep with that arm still dead was interesting; my brain was telling me that my arm was going <em>through</em> the mattress.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once woke up and grabbed my left hand with my right hand. The left hand was asleep and didn't feel anything, but the right hand felt like it was grabbing another hand. I lived alone at the time, so I jumped out of bed in a microsecond.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trippy! I just realized I’ve felt certain body parts “sink into the mattress” and that’s a real part of your nervous system slowing down in preparation for sleep!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to sleep like that too, and had one incident that made me stop. I had fallen asleep on my stomach with my right arm tucked under me. Woke up to get ready for school, and when I rolled over to slap my alarm, I tried to move my arm, but nothing happened. No numb feeling, no tingles or pins and needles, just...nothing. It felt as if my arm completely stopped existing.</p>
<p>I panicked and felt around until I touched my arm, and still couldn't feel it, or move it at all. I used my left arm to lift my right, and it felt like it weighed 10 pounds. I let go and it just fell.</p>
<p>I grabbed my phone and did some web searching, and discovered that it wasn't anything to really worry about, and that it shouldn't cause any damage, so I was able to calm down. Got dressed, with one arm just hanging at my side, and went to the bus stop, figuring the feeling would be back any moment.</p>
<p>My arm stayed completely numb and useless for over an hour, and I was completely unprepared for the feeling when I regained my arm. It was like the usual pins and needled, multiplied by 100, and paired with a 120v electric shock, and it lasted for nearly 10 minutes.</p>
<p>That was enough of a scare that I started sleeping with my arms away from me from that point on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! I've experienced this! It's like &quot;Honey, where are my...<del>pants</del> hands?&quot;</p>
<p>Then I reach out with my mind trying to locate them without having to wiggle them. I can never find them without having to move them, though.</p></div>		</li>
