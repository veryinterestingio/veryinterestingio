			<div class="markdown"><p>I know you've said it jokingly, but with memory leaks the size of the memory (or jar, in this analogy) doesn't matter that much. Imagine that some part of your code doesn't handle memory the way it should and, when you go through it, you always &quot;lose&quot; a part of your memory. If you put more memory in it, it just means it will take more time to fill up all the memory, but since you're not handling the memory already lost, you're not actually recovering anything, so you're just postponing the inevitable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>False, you're recovering the time you would have spent rebooting it more often.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure I've read a few stories on DailyWTF and Shark Tank where the &quot;solution&quot; to a memory leak crash was to just add more RAM.</p></div>		</li>
