			<div class="markdown"><p>While you're correct (though I think your timing for the inflationary epoch is a factor of 10 off), it's not clear what you think this has to do with the formation of elements. The inflationary epoch had ended by 10^(-32) seconds, while nucleosynthesis began at roughly 10^1 seconds (and ended around 10^(3) seconds). At the end of inflation the universe was still far too hot to form stable nuclei.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Elements form inside stars due to gravitational pressure. I can imagine people thinking that in the early universe there was enough pressure to form elements because it was all so densely packed together. The rapid inflation removed that factor. But your point is more to the point - that it was far too hot, anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does. But not in the case of inflation.
With inflation it is space itself that expands.</p></div>		</li>
