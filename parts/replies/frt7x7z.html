			<div class="markdown"><p>That is incorrect. </p>
<p>Fluorescent tubes are all ultraviolet, we can't see any of it without assistance. The coating on the inside of the bulb is what makes light. On a white light, it's stuff that glows under UV. On a blacklight bulb, the coating blocks harmful short wave UV and lets longer safer UV light past. </p>
<p>If you've ever seen a sterilization UV bulb, you'll notice the tube is perfectly clear. Will also give you arc flash, welder's burns on your eyeballs, so no good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right about the coating, yes it is there mostly block the more dangerous UV, but still blocks some of the visible light is produced</p>
<p>But you can still see the produce some visible light, if you’ve ever looked at a sterilizing bulb you’ll see a pale and really cool looking electric blue</p></div>		</li>
