			<div class="markdown"><p>oh correct, i miss-typed that, it should be +12 and -12 will have a 24v potential between them. the example i have is still correct, just not an output on an actual atx psu. thanks for the catch on that :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>-12 V is still required, -5 V was dropped in ATX v1.3 (optional in v1.2). It's only a reference voltage though, not a power rail (but this was the case even in AT PSU days).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely.</p>
<p>It's just like getting shocked from your car door on a low humidity day. Your car becomes charged from the wheels on the road.</p>
<p>Ideally, though, the static discharges fairly quickly from the helicopter skids to the earth after landing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, actually this is a huge danger. The helicopter's rotors moving very fast through the air builds up a large static charge, particularly if the air is dry. Helicopter crane pilots must always touch the hook to the ground before bringing it over to where ground crew are going to attach some cargo to it. This is done to make electrical contact between the helicopter and the ground, so they are at roughly equal static charges. If the pilot doesn't do this, the different static charges are going to be equalized through the body of whichever ground crew person is unlucky enough to be the first one to touch the hook. This has happened and it usually results in severe burns or death. As they say, safety rules are written in blood.</p>
<p>So yeah. Don't step out of helicopters until the pilot says it's ok to do so.</p></div>		</li>
