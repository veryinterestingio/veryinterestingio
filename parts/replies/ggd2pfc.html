			<div class="markdown"><p>But we still have stuff like RTX. There will always be new technologies, even new trends in gameplay, that developers could potentially be pressured into adding to their game late in development.</p>
<p>When GTA was getting big a lot of other games shoehorned in open world features. We had reviewers complaining about all the games that worked poorly for while at the same time complaining that other games didn't include open world features. Open world was a gameplay tend driven by new technology that allowed large maps to load smoothly on demand. It didn't work for all games.</p>
<p>Now we have ray tracing and few games are able to do it right. Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice was absolutely stunning, but I haven't seen any other game use RTX that well. Cyberpunk definitely doesn't. My gf has been playing on my old computer using &quot;low&quot; preset on a GTX970. To me, the lighting and weather effects look <em>leagues</em> better than med-high settings on my RTX2080 with all the RTX options on.</p>
<p>Point being, it doesn't matter how revolutionary the new tech is. There's always something, and devs can waste a lot of time making those new features sort of work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You realize vr games are just 3d games in stereoscopic rendering ,yea? So it's the same. Any 3d game can have vr essentially. It's not like it's a whole new development type</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the basics. But go and try to play through Half Life 2 in VR without vomiting.</p>
<p>HL2 moves too fast, movement accelerates too suddenly, you need to do moves like ascending tight flight of stairs, and quickly escape pursuit in the beginning. Those are very challenging in VR. And then there's the loading screens, where the 3D display gets stuck. That's hell in VR.</p>
<p>The only really playable VR parts in HL2 is inside vehicles, where the experience is actually pretty good. Rendering to a VR helmet is easy. Making a game that's actually enjoyable to play in VR is something that takes a good deal more effort, that depending on the game can deeply affect gameplay.</p></div>		</li>
