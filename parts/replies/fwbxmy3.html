			<div class="markdown"><p>Ditto this. My knees touching while laying on my side hurts more than I feel it should. Even a few layers of cloth helps if I'm away from home. And now that I'm older,  my back hurts if I don't have a thick enough pillow between my knees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel ya, friend. 26 years old and recently left an appliance delivery job of 5 years. My back, my knees, my elbows, pretty much every joint is fucked. I've had people tell me I'm too young to have as many aches and pains as I do, and my only response is &quot;No offense, but you're not the one hauling this 500lb fridge up your stairs.&quot; It's better now with my less intense job, but if I try any mildly  strenuous exercise, I feel like I am going to just fall apart. </p>
<p>It's gonna be fun when I'm old.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm 31 and have had joint pain literally as long as I can remember. Please do not make the mistake of telling young people with pain to &quot;just wait until they're older&quot; now that you are experiencing pain with age. I get this frequently when I mention my pain and it is so upsetting. The pain of getting older is not the only pain. This is my biggest pet peeve so I'm trying to prevent it from the beginning. </p>
<p>For reference, my &quot;pain credentials:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>born with a foot deformity (&quot;corrected&quot; while I was a baby with casts for 6 weeks or so)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>always had range of motion issues with my hips (still can't sit cross legged - 3 year old me hated that I couldn't sit like other kids)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>had physical therapy for knee issues twice while I was a teenager</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>was diagnosed with a moderate leg length discrepancy about 5 years ago</p>
</li>
<li>was diagnosed with si joint arthritis a year ago (framed as good news that I didn't have ankylosing spondylitis, &quot;just&quot; some arthritis at 30 but yea still quit taking those nsaids unless you have a really bad day). </li>
</ul>
<p>I'm probably forgetting some things...</p></div>		</li>
