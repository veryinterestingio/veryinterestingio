			<div class="markdown"><p>The only reputable papers ive found regarding water directly affecting peristalsis were ones where peristalsis was in abnormality. There doesn't seem to be backing that drinking an incredulous amount of water may trigger peristalsis.</p>
<p>Drinking large amounts of water barely raises the pH above a 2. When you eat it goes up significantly more (pH5). There are buffers in the stomach that regulate this, so no, it doesn't matter at all. Both pancreatic and salivary amylase are alpha amylase, which have a ph of 6.5-7, and the bulk of amylase is going to be salivary, which really does not care about your immediate water intake at all.</p>
<p>graduated from the school of google scholar btw, your comment sounded very much like you misremembered stuff from first year biology and probably shouldn't be replying to OP.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Filling your stomach with anything (rocks, water, you name it) will stimulate mechanical receptors in the stomach, which in turn send a signal to the muscle cells around the bowels. This is (one of) the reflex loops in the enteric nervous system. </p>
<p>So for this point, I will stand and fight. </p>
<p>Regarding my second point about water at mealtimes, I will bow to the wise masses of Reddit, and admit that yes, I did indeed repeat what I was taught in nursing school four years ago. Which is alarming, in a way. Like, why would nurses need to know anything about digestion or nutrition. /S</p>
<p>Whilst your facts might be more true, than mine, I think your attitude is slightly snarky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>whoops, didn't mean to rub off that way. Sorry for that. I think I need to recheck my tone every time I post on the internet. I did enter this thread knowing you were a nurse :p did some stalking</p>
<p>why would immediate intake of water dilute amylase? I spent a lot of time looking around for this one but I wasn't able to find anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moving into subjective territory, but I'd say yes, 0.5 litres and above. </p>
<p>I drink about 800 mls first thing, when i wake Up in the morning and five minutes later i poop. Very efficient and satisfying.</p></div>		</li>
