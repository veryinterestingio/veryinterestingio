			<p>I'm not familiar with railroad signaling outside the US. It very well could be the same or similar in other countries, but I can't attest to that. <br>In the US, the tracks either operate as &quot;DC&quot;, where there is either a shunt(0.06 ohms per the AAR) or not. Coded track uses varied electrical signal pulses to convey more information when a train isn't present. The train axle creates an intentional short, which is used to detect the train. If something causes enough water to be present, it could cause current to flow from one track to another unintentionally. This is called ballast leakage. Sever enough ballast leakage can affect proper train detection.</p>		</li>

			<p>But here's one that is true. When the rail tunnel between France and the UK forst opened, there were no specialist high-speed rails on the British side. Instead, trains ran on the third rail electrical system until they reached the tunnel, using a pick-up 'shoe' on the side of the power car. Theoretically, the drivers should have raised the shoe when entering the tunnel and switching to overhead wires, but many drivers forgot. On the french side, these shoes were then smacking French trackside equipment, causing significant (and expensive) damage. The French solution? Reinforced concrete blocks on the French side of the tunnel that ripped the shoes off before they could cause any damage. Which worked fine, until the train reached the UK again and was suddenly useless. And stuck!</p>		</li>

			<p>Exactly. This is exactly the sort of story where the facts are warped into a good story. None of it is true, either: NASA used mechanical pencils, the Soviets used grease pencils, and then Apollo 1 caught on fire and NASA tried to ban every flammable thing they could, at which point Fisher said, &quot;Hey, guess what, I designed this pen that meets your requirements&quot; and they said &quot;sure&quot;.<br><br><a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/13103/russians-didnt-just-use-pencils-space" target="_blank">http://mentalfloss.com/article/13103/russians-didnt-just-use-pencils-space</a><br><br>Most telling: &quot;... NASA received a bulk discount for the pens, reportedly paying just $2.39 per pen for an order of 400 units in 1968. The Soviet space agency also purchased 100 pens.&quot;<br><br>So both groups used pencils, floating chunks of graphite never even caused a short, someone built a private company to solve a need he saw in the world, and it was so clearly superior, and sufficiently inexpensive, that both space programs bought them.</p>		</li>

			<p>Not quite - you need heat, fuel, and oxygen for a fire (the 3 sides of the fire triangle). Conduction through graphite in an oxygen environment wouldn't meet those requirements. You'd have to use the electricity to heat up something, and for that something to be flammable too.<br><br>It <em>is</em> a danger for your electronics, though, if graphite flakes were to get into your machines. You don't want them short-circuiting.<br><br>Edit @ /u/skraptastic - it's just struck me that you mentioned a pure oxygen atmosphere. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISS_ECLSS" target="_blank">It's kept at an Earth-like composition</a>.

			<p>I'm not sure what you're asking here. A spark would need to cause something flammable to heat up to ignition point. This could happen at a gas station because the gas itself is flammable, and resists electrical conductivity so the energy is converted to heat, but a spark itself reaching from an electronic circuit to a piece of conductive graphite won't cause a fire.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'd assume that's just a hub or station designed and reinforced to take the vibration into account. It's not like that everywhere because you are correct, it's crazy expensive to design/build things to withstand those forces. Trains are usually not flying through those stations at top speed and so the vibrations aren't quite as severe as a train going full speed. <br><br>Also, passenger trains are quite a bit lighter than the enormous trains transporting things like coal, cars and livestock.

			<p>Ah, didn't know that. Then yeah, it's probably because it's a passenger train. That's why public train routes and such can all be built like that. I'm a structural engineer who designs bridges but I'd enjoy designing something like that. It's crazy the amount of steel we put into the concrete deck of a bridge, I can't even imagine the amount beneath the tracks for something like that.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm curious. You're a structural engineer who designs bridges. How does that work, like how many bridges a year do you design? I understand new bridges are built occasionally, but then again not <em>that</em> many. Does it take a long time to design each bridge and that's how you have work all the time, or do you go all over the country designing bridges?</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm only in my 3rd year, but glad to answer questions. So, it can vary how many you do per year based on a ton of things. I work for a pretty small consulting firm that's mainly geared for roadway design. Our structural design group only me and 2 other guys. We just work out of an office but when we are looking to win a project that's further away we'll go check it out beforehand. We don't go traveling around designing bridges (though that would be sweet).<br><br>Most projects are posted by a state's Department of Transportation and we have to kind of figure out a rough plan of what we'd design. Then we present that to the DOT (as do other consulting companies) and the DOT decides who they want to give the job to based on value of work and cost, not just the company that can design it the cheapest. <br><br>So quantity wise, it depends how much a DOT likes your firm a lot. My firm is really small, but my partners all actually retired early from MoDOT do they love our company. Also, I'm in St. Louis, Missouri so we get work from MoDOT, IDOT and the Illinois Tollway.<br><br>My first 2 years we got a couple of bridges each year, but also did bridge inspections and some other design stuff. Usually they take a couple of months to design, check, check again and send them off to whoever ordered it to be checked fix everything and finally submit it.<br><br>Now, I have kept saying usually throughout this because this year MoDOT put out a short list of consultants they are trusted and they could just give smaller bridge designs too without all the presentations. We were happy to be on it until all the emails came about the bridges they were giving us. Starting in April/May we started work on 8 bridges due by mid September, and they've thrown 2 more on us since then due in a month ha. They are smaller bridges (60'-160' total length; , 1, 2 &amp; 3 spans; just 2 lanes) and some are mostly similar, but damn it's been brutal. I think you'd be surprised how many bridges there actually are. St. Louis alone has thousands and thousands of bridges. We also do culverts and other things. <br><br>I'll type some more after I get out of the shower. </p>		</li>

			<p>Cool, thanks for the detailed answer! Much more than I anticipated. <br><br>It's always interesting hearing from people themselves how things like this work.

			<p>Yeah there are separate construction companies that construct the bridge (as well as different companies who make the beams, bearing pads, etc.). In the US, there are actually laws for choosing a consulting firm for designing infrastructure projects. The decision has to be a value vs. deliverable decision. For the actual design, it's against the law to give the project to the lowest bidder without looking at anything else. Helps stop things like collusion and usually means a better product is the end result. However... For the actual construction of the bridge, that goes to the lowest bidder ha. <br><br>China is rough because there's got to be corruption and collusion, but they also have awful to nonexistent quality control regulations. It's a big problem with their steel industry. If the steel you order says it's supposed to hold 50,000 lbs you design for that. Then you get the steel and never know that most of the beams can hold 50,000 lbs, but some have so many impurities that it can only hold 30,000 lbs. Can lead to some awful situations. </p>		</li>

			<p>Threw this together to show you the current project I'm working on. This is just a ~140', 2 span (Span 1 ~55.5'; Span 2 ~80.5') bridge deck's reinforcement. Any questions I'll be glad to answer.<br><br><a href="https://imgur.com/a/AplPB" target="_blank">Deck reinforcement</a><br><br>In case you don't see the description. All the SX is just a call out for each separate type of bar. All of the #X's in front of the SX are the bar diameters in 8th's of an inch. So a #5 bar = 5/8&quot; in diameter, or a #8 = 8/8&quot; = 1&quot; diameter bar (which is ~2.5 cm in metric). </p>		</li>

			<p>they are designing and laying down something like this in mechelen- Belgium. You should check it out in the next month, if you are nearby. After it will surely be closed up. The 'simple' concrete in the deck is enforced  with a three layer woven net of 3cm bars. As the structure will be bridge like for High spead trains; the support constructs are like 4 times 2,5 m * 1 m horizontal concrete beams, with so much steel in it i was effectively wondering if there was enough concrete in there to keep it all toghether. from a distance the main reinforcements seem to be 6cm woven bars.<br><br>edit:<br>some pictures<br><br><a href="http://www.infrabel.be/nl/fotogalerij/uitbreidingswerken-gen-project" target="_blank">http://www.infrabel.be/nl/fotogalerij/uitbreidingswerken-gen-project</a><br><br><a href="http://www.infrabel.be/nl/fotogalerij/spoorbrug-jubellaan-mechelen" target="_blank">http://www.infrabel.be/nl/fotogalerij/spoorbrug-jubellaan-mechelen</a><br><br><a href="http://tomputtemans.com/images/station-mechelen/Oude-parkeerplaats-42.jpg" target="_blank">http://tomputtemans.com/images/station-mechelen/Oude-parkeerplaats-42.jpg</a><br><br><a href="http://tomputtemans.com/images/station-mechelen/" target="_blank">http://tomputtemans.com/images/station-mechelen/</a></p>		</li>

			<p>Yes. It's a cost thing. The gravel, or ballast, is used on rails that stretch across the country. The picture you posted, is of rails that go parallel with a highway. Most of rails go through areas that are out in the boonies. You can't possibly cheaply pave everywhere. The ballast is for supporting the rails so they don't sink into the ground. The ballast also prevents water from pooling under the rails. Muddy ground will cause crossing bungalows (they house the electronics that control the crossing) to not operate properly. It will cause the crossing to ring because the moisture would lower the impedance of the rail circuit. Let's say dry ground will give a reading of 100 in an idle state. When a train comes, that reading would incrementaly go down as the train approaches, this is when a crossing would start ringing. The reading would climb back up as the train leaves the circuit on the other side of the crossing. When the ground is wet, that intial reading would be lower, so when a train approaches, the crossing thinks that the train is closer than it actually is. It is still a safe condition, even though it's not ideal. But if the reading in an idle state goes too low,  the crossing would see a fault and would start ringing.</p>		</li>

			<p>The concrete is also more fixed in place which is important for close quarters situations like light rail. With traditional ballast track, the track height changes as the ballast gets compacted down and then later renewed by track machines. The small variances in rail height is no issue for freight tracks in the countryside, but would be an issue for light rail in city streets. </p>		</li>

			<p>That appears to be a relatively short stretch of track. You can put tracks on rigid structures like concrete or a steel bridge, but both are significantly more expensive than gravel. When track has to be laid on a structure that structure needs to be designed to handle it. In open country why spend extra money when there is no need to.</p>		</li>

			<p>Ballast has to be regularly renewed.  Partly this is because mechanical wear turns the angular ballast into rounder pebbles.  <br><br>However, the bigger problem is that the ballast becomes contaminated with finer materials that stop it working so well.  Some of these fines comes from the ballast itself wearing down.  More, however, come from other sources - plant material, wind-blown dirt, dirt carried by surface water, and mud from 'wet beds' (muddy water rising up through the ballast).<br><br>Ballast renewal involves removing the ballast - often with an automated train that supports the track while it does it - and then washing it and replacing it along with fresh ballast.  Some renewal trains do ballast sharpening, which crushes the ballast to make it more angular again.<br><br>YouTube search ballast renewal for some relevant videos.</p>		</li>

			<p>Just wanted to add that many trains have sand sprayers for added traction.  One case where what's great for the train is bad for the track (ballast,) but it would take a <em>lot</em> of trains with their sanders running the entire time to really make a negative impact.  AFAIK sand sprayers are usually only used at low speed/high torque (as in accelerating from a standing stop in adverse conditions.)</p>		</li>

			<p>Some sanding systems are also equipped with a vacuum cleaner like device that sucks up the sand after the locomotive wheels pass. This is primarily to avoid so much sand accumulating on the rails that it interferes with signal systems that detect the presence of trains. These rely on a good electrical connection between train wheels and metal rail, which sand can interfere with being an electrical insulator.  But a side benefit of sand collection is reducing the impact on ballast. </p>		</li>

			<p>Two different size stones because if we added more smaller stones into the mix design, we would rob the ballast of some of its ability to absorb vibration and support the load placed upon it. We want the stones to mesh together, but we don't want them jumping around when the train comes by/ loosening up the ability of the 2's/3's/4's to stick together (5's/6's are going to fly everywhere) This is what I understand, but a railroad expert could tell you better. Additionally, ballast needs to have a large void volume so that fines and other contaminants don't become an issue. <br><br>Also, river rocks are a completely separate type of stone, mined typically from alluvial deposits. </p>		</li>

Makes sense. <br><br>Are your rail customers primarily government organizations? In my experience most rail customers are private and use their own standards rather than government specifications, and usually the railroads fall back on AREMA guidelines. Of course the AREMA guidelines are mostly based on ASTM specs for hardness testing and abrasion resistance, but the gradations themselves are specifically developed for railroad application. </p>		</li>

			<p>To add to that, as some one who works with tracks daily, the stone is called ballast. It's cleaned of all fines and doesn't require any type of compaction aside from vibration to be fully compact. Water will wash out soil and settle over time causing a train wreck. The tracks have to stay true at all times and this is a good way to control that. <br><br>A lot of the tracks I've build had a 12&quot; concrete track slab, then 2' of compact soil or RCA(sub base or sub ballast), then 2' of ballast.</p>		</li>

			<p>I was a gandy back in the day. They used to use a hopper car and dump the gravel down the middle of the tracks, then use house jacks to jack the rail up so we could shovel the gravel under the ties when the old gravel became too loose. Nothing like using a full sized coal shovel to shovel gravel when it's 100 degrees out. Pick axing the holes for the house jacks, and carrying those 80 pound bad boys wasn't fun either.

			<p>You don't really compact gravel. Especially not the crushed stone ballast that is under the tracks. It is of a more uniform gradation than many crushed stone products, so there aren't smaller particles to be lodged in between larger ones. This is one of the reasons gravel is great backfill for excavations where you cannot fit in compaction equipment.</p>		</li>

			<p>Trains can only put pressure on the roadbed through the rail to the ties, which are 9&quot; wide x 102&quot; long and spaced every 18-20 inches. By the time the train's weight gets to the roadbed, it's pretty well distributed, and with 80 ton axle loading, around 90psi ground pressure under the ties. </p>		</li>

			<p>&quot;Immense vibrations&quot; seems very subjective and the notion that rigid Mobutu surfaces would crack is just incorrect. There is direct fixation track, after all, which is mounted to concrete decks and performs just fine. <br><br>But, as you noted, ballast rock does a very good job of distributing loads and can handle the stress due to its ability to deform. <br><br>To answer OPs question, the ballast rock is compacted before ties are to ensure that the aggregate is well-seated and is less likely to blow out under stress. <br><br>Additionally, the aggregate is very strong. After all, the strongest part of concrete is not the hydrated cement but actually the aggregate. <br><br>Finally, track is installed with vibrating fingers (or tampers) around the ties. This nestles the ties and track into a very solid seat of ballast rock that allows for more deformation to accommodate vibrations and weights but also maintains the strength of being installed on rock. </p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;the strongest part of concrete is not the hydrated cement but actually the aggregate<br><br>I think this is true in the majority of cases, but interestingly (if I remember my roommate's masters project properly) it's not really true using Florida limestone. In that case, the limestone actually seems to be weakest, and the concrete tends to crack right through it, rather than around it.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's called the ballast. So the word in itself kinda describes what it does. </p>		</li>

			<p>Not really. The name comes from the fact that early railway ballast was recycled ship's ballast - that is, gravel or rock that was stored in ships' holds that were otherwise empty. Sailing ships required ballast to stay upright if they didn't otherwise have a cargo.<br><br>Early railways were built between mines and ports to export the minerals from the mines. Ports that exported minerals tended to have huge amounts of excess ballast that was unloaded by ships that had arrived to take the exports. As a result it was a very cheap building material - many such poets have jetties, piers, reclaimed land, etc, made out of ballast. When it was found to be suitable for railway construction, even though the stone evolved to more specifically quarried gravel, the name stuck. </p>		</li>

			<p>A friend's father is a conductor and has a story about a washout. Truly scary to think about, but, these guys driving those things know to slow down when things feel wrong...</p>		</li>

			<p>This is called Railway Ballast and not only is the size of the individual rocks is well controlled so is the strength and durability. This means that the friction caused by the load and vibrations is minimal</p>		</li>

			<p>The base for tracks is not generally referred to as gravel, it is crushed basalt, approximately #3 size. Basalt is used because there is plenty of it, it is hard and strong under compression and the fractured sides interlock rigidly when loaded. Despite that, over time tracks do settle but are lifted and the base adjusted with a several car long work gang designed just for that purpose. One car actually lifts the track and ties and adjusts the basalt base.<br><br>The other replies here do well at pointing out other advantages.</p>		</li>

			<p>I airways thought it was due to the need of a much more level track than a road might need. Thus, there gravel acts as a leveling mechanism over small hills and bumps along the route. Is this also true, but less important that the reasons you gave?</p>		</li>

			<p>How does this compare to trams then? They are very similar to trains in size and bulk, yet trams run on rigid tracks.</p>		</li>

			<p>Ballast isn't meant to flex under load. It's meant to lock together and transfer loading from the ties to the subballast. <br><br>Raroads use stone because it's cheap and readily available. Other options like direct fixated track are better but they're expensive so they're rare.</p>		</li>
