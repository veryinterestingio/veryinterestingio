<p>This is the purpose of preheating, for it takes longer to heat up the metal than the small mass of air inside the oven chamber.</p>

<p>Air is heated really easily, and it doesn't hold much energy - that's why a blast of 200 degree hot air to the face doesn't do anything, apart from making you blink.</p>
<p>In technical terms, air has a heat capacity of 1.02/.77m^3</p>
<p>In comparison, steel has a heat capacity of 0.5/0.000127m^3</p>
<p>That means that the energi in the air that escaped is <em>nothing</em> compared to the energy that's already made the metal of the oven hot. It's really nothing to worry about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So as many of you have probably heard, the first attempted &quot;head transplant&quot; is scheduled to occur later this year. I haven't been able to find scientific articles on the subject but it seems they plan to fully connect the nerves/veins/etc, and the spine. However to my knowledge we still haven't figured out how to repair a typical spinal injury, so how can we, even if just in theory, expect to fuse two different spines to any extent?</p>
<p>Edit: so this blue up quite a bit. For the record, I am well aware we can't fix do a body transplant yet, I simply wanted to know how we could even attempt it when we hadn't overcome a major hurdle like that though.</p>
<p>I am well aware the odds of success are super low, that's now what I'm asking about. </p>
<p>I do believe a body transplant is something we could one day achieve, just not yet. Eventually someone has to try, and that's what this is to me. This year's failure could led to next year's success</p></div></div>

<p>In real terms, we have no way of knowing if the spinal nerves will re-fuse and if signals will flow again. Present medical knowledge is that once there is a catastrophic cord injury and severance, then it is pretty much over from a neurological point of view. </p>
<p>The issue here is that the brain stem deals with and controls all autonomous functions of the body (heart beat, breathing, etc) - which presumably will be above the incision point. It is unknown whether the brain stem will be able to send signals down the new spinal nerves, thus there is a very real risk that the &quot;head&quot; will not be able to breathe or function without life support. Combined with that, it is unknown whether the donor body's other functions (digestion, excretion etc) can be maintained by the donor brain, especially if the spinal fusion fails. </p>
<p>It appears that the head donor is terminally ill and has agreed to take part in a &quot;last ditch&quot; attempt at furthering of his life. He already has a terminal neurological condition which affects his body, therefore the logic is that if his head and brain &quot;survive&quot; the operation but there is no cord fusion giving movement or any quality of life, he hasn't &quot;lost&quot; anything as his brain is still in a crippled body and will likely die in due course. </p>
<p>From a medical science point of view, it will be fascinating to see what happens and he should be thanked for his courage and generously in effectively donating his body for the advancement of medical science and understanding. However, I fear that the outcome will not be successful, and for that, I wish him a safe and peaceful trip. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>That's all well and good...but, axonal injury is still axonal injury. Wallerian degeneration (in which the nerve cell dies all the way back to the nerve body) will still occur. Nerves can regenerate after Wallerian degeneration, but they do so at a very slow rate. </p>
<p>I can't imagine a way this would work out such that the patient wouldn't have to be on life support for at least 6 months, likely longer, <em>in the best case scenario</em>...notwithstanding the secondary infections he'd likely get which might kill him before anything good happens. </p>
<p>Of course, the whole goal of this is to prove us naysayers wrong, and I, for one, would be amazingly excited to be proved wrong. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

You are absolutely correct, we have no idea how to repair a typical SCI... however, in this case the nerves of both patients are likely fully intact, making it a much easier job than coaxing cells to regrow following an injury.</p>
<p>That being said, I agree with u/AHoddy that this is extremely unlikely to work. This is more of an experiment to see what will happen as well as a &quot;last-ditch&quot; attempt to save a terminally ill patient. </p>
<p>Also, thank you for calling the procedure by its proper name: a body transplant. It irks me to no end when people call it a head transplant. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

One would imagine that fasting like that would be bad for you, and apparently in people, prolonged restriction in men and premenopausal women over 21 it causes loss of muscle mass, strength and reduced bone mineral density and even has a higher rate of mortality in older middle aged and the elderly, as one would expect; but can still make you live longer and look younger???</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think that you may need to relook at the science.  Prolong fasting does not cause appreciable loss of muscle mass, strength or bone density.  Check out <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413115002247" target="_blank">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413115002247</a> for scientific studies.  These studies conclude that fasting is associated with increased regenerative markets, along with a decrease in risk factors such as diabetes, CVD, cancer and aging.  The research above also highlights and increase in stemcell production and nero pathways.  In fact, the use of Intermittent Fasting has become all the rage among atheletes in order to cut wait but increase performance.  I can give you a ton of links but it would be better to just Google it.</p>
<p>The theory behind the benefits of fasting are that lack of food slows down cell division in parts of the body but stimulates the growth in others while preserving as much muscle mass as possible.  From an evolutionary perspective this makes sense.  For most of our existence we have been hunter-gathers and would eat when we had food.  We did not farm until relatively recently.  Thus, our bodies developed not knowing when it would have it’s next meal.  Had our bodies not been adapted to fasting for extended periods then we would have gone extinct long ago.  </p>
<p>When our ancestors fasted it was because they had no food to eat – it was not a choice.  No food put is in survival mode and the body responded.  In order to survive that body would conserve any energy it could (stop splitting cells where it could), preserve muscle mass so that we could chase prey, increase cognitive function so we could think clearer, and start utilizing stored fat for energy.  All of these things contribute to a longer life and decrease signs of aging.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am pretty sure you need to separate fasting from calorie restriction when looking at the science, they are slightly different.</p>
<p>The benefits of calorie restriction seem to play off of protein metabolism, growth factors, testosterone, and other hormone responses, but researchers haven't nailed anything down.  From what I have read you have to be EXTREME in calorie restriction, to the point that it is difficult for most humans to maintain voluntarily, for the numbers to come out in your favor.  Haven't read much about looking younger...although ageing and our biological processes are essentially oxidation, (?) so if you stop fueling the body the biological process slows and there is less cell death/turnover, but that is only a huge speculation on my part.</p>
<p>from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3569090/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3569090/</a>   (this study looks at humans)
&quot;The mechanisms by which CR slows aging and protects against age-associated diseases are not known yet. Many interrelated and overlapping metabolic factors have been proposed to play a role, including a reduction in growth factors (e.g. insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)), anabolic hormones (e.g. insulin and testosterone), and circulating inflammatory cytokines (Fontana &amp; Klein, 2007). Calorie restriction and reduced growth factor signalling both elevate resistance to oxidative stress, reduce cellular damage, and increase lifespan in experimental animals (Mair &amp; Dillin, 2008; Russell &amp; Kahn, 2007).&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Where did they come from when the life of a house fly is 28 days and they are so huge they can hardly fly.  Caloric restriction indicates drought or some type of scarcity of resource which would prevent reproduction, so they live longer.  When otherwise dieing would be more practical, to make room for the next generation, one step ahead in evolutionary development.  Also, living without big macs isn't really living, so reaper stops his tally. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most credible theory I've read has to do with inflammation. Basically, if you eat extra food, you're making extra work for your body. You bring in outside chemicals and pathogens on that food that your body has to process, when you don't even need the energy, so it's a net negative for your body. Inflammation taxes your body, causing aging.</p>
<p>You can be unhealthy and live a while, just as an obese man can starve to death. Health and age aren't necessarily linked 1:1. Constant lack of food isn't good for you, but it also means there's not a lot of cellular division going on which means you age less, to oversimplify extremely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One is that all food causes oxidative stress which ages you. Basically the process of the food being broken down into energy releases free radicals which cause damage. So basically every meal you eat is aging you a tiny bit. Less food means less aging. The other is cellular autophagy. When your body is short on food, it begins eating itself. It starts by breaking down damaged and malfunctioning cells and recycling them. This leads to having more of the healthy, younger cells running the show.</p>
<p>Tangentially some foods are less oxidative then others and you can trigger autophagy through fasting. So it may be possible to mimic some of the caloric restriction benefits, by eating properly and fasting from time to time while still eating enough calories overall to generally maintain muscle tone and energy levels. So you get to keep a decent quality of life and still maybe add a bit on the back end.</p>
<p>Edit: Just wanted to add, that though you seemed to use caloric restriction and fasting interchangeably, they are not the same. Generally speaking consistent caloric restriction will cause the body to lower your  lean body mass in order to adapt to having fewer available calories. Fasting by contrast seems to preserve muscle at first. A fast of even a few days does not cause a noticeable decrease in lean body mass, most the energy will come from stored fat. It's as though evolutionarily, your body thinks it needs that muscle in order to get more food or else it will starve. Whereas the guy who is getting just slightly fewer calories everyday for months on ends up adapting to the new normal by loosing muscle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From an evolutionary view it is beneficial for us to easily remember bad memories. This helps us avoid repeating mistakes we have witnessed and keep us out of dangers way e.g. My friend was eaten by a bear in that cave, I remember this in great detail and avoid that cave in future so I'm less likely to be eaten by a bear.</p>
<p>I think it might be similar for things we find embarrassing. It's dangerous to do things that alienate you from a group since we are social creatures that rely on acceptance and group work to survive. If we remember things we've done before that threatened our social standing then we aren't likely to repeat the behaviour in future and avoid exclusion. That's just speculation though. </p>
<p>Edit: for people asking for more info on this I highly recommend looking up evolutionary psychology.</p>
<p>'Evolutionary theories of emotion view emotions as adaptive traits - they help the organism to adapt to the demand of the environment and thereby survive' (Izard, 1977; Plutchik, 1984).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm an undergraduate currently studying emotion and cognition so I think I may be able to enlighten you a tad. So, current theories of emotion center around two things.  The Internal environment and the external environment. The internal environment being your subjective understanding of the environment and the environment being the physical reality to which you operate. Emotions are placed onto environmental energies (Things that happen in reality) as there is only one cognitive state, known as arousal. Arousal is an on or off function within our brain and can be triggered with pretty much anything, be it a glancing touch or an oncoming car. The cool thing about this is that emotions are supplanted on top of environmental energies. In a way, we actively decide how we feel about certain things. The movie Inside Out is a fantastic example of this process. </p>
<p>When it comes to memory and emotion, our brain (us) is particularly good between confusing our internal and external environment and can supplant emotion over memory. I hope this helps, I could not give you any sources but that is what I was taught. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Only highly empathic people suffer from cringe when remembering old memories. The scientific explanation for that &quot;cringe&quot; feeling, is that our brains are able to connect with another person so well that we actually &quot;feel&quot; what they're feeling. An evolutionary reason for why we cringe is that people who could feel others' pain were less likely to make the same mistakes. For example, in olden times if you a tribesmen tried to eat a poisonous mushroom and you could empathise, you wouldnt make the same mistakes. Cringe is a human emotion which allows us to learn without having to experience the consequences ourselves. When you remember, your brain identifies the old you as another human being, and so you feel the cringe yourself. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a mathematician, the first thing I can say is to NOT watch a video called &quot;Imagining the Tenth Dimension.&quot; It's poor math and worse science and completely misses the point.</p>
<p>A better way to approach this is to understand what &quot;dimension&quot; really means to a scientist. A &quot;dimension&quot; is basically anything you can measure with a single number. So, for instance, a line is one-dimensional because you can describe any distance along that line with one number: the distance forward from some starting point. You could use a 1-dimensional measure to describe your position along a highway, or how far you are from the north pole, or the amount of time that's passed since midnight, or so on.</p>
<p>We commonly say that we live in 3-dimensional space. This is because it takes 3 numbers to describe our location. For instance, you could describe your position relative to the earth using three numbers -- Latitude, Longitude, and Height above sea level. Or you could describe your position relative to the room you're in -- measure the distance from the floor, left wall, and back wall, for instance. You could even measure your position relative to three points in space, and this is exactly how GPS satellites work! The important thing here is to note that two numbers aren't enough -- we need 3 numbers to give a useful description of a location.</p>
<p>When we talk about things with &quot;more than three dimensions,&quot; we usually mean we're talking about things too complicated to describe with only three numbers. Spacetime is a common example, because if you want to identify an <em>event</em> (like, say, a wedding), then you need to give at least three dimensions to identify the location, plus one dimension to identify the time. But it's quite possible to make other spaces which have more than three dimensions -- for instance, if a library database is indexed by Year, Subject, Author's Last Name, and Media Type, then it could take 4 numbers to identify a point in that database space. And there's no upper limit -- you can make &quot;search spaces&quot; like this as complicated as you like, requiring any number of dimensions to identify a location within them.</p>
<p>When mathematicians talk about extra dimensions, they're often thinking about adapting existing mathematics to see how it would work in four or more spacial dimensions. For instance, we know that a line has 2 sides, a square has 4 sides, and a cube has 6 sides -- and we can prove that if there was a four-dimensional shape that fit this pattern (a &quot;tesseract&quot; or &quot;hypercube&quot;), then it would have 8 sides (and each side would be a cube, just like all 6 sides of a cube are squares).</p>
<p>When <del>physicists</del> [string theorists] talk about extra dimensions, they're often thinking about how they could use additional types of measurement to better describe space. At very small scales, our space doesn't seem to obey &quot;normal&quot; three-dimensional laws -- so adding more dimensions is a way of getting more specific about what's going on at the <del>quantum</del> [subatomic] level, where <del>momentum and position</del> [some stuff I don't actually understand since I only studied undergrad mathematics] are tangled up in each other.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr: dimensions are just a thing we made up to describe how we measure things, there's no objective way to say how many the universe has, and if someone tells you to visualize all dimensions as branching structures then they've been watching too many time travel movies.</strong> </p>
<p><em>Edit: Wow, this blew up, and many of you had great corrections. To be honest, I don't know what the hell physicists actually want out of extra dimensions, I only understand the math concepts.</em></p>
<p><em>Also holy shit, it's over 9,000. Glad you all found this helpful! Remember, math isn't just for geniuses, it's for everyone who can read a book and ask a question!</em></p>
<p><em>PS: If anyone's looking to hire a budding mathematician/aspiring programmer, please give me a call, with more experience I can write even more mind-blowing teachpieces.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OP I think you're misunderstanding the concept of a dimension in the first place. There is no such thing as the 'first' dimension. Once you decide you've got a particular number of dimensions (usually 3 if we're talking about things in physical space) they're all indistinguishable. So what is a dimension? Well the number of dimensions simply specifies how many numbers you need to tell where a specific point is: on a flat piece of paper you need two numbers, the first number could refer to how far to move along and the second to how far up but there's no reason it needs to be this way; you could just as easily describe that point by its angle to the horizontal and how far it is away from some specified point. Whatever way you want to describe it though, you always need two bits of information so the flat surface is 2D. </p>
<p>Edit: I'll try and flesh this out to have a go at the 11 dimensions bit.</p>
<p>First off, dimensions beyond 3 spatial and 1 time are theoretical. There's still disagreement among string theorists over the number of extra ones they'd like: supergravity has 7 more spatial ones but i've heard the number 26 thrown around as well. I don't think there's any way to intuitively understand why those numbers should be what they are, its just the way the (very) complicated maths works out. As to why we can't move in these extra dimensions, the classic explanation is that they're curled up very small. This is like if you look at a straw from a long way off: it looks like a line (so 1D) but actually you could move around its surface so to describe where a dot on a straw is you would need two numbers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Now, this is the visualization of the 4 dimentions. It is a bit simplistic, but it translates the point. Earth orbits the sun, in a 2D space - on an elipsis. (No it is not a circle, since it is not perfect one - elipsis). However, it also &quot;wiggles&quot; slightly up and down from it's trajectory. Oscilates, I believe is the english word for it. So, technically, in order to describe its motion (position of Earth at given intervals), we need the 3 dimentional coordinate system: X - horizontal, Y - vertical and Z - Depth. Now, the fourth dimention is Time. How do we show that? We obviously need a 4th reference point. In the video, the Sun is portrayed as the axis along which we will measure the movement of the other planets. So it is stationary, relative to them. Lets say we put the axis T - time, through the Sun. So the sun moves forwards in time - basically, along the line/axis T. Relative to it, the Earth, which orbits the Sun, now moves not in an elipsis, but in a spiral - a helix. This is why the statement that Earth moves in an elipsis through space (3D) and in a helix through Spacetime (4D) is true.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I cannot give you a good explanation of the other dimentions. But the answer of r/ohballsman is quite simple - the more you need to describe a given point, to identify its location, the more axis-es you'll need. Each axis is a dimention. 1D is a point. 2D a circle. 3D - a sphere. And 4D... well, best gues is a cyllinder, but that will need some more explaining. (It's sides will be moving in a given direction, at a constant rate, up to infinity.)</p>
<p>I may be wrong on some points regarding time, because of its relative nature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>One thing almost all of the posts on here are missing is the idea of orthogonality.  In simple terms, this means that the dimension should be at &quot;right angles&quot; to each other.  But more importantly, it means that the dimensions are not intertwined.  You can fix all of them, and then change one without changing the others.  For example, you could have a position in a 2-D plane and then change your z-value without changing your x-y position.  You can change your time value without changing the xyz position.  An object with a certain cross section in n-dimensions can be extruded to a solid in n+1 dimensions.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so first thing to note is that light is an electromagnetic wave, the photon is the carrier particle for the electromagnetic force. When we're talking about optical effects, we are talking about electromagnetism, which means there are only three (mostly two) particles we have to consider: Electrons, Protons, and Photons.</p>
<p>Electrons and Protons both respond to the electromagnetic force, but Protons are almost always shielded by an atom's electron shell, so they almost never interact with light. Electrons inhabit orbitals, which are basically imaginary shells that surround the nucleus of an atom. They can move from one orbital to another by gaining or losing energy, but they have to gain or lose enough energy to move a while number of orbitals. For example, an electron could jump 2 or 3 orbitals, but not 1.5 orbitals. </p>
<p>When a photon approaches an atom, if the photon can excite an electron into a higher orbital, that photon is absorbed, then the electron jumps back down to its original state (electrons always want to be in the lowest available orbital) and releases a photon of slightly lower energy as the atom recoils, having absorbed some of the photon's momentum as heat (heat is just kinetic energy at tiny scales). If a photon doesn't have the right energy to excite an electron, it passes right on by, if it hits an atom directly, it is deflected rather than absorbed, which lengthens the path the light takes through the material, which is what causes the speed of light to appear to change in different materials. This is why glass is transparent to visible light.</p>
<p>A reflective surface has a lot of free electrons, which are not in orbitals and thus don't have to absorb specific photons to be excited (though they will have trouble with very high energy photons because they just knock electrons right out of the metal, or fly right through them via quantum tunneling), so they take all comers and and reflect them according to the same rules.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physics rather than chem, and it's subatomic/wave rather than atomic.</p>
<p>Light is a wave (or a particle, or both, but we'll stick to wave) of electromagnetic radiation which travels through a variety of media (air, vacuum, water etc.).  Visible light is made up of several different wavelengths which we see as colours.  The important thing here is that, as a wave, it is carrying energy.</p>
<p>When light hits an object, it can be pass through, be absorbed, reflect or scatter, or any combination of these.</p>
<p>When the light wave hits the mirror, the energy from the lightwave is absorbed by the atoms.  This pushes electrons into higher energy states.  This isn't a stable condition, and so the electrons release the energy.  In a perfectly reflective surface, all of the absorbed energy is spat back out, perfectly mirroring the incoming energy.</p>
<p>Across the entire surface of the mirror, this leads to the light being absorbed and then spat back out in a way that produces a &quot;good&quot; reflection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What everyone else has said is correct; photons (light) being absorbed by electrons (subatomic particles) will excite them, and then they emit their own photon of equal wavelength. You can see <a href="http://s298.photobucket.com/user/msimmond/media/Absorption-1.gif.html" target="_blank">this</a> diagram for a visual aid. What this doesn't explain is why <em>metals</em> (which are basically mirrors without glass in front) are so good at reflecting light.</p>
<p>I would like to go into the Chemistry aspect of this, though, if it's not too late -- since that is the study of atoms, after all. Note: it may help to have a periodic table open in another tab. &quot;Free electrons&quot; is a term I saw in another answer. This basically means that the atom has a lot of electrons not strongly attracted to the parent atom. Can you guess which atoms have the most free electrons?</p>
<p>The answer is metals! Check out a periodic table, and the whole middle section will be the transition metals. If you think about some of the characteristics of metals, they can be explained by their electron structure. First, they're good conductors of electricity, something that directly deals with electron exchange, and second, they're shiny, which relates to what we're talking about. They're also strong at oxidizing, which is part of why batteries work the way they do. Hell, their electron structure is the reason that when you breathe, oxygen gets transported around your body the way it does.</p>
<p>This is where the Chemistry begins. Again, I recommend a <a href="http://www.ptable.com/Images/periodic%20table.png" target="_blank">periodic table</a> if you're reading this. I'm going to try and put this into ELI5. I'd be happy to explain if I don't do it justice.</p>
<p>Basically, around every atom, there are electrons. These are separated into orbitals, named <em>s</em>, <em>p</em>, <em>d</em>, and <em>f</em> orbitals (don't worry about <em>f</em>, that's some Nuclear Chemistry shit). Only the outermost orbital contains electrons usable in reactions, and these are known as valence electrons located in a valence shell; the other ones are tucked away for the most part. Obviously, as the orbitals grow and grow in diameter, they get further and further from the nucleus of the atom, and are less attracted to it. This is what that &quot;free electron&quot; reference meant; these really far-out electrons are only barely associated with the nucleus and are pretty much free to do whatever they want. Metals have valence electrons in the <em>d</em> orbital (which is the middle chunk of the periodic table), and so have plenty of free electrons when compared to an atom with valence electrons in the <em>p</em> orbital or <em>s</em> orbital.</p>
<p>Metals are, to conclude, what makes mirrors shiny. As long as the surface is very, very flat, metals will reflect light very well. I hope I have explained why.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

You could guess that the light is much larger than a single atom. This is why we cannot see individual atoms or molecules with regular optical microscopes - the light wave just goes around the atom. <strong>But</strong> if you pile up those atoms by length, width, and depth, eventually the large area will be big enough to intercept the light wave and bounce it back. I couldn't tell you though if a single atom is responsible for bouncing it back by chance or if multiple atoms can bounce light back, that's out of my jurisdiction</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Same reason why peoples faces get really shiny while their arms and legs don't. Your face (and chest, back, shoulders) has pores. In these pores are things called sebaceous glands, which produce sebum. Sebum is the bodies natural waxy substance which lubricates the skin and keeps it healthy. Some people produce a lot of it, and their faces shine like a diamond. Some people produce little of it and get dry skin. It itself is not a bad thing. Acne comes from when the pores get clogged. </p>
<p>Most people have the bacteria that causes acne on their skin already. But it doesn't do anything on healthy skin with healthy pores. Acne happens when these pores get clogged up. The bacteria consumes the sebum in our pores and releases its waste. Something to note is that the bacteria are anaerobic, meaning they thrive in low oxygen environments. So these bacteria are in your pores, eating your sebum, releasing waste, and your pores gets clogged. This is the start of a pimple. If the clog is deep, and the top of the pore is still open, a blackhead forms. If the clog is near the surface and a thin layer of skin forms over it, a whitehead forms.</p>
<p>So the face produces the most sebum and has a lot of pores, making it prime breakout territory. Your forearms and legs have much less sebum so they don't really get acne.</p>
<p>Edit: as I am the top comment, I'm going to plug /r/skincareaddiction as a prime knowledge center with very helpful people. First things first, don't pop whiteheads if you can avoid it, and if you have to, do it gently and cleanly. Popping acne and picking at pores is how you get scarring, and you don't want facial scarring. Secondly, daily sunscreen is how you look 30 when you're 50. Sun damage causes wrinkles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When I finally &quot;gave up&quot; and stopped washing my face so much my acne eventually cleared up. I would use the Acid soaps, special creams, tanning, picking, not picking, everything and anything. It wasn't until I just stopped that my face finally started healing. I won't lie, it did get worse before it got better. And it was hard.</p>
<p>Perhaps my experience was one of reaching adult age and it just going away, I dont know. My wife swears by the Charcoal Soap. It's black, has almost only charcoal in it and does seem to create nicer skin.</p>
<p>There is a bit of feeding the beast that happens when one washes their face. It starts with a break out, some hard cleaning, acid pads, feeling good, then waking up to a face that looks like it slept face down in pizza grease. The facial skin is like most parts, a self organized system. It knows all the oil had been stripped off and over produces. Hence the ever increasing oily face. If that's someone's experience then just stoo washing your face. A towel pat down once a day will work. Perhaps a light water rinse once a day.</p>
<p>Then we have the other cases where the face is infected, and each time something is popped it spreads. This requires antibiotics. And the will power to stop picking. Acne IS different then pimples. Sometimes we will get pimples with white heads that just go bloop when touched. Then there are the omg this hurts so much bumps that are swollen and red and full of crap. That's acne and it's a special kind of bacteria that shouldn't really be concentrated like that. It may require a good dermatologist. Acne needs medicine, break outs from Mensi can be dealt with by not over washing. </p>
