		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two main factors. Most antennas people notice are for xm radio that works at 2.3 ghz instead of 100 mhz that standard fm radio operates. The wavelength is directly related to the antenna size and the wavelength of 100mhz is roughly 10 feet were 2.3ghz is 5inches.</p>
<p>Secondly electromagnetic modelling software has made amazing jumps in the ability to model complex structures, like HFSS and Feko. So designers can embed antennas in places they never could before, like most cars have the fm antenna in the wind screen. </p>
<p>There has been a lot of talk about impedance matching, although helpful not really that important in this case. Just because I can impedance match a beer can to 50 ohms doesn't mean it propagates worth a damn.</p>

<p>Profit is the answer you're looking for. In 2000 I designed the rear backlight (rear window) of the Bentley Continental GT.
It had 26 (near invisible) antennas built into the laminated glass and obscuration band.</p>
<p>Those 26 antennas captured all radio (analogue and digital), TV, Satellite, WiMAX etc signals for every overseas continent. All options.</p>
<p>The cost to Bentley was £450 ($600) per window, back then. So the technology was available (and had been for some time) back in 2000, it just didn't come cheap.</p>

<p>Antennas resonate with radio wavelength. They can resonate on different ratios of wavelength, those ratios are 1/4, 1/2, 1 and maybe 3/2.</p>
<p>Electrical length and physical length of antenna arent the same, even thought they are closely related.</p>
<p>There are techniques to increase or decrease electrical length of antenna. These techniques take capacitor or inductor added to antenna.</p>
<p>So you pick 1/4 wavelength antenna, you can add inductor to its base which will increase its electrical length, so the physical length can be shorter.</p>
<p>With radio frequency of 100MHz wavelength is 3m. 1/4 is 75cm, which can be shortened further.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A sprain actually doesn't involve any damage within the muscle tissue. A sprain affects the ligaments that connect bones to joints and can vary from a snapped ligament down to just a ligament that has a twist. What I believe you're thinking of is a strain and the easiest way to understand that is to look at a picture of striated muscle tissue and imagine all those little lines as rubber bands, when you strain the muscle some of the rubber bands snap.</p>
<p>[edit] I'm an EMT by the way and we basically treat sprains, strains, and closed non angulated fractures all the same way. The treatment is basically the same, immobilize it, ice it, and go easy on it. If you have concerns go get an X-ray cause that's the only way to be 100% sure if it's fractured </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned before, you don't &quot;sprain&quot; a muscle.  Generally speaking you &quot;strain&quot; a muscle.  When you sprain/strain a muscle you damage the muscle fibres - you stretch, break, bruise, mash, etc the tissue of the muscle.  When you damage the muscle tissue (soft tissues) you will then get inflammation.  </p>
<p>What is inflammation?  It is essentially a fluid.  What's in the fluid?   The fluid consists mainly of a matrix made up of dead cells and repairing or rejuvenating cells.  Initially this matrix of cells is very liquidy - the area of muscle becomes swollen (bigger), hot, painful and difficult to move.  Over time (after about 1 week) the inflammation then becomes thicker and stiffer.  This thicker and stiffer substance is called scar tissue.  This scar tissue has  formed from the initial liquidy inflammation around the injured muscle.  The scar tissue then &quot;patches in&quot; the strain/sprain area of the muscle.    </p>
<p>The scar tissue is just like a scar on your skin, but is like a scar on your muscle.  Your muscle cannot grow new muscle fibers, so it repairs/heals itself with scar tissue that is formed from the initial inflammation.  The whole process, generally speaking, takes about 4 to 6 weeks depending on the severity of the injury.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to other well written replies here : in old Latin they would call inflammation caused by events such as sprain as follows : calor (heat) dolor (pain) rubor (redness) tumor (swelling). They are all basically caused by the infiltration of immune cells (white blood cells and others) to &quot;clean up&quot; any damaged tissue or strained muscle that can lead to loss of tissue integrity. Because​ immune cells from the lymph have to squeeze through to get through the cells lining the lymphatic or blood vessels, they cause this swelling followed by fluid from the lymph accumulating as a result. This causes the pain and redness as well. Once they repair the damaged cells they die or migrate back to local lymph nodes subsiding the swelling. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

</blockquote>
<p>Significant spot reduction of fat isn't a thing.</p>
<p>There was a 2007 study by University of Connecticut that had people exercise one arm for 12 weeks and measured the fat on both arms before and after the 12 weeks, and showed the fat loss was general over the body. There was also a 1971 study that looked at tennis players (who use one arm a lot more than the other) that found both arms had similar thicknesses of fat.</p>
<p>There has been another study from 2007 that suggest a slight link between heavier exercise and minimal spot reduction, but I haven't read that paper or seen it reported in a scientific magazine so I don't have much confidence in that study as evidence spot reduction works.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of really good answers and this will probably end up buried, but for the couple of redditors that do read this. </p>
<p>The geist of everything that's been written is, don't bother with spot reduction, your body loses fast all around at the same time. This is a good enough ELI5.</p>
<p>Bringing the explanation up a notch.</p>
<p>When fat it's first stored, it will go to specific parts of your body first. This will depend on 2 things: Your DNA and your Sex Hormones at that moment.</p>
<p>This makes it possible, for example, if a man gains fat at a period when his estrogen is high ( puberty, environmental factor, medication, disease, etc ) he can put fat in places where woman usually put on fat, on the hips, ass and breast areas.  </p>
<p>A general tendency it's that male sex Hormones creates a tendency towards belly fat and female sex Hormones creates a tendency towards hips, ass and breast. Low on both gives more tendency for evenly distributed fat all around including arms and chin.</p>
<p>Now knowing that there is an order in which your body puts on fat, there is also an order in which the body metabolises the fat. This is the reverse of when you put on.</p>
<p>So here's a practical example.</p>
<p>Let's imagine a man put on some fat when he is 13 years old and got fat is his breast area, because his estrogen was high during puberty. Then at 22 he put on more fat on his belly. </p>
<p>At 25 he wants to lose the fat is his breast because he is self conscious about it. Doing chest exercise will not help. For him to lose the fat in his breast he will have to first lose the fat in his belly and only then he will lose it in his breast.</p>
<p>The order is Last fat In First fat Out ( LIFO ).</p>
<p>Of course keep in mind that rarely does the body put on fat in just one spot, usually it puts on in one place more than all the rest, but we are keeping it simple for the sake of the explanation.</p>
<p>As far as we know right now, there is no way to change the order in which we lose fat. We also don't know how the body identifies which fat cells put on fat last.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are either in anabolic state or catabolic state.  That is to say, your body is absorbing and or storing what you just ate OR you are catabolic and your body is taking from its stores.</p>
<p>These two states are regulated by little messengers in your body called hormones. Certain ones tell fat cells to release energy, others tell them to store. </p>
<p>Thing is, those hormones are released in the blood stream and travel all over the body. You can't really pick and choose where they go.</p>
<p>When you are anabolic, those hormones tell fat cells &quot;hey bro, we have more energy floating around than we need, store this up for later.&quot;</p>
<p>When you are catabolic, those hormones say &quot;hey we need more energy, hook us up fat cells.&quot;</p>
<p>This is also why it's hard to gain lean muscle but not fat. You have to be anabolic, your muscle cells need to be all like &quot;we are swole bro, we need protein.&quot;</p>
<p>So your anabolic hormones will be running around storing up anything, proteins in muscle cells AND energy in fat cells. </p>
<p>It becomes a tricky but not impossible line to walk.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blood circulates everywhere all at once, only definitely passing through the heart and lungs in a particular order (edit: and the gut to the liver). Different areas of fat can have different quantities of receptors for different hormones. Some cells are more sensitive to testosterone or estrogen or cortisol or insulin or adrenalin or whatnot than others. This is why your ass gets fat but your forehead doesn't. Which receptors go where is determined by both genetics and environment/lifestyle.</p>
<p>How fat you get is determined by how many excess calories you eat. How many excess calories you eat is determined by your hunger. Your hunger is determined by a lot of things, but the hormones leptin and ghrelin, which turn off and on hunger, respectively, are the big two. Leptin sensitivity seems to be closely related to insulin sensitivity. Insulin sensitivity seems to be closely related to viceral fat, particularly liver fat. Liver fat is mostly a function of fructose and polyunsaturated fats, but alcohol contributes, too. The fructose and alcohol because they're processed there, the fat because unsaturated fats are unstable and oxidize readily and the liver holds on to those rancid fats until it can decontaminate them, which it's not that great at.</p>
<p>It gets more complicated from there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The salaries of celebrities (be it an athlete, actor, musician, etc) have outpaced those of traditional workers/employees precisely because celebrities aren't traditional workers. Celebrities attract unique attention, and that attention can be leveraged and monetized. And over time, celebrities have gotten better at leveraging that attention, and brands/companies have gotten better at profiting from it. It has, in other words, to do mainly with visibility. </p>
<p>Someone who is 'traditionally' employed by a company gets paid relative to the role they occupy, to what they're tasked with. An athlete might be hired and paid in a similar fashion, in theory, but the key difference is that their role, and what they're tasked with by default has an <em>audience</em>. This makes them more valuable, in a number of ways. Put simply, celebrities exhibit desirable talents and traits in a very visible way. Because these talents and traits are desirable, and often idealized, what celebrities commonly do plays upon emotions. </p>
<p>Musicians and actors give a voice to what people are feeling, or wish they could themselves say, or how they wish they could look or behave. Athletes exercise physical and mental acuity in sports, pull off great feats, etc. And because sports have over time become popular to the point that they're tied to people's identities and dreams, they likewise act as an example of who people wish they could be. TV personalities and models and whoever else also offer a fantasy or a target for people's aspirations - how they want to look, how they want to behave, how they want to be seen, how they want to live. And on a lighter note, all of these people offer entertainment and even distraction.</p>
<p>So you might see how this can all be monetized. What marketing does is play into people's emotions - &quot;Buy (x) to be more attractive,&quot; &quot;Buy (y) to be faster&quot;. And to attach a product which plays upon these desires to a person who epitomizes them? Doubly powerful. As for more traditional jobs, no one is idolizing a lawyer sitting in their office working on a brief. No one (or not many) people are going to want the clothes <em>that lawyer</em> is wearing, or go see a movie that lawyer is in, were they somehow, for some reason, hired for a role in a movie.  </p>
<p>What's interesting about today's world, though, is that we're basically seeing experiments in this. In today's world, a lawyer can start a youtube channel. A teacher can have an instagram. They can find the people who might in fact idolize them, want to be like them, live like them. I think that's great. Maybe they won't be handed a $30-mil a year contract, but they can certainly find ways to make money. There are people in all walks of life and professions making a pretty penny by way of the platforms out there, and the attention they can net. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Increasingly, salaries are tied to how replaceable we are rather than anything about how hard our job is or how much work is involved. Cleaners work very hard and long hours, but you can get someone else in to take over a job immediately with little training if someone quits, so they are paid crap money. Doctors/nurses/teachers are always in high supply because they are jobs that people want to do regardless of the pay, so they don't get paid much either. </p>
<p>Celebrities that bring in lots of money for companies because of who they are as individuals are quite hard to replace. If you don't pay Dwayne Johnson enough to do the job you can't get another Dwayne Johnson. With movies, particularly, up until around the 60s (not exactly sure) there used to be a studio system where an actor/musician/director/writer etc. would sign a contract with the movie studio and they couldn't do a film for another studio until their contract was up or the studio allowed it - it's a bit like comic book movie franchises at the moment. Because actors were contractually tied to studios they couldn't demand ridiculous salaries or threaten not to make the movie, and when there are only a handful of studios the bidding wars can't really get that high when contract renewals come around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The correct price for any product or service is the highest price the market will bear. Econ 101.</p>
<p>As actors/athletes/anyone stipulate that they are worth $X, and a studio/team/employer pays that, then that's the going rate.</p>
<p>If the movie is a runaway blockbuster, or the team wins the championship, that contract is likely to be renewed or extended. The price goes up.</p>
<p>If the movie flops, the player tanks, or (more often) the latest/greatest star/player is coming up and will work/play for less, out with the old, in with the new.</p>
<p>In the movie and sports business, the &quot;market&quot; is inflated relative to Joe Schmoe, but as long as the studio/team is making money, the price will be paid. And the staying power of a few &quot;stars&quot; (Alex Rodriguez, Jennifer Aniston) that exceed the standard curve are not indicative of the more &quot;rank and file&quot; members of the group. They are &quot;sure bets&quot; and are worth a premium. Look at the average career of an MLB/NFL/NBA/etc player, or how many &quot;huge&quot; roles an &quot;average&quot; actor had. Those &quot;careers&quot; are short, perhaps sweet.</p>
<p>The &quot;A-list&quot; is incredibly small, even compared to the  small group of people that make it to the mainstream level. They are paid well above a &quot;market&quot; rate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wells Fargo was fined $185 million for identity theft in relation to those practices. </p>
<p>Charging the fired employees with criminal charges of identity theft leads to a very big problem for whoever wants to prosecute that - the fired employees have already claimed numerous times that this was company practice, and that they were pressured by management to do it. Those employees who did not do this were forced out or fired. Furthermore, Wells Fargo has already seen civil damages from this and has also paid off members whose accounts were affected. Any prosecutor who wants to charge the fired employees before the company itself is going to have a very hard time explaining that decision to anyone.</p>
<p>The employees were acting in their capacity as Wells Fargo agents at the time of the identity theft. The case would be different if an employee were fired and then continued to make new accounts in other people's names. It would be different if a person was employed by Wells Fargo, but was doing this in their own home at 11 pm on a Saturday, off the clock. But they were literally doing what management told them to do while they were on the clock - create this number of new accounts, no matter how you do it, or you're fired. Management is legally responsible for the consequences. Wells Fargo, the corporation, is legally responsible for the consequences. Why would anybody go after the individuals?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This is the only thing I've come up with on the topic so far. It seams reasonable that one's body would benefit from a release of energy for homonal/repair/immune function that does happen during sleep; however, I traced the reference chain back finally back to an Ayurvedic medicine writer, and haven't found any peer-reviewed empirical research on the topic (yet), so I think the jury is still out on this one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

This is mainly due to the same mechanism that governs &quot;fight or flight&quot; and is intended to provide awareness against predators or other threats. The endorphins are released slowly compared to a situation where you are immediately in danger, and the supply lasts longer. As you remain awake, the sensation of awareness is heightened at the expense of a larger crash later, when the supply runs out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

If you combine the &quot;E&quot; and the &quot;t&quot; you get something that sort of looks like a modern ampersand. After years of use and changing cursive styles, we ended up with the modern ampersand. You can see how the form changed over the years in this picture: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#/media/File:Historical_ampersand_evolution.svg" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand#/media/File:Historical_ampersand_evolution.svg</a></p>
<p>The origin of the word &quot;ampersand&quot; is interesting too. The character used to be included at the end of the English alphabet, so it would be recited by schoolchildren. And people also used to say &quot;<em>per se</em> _____&quot; when referring to a letter that could also be a word. For example, you might say &quot;<em>per se</em> i&quot; so as to not confuse people that you're referring to yourself or that you mean &quot;eye.&quot; As a result, schoolchildren would say &quot;and <em>per se</em> and&quot; when they got to the end of the alphabet, which often got slurred to &quot;ampersand&quot; the same way children now often think it's &quot;Olive the other reindeer&quot; (instead of &quot;all of&quot;) or they pledge allegiance to the flag and &quot;The Republic Forwhichistan&quot; (instead of &quot;for which it stands&quot;).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the time of medieval Latin, paper was super expensive, so to save space, there were many symbols which were used to shorten writing. Some for common endings or prefixes (like con-/com- or -ibus, which were actually the same symbol for some reason), some for whole words. Et was written in a single symbol, the Tironian et. This symbol was the ancestor of the modern ampersand.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, this is also the origin of the ˜ in both Spanish and Portuguese. The only difference is where exactly they put the mark (before vs on vs after the affected sound). Now in Spanish, it indicates palatalization of the consonant*, and in Portuguese, nasalization of the vowel.</p>
<p>*Palatalization is sort of like adding a y before the vowel. It's very common in Russian, where any consonant can be palatized depending on the vowel after it. For a good example of palatalization, think either the Russian word for 'no': 'нет' /n^(j)et/ or any Spanish word with the ñ, I'm sure you can think of examples.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

So, say Bob and Jim are writing a script for a movie, and then Chris comes along and does a rewrite, and Steve cleans it all up before final approval.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What is the harm caused by drugs?</p>
<p>1)  People get addicted</p>
<p>2)  People do bad things while high, because their judgment is impaired; and</p>
<p>3)  People commit other crimes to finance getting high.</p>
<p>How is the criminalization of drugs contributing to the harm caused by drugs?</p>
<p>1)  By making it illegal we make it more difficult for people to access care services to get off drugs.  By making it illegal we punish people and make their lives actively worse (i.e. job loss, jail, social stigma) when they are most in need of help to quit and in the best position financially and socially to quit.  We thus keep people on drugs and make it harder to quit.</p>
<p>2)  By making it illegal we limit the options people have to enjoy drugs in a safe environment.  Imagine if you could only get drunk in a public park as opposed to at a bar or your home (and once again because of the punishments we apply to drug addiction many addicts cannot own a home due to job loss).</p>
<p>3)  By making it illegal we drive up the price.  This means that an addiction is extremely expensive when it could be extremely cheap.  There is no reason why, on a month's salary from McDonalds, you couldn't buy the equivalent of a million dollars in heroin at today's prices.  If we produced this shit at scale and more efficiently we could make the price basically zero and eliminate the need for people to commit crimes to be able to afford it.</p>
<p>What harm is caused by making drugs illegal?</p>
<p>1)  Huge financial expense to enforce drug laws.</p>
<p>2)  Criminal gang wars for control (see the mob wars and prohibition)</p>
<p>3)  Huge numbers of drug users in jail (also at a huge expense).</p>
<p>4) Huge amounts of money going into the hands of hardened criminals who finance corruption of politicians, murders, etc. </p>
<p>In short... it causes more harm to make it illegal and making it illegal increases the harm it causes, than simply letting it be legal.</p>
<p>Frankly I would have the government give out free drugs at government owned facilities.  Get your heroin, get a room for the night, and enjoy.  But before you get your fix, a nurse kindly looks at you and says &quot;Bubz, you sure you don't want to get clean?  I'll stay with you, set you up with a job, your own place...  Life can be a lot better than it is... if you want it.&quot;</p>
<p>Edit:  I stupidly forgot another catagory here...</p>
<p>What GOOD is done by drugs being illegal:</p>
<ol>
<li>We hope that we reduce the number of people who become addicts.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the same reasons prohibition was a failure - the War on Drugs makes an already dangerous situation much worse.</p>
<p>By making drugs illegal you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a black market with enormous financial incentives - this is why the war on drugs can never be won. There is an ENORMOUS demand, and by restricting the supply, all you do is drive up the price/profit margin - this means that there is a ton of easy money to be made, as long as you're willing to take the risk. Someone, somewhere, will always be willing to take that risk. </li>
<li>Cause most of the violence related to drugs - enormous profits mean people will go to extraordinary lengths to protect those profits - this is why people are willing to use violence to protect/increase their market share. Think of alcohol as one of these dangerous drugs (it's one of the very few addictions whose withdrawals alone can kill you) - when's the last time you saw violence between beer vendors?</li>
<li>Make it harder for people to get off drugs - you direct the money you could spend on treatment to police/prisons instead, which leads to the next point...</li>
<li>You lose an extraordinary amount of human capital - locking people up means they're not working. It also means that their family has lost a father/mother/brother and leads to children growing up without parents.</li>
<li>You actually cause a lot of the deaths with the more dangerous drugs - when it's illegal, there's no quality control. Consider heroin - heroin addicts very rarely die from an acute heroin overdose. They know exactly how much heroin they need to get their fix. What kills them is when a drug dealer spikes their batch with fentanyl (or other drugs more powerful than heroin) to make their batches last longer, or to get a reputation for a powerful product. It'd be like accidentally drinking 24oz of Everclear (95% alcohol by volume) when you thought you were just drinking a couple of beers. </li>
</ul>
<p>Just think of it in the exact same terms as prohibition. It's a war that can't be won because of the enormous demand, and driving the market underground means that instead of reputable companies providing a consistent product, you've got gangbangers doing whatever they can to make a quick buck - including purposefully killing people to get a reputation of &quot;having the strongest stuff&quot;. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not my thoughts, but I copied this from a comment by <em>Frater Plotter</em> on an article by Prof. Johnathan Adler about federal drug policy that he posted on the  <a href="http://volokh.com/posts/1234812396.shtml" target="_blank">Volokh Conspiracy blog</a> (before it became part of WaPo) in 2009. I repost this comment from a stranger because I could not say it better myself:</p>
<p>The biggest problem with prohibition is that it is a straightforward infringement of liberty. What substances my neighbor chooses to put into his body is not my business. To borrow a phrase from Jefferson on religious freedom, &quot;it neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg.&quot; </p>
<p>However, as with many infringements of liberty, prohibition also creates social ills, which may be observed even by those who do not consider liberty an adequate inherent good. </p>
<p>First among these ills is the cost of enforcement. This includes the cost to taxpayers of policing drug production and use; the cost of trials; the cost of imprisonment or parole enforcement. These costs are substantial and are easily reckoned: consider that one-quarter of persons imprisoned in the United States were convicted solely of drug offenses (production, possession, or dealing). </p>
<p>A second social ill is the lost productivity of the imprisoned. This is an indirect consequence of enforcement. My present salary is in six figures; if I were to use illegal drugs and were convicted and imprisoned, I would lose that job, and the economy would lose my contribution. This ill does not end with the end of a prison term, as ex-cons are typically unable to find jobs that allow them to make as large a contribution as the un-convicted. </p>
<p>A third ill is the creation of a black market. The black market is outside of the legitimate economy and thus represents economic activity that is not taxed -- or, in many cases, recorded at all. If a man chooses to spend $50 on a quantity of marijuana or cocaine rather than of wine or tobacco, he creates a &quot;leak&quot; in the flow of money from the legitimate market to the black market. Money laundering and other forms of economic corruption are created to lift the leaked money back into the legitimate economy. Thus the black market corrupts the legitimate market. </p>
<p>A fourth ill is the creation of high-risk, high-reward economic opportunities in the black market. The more effective enforcement is at restricting the supply of illegal drugs, the higher the prices will go -- and thus, the higher the reward for successful drug production, smuggling, and dealing. Larger risks can only be absorbed by truly desperate individuals (who turn to drug crime in the perceived absence of alternatives) or by increasingly large and well-defended operations: drug gangs. Thus, prohibition ends up financing the creation of large-scale criminal operations: organized crime. </p>
<p>The consequences of organized crime are many, including violence; but one of them deserves special notice as a fifth social ill of prohibition: once there is organized crime with a revenue stream, the corruption of enforcement authorities becomes a necessity. Broadly, organized crime cannot exist for a substantial length of time without the consent of the cops: either by abandoning their duties (letting the gangs &quot;own&quot; a neighborhood because it's too dangerous to patrol) or by explicit corruption (being bought off). In some cases -- even in one small, quaint Massachusetts town where I used to live -- the police become an active part of the black market, moving and dealing illegal drugs. </p>
<p>(It's worth noting that many people lay the blame for some of these ills upon drugs rather than drug prohibition. However, recreational and addictive drugs which are not illegal do not create these ills: the owners of liquor stores and bars do not engage in shootouts, nor do they generally need to buy off the cops -- except, of course, in places where a scarcity of liquor licenses is used as a means of extortion.) </p>
<p>A sixth ill is the degradation of other rights to make enforcement easier. This includes the weakening of the rights to be secure from search and seizure, the increase of police violence, as well as the degradation of the right to freedom of speech and of the press. (For the latter, see the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act, which forbids the publication of information relating to the manufacture of a controlled substance.) </p>
<p>A common rebuttal is that some of these social ills would follow from the prohibition of anything, even of acts that are themselves violations of rights. (For instance, organized crime can exist amongst thieves as well as amongst drug-smugglers.) </p>
<p>This is, to an extent, true. However, the cost of many of these ills depends on the prevalence and profitability of the crime in question: and illegal drugs are vastly more profitable than theft. It is reasonable to say that the social cost of theft would vastly exceed the cost of &quot;theft prohibition&quot; -- so prohibition is a good bargain. The cost of drug prohibition, however, vastly exceeds the cost of drug use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so I was victim of identity fraud.</p>
<p>Here's how it went down, I'm Dutch though so it maybe different wherever you're from.</p>
<p>About a year after I moved from The Hague to a smaller town, I got a letter in the mail from a debt collectors office stating I hadn't paid bills for an iPhone 6 by a certain provider. Two things: I did not own nor have I ever owned an iPhone 6, and I had never been with that particular provider. So I called the debt collectors and told them about this. I also asked for any information they could give me, but they couldn't release an info at that time. So then I called that provider and explained what had happened. They couldn't give me very much info, but they were able to tell me that my passport had been used to sign the contract, no payments had ever been made, and the adress given was an adress I've never lived at. They couldn't tell me what the exact adress was but they were allowed to disclose the street name to confirm I did not live there. The provider was going to start an investigation and adviced me to file a report with the police additionally. </p>
<p>I looked up the street on Google maps and found out it was very close to the building I used to live. I lived in student accommodation then and I highly suspect it was an employee in the facility. I had never shown my passport to anyone, I wasn't social in the building at all, I had also never lost it. I did however, have to leave a copy at the front desk. So yeah.</p>
<p>I filed a report with the police and any charges from the provider against me were dropped. I never found out who it was.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I got a bank card in the mail once I didn't open, called to cancel and it was like an online bank I'd never heard of. No clue. Cancelled it before anyone could do any damage with the online account, because card has to be activated first anyway. Apparently this was a test to see if my info is valid before moving on to harder pulls because this online bank is mostly used by students for building credit or something and its easy for ANYONE to get approved no matter credit score. I then put in a police report, filed fraud with that banks fraud department, and I changed all of my passwords immediately. Even reddit. I also monitor my credit religiously, which helped me learn a lot more about it, and I've boosted my score to like top 1% of users. All in all, if you don't pay attention and aren't knowledgeable you can get screwed over pretty quickly. I always check for card scimmers at stores too, and worry about Target or Home Depot hacks like near the holidays. I always try and pay cash on Black Friday or doing holiday shopping now and for like a month before and after. Basically never use my cards at any stores October to January if I can help it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
