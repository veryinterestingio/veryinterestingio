		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it:
In both experiments, there was a drive (lasers in Monroe's, microwave pulses in Lukin's) that causes a change in spin state of a system (Monroe: a chain of ytterbium ions; Lukin: defects in a diamond). In both cases, the spin states of these systems revert back to their original state. However, the drives were periodically applied, and the resulting spin state oscillation did not match the periodicity of the drive, but oscillated at 1/2 or 1/3 the frequency.</p>
<p>(I may have misunderstood this - I'm a biologist, not a physicist. Please correct me if so).</p>
<p>What I don't understand is - if the periodicity of these systems is a result of the periodicity of the drive, and not a product of the systems themselves under specific conditions, why is this <em>spontaneous</em> breaking of time symmetry?</p></div></div>

To say that the remaining discrete time translation symmetry is spontaneously broken is to say that the Hamiltonian (which governs the evolution of the system) still has time translation symmetry with period T (i.e. H(t+T)=H(t)), but the <em>state</em> of the system only obeys a lower symmetry, in this case |\psi(t+NT)&gt;=l\psi(t)&gt;. We then would say that the time translation symmetry with period T was spontaneously broken to a time translation symmetry with period NT.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's quite a few different tactics used to keep produce fresh during transportation and storage:</p>
<p>Temperature  - Just like your fridge at home, produce is kept cool (generally not  frozen as the formation of ice crystals damage plant structure). Lower  temperatures cause chemical reactions, and thus life itself to slow  down. Both the produce itself and any fungi or bacteria that can spoil  the produce are slowed down preventing the food going off.</p>
<p>Humidity  - Many living organisms are reliant on water to survive, and reducing  humidity either by refrigeration or direct removal of water from the  surrounding air inhibits fungal and bacterial growth.</p>
<p>Removal  of spoiling organisms - As discussed above,  fungi and bacteria spoil  produce. After picking the produce may be simply washed, sprayed with  biocides or exposed to gamma or UV radiation to reduce or destroy fungi  and bacteria on the produce.</p>
<p>Maintaining  a sterile environment - Again those major spoiling agents come into  play again. Once they have been removed, these organisms need to be  prevented from infesting the crop during transport. Sterile gases free  of oxygen can be pumped around the produce, inhibiting the growth of  aerobic spoiling organisms. Alternatively, biocides can be sprayed onto  the produce or even a simple wax coating (common for citrus and pome  fruits) inhibit the growth of spoiling organisms.</p>
<p>Picking  unripe produce - Produce is picked at a stage where it isn't ripe, but  is fully capable of becoming so by itself without any input from the  plant it was picked off. When the still unripe produce is approaching  its destination, plant hormones such as ethylene introduced to induce  ripening.</p>
<p>Crop genetics - The  genetics of the crops themselves affects how long they take to ripen and  how long they can last before becoming overripe. For example, crops  with the genes for reduced ripening hormone production were selected so  the produce ripens slowly, unless humans artificially introduce these  hormones when we want them to ripen.</p>
<p>These  improvements (in particular refrigeration) are highly effective and  have enabled the globalised food economy we see today. Often the apples  you eat in Spring and Summer are ones picked from the Autumn before,  stored in cooled sterile warehouses and induced into ripening in special  lorries on the way to the supermarket.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're kept cold.  Sometimes they are literally frozen for the travel to the destination and then unfrozen before they're packaged and sent to supermarkets.</p>
<p>They're often bagged or otherwise sealed.</p>
<p>They're swathed in nitrogen and other gases which means there's almost no oxygen to attack them (oxygenation is what destroys a lot of things on the planet, including food, steel, etc) and which either prevent ripening or, in some cases, induce ripening in things that were picked way before they were ready to be ripe.</p>
<p>And most food lasts way longer than 2-3 days anyway, you're only seeing the end-point after already it's been transported.  If you picked it fresh, it would likely last an extra couple of days anyway.</p>
<p>Stick an apple in a cold sealed tupperware box and it'll last days longer than if it's just sitting out somewhere - I've had apples last weeks and sometimes into months just by sitting on the bottom drawer of my fridge.  That's how people used to survive the winter, after all.  Apples will last a season and still have edible goodness (though you might want to mash, stew and preserve stuff to last you out for the end few weeks).  Any fruit or veg that has a sealed skin will do the same in the right conditions because the air can't get to it.  Pears stay &quot;unripe&quot; (hard) for weeks if you store them right.</p>
<p>Same with bread (if you get bread that crusts nicely and seals itself fully, like some Italian breads, they are basically air-tight inside and survive the hot weather and for much longer than the open, fluffy, crumbly breads that we are used to in modern supermarkets), cheese (lasts almost forever in the right conditions), carrots, potatoes, etc.</p>
<p>It's all about reduction of surface area, reduction of interaction with the oxygen in the air, and reduction of moulds and bacteria by keeping cool (though for some foods this is positively encouraged - e.g. cheeses, salamis and salted hams which crust over to form an air-tight hard outer shell which means the stuff inside stays good... salami and similar meats are often bought with a &quot;good&quot; mould all over the outside of it).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A small addition to all the other answers: another factor that makes fruit spoil at home is that you store different fruits together. Some fruits, such as apples, naturally release ethylene gas while ripening, which accelerates other fruits' ripening process a lot. It's better to store apples (and kiwis) separately from other fruits and vegetables for this reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Old injuries and irritated joints often have some amount of inflammation on a constant basis. The air pressure kinda squeezes them constantly, so your body gets used to &quot;this amount of inflammation/pressure is fine.&quot; When a storm front moves in, the air pressure drops like a rock, without the &quot;usual&quot; amount of compression, the inflammation gets way worse than usual and that makes it hurt a lot.</p>
<p>Bonus fun fact: cats are pretty good at predicting rain for the same reason! If a cat is washing over the back of his ears a lot, there's probably a pressure front coming in; the cat is trying to get his ears to pop!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The claim that weather and barometric changes cause joint pain is a longstanding and widespread myth. There isn't any conclusive evidence to back it. <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/359/bmj.j5326" target="_blank">In fact, there are large-scale studies that don't show a correlation between weather and pain</a>.</p>
<p>My personal belief is that it's primarily due to the mood and mental related aspects of poor weather. It's a downer when things get really dark, wet, and cold. This changes the way peoples brain modulate pain signals, and leads to them experiencing more pain.</p>
<p>Source: I'm a physical therapist. Patients ALWAYS complain when it goes from being nice out to being stormy, but they rarely complain about increased pain when it goes from stormy to being nice out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Things are opening up, and blood is getting where it needs to go very easily because your muscles also help squeeze the blood around. Also your brain is drugging you with endorphins which help you to return to calm after working out.</p>
<p>When you are stressed to the point that your heart rate is increasing, none of those other muscles are helping. You're just sitting there making your heart work harder. None of the blood vessels are opening, so there's just so much more force required to push all that blood just with one little heart. Also your body is flooded with cortisol, a corrosive hormone that causes fight or flight feelings basically. You want to run away, and your body is preparing for that, but you're not going to run away, so it hurts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, Proxima will become a type of star which cannot exist in the universe at the moment, but not until long, long after the Sun is but a cool stellar ember.</p>
<p>Red dwarf stars, like Proxima, are frugal with their fuel and can also use far more of it, proportionally, than larger stars can. They aren't picky eaters, they're slow eaters. The Sun will be a planetary nebula in around 6-8 billion years, but Proxima will be unchanged from how it is today. It works on a completely different timescale, that of trillions, not billions, of years. At the upper edge of estimates, Proxima may get up to eight trillion years out of its hydrogen.</p>
<p>Proxima will never fuse helium. As it ages, it contracts. Fusion rates try to decrease with declining hydrogen concentration, but the contracting star increases core pressure. Of course, being convective, Proxima doesn't have a core, and we don't think one will emerge even as the star contracts. This means its central pressure is ultimately limited by lower temperatures: Convection is an efficient way of moving heat to the surface.</p>
<p>The star becomes a low mass blue dwarf, a spectral type of O or B, and very rich in helium. While more powerful, it is still quite feeble. To the spectroscope, it will appear to be a Wolf-Rayet star, but anyone who can measure its mass will realise it is much too small for this classification.</p>
<p>It will remain like this for a few billion years before fusion begins to fade away completely. The star will cool through blue, white, yellow and back to red. Eventually it's just a really massive ball of helium, looking much like a gas giant planet, but for its lack of hydrogen and its very high mass.</p>
<p>No grand event signals the end of its life, no great nebula nor mighty flash. It just fades and cools, becoming a helium ember.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Sending an image</strong> is a kind of file transfer. It uses a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), which is connection oriented. Essentially, all hosts (i.e. both you and your friend's computer, or each computer and a server in discord's case) care about what is being transferred and if it was done so correctly.</p>
<p>It does this by sending both the image itself and a 'hash'. The hash is just the image data sent through a particular algorithm resulting in a string of what appears to be gibberish. However, the receiving computer can run the payload (the image you sent) through that same algorithm and compare the hashes. If they match, the image was sent completely without error. If not, the whole thing must be sent again.</p>
<p><strong>Video Streaming</strong> typically uses some connection<em>less</em> protocol (like UDP). In this kind of interaction, both hosts don't care what is being sent or if anything is lost. If some packet doesn't make it or is damaged, it just moves on to the next like there isn't an issue. This is considerably faster but you will inevitably end up with packet loss (and stuttering/blurriness) unless the connection is perfect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So many incorrect answers here...</p>
<p>So, assuming the same quality of picture (but live video calls are often sent at far lower resolution which makes for exponentially smaller sizes);</p>
<p>If you send a picture, barring some still-image compression that gets the thing down from (say) 10Mb to 1Mb, you send the <em>complete picture in full detail</em>. If you send another picture, that is a completely different thing and that whole picture is also sent <em>in full detail</em>.</p>
<p>With video, you send a key frame (full picture) and then video compression sends only the differences from one picture to the next, which reduces the amount of information hugely. A new key-frame may be sent every few seconds, or key fragments may be sent as a rolling-update sort of deal.</p>
<p>There are other factors too, platform dependant, which may or may not apply;</p>
<ul>
<li>Live video/audio traffic may (very likely) be prioritised over text or static pictures because it doesn't matter if a picture or text arrives 5 seconds late, but even half a second late for a video or audio frame is useless.</li>
<li>Video/audio may be captured at low resolution / bitrate compared to the full quality of a static picture.</li>
<li>The frame rate may also be low, you assume 30fps but with a bit of cunning you can make 15fps look quite acceptable, that's half the data rate right there.</li>
</ul>
<p>You'd be amazed what even H.264 can do with 1080p30 video, it can get it down to 64k/sec (nominal bandwidth of a normal landline voice call) - so knock that video call down to 720p and 15 fps and you knock \~75% load off (or get 75% better video), with more modern encoders tuned for the task at hand (EG knowing it'll be a talking head and static background) you'd be amazed at how good that could look over a 64k link.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During a video call you can use compression very effectively because only a few pixels change from one frame to the next. Basically you're not sending 30 full images per second, but just the changes between frames. The quality requirements are also much lower compared to a photo that you're sending.</p>
<p>Secondly, the connection has already been established, so it's just streaming data. If you send a  single photo, your browser has to establish a new connection to the server to upload the image, and when that has finished, the client needs to establish a new connection to download the image, and there are delays associated with that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can sort of chunk the history of US nuclear weapons safety into a few broad categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1940s through early 1950s: The early weapons were <em>very dangerous</em> once assembled. They had very few safety protections. They could be set off by lightning, fires, what have you. The main safety precaution was that the nuclear core of the weapon could be removed from the non-nuclear components and stored separately. So the odds of them going off were very low, because they weren't assembled until they were intended to be used. So in a sense these were very dangerous weapons (once assembled!), but very safe the rest of the time. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1950s through 1960s: The development of &quot;sealed-pit&quot; weapons made it so that the cores were now permanently part of the weapon. Safety procedures were relatively poor but not terrible — there were &quot;<a href="http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Mk-39-ready-safe-switch.jpg" target="_blank">ready/safe</a>&quot; switches that would interrupt the firing signal if it was sent inappropriately. They started adding &quot;environmental sensors&quot; that would making a firing order unlikely to complete if the weapon wasn't under &quot;realistic&quot; war conditions (like falling through the air). They did tests to try and make sure that if one of the conventional explosives did go off, the weapon was &quot;one-point safe&quot; and unlikely to generate a nuclear yield. (Not all weapons designs were, and sometimes engineering &quot;hacks&quot; were used to make them safer. One warhead had a reel of neutron absorbing material inside of its hollow core that could be withdrawn upon use; it turned out that this made the warheads very unlikely to fire correctly and they all had to be fixed.) This was a time of <em>many</em> nuclear accidents, fortunately none of which generated a nuclear yield. But it came close-enough that people started to worry about it very seriously in the late 1950s, and start creating better regulations and engineering guidelines to make them safer.</p>
</li>
<li>1960s to the present: Continual review of weapon safety, integration of technologies meant to make accidental nuclear use very unlikely, such as using insensitive high-explosives that basically won't detonate unless you set them off in exactly the right way. The integration of Permissive Action Links (PALs), electro-mechanical &quot;locks&quot; on the weapons, so that unauthorized use can't occur. Better creation of &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;weak&quot; links to make it so that under adverse circumstances the weapon won't possibly have a nuclear yield. Etc. I don't want to make it sound like everything from the 1960s onward was super safe — some warheads weren't — but they started taking this very seriously and started taking advantage of safety techniques so that they could be pretty sure that no matter <em>what</em> you did to a nuclear warhead, you wouldn't get a nuclear yield unless you were authorized to get one and were using it under the right circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a very readable overview of this history, see Schlosser's <em>Command and Control</em>. For a video version, Sandia National Lab's three-part <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQEB3LJ5psk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;list=PLouetuxaIMDrht4F8xiS4AY-oLvCq77aA" target="_blank">Always/Never</a></em> does a great job of explaining it, with the engineers and physicists who were involved talking about what they did and what they were afraid of happening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very simple explanation:  </p>
<p>So the core is required to be compressed in order to achieve a real nuclear blast. The core is a ball of reactive material, like plutonium. It is surrounded by shape charges that blast inward.
Out side of that is material that add to all detonation, but not relevant here.  </p>
<p>In order to to achieve total detention every shape-charge must be activated at the exact same time to press the core as small as possible.   </p>
<p>This requires a timing trigger since the wires aren't all the same length.  </p>
<p>The trimmers are what are placed in the weapons to &quot;arm&quot; them. At that point they are dangerous.  </p>
<p>Before that, if one was compromised it would be a fairly light conventions detonation with some radioactive debris. If that debris is in an underground silo, it's not so bad (from a contamination view) since it's contained.    </p>
<p>There are all sorts of safeguard based on material choice for housing, etc. But basically these things area designed not to detonate without the timing trigger being manually installed and activated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few ways to keep them safe:</p>
<ol>
<li>The nuclear material isn't inserted into the bomb until it's time to use it.  The result of an accident would be a conventional explosion.  The USAF transports nukes around the country all the time, but since those are practice flights, the core is not inserted.</li>
<li>The nuclear material is a sub-critical mass, and requires a <strong><em>very precise</em></strong> explosion to compress it into a critical mass.  If you watch video of the &quot;Trinity&quot; test (the 1st nuclear explosion), you'll see small pockets of asymmetry as the fireball expands.  Even with the most precise calculations and care while building the bomb, a few micro-seconds of delay by one segment during the explosive compression can significantly alter the outcome.</li>
<li>The use of a booster, such as deuterium or tritium; technically, the explosion <strong>would</strong> be a fission process, but the yield is smaller without the booster.  A &quot;Dial-A-Yield&quot; nuke might produce a 5kT explosion, but injecting deuterium/tritium into the core just before detonation can yield 50kT.</li>
<li>&quot;Fail-Safe&quot; devices in the electrical circuitry.  &quot;Little Boy&quot; and &quot;Fat Man&quot; required that the man arming the bomb removed wooden plugs and inserted metal plugs in their place, thereby completing the electrical circuit necessary for the bomb to detonate.</li>
<li>ICBMs have many fail-safes engineered into them, and most are classified.  A missile might detonate in a silo or a sub's launch tube, but that's not a nuclear explosion.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I answered a very similar question recently. So I'll take the liberty of plagiarizing myself:</p>
<p>Genealogical companies that trace your ancestry use ambiguous terminology to make you think they're that good. The methods they are not so reliable, and vary greatly from company to company.</p>
<p>Roughly how it works is, they get your DNA, they take a look at a large number of locations on your genome, locations thought to vary between ethnic groups. Then they compare your results to a reference library, basically a DNA database, that they built over time. They build such libraries by different methods that aren't really that clear, because they don't disclose too much information about it. But the general idea is that they go around the world and take the DNA of people with deep roots in a given region like a bunch of families that are known to have been in one region for a long time. They find similarities between these people at those locations on the genome or &quot;loci&quot; and they Label these common denominators as a marker for a given region.</p>
<p>So as you can see, the results they give you are only as good as the accuracy of their reference library. And this library is built with not so accurate methods (like partially with self reports for example, a family could say oh we're hardcore Scots, we been living in this land for a thousand years, but too many people want to believe that about themselves, doesn't make it true). Sometimes a whole group of people who lived in region A for thousands of years migrate to another region B a couple centuries ago and stay there, they still make it to the reference library as people of region B. So that's one giant problem with their approach, another is that they look at a limited number of locations in your genome, they don't sequence the whole thing that would be too expensive. So they're missing a lot of info. That's another issue. Yet another problem is they use mathematical algorithms to actually compute percentages based on your results but the algorithms are kept hidden as a &quot;trade secret.&quot; So we don't even know how good their algorithm is.</p>
<p>So when you get results that say you're 30 percent British, it doesn't necessarily mean one third of your DNA came from there. It just means 30% of the locations in your DNA they looked at, they think are quite common in Britain, because the people they first looked at in Britain think of themselves as very British. People migrate way more than you think, and these &quot;markers&quot; of a given area, are just statistical estimates, these markers could also exist elsewhere, they have not looked everywhere on the globe.</p>
<p>Edit: Wow, I comment on many ELI5 posts, first one I get silver for, thank you kind redditors. There's an overwhelming amount of replies, it will take some time to respond to them. I'm at work, but I'll try to get back to you guys asap. Just a few quick clarifications though:</p>

<p>The results these companies give you are likely to be accurate, qualitatively (where you could have roots from) but not quantitatively (how much of your family tree originates from a given region, percentages). I'm a scientist, so when something is inaccurate quantitatively, I dismiss it altogether. So that's a point to bear in mind.</p>

<p><a href="https://phys.org/tags/methane/" target="_blank">Methane is a relatively potent greenhouse gas with a high global warming potential</a> of 72 (averaged over 20 years) or 25 (averaged over 100 years). </p>

<p>What that means is that in the short term, each ton of methane is as damaging as 72 tons of CO2.  But in the medium term of 100 years, it is &quot;only&quot; 25 times as bad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>A 'greenhouse gas' is any gas that produces the greenhouse effect in the atmosphere. Some greenhouse gasses have a stronger effect than others, this is why they are all compared to CO2 for simplicity.</p>
<p>It's important to understand that these gasses have differences, Methane for example produces a stronger greenhouse effect but also decays faster - although it decays into CO2.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The numbers indicate the scale degree. i is the first note of the scale, ii is the second, etc. Which means you have to know the notes of the scale. Maybe you understand that now from other responses. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, how do you determine which order to play them?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You play them in the order the song requires. Or if you're writing a song yourself, you order them how you want to get a particular sound. There are many possible chord progressions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I have taught college music theory for 5 years now and when students come in that are there to satisfy a fine arts requirement as a core class, they struggle with this as well.</p>
<p>My best recommendation is to think of a scale as what notes are “allowed.”</p>
<p>What notes are involved in a C Minor scale?</p>
<p>What notes are involved in a C Major scale?</p>
<p>Once you have those notes, you can build chords using the 1,3, &amp; 5 starting from each scale degree.</p>
<p>Don’t forget the Roman Numerals may or may not be capitalized depending on their chord quality. </p>
<p>In C Minor the 1 = i
In C Major the 1 - I</p>
<p>So each of the corresponding chords up the scale will reflect a capital or lower case depending on whether or not it’s major or minor.  And in the case of a diminished chord, there will be a degree symbol.  Like it’s 70° &lt;</p>
<p>Best of luck, first step is to be able to spell out your scales whether major or minor.  Start there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Roman numeral notation is fairly straight-forward. The numbers determine the scale degree the chord is built on, and capital/lowercase letters determine the quality of the chord. So for an example, a V chord is a <em>major</em> chord build on the fifth degree of the scale, while a v chord is a <em>minor</em> chord based on the fifth degree of the scale.</p>
<p>For your example you state the i chord is C minor. So we'll take the notes of the C minor scale (C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C) and use those notes as the root of every chord. Which gives us:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Roman numeral</th>
<th>Chord</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>i</td>
<td>C minor</td>
<td>C Eb G</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>II</td>
<td>D major</td>
<td>D F# A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iii</td>
<td>Eb minor</td>
<td>Eb Gb Bb</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iv</td>
<td>F minor</td>
<td>F Ab C</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>V</td>
<td>G major</td>
<td>G B D</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>VI</td>
<td>Ab major</td>
<td>Ab C Eb</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>VII</td>
<td>Bb major</td>
<td>Bb D F</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This example ends up being a little wonky with the mix of sharps and flats, but that's what each roman numeral in your title would mean. If it helps, the proper chords for the key of C minor would look like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Roman numeral</th>
<th>Chord</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>i</td>
<td>C minor</td>
<td>C Eb G</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iidim</td>
<td>D diminished</td>
<td>D F Ab</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>III</td>
<td>Eb major</td>
<td>Eb G Bb</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iv</td>
<td>F minor</td>
<td>F Ab C</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>v</td>
<td>G minor</td>
<td>G Bb D</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>VI</td>
<td>Ab major</td>
<td>Ab C Eb</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>VII</td>
<td>Bb major</td>
<td>Bb D F</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As for the order you play them in, you would simply play them however it's written. If a song you're trying to play says to play the chords iidim - V - i, then you would play (assuming we're still in C minor) Ddim, G major, and C minor in that order. If you're writing a song on your own, then you can put them in whatever order you'd like based on what sounds good to you or what sound you're trying to go for.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First we have to know what scale we're playing. Since we're starting on a C minor we will assume that we're playing in C natural minor (also known as C aeolian, C minor or Cm scale). The C natural minor scale consists of the notes</p>
<p>C - D - Eb - F - G - Ab - Bb - C - D - Eb - F - G - Ab - Bb - C (etc.)</p>
<p>There are reasons for this but to keep this post from getting thrice as long let's settle for &quot;because that's just what a C natural minor scale is by definition&quot;.</p>
<p>The roman numerals represent the chords that belong to these notes.</p>
<p>So I is the chord beloning to C, II is the chord beloning to D, III is the chord belonging to Eb.</p>
<p>If we want to build this particular chord then what we do is we take the root note, the note that is two positions to its right (The &quot;mediant&quot;), and the note that is four positions to its right (The &quot;dominant&quot;. so two more positions from the last one). Example: Our III chord in C minor consists of the notes Eb, G and Bb. This chord is known as &quot;E flat major&quot; also known as &quot;Eb chord&quot;, &quot;Eb triad&quot; or just &quot;Ebmaj&quot;.</p>
<p>Why is this chord &quot;major&quot;? In an eli5 sense the best thing I can tell you is &quot;A major chord has 4 semitones between the root (in this case Eb) and mediant (in this case G) and 7 semitones between the root (in this case Eb) and the dominant (in this case Bb)&quot;. If it were a minor chord then these distances would by 3 and 7 instead of 4 and 7.</p>
<p>For clarity: A semitone is the distance between two tones on the twelve tone &quot;chromatic&quot; scale. So it's the distance between two adjacent keys on the piano or between two adjacent frets on the guitar.</p>
<p>A little trick that might help you cheat this logic: If the roman numerals are in upper case (III) then the chord is Major. If they are in lower case (iii) then the chord is minor.</p>
<p>As for your last question of how do you determine which order to play them... That is a point of study that'll require a good 1000 pages of reading. If you want the quickest and easiest rule of thumb: Chords like to either move up or down by a fifth (That is four chords to the right or four chords to the left. So from C to G or from C to F) and they like to move up or down by a third (That is two chords to the right or two chords to the left. So from C to Eb or from C to Ab). They like moving down more than moving up.</p>
<p>But that isn't to say that these are the only &quot;legal&quot; moves&quot;. Any note may follow any note and any chord may follow any chord, it's just that moving by thirds or by fifths (and especially downward) is something that chords just enjoy doing. The reason that they like doing this is if they move by third or fifth then the new chord will contain notes from the old chord. Eg. If you move from your i chord (C, Eb, G) to your VI chord (Ab, C, Eb) then both of these chords will contain the notes C and Eb. This gives a nice familiar feeling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
