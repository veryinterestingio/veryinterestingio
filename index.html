		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, PhD student here. Excess fat in adipose tissue stresses out the cells. When they have too much lipid in them, they release cytokines. Sometimes they burst and call in macrophages to remove the debris, also releasing cytokines. This becomes systemic and you have a constant low grade inflammation throughout your body. Over time, this constant inflammation interferes with insulin signalling (Insulin signalling is what controls your blood sugar and is very important in preventing diabetes). It prevents proper activation of a key signal transduction protein called IRS-1 and also interferes indirectly in downstream processes. This is why you are more likely to get diabetes when you're obese. Your liver is one of the key organs affected by insulin . When your signalling goes wonky, the excess fatty acids from your diet and the fat you make through lipogenesis either gets stored in your liver, giving you steatosis (or a fatty liver) or gets exported into the blood stream through the use of very low density lipoproteins (or V-LDL or the &quot;bad&quot; fat). This LDL is small and can stick to the insides of your arteries, giving you high blood pressure or artherosclerosis, putting you at risk for a cardiac event. If you have diabetes, this is even worse as the constant high blood sugar damages the heart tissue making you less likely to survive the attack. When you treat the obesity early enough, you can heal the damage and have a much better quality of life. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Adipose tissue is hormonally active.  It converts androgens (like testosterone) into estrogens.  High estrogen levels disrupt ovulation and cause ovarian cysts (hence polycystic ovarian syndrome's association with obesity).  They also encourage endometrial proliferation, leading to endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Insulin and glucagon are the main hormones that signal the energy state of the body; more insulin is released when there's plenty of energy available, like after you've just eaten. Glucagon is the opposite. So obviously if you're gaining weight you're probably spending a lot more time in that high-insulin state, and vice versa. The connection to insulin resistance is hopefully more intuitive in that context, though the actual mechanism of insulin resistance is more complicated, and other factors like exercise definitely are involved.</p>
<p>As for other health effects, well for example you have the protein-fat complexes that carry fat through the blood (because fat is water-insoluble, it needs some carrier). The configuration of those complexes that are more common when someone is overweight is more likely to deposit its lipid content inappropriately inside blood vessels, which is when atherosclerosis gets really bad. Basically the fat transport system is more busy sending fat into storage than bringing it out of storage to be metabolised (burned for energy), and then some of that fat in transport can end up &quot;spilling&quot; in the wrong place. The other mechanisms involved in atherosclerosis are, again, pretty complicated, but at least this should give you an idea of why it's connected to obesity or weight loss at all.</p>
<p>(Those protein-fat complexes are often called &quot;cholesterol&quot; but that's actually inaccurate. Cholesterol itself is a specific molecule that's fat-soluble but pretty different from normal fat. It's also pretty harmless and continually being produced by the body)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Positive physiologic changes associated with weight loss aside, I would say that one giant benefit to weight loss is that when you DO ultimately get sick and end up in the hospital (as we all will at some point), it is literally just easier to effectively take care of a normal sized person. Morbidly obese patients generally seem to experience much longer and more complicated stays because it is physically harder to take care of them due to their excess mass: </p>
<p>Harder to turn to prevent pressure ulcers, higher risk of some various tube getting dislodged when moving between beds, difficulty or complete inability to use some forms of medical imaging because of excess fat, harder for the patient to physically move and rehabilitate themselves, harder to secure an airway, harder to ventilate with a machine, harder to get IV access, harder to get an effective systemic drug concentration achieved, harder to clear drugs that are fat soluble, harder to resuscitate if they have cardiac arrest, harder to operate on, harder to keep wounds clean.

It is not weight loss that is beneficial it is fat or adipose tissue loss.
Adipose tissue is starting to be recognized as an endocrine (hormone secreting) organ. Which is totally true. Fat/adipose tissue stores and secretes a lot of hormones such as estrogen and steroids among a bunch of hormones. It also contributes to insulin resistance (diabetes) and the complications that come from that.
Fat is bad, muscle is good. Weight loss matters if you are talking about decreasing the amount of fat you own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This feature of linearity is by <em>choice</em>.</p>
<p>What we found from experiments is that a simple (classical) one-to-one mapping of system states to observable states is an insufficient framework. Some states of our system do not appear to be observable states, but they are &quot;combinations&quot; of observable states. What kind of combinations though? The simplest hypothesis is that they are linear combinations of each other. If you want I suppose you could try out a non-linear framework, but this would get very hard very fast. We understand linear systems much better theoretically and computationally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As with most mathematics in science it is used for mathematical convenience, and any “meaning” behind the approach is applied after the fact, since humans crave intuitive causalities (and thats how we publish papers). </p>
<p>That being said, newcomers just can’t stomach the above because it sounds too “trial and error” and they would rather believe QM (or any aspect of science for that matter) is founded on a principled approach to understanding nature. How cute. </p>
<p>Hilbert spaces are successful in describing what's objectively and reproducibly observed in Nature; period. In other words, the Hilbert space is precisely the mathematical structure that is needed to describe matter, from quarks and leptons up to neutron stars. That's why it's used.</p>
<p>Still not satisfied? Ok let’s pretend science isn’t trial and error.  Hilbert space is the only normed linear space that has an inner product. In Quantum Mechanics, inner products of two states represent transition amplitudes from one quantum state to the next. So these transition amplitudes are orthogonal projections of one state onto another. Quantum Mechanics uses the inner product feature of Hilbert. </p>
<p>Remember that measurements in Quantum Mechanics are linear operators on the vector space of quantum states. For each operator there is an orthonormal basis of eigenstates (eigenvectors of the operator). The idea of orthonormality only makes sense in a Hilbert space. These eigenvectors are the possible states that remain after a measurement. When measuring a property of a quantum state, the outcome of the measurement is uncertain. It can be any of the eigenstates of the linear operator. The square of the probability that the measurement will land in a particular eigenstate is the Hilbert space inner product of the quantum state with the eigenstate. So the full suite of features of Hilbert space are used. </p>
<p>How convenient :) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Under both the probability distribution and vector interpretation, there are a number of operations one would naturally want to do such as computing expected values, lengths, and angles.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have different types of acne, so it’s really difficult to just talk about one cause and propose one treatment to get rid of it.</p>
<p>Very broadly, you have three types of acne: comedonal acne, inflammatory acne, and drug-induced acne.  I’ll just focus on the first two, because that’s what most people are concerned about.  </p>
<p>The root of most acne lies in the hair follicle.  Your skin produces oils called sebum to lubricate your hair and skin.  These pores can become clogged and produce comedones (which are your “blackheads” or “whiteheads” depending on whether the comedone surface has been oxidized by the air).  If you want to treat comedonal acne, you need to use a topical retinoid (which is a derivative of Vitamin A) and this will interfere with sebum production.</p>
<p>Now in other cases, these plugged pores can become a site where bacteria take up residence, and this leads to pustules, papules, cysts.  This is inflammatory acne.  At that point, you need to add an antibiotic or two along with a retinoid to attack both problems.  So you really need a doctor to classify what type of acne you have before you can figure out what treatments you need.</p>
<p>Most people have acne in their teenage years because they have higher levels of steroid hormones (e.g. estrogen or testosterone) which promote sebum production and the development of comedones.  As their hormone levels stabilize through puberty, sebum production will level off.  I’ll leave it to the dermatologists to tell you the best ways care for your skin.  But aside from medications, you want to keep your skin clean and moisturized at a level where you’re not allowing sebum to build up, but your skin is also not too dry and cracked that your skin bacteria can invade and cause inflammatory acne.  Finding the balance can be difficult.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Washing your face with the wrong soap can dry your skin out and cause it, but another soap can make your skin oily and cause it.
Washing too often can be an issue, but so can no washing.
Your diet can cause your skin to produce more oil, and exercising while often a way to clear your skin can also cause it.
A lot of what causes acne is thought to be genetic, but there's also strong arguments that it's environmental.
So without being able to pin down one exact cause you can only treat it, not prevent it outright- think of it like the common cold. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This creates acne deep in the skin where topical products cannot really reach it &amp; do not help much. </p>
<p>Isotretinoin (AKA accutane) treats all (?) forms of acne. It’s a pill, typically taken twice daily for a set number of months. The dosage is calculated by a dermatologist. Most people see permanent results. Head over to r/accutane to see some before &amp; afters. </p>
<p>Edit : so many replies. TL;DR - isotretinoin can be great. It can also cause unwanted, possibly long lasting side effects. Speak with your derm about concerns if you’re considering it. A dr will be able to recommend what’s best on a case by case basis. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

2) oil production: amount of oil produced by the skin.
3) bacterial flora: which kind of bacteria and the proportion of them living normally in the skin.</p>

<p>We are in a warm period of that ice age called an interglacial period, which is why it isn't as cold as you think of an ice age. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned below, the main cause of these big swings in climate are <a href="http://climatica.org.uk/climate-science-information/long-term-climate-change-milankovitch-cycles" target="_blank">Milankovitch Cycles</a>. The first-order parameters which govern how warm cold we are are either external or internal. Externally, the energy the Earth receives from the sun can vary because of (1) the sun's energy increases/decreases - the sunspot cycle; or (2) our position relative to the sun changes. As mentioned below, this is a mix of our axis angle, how wobbly the Earth's spin is, and how circulate or elliptical our orbit is. Together these change how much energy the poles get, especially the north pole. As a result, longer colder winters allow snow to fall, not melt, and glaciers to form and grow.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There's a difference as well between ice age and glacials. Some people think that they're synonymous, but often Ice Age refers to the Pleistocene, a period in which lots of glacial-interglacial cycles have occurred. Using the term glacial or interglacial is the best way around this for what you mean. They cycles of glacial - interglacial - glacial used to occur every 40,000 years, but more recently have occurred every 100,000 years. This includes cooling, full glacial conditions, and a warming to the conditions we see now - an interglacial.</p>
<p>The last glacial maximum - when ice covered much of Canada/N America, Scandinavia etc peaked about 25,000 years ago, followed by warming.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An ice age is occuring whenever the Earth has large glaciers covering its surface. So with the Artic and Antarctic frozen over we are in fact in an ice age right now. During an ice age, the climate swings between glaciation periods and warmer intermediary periods. We left the latest glaciation period roughly 12,500-10,000 years ago and are now in an warmer interglacial period.</p>
<p>Due mainly to changes in the Earth oribt, called Milankovitch Cycles, we could expect to enter a new glacial period in roughly 10,000 years. However, due to human caused global warming, it seems ever more likely that we might actually cancel not only the next glaciation period, but the ice age as a whole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You mean glacial periods.  The best theory i know if is based on the Milankovitch cycles, which are astronomical cycles of the Earth's angle of obliquity, orbital eccentricity, and precession of the equinoxes.</p>
<p>The idea is that a glacial period starts when insolation (energy received from the Sun) at 65° North is at a minimum, and that interglacial periods begin when insolation at 65° North reaches a maximum.</p>
<p>For example, precession of the equinoxes means that every 12,500 years or so the hemisphere whose singer coincides with perigee flip.  So every 25,000 we have one insolation maximum at 65° North and so on.  (Glacial periods typically last three equinox precession cycles.  Interglacial periods typically last about half an equinox precession cycle.  The other cycles are involved.  Also, these aren't very smooth cycles, as there are lots of interactions with Jupiter making them non-linear.)</p>
<p>Now, why 65° North?  Because there is more landmass in the northern hemisphere.  Ice that accumulates on the sea can move and melt if it moves towards the equator, but ice on land does not.  So if  land ice accumulates all year long - that is, if it doesn't melt in the spring! - then it will accumulate more, and here comes the killer point: once you have land ice year-long... the Earth gets shinier (albedo goes up) and reflects more of the Sun's light, thus making it colder.</p>
<p>The vicious cycle of ice accumulation ends in massive drought, which causes less precipitation, so less ice accumulates.  Eventually, during an insolation maximum, ice begins melting in the spring and summer, the cycle reverses, and we get a virtuous cycle that warms up the Earth and speeds up the melting.</p>
<p>It's been like thus for a couple million years, but the particular cycle lengths and patterns have changed.</p>
<p>FYI, we're just about due, if not overdue, for a glacial period.  This has been a long interglacial period, but not so long that it must be one of the log ones.  There have been two interglacial periods in the last 700ky that lasted closer to 50ky than the more typical 12ky - 18ky.  We night get lucky and miss a glacial period right now.</p>
<p>As i understand it, glacial periods set in very quickly.  It takes thousands of years for ice to get a mile thick in New York, but only a few hundred for glacial weather patterns to set in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several contributing processes, some periodic and some not. This is why ice ages differ in severity, and have glacial and inter-glacial periods as these various processes are in and out of sync. I've seen others mention volcanism as well as changes in ocean current patterns. Sunspot cycles affect the amount of radiation (energy that becomes heat) that reaches earth, and therefore contribute to ice age patterns as well. More notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles" target="_blank">Milankovitch Cycles</a> describe periodic changes in earth's axial tilt and orbital eccentricity, which affect the amount of solar energy that penetrates our atmosphere.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the composition of our atmosphere can affect the severity of all other causes of earth's climate cycles, because certain gasses are more effective at retaining solar energy. Anthropogenic CO2 is interrupting an existing ice age right now, and unambiguously causing global average temperatures to increase at an absolutely unprecedented rate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Corruption happens for lots of reasons. Think of each file as a million light switches. The order in which the light switches are on or off tells the computer what is inside the file. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If the light switches were stored I'm a giant steel box then whenever you went to look at them they would be in the same order. In a perfect world, someone could open that box, copy the order of switches into a new box, and then close their box for a perfect copy. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Imagine if you started to copy the switch order to a new and something interrupted you, or the box you were copying from was removed. If this was towards the end of the switches, you would think you might think you had a copy, but would be missing pieces of it.  This is how files can get corrupted while copying though most programs have a method to verify the switches were copied correctly.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>When something on your computer is running, it stores those switches in a temporary box that is really fast to change, but also really sensitive. Imagine if you shook the box with a bunch of rocks in it. Theres a chance that while you're shakeing the box, one of the rocks would hit a switch and change it at random. This is what can happen with data while it's in memory, sometimes background radiation can hit one of the electrons and change it. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Every time you save or retrieve data there is a chance that someone along the line some piece of hardware will incorrectly read the data or incorrectly write the data. Computers do a lot to check if this happened and correct it, but occasionally something will cause an undetectable issue and that is viewed as corruption.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Underneath the model of digital signals, it's really an analog world. Circuits assign meaning to low voltages (zero) and high voltages (one), but voltages near the middle will look like zeros to some circuits and ones to others. Circuits have amplifiers that try to take small analog errors on their inputs and eliminate them, driving outputs back to voltages that are clearly ones and zeros. However, these circuits are themselves built in an analog world, where the threshold between ones and zeros, amplifier gains, transistor saturation, logic function delays, power supply voltage and similar characteristics vary due to manufacturing variation, focusing error, microscopic dirt on the chip and the like. Signal-to-noise ratios are kept normally high enough that digital errors are rare, but variations from ideal behavior large enough to cause errors happen. Most computers make no attempt to correct individual errors in computation, except for data stored in memories and possibly in caches.</p>
<p>One particular problem that leads to corruption is circuit delays. As discussed above, after manufacture, logic circuits have varying delays for many reasons as described above. We build computers to be fast. Really fast. Really, as fast as we can make them. We rely on clock signals to capture logic signals once the circuits have computed a result, but a circuit that's too slow will cause the wrong answer to be captured when the clock signal arrives. That's why overclocked computers can result in corruption - they're being operated beyond the point at which the logic signals have settled to their stable values.</p>
<p>Disk drives have servo circuits that try to keep the read and write heads on tracks for the best signal-to-noise ratio, and when the heads are little out of place, the drive reads values that are a little off, and once a written zero comes back as a one, or vice versa, raw data has been corrupted. Disk drives in particular rely upon error-correction coding, so individual  errors and some combination errors in the raw data can be detected and corrected, but once the error rate gets too high, that corruption gets passed out of the disk drive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Software programmer here! There are two main types of corruption: hardware and software. Hardware corruption is when hardware malfunctions, and can be from anything the hardware wearing out to losing power in the middle of things. However, software can also get corrupt through programming bugs.</p>
<p>When you write software in C and C++, you have direct access to the computer's memory. You can literally ask the computer to allocate a certain number of bytes for you. However, the cost of this level of control is that you have to give the memory back to the computer when you are done. Not doing so results in a memory leak, where your program takes more memory the longer it runs. On the other hand, corruption results from giving the memory back to your computer and then using it afterwards, giving it back to the computer more than once, or using more memory than the computer gave you.</p>
<p>Say you ask the computer for enough memory to store four numbers. Then immediately after, you create an unrelated integer, x, and set it to 7. Then you tell the computer that the fifth number in your list of four numbers is 3. You go to print out x, and are surprised to find its value is set to 3, even though x was never changed from 7.</p>
<p>In the above example, information was stored in an unexpected area. But the reverse can occur too, information can be retrieved from unexpected areas. Hackers attempt to do this intentionally to access secured information, and this is how the Heartbleed vulnerability occurred. However, probably the most famous corruption example in history is caused by this as well: MissingNo from Pokemon.</p>
<p>The Pokemon game ended up with extra storage for the list of Pokemon types that exist in the game. MissingNo is seen in the game by exploiting bugs that cause the game to access this data and interpret it as if it were a Pokemon. These unused Pokemon were named &quot;MissingNo&quot; but their graphical data was never set to anything.</p>
<p>In C and C++ at least, when data is not set to anything, instead of the data being cleared and set to 0, the data is whatever data was stored their previously. It's not random exactly, but it is likely to be nonsensical in the current context. Imagine if a program that sorted pictures of vegetables came across a picture of a cat. The picture of a cat isn't random, but it is meaningless to a program expecting pictures of vegetables. When the program attempts to treat it as if it is a picture of a vegetable anyway, this results in interpreting the data in a seemingly random way. We refer to this random-ish data as garbage data. Pokemon trying to interpret the garbage data as actual Pokemon sprites is what causes MissingNo type corruption.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These regions are in a band of latitudes known as the sub-tropics. There is a large circulation of air know as the Hadley cell, in which air rises near the equator and descends in the sub-tropics. When air descends in altitude, the pressure increases and the relative humidity goes down, making the air drier. This also helps explain dry regions of Mexico and Australia. Clouds and rain are very unlikely to form in these regions because of this constant supply of dry air. This also happens over the sub-tropical ocean regions, causing less rain there.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Diesel is a very heavy fuel, it's a large hydrocarbon; you can think of it as a very light oil. When it gets cold enough, it turns to jelly - so diesel fuel systems are insulated and have heaters for winter use.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This large hydrocarbon burns really hot - and really slow. The whole point of heat engines like sterling engines, steam engines, and internal combustion engines - which include jet engines, are hot expansive gasses provide pressure to perform work.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So since diesel is a lot of chemical energy stored, it produces a lot of cylinder pressure for a long time. To take advantage of the slow burn, diesel engines have a long piston stroke. This means these engines produce torque, force rotating about an axis, for a long time compared to a gasoline engine which both burns faster and has a shorter stroke.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>How slow does diesel burn? The fastest diesel engines rotate at 5,000 RPM. Any faster, and you'll be dumping still-burning diesel down the exhaust manifold. That's destructive, wasted energy. By comparison, F1 engines burn gasoline, and the fastest ever built was a prototype for Ferrari by Cosworth with top engine speed of 25,000 RPM. It never made it to competition due to league regulations.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Due to the massive forces a diesel undergoes, and heat, they're built heavy duty and with looser tolerances - to make room for hot, expanding metal components. These things have very favorable durability characteristics. I won't bother getting into the technical nuances, but diesel engines found in trucks, trains, earth moving equipment, generators, ships, etc, have continuous operating lifetimes of years. Gasoline engines aren't built to these tolerances because the vehicles aren't expected to perform such heavy work (they're not as efficient at it) or last that long. In industry, if a truck starts rusting apart, they just replace the body on the frame, and the rest keeps going.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many good reasons listed in the other posts here. One more reason is that...gasoline will only ignite in a very narrow fuel-to-air ratio, regardless of the load (heavy acceleration vs idling). </p>
<p>Diesels can operate at VERY lean ratios, and air is free. This means when they are idling or under a steady cruise state, they only need just enough fuel to handle the load they are under. Of course if you add too much air, the hot air that is uncombusted can produce nitrides of oxygen (NOx) in the exhaust, which is considered a pollutant. If you purposely or accidentally run a gasoline engine too lean, it will stop running.</p>
<p>Since internal combustion engines are capable of injecting more fuel than they can possibly burn, the maximum power an engine can produce is directly related to how much air can be moved through it. Hot rodders call it an air-pump that needs a little fuel.</p>
<p>Most gasoline engines do not use a turbocharger, but a turbo is such a good fit for diesels, that almost all commercial diesels use a turbo. Since a turbo is a variable displacement impeller, it moves almost no extra air at cruise RPM's, and it is only after higher RPMs are chosen that it will pressurize and pump a significant amount of extra air. This also means that diesels have a very wide operating range in which it provides usable torque. High-power from a fittable size of motor when it is needed, and then very good fuel mileage when a low load is applied.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>“‘A natural home in the ground, large enough for human entry’ is probably the most useful definition. This covers the enormous variety of caves that do occur but eliminates the many artificial tunnels and galleries incorrectly named caves. The size criterion is arbitrary and subjective, but practical, as it eliminates narrow openings irrelevant to explorers but very significant hydrologically, that may be better referred to as proto-caves, sub-conduits or fissures. A cave may be a single, short length of accessible passage, or an extensive and complex network of tunnels as long as the hundreds of kilometers in the Flint Mammoth Cave System. Most caves are formed by dissolution in limestone but sandstone caves, lava caves, glacier caves and
tectonic caves also occur. Marginal
candidates for use of the name cave
include riverbank undercuts and rock
shelters of various origins. In some
countries a cave is regarded as being a
horizontal opening, as opposed to a
pothole, which is a vertical opening. This
usage is common in England but is not
ubiquitous[9]. 2. A natural opening
formed in the rocks below the surface of
the ground large enough for a man to
enter. It may consist of a single
connected opening or a series of small or
large chambers connected by galleries[20].</p>

They form when a rock like limestone begins dissolving from groundwater. I suppose if the water was acidic enough and the flow strong enough that a human would be able to see a difference in the rock surface, but I don’t think an entire cave can form in a humans lifetime. Unless there was a underground karst that wasn’t visible by surface dwelling humans until a sinkhole formed which then opened up into an adjacent cave. I guess you can say that cave formed then, but then again not really because it would have been dissolving and eroding for tens or hundreds of thousands/million of years prior.</p>
<p>Also, I only took geology in undergrad some years ago so I may be wrong about every single thing I just said.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Sudden rock collapses can create caves. A rockfall or rockslide from the base of a cliff could leave an overhang with space underneath. Likewise, there are sometimes caves under large boulders in talus fields, which could be deposited in a single rockslide.</p>
<p>Your more classic limestone caves form slowly through dissolution of  carbonate minerals as water flows through the formation and this is not really something that happens on a human timescale. There are other minerals that dissolve more quickly like salt or gypsum, so for example sudden flow of water through a salt formation could quickly form voids, but it's more likely these would collapse as quickly as they formed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Torque is rotational force. You might be familiar with the unit of measurement, <em>foot-pound</em> (ft-lb). Imagine you're using a 1 foot long wrench to remove a wheel from your car. If you align the wrench horizontally (parallel to the ground) and set a 50 lb weight on the end of the wrench, you're putting 50 foot-pounds of twisting force on the lug nut.</p>
<p>This helps quantify how much force a vehicle can put to the road, or how hard the vehicle can pull. However, having high torque doesn't mean high speed. Construction vehicles have enormous torque to be able to move heavy loads, but don't move quickly.</p>
<p>Horsepower takes this a step further by measuring torque <em>multiplied by engine speed</em>. This gives a somewhat more useful measure for cars, because it represents an engine's ability to apply its torque over time. Two cars might have the same horsepower, but one achieves it through higher engine speed with lower torque, while the other achieves it through high torque with lower speed.</p>
<p>Generally, smaller engines have less torque but can rev higher, while large engines have more torque but cannot reach such high speeds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, lots of wrong answers in this thread. tl;dr at bottom.</p>
<p>Torque is how much twisting (technical term: angular) force something exerts. In the case of a car engine, it's basically how hard the engine is trying to speed the car up (or, specifically, how hard the engine is trying to twist the axles, which is what makes the car move). In the case of brakes, it's how hard the brakes are trying to slow the car down. If you know Newton's Second Law, *force = mass × acceleration*, then the rotational equivalent of force is torque.</p>
<p>The reason that we talk about torque rather than force is because when you want to spin something, where you apply force to it relative to the axis makes a big difference. For instance, with a lever, the farther away from the fulcrum you apply force, the easier it is to make it move, but the slower it goes. Torque accounts for this by saying that something that makes something spin the same amount is the same torque. So the closer you are to the axis (the center you're rotating around, like the fulcrum of a lever), the more force you need to produce the same amount of torque. It's similar to how we measure the speed that a wheel is spinning in rpm (or another similar unit) rather than in how fast any individual part of the wheel is moving.</p>
<p>Forces only exist when they cause or prevent change of speed, and the same is true of torque. More force is required to accelerate something from a standstill, because you have to give it all the inertia of motion. But once it's moving, you only need to apply enough force to counter drag and friction to keep it moving at the same speed. So a car that's cruising at speed is not actually applying all that much torque; the engine would put in the most torque if you press the pedal down all the way from a standstill, or if you slam the brakes.</p>
<p>Horsepower is a measure of power, which is difficult to explain fully without first explaining work. Work is *force × distance*, and measures how much energy is transferred from the source of the force into whatever is moving. The faster something accelerates, the higher the force, so over the same distance, it will do more work. This works out, because the resulting speed is higher, so the moving object has higher energy.</p>
<p>Work is really unintuitive at first, because of how muscles work. Muscles consume chemical energy to exert any force, even just to hold something up. So you shouldn't think of work as how hard you have to strain for something. A better example is a building: a building stays up because, even though gravity tries to pull it down, the forces that hold it together counteract gravity. They don't need to keep spending energy to do so. And since nothing is moving, the total work done by gravity on the building is 0.</p>
<p>Power is a measure of how quickly energy is transferred. The SI unit of power is the watt, which is the same thing we measure electricity with, and that helps understand it. For instance, if you use an electric heater, then the wattage determines how much electrical energy can be transferred into heat per second. More wattage means you use up more energy in a given amount of time, but get more heat out. Horsepower is a different unit of power, but measures the same thing (the exact definition varies, but is usually around 745 W unless you're measuring steam engines in which case it's about 9800 W for some reason I can't explain).</p>
<p>When applied to motion, we already have *work = force × distance*, and then we have *power = work / time*. But *distance / time = speed* (ignoring the technical distinction between speed and velocity), so *power = force × speed*. In the case of a car, the power is the speed at which the car is moving, times its speed. In order to exert the same force on two objects, you have to transfer *more* energy on the one that is moving faster. Remember that the transfer of energy and the force are not the same thing. If we want to talk about torque instead, the same thing comes out once we account for rotational speed (which, again, we measure in units like rpm), we get *power = torque × rotational speed*.</p>
<p>This might seem a bit weird, but the reason is fundamentally because of the fact that kinetic energy (that is, the energy of something moving) is not linear. If you have two objects of the same mass, with the first traveling twice as fast as the first, then the first object actually has four times the kinetic energy than the second. The reason that this has to be true can ultimately be traced down to relativity and to the fact that the laws of physics don't change over time (as far as we know, anyway). But it's also why something traveling twice as fast hitting you can hurt more than twice as much.</p>
<p>This means that the power output of the engine limits the top rotational speed of the drift shaft coming out of the engine, because at some point it is already spinning so fast that the engine can't output enough torque to do anything more than overcome resistance. From there, the drive train and wheels (most importantly the gear ratio, but wheel radius plays an important role as well) affect the conversion of torque into forward force. There is a tradeoff between force and speed. In a low gear, you get high torque but a low top speed, which is perfect for accelerating at lower speeds. In high gear, you get lower torque, so the engine has a hard time accelerating the car, but in exchange it can keep it up at much higher speeds.</p>
<p>tl;dr Torque is how much force is applied to accelerate or decelerate something spinning. We rate car engines with torque, not force, because car engines work by spinning an axle (or multiple axles). Horsepower is how quickly the engine can transfer energy into moving the car.</p>
<p>While it depends on other factors, and the drive train is super important, the horsepower is the ultimate limiter on the top speed of the car. Torque affects how fast the engine can accelerate the car, more torque is faster.</p>
<p>For two engines of the same power but different torque, the one with lower torque will have a higher top speed but lower acceleration. The gearbox lets us convert between torque and top speed, though, so then a lot of the distinction comes into the kind of gears needed.</p>
<p>EDIT: Talked about drive trains and the role of gears and cleared up the summary, thanks to u/constantino1's reply.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I guess because you've used the word &quot;horsepower&quot;, you're only getting answers about cars. Horsepower is a unit of power output that can be used to describe any source of work over time - it is not limited to cars. That is to say that power describes a force applied to move an object over a given distance and time. Power can be measured in horsepower or a number of other units. Torque is a twisting force, or a force applied at a distance from a rotation point. They differ in that power is related to time, whereas torque is not. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Horsepower is power, ideally measured in Watts. I assume you are talking about a car or something similar, so in this case we are talking about mechanical power, but it is the same as electrical power. It is a measure of the rate at which energy is exchanged.<br />
Torque is measured in Nm, and it is the force that is acting on a rotating object, in this case the axle of the car.<br />
By definition the horsepower is the product of the Torque and the rotating speed(rpm) of the object. It is important to note that you can achieve the same horsepower with different torques as long as you have different rpm.<br />
That is what the gearbox of a car does. The engine provides a constant amount of power(horsepower) by rotating the shaft at a certain speed (rpm1) with a certain force (torque1). When you need to go uphill, you need addtional force, so the gearbox use gears of different radii to lower the rotating speed of the wheels (rpm2) and so obtain an higher force (torque2).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
