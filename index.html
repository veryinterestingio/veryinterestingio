		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like no-one has really answered your question so far, especially in regards to the Revolver part of the question. I'll try my best as a former Beatles fanatic.</p>
<p>As you alluded to, Revolver was quite an experimental pop record, and it was the first album where the Beatles REALLY decided to use the studio as an instrument. The wild guitar solo in Taxman played the band's bassist, the backwards guitar in I'm Only Sleeping, the raga banger that is Love You To, and not to mention the psychedelic tape-looped masterpiece that is Tomorrow Never Knows. The Beatles threw brass and string instrumentation all on this thing as well, like in Eleanor Rigby and Got to Get You. Critics and Music Pundits understand the impact and importance Revolver brings forth, and many diehards will say Revolver is their favorite Beatles record. It certainly was mine for the longest time.</p>
<p>Sgt. Pepper, however, was a different beast. In my opinion, it wasn't as musically ambitious as Revolver. However, conceptually, it changed how the artform of the album was seen. Instead of a collection of songs, it was better taken as a whole. All the songs are thematically and musically connected (The Beatles didn't exactly /intend/ this, but intention isn't important), the album art was wildly unique and fed into the album's themes. It was the first REAL album, Pet Sounds be damned (I like Pet Sounds more than any Beatles' album, so hush). This album also came out after the Beatles retired from touring, and after the double masterpiece whammy that was Strawberry Fields Forever and Penny Lane. The hype was through the roof and the Beatles trumped even that. They also won AOTY at the Grammys, which was surreal.</p>
<p>It's a landmark of an album. Revolver is fantastic, and I like it way more than Sgt. Peppers, but it isn't a landmark. Not like Peppers.</p>
<p>EDIT: Umm, wow I was not expecting this sort of response! I wrote this up in about 5 minutes before I ran out to hang with friends, so I know it’s quick and dirty, lacking a ton of history of what lead up to Revolver/Sgt. Pepper’s. I just wanted shine light of that period, so it would easier to do future research! I did want to answer three questions I saw:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What do you mean “former Beatlemaniac”?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was OBSESSED with the Beatles years ago. They were all I listened to for years straight, and I pretty much read every single thing possible about them. Now, I’m way more chill, ha. Still love them to pieces.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You like Pet Sounds more than any Beatles album? Really?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep. The compositions and arrangements of Pet Sounds are transcendent, and the performances of each song are perfect. It’s a flawless album that hasn’t been touched since IMO</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zappa did it first/did it better/The Beatles suck</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zappa was a prolific avant-garde/experimental musician, and unlike the Beatles, he did not make music for popular consumption per se. He did not have the production/engineering chops of the Abbey Road team, and he did not prioritize making layered pop tunes. He made weird bops. He’s a great musician and composer, but he and The Beatles couldn’t be any more different. They affected very different circles. You can believe the Beatles suck if you want tho.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This was an album that brought a very different and original sonic landscape to people who were NOT used to it. Imagine waiting for months for the next Beatles album and listening to THIS. Just imagine waiting and lusting for the follow-up to Revolver with its black and white artwork and getting this colorful sleeve work that features the Beatles as you had never seen them before: long hair, moustaches, in those weird military band uniforms.   </p>
<p>And that's even <em>before</em> you put the stylus over the record...  </p>
<p>Flanger, echo, stereo imaging, distorted guitars, orchestra-driven tracks, tambouras and tablas, the whole this-is-not-the-Beatles concept, even the colorful gatefold sleeve with its who's-that trivia.  </p>
<p>Try to get a hold of a list of the singles and albums that Sgt Pepper was competing against in the famous Summer of Love and you'll understand what kind of departure it was.  </p>
<p>Jimi Hendrix and Beach Boys were giving the Beatles a run for their money, but this album was a huge step forward.  </p>
<p>Now, check the kind and size of influence this album had in the world by checking the kind of songs, artwork, fashion, words (slang even...&quot;turn you on...&quot;) that came AFTER Pepper.  </p>
<p>One of the things that will stick in my mind FOREVER is the use of the word &quot;clutching&quot;, in She's Leaving Home. Have you heard such an usual word in a song ever again?  </p>
<p>For me, personaly, the very first bars of A Day in the Life are hauntingly beautiful. Lennon's voice is just... different. He has such a eerie delivery never again heard or matched (by himself, I mean).  </p>
<p>If you play guitar, for instance (although bass, drums, piano, or singing certainly apply) and try to learn and play these songs, you will even find yet another layer of complexity and appreciation.  </p>
<p>Sometimes you need to tune your strings higher just to be able to match some solos, not to mention you will have a blast (and a hard time) trying to match the sounds you hear with the help of ready-to-go effects pedals, apps, etc, and it's then when you stop taking this music for granted and you start to understand the vital role that people like George Martin, Geoff Emerick (try to read about his recording techniques and his microphone positioning, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Send_tape_echo_echo_delay" target="_blank">Send tape echo echo delay</a>) and the engineers at EMI played in the Beatles' sonic development. Listen to the guitar sounds of the previous albums and compare them to these.  </p>
<p>The harmony work bestowed upon She's Leaving Home is beautiful, but of course you cannot appreciate it with just one listen. Find the main vocal, then try to follow John's harmonies and then George's.  </p>
<p>The cinematic lyrics of Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds leave nothing to chance. You are there, watching the newspaper taxies, no matter which taxis you're familiar with.  </p>
<p>The boldness of including a track comprised of indian instruments right in the middle of this so-called pop album.  </p>
<p>As you can see, I could go on and on. Hopefully, I have already transmitted you a fraction of what this record means to me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know that everyone would agree that Revolver was more experimental. One factor for Sgt. Pepper, is that the mind-bending &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; is (almost) the last music you're left with. I say &quot;almost&quot; because LP listeners back in the day were also treated to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaXnqw-Zv0Y" target="_blank">a chaotic repeating outro track</a>. That leaves an impression.</p>
<p>Add to that the &quot;concept&quot; album factor. While the final album isn't <em>as</em> thematically cohesive as originally intended — the way some of the songs blended into one another demanded that the listener not think of the album as a collection of songs, but as a piece of work in and of itself.</p>
<p>Add to that the presentation. Not only was the cover an explosion of color featuring a gamelike &quot;who's who&quot; of guest stars on the cover, but they really went all out. It opened into a <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-592262012-13bd204b-6f80-41c9-ae3b-c4909338ad1b.jpg" target="_blank">gatefold</a> (even though it wasn't a double album), and included <a href="https://www4.picturepush.com/photo/a/10599742/img/10599742.jpg" target="_blank">cutout badges and extras</a> that made the experience feel more than <em>just</em> a record.</p>
<hr />
<p>TLDR: While Revolver was definitely sonically adventurous, so to was Sgt. Pepper. But in addition to that, it incorporated a conceptual dimension to it and executed it beautifully.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Reactions such as fire and the creation of alloys were found empirically, but never studied like they are now. </p>
<p>There were early theories as to what composed matter, such as the idea that all matter consists of fire, water, earth, etc. But such theories never tried to “explain” reactions other than saying that things were how they were.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston_theory" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston_theory</a></p>
<p>&quot;Phlogiston theory states that phlogisticated substances are substances that contain phlogiston and dephlogisticate when burned. Dephlogisticating is the process of releasing stored phlogiston, which is absorbed by the air. Growing plants then absorb this phlogiston, which is why air does not spontaneously combust and also why plant matter burns as well as it does.&quot;</p>

For example, there was knowledge of what an acid was before the discovery of the atom based on physical and chemical properties, but there wasn't an explanation of what an acidic molecule was like. So a reaction would be run and the scientist would say they made an acid based on testing the properties. A lot of the analysis of products was done by comparing melting point, acidity, relative reactivity, and sometimes even taste (!) to known natural chemicals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like many subjects, chemistry has evolved over time. </p>
<p>Initially things started out as a kind of mythological understanding (i.e. ancient alchemy.) A lack of true understanding lead to people trying to turn various things into gold. We now know that you can't do that, but back in antiquity people had no idea. They knew if you mixed A with B you'd get C. So in theory, you could mix D with E to get gold. You just need to figure out what D and E were. </p>
<p>The ancient civilizations understood that everything was made up of stuff. Originally this was as simple as fire, earth, water, air. Then people started to understand that stuff was made up of other smaller stuff. The word &quot;atom&quot; comes from the latin &quot;atomos&quot; meaning indivisible or uncuttable. Atoms therefore became name for the smallest building block of everything. (We now know this isn't exactly correct. Atoms can actually be further divided.) We went from saying things were made of fire and water to understanding that there were other things (i.e. elements.) </p>
<p>There were varied explanations as to why certain things worked but no real concrete explanation. As time goes on, people start focusing on the <em>why.</em> Experiments were designed to test these theories. For example, wind. We can't really see it, but it is there. We feel it on our skin and see it move the leaves on trees. Well, why does wind move trees? It's probably not the breath of Zeus or the wrath of Athena. There must be something that makes the leaves move.  What are those things? Atoms! What do those look like? There have been many explanations of this: Bohr, Rutherford, Thomson, etc all had theories. Continued exploration eventually figured out that atoms are positive centers with orbiting negative particles and so on.</p>
<p>The more we learned about the composition of the parts of compounds, the more we understood how they work. The more we understood the more we could explain.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So in short, they just kinda BS'd it. Fake it til you make it irl. If you want a more detailed explanation, grab any gen chem textbook. One of the first chapters in most textbooks will cover the discovery of the atom from the simplest models to the current quantum mechanical theory.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>For example: Lead white is a compound that has been synthetically made and used since antiquity in white paints. The preparation for this compound has been described as early as 300BC by Theophrastus. Theophrastus' description says lead was placed in a vessel with vinegar and left until it formed a crust. The crust was then scraped off and the lead was placed back in the vessel and the process repeated until there was no more lead.  The scraped off crusts were dried and powdered andddd bam! You've got paint pigment. Why does this work? They had no idea, but it's how you get white lead. Now we know it's a process called corrosion (aka the formation of a metal oxide.)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>tl;dr Fake it til you make it. Explanations were given based off the information of the time and evolved as the science became more understood. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As similar as those two things may seem, they are quite different. Activated charcoal is generally pyrolyzed, meaning it is heated to high temperatures around 800 degrees C, under inert atmosphere. This process gives a product which is quite close to pure carbon. Non-carbon elements are almost completely burned out.</p>
<p>In contrast, burnt food stuffs often contain a range of byproducts from incomplete burning, most famously acrylamide. These compounds can be distasteful and carcinogenic, but are also responsible for some of those &quot;smokey&quot; and &quot;grilled&quot; flavors that many people enjoy, when subtly present.</p>
<p>If you would pyrolyze blackened food, it would become charcoal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since the difference between charcoal and burnt food is already well explained, I'll only add this:
Activated charcoal is NOT harmless and definitely not encouraged. It is a medicine used after intoxication, because it is a strong adsorbant, meaning chemical substances like to stick to it. However, the charcoal is not selective. It adsorbs basically any substance. That includes any medication you might need (eg birth control or antibiotics) and also nutrients! So misuse can lead to ineffective meds and malnutrition.
If you don't have to take any meds and are generally a healthy human, nothing bad comes from eating activated charcoal every once in a while. On the other hand, there also are absolutely no benefits to eating activated charcoal without a medical condition requiring it.</p>
<p>To clarify: OP didn't say it was generally encouraged, but I'm seeing the recommendation to eat activated charcoal, sometimes even on a daily basis, all over the internet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

At night, we have signals in the brain that make us sleepy; blue light can screw up the release of melatonin. Things like testosterone and cortisol follow this diurnal rhythm.</p>
<p>Sometimes people are forced into abnormal sleep schedules, either by work (shift work) or because they want to stay up playing video games (social jetlag). Military personnel on submarines used to have to stay up for 6 hour shifts and have 12 hours off, to make an 18 hour day.  However, that really negatively affected their sleep schedules and quality of life.  They have switched it to 24 hour work days (8 on, 16 off) and quality of life has improved, as well as mission execution and alertness. People weren't nodding off anymore.   <a href="https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2016/10/28/this-life-changing-shift-has-made-submariners-much-happier/" target="_blank">https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2016/10/28/this-life-changing-shift-has-made-submariners-much-happier/</a></p>
<p>Circadian misalignment, ie sleeping at 2am to 10am every night instead of 11pm to 7am, has been shown to have a lot of negative effects on the body.  Shift workers who work at night have higher rates of heart attacks (possibly from inflammation), diabetes and obesity (changes to appetite hormones and cortisol and metabolism are all possibilities), psychiatric issues, and other things.

<p>&quot;sleeping is thought to help clear out toxins that accumulate in the brain throughout normal daily activities. Beta-amyloid is a protein associated with Alzheimer’s disease is an example of one such toxin. During sleep, channels in the brain expand to allow the flow of cerebrospinal fluid to clear the debris, known as the glymphatic system, due to the similarity to the lymphatic system.&quot;</p>

<p>They dive into the different stages of sleep and why they’re all equally important. Your brain is deprived of Deep REM sleep so, you may need more than the normal 7-8 hours for your brain to make up for the lost cycles, but the quality of those resting hours matters in figuring out how much more. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes it can but not because of the reason you would think. Clouds usually mean updrafts, or vertical movement in the air, as a result to maintain altitude for these short periods of time, the aircraft pitches down in an updraft which results in an increase of airspeed. Same and opposite effect for downdrafts in cloud. Horizontal movement of air in convection (clouds) is negligible. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Female lobsters are typically the ones on the prowl, scuttling around ocean avenues, searching for and visiting multiple dens occupied by male prospects. When she wants to engage, usually with a dominant male, she urinates out of her face to present her pheromones, and when the male gets the signal, he lets her into his den. The female then gets naked—no really—she moults to make relevant parts available. Then the male climbs onto her back, flips her over and internally deposits a capsule of sperm. Interestingly, the sperm capsule or spermatophore hardens into a plug to deter insemination from other males—although this does not stop the female from mating again. As a gentleman wouldn’t kick a naked lady out of his house, the male protects the female for a few days as her new exoskeleton hardens.  They part ways just in time for another female to pee at him. Females can keep sperm for over a year from multiple males. Then, although sperm is deposited internally, actual fertilization occurs externally when the eggs are laid. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Previously the kilograms was based on the mass of an arbitrary piece of metal in France, and companion pieces of metal were made of the same mass and given to other countries as well. It has been discovered that all of these pieces are not as precisely the same as you would like, as well as the fact that radioactive decay is making them slightly less massive all the time. Also with only I think 5 of these in the world, it's very hard to get access to them for tests if needed. </p>
<p>To combat these things and make sure that the mass of a kilogram stays the same forever, they are changing the definition to be a multiplier of a universal constant. The constant they selected was pretty well known but scientists were off by about 4 digits on its value, so they spent recent years running different experiments to get their value perfect. Now that it is we can change the kilogram value, and other base units that are derived from the kilogram. And since this universal constant is well.... universal, you no longer need access to a specific piece of metal to run tests. So anyone anywhere will now be able to get the exact value of a kilogram.</p>
<p>But the mass of a kilogram isn't actually changing, just the definition that derives that mass. So instead of &quot;a kilogram is how ever much this thing weighs.&quot; It will be &quot;a kilogram is this universal constant times 12538.34&quot;</p>
<p>Some base units that are based on the kilogram, like the mole will actually change VERY slightly because of this new definition but not enough to impact most applications. And even with the change we know that it's value will never change again. </p>
<p>Edit : Fixed a typo and change weight to mass because apparently 5 year olds understand that better then weight.......</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: The way we &quot;define&quot; the measurement has changed, but otherwise everything is exactly the same. It's kinda like saying &quot;We used to use the ford focus as the standard &quot;car&quot;. Now we're saying the standard &quot;car&quot; is a vehicle with 4 wheels and is shorter than x meters, etc etc. We went from a physical &quot;standard&quot; to a &quot;virtual&quot; one. </p>
<p>ELI'm Older: The values are the same, only the &quot;thing&quot; we consider the &quot;official&quot; kilogram has changed.</p>
<p>Back in the day, we used to standardize everything by making a really really good and accurate &quot;thing&quot;. For example, the meter used to be defined by a literal bar of metal that was exactly 1 meter long. This was considered to be &quot;THE&quot; meter, the most accuratest meter ever. Same with the kilogram. The kilogram has always been defined by a few different 1 kilogram weights that were given to a bunch of different countries. These weights weighed EXACTLY 1.000000 kilogram (as accurate as we could make it.) (This isn't exactly true but I'm not going to get into it.)</p>
<p>So we used to define the kilogram by an accurate &quot;weight&quot; but those are bad because they degrade and they change depending on temp and humidity etc. But now we're saying that the &quot;kilogram&quot; is exactly how much &quot;weight&quot; can be held up by a certain amount of energy using electromagnets. The energy is defined using &quot;Planck's constant&quot; which is a universal constant. The device used to measure this is called a &quot;Watt&quot; (or Kibble) balance.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibble_balance" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibble_balance</a></p>
<p>So basically we went from a physical block of metal as the &quot;kilogram&quot; but now we're defining it as &quot;X amount of energy will lift exactly 1 kilogram&quot;</p>
<p>This is good because instead of needing this really expensive physical object, anybody can replicate the &quot;kilogram&quot; provided they build a sufficiently accurate machine because Planck's constant is... well... a constant and everyone knows it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the past, the Kilogram was defined as the weight of a particular hunk of metal in France.<br />
Countries would bring their own hunk of metal, and make it so that it weighed the same as the original hunk, and then calibrate their own weights.<br />
This had problems, because the scale might not be exactly accurate, and things like dust would add or remove tiny amounts of weight.<br />
Also if someone accidentally scrapped of a bit of that metal, the kilogram would change.</p>
<p>They changed it to a physics definition.<br />
Now instead of going to France to weigh your piece of metal, you do a physics experiment at home and then compare with that experiment.  </p>
<p>The difference is tiny, so unless you are doing some seriously hardcore physics, you won't notice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thing about antidepressants is that they don't directly oppose depression, but they do enable a state that can allow individuals a way out of their depression, so to speak. Like others have stated, antidepressants are a wide class of drugs ranging from SSRIs to tricyclics to MAOIs.</p>
<p>Some of these drugs have potentially severe side effects and some are quite safe even in overdose. Dosage is the biggest determining factor in the effect of a drug right after its actual binding affinities. There are no cut and dry answers here.</p>
<p>The most commonly prescribed type of antidepressant is the SSRI. This class of drugs works primarily by binding to the serotonin transporter and preventing reuptake. This results in greater availability of serotonin and consequently higher rates of serotonin binding to receptors.</p>
<p>Serotonin has a very complex function in the human body. There are several different types of serotonin receptors all with different roles and distribution in the brain/body.</p>
<p>High doses (see overdose) and you end up with symptoms of what's called serotonin syndrome. These include: agitation, confusion, hyperthermia, and muscle rigidity. </p>
<p>Low doses and you may not feel much different at all. A slightly higher dose and you're likely to feel slightly blunted emotions or perhaps some amount of sexual dysfunction or nausea.</p>
<p>Drugs are complicated and so is the body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the person has bipolar disorder as opposed to unipolar depression and is in a manic state, most anti-depressants will likely worsen the manic state. (1) Different medications may effect the person differently. For example, wellbutrin may cause the patient to sleep even less than in an unmedicated manic state. This might suggest that they could induce a manic or hypo-manic state in someone who had no symptoms whatsoever (for example, a malingerer). The use of anti-depressants in children and young adults until the brain finishes development at around age 25 may actually cause suicidal tendencies, regardless of whether or not the child/young adult has depression. (2) For people with serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, the use of anti-depressants in addition to anti-psychotics is probably relatively safe. (3)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can't even tell what the effect of an anti-depressant would have on an individual depressed person. Some people take a drug and see an incredible turn around in their mental health. Others take the exact same drug, same exact position and problem in life, and it makes them suicidal and lactate milk from male breasts. </p>
<p>But the reality of anti-depressants is their mechanism is not well known. For example, SSRIs block reuptake of serotonin, increasing the amount of the neurotransmitter in the body and brain, and thus improving mood. Simple then right? Serotonin controls mood. You increase serotonin, mood improves!</p>
<p>Except, SSRIS take upto 6 weeks before a patient might feel better. And yet...an increase in serotonin is registered almost immediately. If it was just the serotonin, they would instantly feel better.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29446012" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29446012" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29446012</a></a> this study says that non-depressed people see no change in cognitive functioning, whereas depressed people do. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.afr.com/lifestyle/health/mens-health/what-antidepressants-can-do-to-a-brain-that-is-not-depressed-20150907-gjh8mb" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.afr.com/lifestyle/health/mens-health/what-antidepressants-can-do-to-a-brain-that-is-not-depressed-20150907-gjh8mb" target="_blank">https://www.afr.com/lifestyle/health/mens-health/what-antidepressants-can-do-to-a-brain-that-is-not-depressed-20150907-gjh8mb</a></a> this study on primates suggests negative effects of anti-depressants in non-depressed primate brains, causing permanent (as much as anything is permanent in the brain) changes in structure. </p>
<p>In reality though, the effect is minimal. We know this, because hundreds of millions of prescriptions for anti-depressants have been given out since they arrived. If not billions. If even 1% of those were the wrong diagnosis, that's millions taking them. If millions of people do something for 25 years, you will have evidence if the effects are devastating. </p>
<p>Still, I wouldn't do it. It likely has a subtle effect that is hard to measure. Speaking from personal experience, the chemical composition in your brain has a huge effect on you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It sound like you are good with the idea that if you push an object with a set force for twice as long of a time it will end up going twice as fast. Work isn't based on time though, it's based on distance.</p>
<p>So, let's say you push an at rest object for 10 meters and get it going 4m/s. Then, you keep pushing it for another 10m. However, since it was already moving at 4m/s, it takes a lot less time to cover the second 10m than it did to cover the first 10m. As a result of this, there isn't enough time to speed up as much as happened during the first part. When you do the math, it works out that you would have to push it an additional 30m to double the speed and get it going 8m/s, and this additional 30m of pushing would take the same amount of time as it took to push it the first 10m.</p>
<p>You have to push for twice as long to go twice as fast, bust since you are already moving as you start the second half of the pushing time, you end up pushing for a greater distance than during the first part.</p>
<p>Work, to algebraic simplification, is Force x distance. The Kinetic Energy gained by the object you push is equal to the work you did in pushing it. To push an object from rest and get it going twice as fast, you had to push it four times as far, doing 4 times the work. Thus, the energy must depend on the square of the speed.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can look at the mathematical derivation of it at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy#Derivation" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy#Derivation</a> to get the result fromt interrelation of momentum  You can the the same without any explicit integration</p>
<p>A way to look at it is to try to calculate what energy is need to accelerate a object. </p>
<p>Newtons second law is force= mass*acceleration , F=m *a  </p>
<p>Speed it acceleration times time , v=a*t .</p>
<p>Work is force times distance, W=F*s</p>
<p>To accelerate a object from 0 to speed v  with constant acceleration takes t=v/a. </p>
<p>The average speed of constant acceleration is half the top speed or v_a=v/2</p>
<p>The distance traveled to accelerate the object will be s=v_a *t= t *v/2= v/a *v/2= v *v/(a *2)= v^2 /(a *2)</p>
<p>The total work is W=F<em>s or W= m *a *v^2 /(a *2) = m *v *v/2 *a/a= m \</em>v^2 /2</p>
<p>So from the simple linear equation of moment you can derive that the energy needed to accelerate a object is proportional to the square of the speed.  That is the same as the kinetic energy of the object.</p>
<p>The part that is the reson for the square is that the both the average speed and the time for the acceleration both depend on v and when you calculate the distance traveled you need to multiply them so the result is v^2,</p>
<p>Not exactly a explanation for a five year old but when you start to calculate physics with some equation and get introduced to things like  kinetic energy and  proportional  you will know the other used physic formulas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of Voyager like an arrow. Once fired it doesn't need fuel to keep moving. We aimed it in a way that made it pass by large planets the craft would &quot;fall&quot; towards and using a little fuel can sling shot out from. The Earth appeared the size of 1 pixel while Voyager was 3.7 billion miles /6 billion km and was taken in 1990. Voyager is now 11.7 billion miles/18.8 billion km away moving at 38,000mph/61,000kph.</p>
<p>A light year is 5,879,000,000,000 miles/9.461x10^12 km so Voyager is only 0.2% of a light year away.</p>
<p>The amazing part is that we are able to pick up the signal it is sending. The transmitter uses less power than the light bulb in your microwave. By the time the signal reaches Earth it is only one-tenth of a billion-trillionth of a watt.</p>
<p>Human's can't leave Earth like that for a few major reasons.      </p>
<p>1 safety. There is no way to shield astronauts from radiation or avoid the side effects of weightlessness.         </p>
<p>2 weight. Humans and everything we need to stay alive weigh a lot.         </p>
<p>3 space is huge. The Moon is a 3 day trip, Mars when closest is months. From there you're talking years of travel. And when you get to these places you have to survive them, and they are as extreme as you can imagine.</p>
