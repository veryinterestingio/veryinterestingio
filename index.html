		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know when you throw a rock in a pond and waves expand outward? Turns out electicity+magnetism behave somewhat similarly. If you hit them with energy, they'll wave, and the waves propagate outward.</p>
<p>Now imagine a very long, very narrow canal of water with a wave machine at one end and a guy observing waves coming out the mouth of the canal at the other. As you can imagine, there are lot's of ways to change the wave machine, the the fellow at the far-away mouth of the canal would be able to observe. Bigger vs. smaller waves (this is AM radio), faster vs. slower waves (this is FM radio).</p>
<p>If you want to make it &quot;digital&quot; (i.e. represent just 1s and 0s), you pick two states and only vary between those. If decide to go with fast vs. slow waves (this is called frequency-shift-keying aka FSK), the guy at the end of the canal watches waves and if they're fast, he writes down a 1, if they're slow he writes down a 0.</p>
<p>Now, what if he could faithfully differentiate between 4 different state rather than just 2 -- say, slow, medium-slow, medium-fast, and fast? This would allow the wave machine to send him more information in the same amount of time. We just assign 2 bits to each state now -- slow=00, medium-slow=01, medium-fast=10, fast=11. </p>
<p>What's the limit on adding states?  Well, if the wind is blowing, and it get's difficult to tell the difference between two speeds as they get closer together, we start getting read errors or &quot;bit errors&quot;. There's also a physical upper limit on how fast the wave machine can move the water, and a lower limit on how slow it can go before the waves stop reaching the observer. So each state has to operate within this fixed window.</p>
<p>There's lot's of other tricks that come from complex (as in sqrt(-1)) math, to get more bits through the canal in a reliable way, but that's the gist of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

	</div>

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A volcanic eruption is measured in two constants--gas and viscosity.   For clearance, low viscosity is like squirting water off a nozzle,  whereas high viscosity is like squirting caramel off a nozzle, which takes more effort to do, which ultimately makes it more dangerous.</p>
<p>In geology, there are four different kinds of volcanic eruptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Low Gas + Low Viscosity = A quiet lava flow. </li>
<li>High Gas + Low Viscosity = A fire fountain eruption. </li>
<li>Low Gas + High Viscosity = A dome-building eruption.  (This sort of eruption doesn't reach critical right away.) </li>
<li>High Gas + High Viscosity = A Ring of Fire explosion. </li>
</ol>
<p>These sorts of eruption are impressive enough on land, but in the  event of someone doing some serious worldbuilding, this question puts  three of the four types underwater.  Type #1 has long been confirmed to  happen underwater, but the oceanic differences in temperature and pressure have produced a different result called &quot;pillow lava&quot;.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Is it possible for eruption types numbers 2, 3 and 4 to occur underwater?  If yes, then would the oceanic differences in temperature  and pressure make them look and act differently from how they have acted  above sea level?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All four of those cases you listed depend only on the magma, not whether there's surface water, so yes, all four can occur underwater. <a href="http://www.geology.sdsu.edu/how_volcanoes_work/Hydrovolcanic.html" target="_blank">This page</a> gives a nice summary of hydrovolcanic eruptions.</p>
<p>As you can see it's a bit complicated and depends on the circumstances, how much water there is, the depth of activity, and so on. You will want to read the article to see which style matches what you intend.</p>
<p><del>You can probably safely assume any eruption in shallow water is going to be somewhat explosive and</del> Gas rich lava will explode and generate a large white steam plume that will travel for some distance. Take a look at the videos of Anak Krakatoa just after the recent landslide for an example. Note the dark ash mixed with the lighter steam. <del>Pillow lavas require enough depth and pressure to keep the steam from expanding, because if it's allowed to expand it does so explosively, so you're most likely to see those at some depth.</del></p>
<p>Edit: never mind what I said about the depth. I'd thought lava entering water at shallow depths usually resulted in explosions that shredded it, but apparently that's not the case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The four types you list are not exactly categories as much as they are end-members. Volcanoes can exhibit qualities on the full range between high and low viscosity, and high and low gas content.</p>
<p>There is nothing stopping any of those situations erupting under water, except that high viscosity is usually associated with highly evolved melts that have spent a substantial amount of time in the crust. This tends to be the case in continental crust, because (a) it is much thicker so magma reservoirs have more opportunity to stabilise, and (b) the crustal material is more silicic, so as it is assimilated into the melt it leads to more extreme evolution trends towards viscous (high silica) chemistries.</p>
<p>Because they tend to come up through continental crust the opportunities for them to erupt underwater are much less. That's not to say it doesn't happen. We do get to see <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Pumice_raft.jpg" target="_blank">pumice rafts</a> forming where explosive eruptions have occurred underwater.  Once erupted from the sea floor the eruption plume will rapidly be quenched by the surrounding water. Depending on depth the water pressures will likely collapse any bubbles, leading to the gases going into solution, so you end up with something that looks a lot like a big version of this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtFFmDGIsa4" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtFFmDGIsa4</a></p>
<p>The buoyant stuff like pumice may find itself to the surface (assuming it's not completely water saturated - this will depend on depth) to form a raft like I linked above.</p>
<p>Lava domes below the ocean are likely to act much like the ones subaerially erupted; they'l cool to form a solid crust then gradually inflate as more material is injected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To put it simply, all 4 can happen underwater. Gas or viscosity are irrelevant as to whenever or not water is above the magma source.</p>
<p>Generally you also only have 2 types of reaction between magma and water:</p>
<ol>
<li>The slow reaction. The water is boiled rapidly by the magma which is in return cooled rapidly and thus turned into pillow like rock structure. This mostly happens in an unconfined area, as when the water expands it has enough room to do so.</li>
<li>The explosive reaction. Here the water has not much room. It also boils immediatly, but has no place to go. The surrounding water flows into the area where now the gaseous water is while the gaseous water pushes into where the water was, while due to itself taking more room than the &quot;normal&quot; water. The pressure builds up more and more. Now three things can happen: A. The pressure builds up , while the water cools the magma, the pressure does not built up enough to rupture the surrounding rock. The magma cools and becomes rock and the pressure dwindles over some time. B. The pressure builds up  , while the water cools the magma, but the pressure does rupture the surrounding rock. It either finds some smaller release or simply makes itself some room in the rock. The gaseous water and it's pressure is either contained or released, but we reach no critical pressure to. magma becomes rock or the water escapes/ is contained in the surrounding rock. C. Here is the fun part: The pressure builds up, but has no release and stays contained. More and more pressure. The surrounding rock withstands it over a long peroid of build up resulting in enourmous pressure or the amount of water during contact is quite big. Result; An enourmous explosion, as the rock can't contain the pressure anymore and is violently erupted into it's surrounding.</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, that is atleast as far as I remember that stuff? If anyone has any corrections please tell me.</p>
<p>Edit: tl;dr verison of the reaction</p>
<p>Pressure cooker with water in it (aka the water) secured on top a chunk of molten, hot stuff (magma).</p>
<p>No lit, normal chunk-&gt; boilded water, colled chunk (pillow lava)</p>
<p>lit on, small chunk -&gt; gaseous water in cooker, cooled chunk</p>
<p>lit on, cooker has a small weakness, big chunk -&gt; cooker swells, then the gaseous water burst from the weakpoint, cooled chunk or empty cooker</p>
<p>lit on, cooker has NO weakness, big chunk-&gt; cooker can either withstand the pressure or will EXPLODE as the pressure is too high to contain the water, chunk either cooled slowly, if the cooker can withstand it or be torn apart by the EXPLOSION.</p>

<li>Event no.3 can definitely happen. There are multple documented, the biggest right now being a slow eruption under the Kikai caldera south of Kyushu.</li>
<li>2&amp;4 generally only happen close to land. These types of volcanos are also physicly impossible in deep water (2km deep) since the increased pressure prevents gas from excruding.</li>
<li>Rhyolitic (a type of no.4) underwater volcanoes are super rare, but can be absolutely spectacular. 2012 the Havre Seamount absolutely goddamn exploded (and we almost didn't notice it), but almost levelled the Havre seamount and formed a pumice raft larger than israel. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Kermadec_Islands_eruption" target="_blank">Wiki</a> <a href="https://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/ourchangingworld/audio/2018648947/havre-the-world-s-largest-deep-ocean-volcanic-eruption" target="_blank">Link with more images</a></li>
<li>A type of no 2 is called a &quot;Surtseyan eruption&quot;. It's characterised by base surges (rapid pyroclastic flows expanding along the sea bottom while releasing steam and gas towards the surface. Base surges are typical for no.2&amp;4 eruptions under water) and explosive pillars of steam, ash and solid magma blasting through the surface of the water.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The viscosity is referred to as basic and acidic. Basic  magmas have a low viscosity whereas acidic are high. </p>
<p>You're right that high volatile (gas) content will cause it to degas when confining pressure is released. Exactly the same Principe as opening a carbonated drink, the volatiles can no longer stay dissolved in the low pressure environment and leave the magma returning to their gaseous state.</p>
<p>Both acidity and volatile content are on a sliding scale not binary.</p>
<p>When it comes to eruptions in different media, air Vs water, the biggest difference is how quickly the lava cools and solidifies. In air it cools relatively slowly but in water much quicker. </p>
<p>As you may know when something cools slowly it gives time for the crystals to form and grow. In rocks the size of the crystals is called the grain size. The largest grain sizes are found in igneous intrusions that never left the surface and cooled very slowly stuck underground. </p>
<p>The smallest grain sizes are when the lava cools almost instantly such as underwater, this leads to things such as volcanic glass where the lava has cooled so quickly it is more akin to glass then a rock.</p>
<p>Eruptions can also happen under ice Subglacially. An interesting example is Eyjafjallajokull which when it erupted under a glacier in Iceland blasted shards of volcanic glass and ash Into a giant cloud which shut all air traffic over alot of Europe for a week or so.</p>
<p>Krakatoa is the classic example of a high volatile acidic eruption. It was the loudest noise ever recorded, travelling around the world 3 times. The entire mountain was demolished and turned into ejecta and effected global weather for several years.</p>
<p>If you're interested in world building some interesting examples to look at could be:</p>
<p>Olympus mons, the largest volcano known to man. A shield volcano on mars that's taller than Everest, it's so large that it couldn't exist in earth because its own weight would cause it to sink into the mantle.</p>
<p>Pele's hair, happens in Hawaii where the wind catches the streams of lava and draws them into fine strings that look like hair.</p>
<p>Lava tunnels, where the outside edge of a lava flow solidifies but inside continues to flow. This leaves behind intricate networks of tubes left behind, often known to be fragile and prone to collapse.</p>
<p>Carbonate lava, the vast majority of magma is predominantly sillica based like most rocks but there is such thing as carbonate lava, carbonates are the basis of limestone and chalk. Carbonate lava has only been observed at Ol Doinyo Lengai in Tanzania where it erupted as a low viscosity flow which ran down the sides of the volcano, it is dark in colour when liquid and hot but becomes a light colour when it solidifies and cools. It is also interesting that it is the lowest temperature lava at 500-600°C</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physical geographer here. The changes would be much smaller in Scotland compared to the tropics. Precipitation is entirely driven by the westerlies transporting moist air to you. However, runoff would decrease because trees increase what's called evapotranspiration, which would mean reduced risk of flooding. I don't remember the numbers but it's in the general area of 10-15%, which is a lot.</p>
<p>Temperatures would become more stable and generally slightly cooler, but probably just a few degrees.</p>
<p>You also have to remember that the effects are mostly local (except runoff ofc. which is important for everything downstream), on the order of kilometers I think.</p>
<p>By far the most important benefit of reforestation would be ecological as the heathlands are extremely poor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>ELI5+:The ribbon cable transmits data frame by frame, one bit/byte of data at a time depending on whether it is parallel or serial, which are stored in memory on a display driver chip. This chip does nothing but read frames of data from the memory, and uses some fancy electronics to display it to the screen.</p>
<p>Beyond the ELI5, here is an incredibly simple version of a display driver chip that displays data to an 8x8 screen:</p>

<p>The port labeled MOSI in the white box is where the data comes from the processor. The display driver chip (labeled MAX7219) then displays it to the screen, so the processor doesn't have to do all the work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I haven't seen a good accurate reply on here. </p>
<p>Screens don't update every pixel all at once, they will scan through each line of pixels from top to bottom like an old tube television. They do this through a process called multiplexing.</p>
<p>Since you need 2 wires to complete an electric circuit, a voltage and a ground, you are able to disconnect either one to turn off the pixel. Multiplexing is the process of manipulating the ground connections to select a row of pixels to be updated.  </p>
<p>To give an example of the multiplexing process let's use a 5x5 grid of pixels, each pixel can either be on or off.  First you will need to split this grid into rows and columns.  You will make have five horizontal rows, each one having 5 pixels.  And  5 vertical columns, each one also containing 5 pixels.  </p>
<p>Next you connect all of the pixels in a row to a ground line, and each of the pixels in a column to a voltage line, so that the voltage and ground lines run perpendicular to eachother.  What you will end up with is 5 voltage lines and 5 ground lines, a total of 10 wires. </p>
<p>Lets say that you wanted to only light up the pixels around the edge of the screen. Great, so you see that the first row of pixels needs to be lit, so you connect all of the voltage lines and only the first ground line.  The first line lights up just how you want, perfect. So you move on to the second row. Great, you see that the first and last pixels need to be lit on this row. You see that the voltage lines for the first and last pixel are already connected, so you connect the second ground line. But here's the problem, every pixel in this row is now lit up, not just the end pixels.  So you try disconnecting the middle 3 voltage lines, only to find out that those pixels also turn off on the first row, so that won't work. You will need to find a different  solution.</p>
<p>This solution is multiplexing. As it turns out, you don't need to keep the pixels turned on all of the time, Human eyes can only detect a change so quickly.  So you will 'scan' through the image you are trying to create.  To do this you start with the first row.  Just like before you connect all 5 voltage lines and the first ground line, the correct pixels now light up.  Perfect, now you move onto the second row.  This time you disconnect the first ground line, turning off the previous line.  Now you can disconnect the middle three voltage wires and connect the second ground line. Only the outer two pixels light up, and you can move onto the third row.  You disconnect the second ground line, update the voltage lines to what they need to be, and connect the third ground line. Keep doing this process of cycling through the ground lines until you reach the end, and voila you've slowly updated the pixels to what the need to be.  The only issue is that a human cant do this fast enough by hand, but if you swap out the human for a dedicated chip, it becomes possible.</p>
<p>On the little flat flex cable that connects the display, there will be one or more of these little chips that does this multiplexing process.  This chip will accept binary inputs from just a couple of connections, interpret which line to update, and output the correct signals extremely quickly. On modern displays with color and brightness, it's the same theory but more wires.  Instead of 1 voltage per pixel you will have 3, one for red green and blue.  And by varying the voltage, you can adjust the brightness of the pixel.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Those cables are just pushed onto it, contact will be bad and rather high-resistance, so those spots do heat up first. As they heat up, their resistance grows, they heat up further and also heat the material next to them, raising the resistance there too, causing further heating, further increase of resistance, and the effect migrates inwards from the ends where contact was first made.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 113 known cannabinoids.  Many have some effect or another on appetite, but those effects vary greatly.</p>
<p>THC, the most well-known cannabinoid (mostly for creating the 'high'), seems to have the greatest impact on appetite according to current research.  THC is often found in small amounts in CBD oil (up to .3% is legal federally).</p>
<p>THC affects appetite in 3 ways.  First, it boosts a hormone called 'ghrelin', which makes you feel hungry.  Normally, the body only releases ghrelin when your stomach is empty.</p>
<p>Second, THC can interact with CB1 receptors in areas of the brain that modulate appetite (I think these interactions can actually boost or suppress appetite, depending on circumstance).</p>
<p>Third, THC can boost dopamine and our senses of smell and taste, all of which help us get more pleasure from eating.</p>
<p>TLDR ; CBD itself doesn't cause the munchies.  However, it does quell nausea and pain.  For people who struggle to eat enough because of pain or nausea, CBD could help.</p>
<p>If you're concerned about over-eating as a result of taking CBD oil, you shouldn't have any issues.  Just consider using one of the totally THC free products, rather than one with .3%, to be safe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's more of a matter of balancing and complimenting flavors. Salt goes so well with sweets like caramel and chocolate because there are taste receptors in your mouth that essentially unlock when there's salt involved and they allow you to notice more flavors in the combination. However, if there's too much salt it can become overpowering because there's way too much of that flavor to where it's not longer complimenting the sweet. But when you mix something like m&amp;m's and spaghetti there's too many different flavors that don't really compliment each other. So even though your taste receptors are opening up from the saltiness of the spaghetti, the amount of different flavors like the spices in the spaghetti can conflict and make you taste weird things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you play around with two magnets you'll see that they have two sides where they are stronger. Depending on how you hold them they either attract each other or repel each other. If you add a third magnet and do some systematic tests you can find out that the magnets have two sides you can distinguish - they are called north (N) and south (S) pole (I'll come to the reason of that). If N of one magnet faces S of the other the two magnets attract each other. If N faces N or S faces S they repel each other.</p>
<p>People played around a bit with magnets. Instead of holding them in your hand you can also put them on a small piece of wood in a bowl of water, for example, then it can rotate easily and it is more sensitive to smaller forces. It turns out that they always align north/south on Earth. The pole facing north was called the N pole, the pole facing south is the S pole. What does that mean? Well, Earth itself is a (weak but huge) magnet. If the N pole of a magnet faces north then it must be attracted by a natural S pole - at the North Pole of Earth. Quite counter-intuitive, but we are now stuck with that definition.</p>
<p>It turns out this is just an approximation, the magnetic poles are not exactly aligned with the poles defined by the rotation of Earth. In addition the magnetic field of Earth changes over time, which means the positions of the poles change, too. We know they can even &quot;flip&quot; - the magnetic poles go from one (rotation) pole to the other. This happened many times in the past. Before such a flip the magnetic field of Earth gets weaker and the magnetic poles wander around quicker (as they are more influenced by smaller disturbances if the field is weaker). The magnetic field protects satellites and (a bit less) the ground from radiation that can be dangerous. Without it many satellites can fail and we might get sightly higher radiation doses at the surface, too.</p>
<p>The quickly wandering magnetic poles plus an observed weakening of the overall field suggest that such a pole reversal might happen in the not so distant future - which means something like 1000 years. It is not guaranteed, however, it is also possible that the field gets stronger again and nothing special happens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The shifting of the poles has several implications, but if this is derived from the post yesterday about redrawing maps, air travel is done by magnetic compass, as is some marine travel (talking about individuals sailing private vessels, not big merchant shipping vessels). If the poles move, a plane flying the same route as it always has will have to adjust it's heading (direction of travel) according to the shift in the pole. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no.</p>
<p>It is possible to create molecules with several Si-Si bonds just like with carbon, but those are less stable than Carbon bonds.</p>
<p>In addition Silicon Hydrogen bonds are pretty reactive.</p>
<p>Just compare Methane, a pretty stable and unreactive molecule, with Silane, which combusts in air without any help.</p>
<p>That's because the electronegativity of Silicon and Carbon are different, which affects the Si-H bond.</p>
<p>As the other people mentioned Silicon Oxygen bonds are quite stable, that's what Silicone (the polymer) is.</p>
<p>Still, Carbon is the only known element that forms &quot;unlimited&quot; amounts of different molecules where the Carbon is directly bound to another Carbon.</p>
<p>Adding a CH2 group to elongate a molecule does not make it less stable.</p>
<p>This is called catenation, and allows so many different carbon compounds to exist.</p>
<p>Silicon, ( and Sulfur and Boron) allows for limited amount of Catenation, while Carbon allows basically unlimited chain length and branching.</p>
<p>The longest silicon chain that is somewhat possible to create contains 8 Silicon atoms in a chain. Everything longer will decompose on its own, into unspecific Silicon hydride polymers.</p>
<p>Si8H18 is the sum formula for that.</p>
<p>In addition Carbon can form very stable double and triple bonds, the same bonds are possible with Silicon, but they are extremely unstable. the simple molecules <del>Disilane</del> Disilene and Disilyne are possible to isolate, but anything more complex falls apart.</p>
<p><strong>Tl;Dr</strong> They are very similar, and both allow Catenation, but the addition of another electron shell in Silicon changes the properties (electronegativity) just slightly, so that longer chains get less stable, compared to Carbon chains getting more stable and bonds with Hydrogen have more of a hydride characteristic than the covalent bond between Carbon and Hydrogen.
Thus lifeforms in anyway similar to earth's life is impossible on a silicon basis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sure. Si atoms are also incorporated into organic molecules with four possible bonds. These silanes can have interesting and useful properties; for instance, the company Silatronix has shown that they can be used in lithium ion batteries to stabilize the electrolyte mixture.</p>
<p>To answer from a slightly different perspective: one of silicon's useful incorporations is as an oxide support. Silica -silicon oxide - is used for many of the same applications as graphite and graphene. In this sense, the overall similarity of these two memvers of group IV is clear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if anyone has mentioned it yet, but one factor that limits Silicons ability to act as an organic molecule is its size. By being physically larger than Carbon, it is limited in the bonds that it can form. A common example is Carbon Dioxide, which is a simple covalent gas. Meanwhile Silicon Dioxide is a giant covalent molecule you would know as sand (A giant covalent molecule is one where a repeating pattern of covalently bonded atoms make up a giant structure). </p>
<p>This is because Carbon can form pi bonds with Oxygen. Pi bonds are caused by an overlap of P orbitals, and can exist above and below the plane of a regular Sigma bond. These can exist in Carbon - Oxygen bonds (as the sigma bond length is quite low). This means that CO2 can be simple while still observing the octet rule. As Silicon is larger, it cannot form pi bonds (as the sigma bonds are too long to allow the p orbitals to overlap) meaning that to observe the octet rule it has to form 4 sigma bonds, leading to the giant structure of Silicon Dioxide. Silicons size is just one of the factors that lead to it not being able to do many of the things carbon can chemically.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Silicon has a whole extra shell of electrons compared to carbon. It's still tetravalent, but the orbitals are bigger and floppier and hazier than in carbon. This makes it less able to hold its electrons and makes overlap between orbitals poorer, leading to less covalent nature in its bonding. Instead you see more metallic type bonding. Another thing that arises because of this is that silicon tends to not make double bonds, but graphite does. this is why carbon will make graphene-type structures with pi bonding and resonance and so on, but silicon won't. Silicon sticks to single bonds if it does bond covalently, and tends to be more metallic in nature generally. It will still form covalent lattices if you mix it something like oxygen though. Glasses and crystals and so on are silicates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
