<p>Inflation encourages people and corporations (and especially banks) to do things with their money, specifically, invest it in businesses, education, or something else. If money loses 2% of its value each year, companies have to be doing something with it that earns at least a 2% profit - like lending it out.</p>
<p>Basically, inflation forces banks and billionaires to stop just sitting on money and instead reinvest it, creating new businesses and jobs and driving the economy forwards.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Inflation isn't necessarily good, but deflation is extremely bad.  As others have stated, inflation causes currency to lose value over time.  The quicker the currency is losing the value, the quicker people want to get out and spend it.  So inflation encourages participation in the economy and the churn of money that keeps everything moving.  Deflation causes currency to gain in value, which sounds great, but it encourages people to save all their money instead of spending it.  As people disengage from the economy, things start to slow down.  Manufacturers start seeing that people aren't buying their goods as much, so they start making fewer goods.  Now that they don't need as many goods produced, they start laying off workers.  As people see their neighbors losing their jobs, they get nervous and start spending even less to hedge the risk of future unemployment.  And the cycle keeps repeating in a self-reinforcing manner.  </p>
<p>High inflation can have terrible effects too, as seen in Weimar Germany, Zimbabwe, or Venezuela, but it's generally much easier to slow down people's rate of purchasing things than it is to convince people to start spending again once they've stopped.  So overall it's much better to accept having a little inflation than to risk having any deflation.  2% inflation is the commonly accepted safe buffer to shoot for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Let's say there is a 2% deflation rate. Money is getting more and more valuable every year! That's great! Except now banks and corporations and anyone with a good chunk of change has incentive to do absolutely nothing with the money. They can just sit on it and they will make money actually.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>TL;DR</em>
<em>Inflation is bad for people who cannot fight for better wages. If you are paid $500/week and the cost of everything increases by 5%, unless you can fight for more pay, you lose.</em></p>
<p><em>Inflation is good for people who are in debt (as my debt is worth less than it was before) and small businesses (I can get away with charging more and not increase my staff's wages)</em></p>
<p>I think the best way to answer this is to explain the impacts of inflation.</p>
<p>Inflation is good for some and bad for others. </p>
<p>Generally, high inflation is good for those on strong wages and bad for those on weak wages.</p>
<p>High inflation is good for those in debt, but bad for lenders (unless the interest rate climbs) or people with savings earning interest.</p>
<p>And vice versa.</p>
<p>Example 1.
I lend you $500 for 1 year and get 5% interest.
If the inflation rate was high (5%), when you pay me back I have effectively made no profit.</p>
<p>I made $50 in interest, but it is still only worth what $500 was a year ago.</p>
<p>This is great for the borrower who found it easy to pay me back though as their wage increased.</p>
<p>Example 2:
An elderly couple retires with a fixed income of $500 per week.
rent = $300
Food = $150
Save = $50</p>
<p>But costs inflate 10% over 2 years.</p>
<p>Now,
They still make $500 per week
Rent = $330
Food = $165
Save = $5</p>
<p>So now, the couple does not have the money to cover incidentals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eggs are either really tough, or soft and leathery. Trying breaking an egg in your hand, the shape makes them very resistant to pressure. To break the egg the bird would have to have such a serious impact that the animal is probably dead before the egg breaks. </p>
<p>Sometimes birds produce imperfect eggs. They can get stuck along the way for a bit before moving on, leading to odd shapes, or sometimes no shell at all. The shell-less eggs can tear, scramble egg in the nest, but the shell wasn't hard yet, so at least no cuts. If an egg gets stuck completely it's a life-threatening emergency. Usually you'd try to lubricate it and gently massage it out in one piece. Breaking the egg is a last resort and dangerous, because yes, the shells can cut the bird up. </p>
<p>The soft eggs of reptiles can tear when they get stuck. It's also possible that eggs accumulate and can't come out at all, same urgent emergency as with birds, gotta get them out or the animal dies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why are there so many people in a science sub that are convinced that bird eggs harden <em>after</em> being laid!?</p>
<p>They don't. The calcium shell is applied in multiple layers inside the bird, and each layer hardens right as it's being secreted. <em>NOT</em> from exposure to air. Chickens and other birds lay eggs that are already fully hard.</p>
<p>It's quite rare but bird eggs can crack while still inside the hen. Similarly, reptile eggs can tear open while still inside the female. Usually from external trauma. If bird eggs aren't all the way through the shell-making process when they crack, then they can be 'mended' by the next layers of shell applied. And the place where it cracked can still be visible after laying.</p>
<p>I've had one hen in the past lay a cracked-and-mended egg - she laid it the morning after she spooked when I was closing them up for the night, flew straight into the coop wall, and fell hard onto the waterer. Another hen had an egg break internally (finished shell - apparently too close to being laid to be 'mended') which got stuck inside her and ended up causing Egg Peritonitis - a serious internal bacterial infection. Like how mammals can get sepsis from a retained placenta.</p>
<p>The shell-adding part of egg laying is the last step. The whole process along the bird's oviduct is like an assembly line <a href="https://the-chicken-chick.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/reproductive-tract-of-hen-University-of-Kentucky.jpg" target="_blank"><em>(dissection pic of oviduct</em></a> &amp; <a href="https://opimedia.azureedge.net/-/media/Images/CFR/Editorial/Blogs/Rachel/Mommy-Where-Do-Eggs-Come-From/egg-formation-process-550-jpg.jpg?h=302&amp;w=550&amp;la=en&amp;hash=88800069E6A6DB5E27856D1878CCFF024DBD2A4E" target="_blank"><em>diagram of egg formation)</em></a>. Yolks start tiny, grow large, go down the tube to get the whites added, then enter the shell-coating area. Sit there for almost a day to get the shell layers applied and are then laid. But while that's going on another yolk is starting to mature and make its way down the tube, with another growing to be ready behind that. So an egg can't hang around much longer than normal without causing a backup and problems with the whole system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You’d be surprised how many companies operate in massive debts.</p>
<p>The methods vary - the simplest is that a debt figure isn’t as simple as it looks.</p>
<p>The first aspect is that having debt doesn’t mean they don’t have actual cash in the bank. In the same way that a mortgage doesn’t mean you don’t have money - all agreed debt has terms.</p>
<p>Say they have 10 invoices for a million each due this week. They have 50m in the bank. So they pay their 10 invoices on the day they’re due. Their debt just dropped by 10m. But if on that same day, another supplier sends them an invoice for 10m that’s due in 60 days, it will look like they’re still in the same debt position.</p>
<p>They’ll still have 10m of debt, but it’s gone from 10m of debt due this week to 10m of debt due in 60 days. And in those 60 days, they’ll be getting in subscription money, as well as interest, etc. So they have time to gather the 10m to pay that invoice. </p>
<p>Whenever they get a new supplier or renew a contract with a supplier, they’ll negotiate payment terms (or try to), in order to get the longest payment terms they can. Because that way they have longer between getting invoices for something and actually having to pay for it.</p>
<p>Beyond that, simple debt isn’t really a great measure of how well a company is doing. A better measure is how much their debt is worth vs what the company has. So basically “if I were to sell everything the company has at it’s expected value, how much of that would be needed to cover my debts?”</p>
<p>In the case of Netflix, they may have huge debts, but taking the value of their cash and everything else in the bank, their debt is only worth about 62% of it. To use easier numbers, let’s say everything netflix has is worth 100m. If we sold everything netflix at expected values and then paid off all debts, there would still be about 38m left. </p>
<p>The last concept would be leverage - basically using what you have to get more. Then simplest real world example I can think of is actually in house buying. (Called leverage because of that “longer lever brings bigger effects”) thing.</p>
<p>Say I have 200k to buy a house with (for this, assume it’s magical Christmas land and 200k can buy a house outright). <strong>edit: I don’t care if house prices where you are are low enough to buy a mansion for 2 grand. So stop replying telling me that you can</strong></p>
<p>I could use my 200k and buy a house. If that house is worth 300k in a year. With no leverage I’ve gained 100k in a year, or 50%. </p>
<p>But say I split my 200k into 4 blocks of 50k, and used those as down payments on 4 houses with mortgages for the other 150k. So I’ve spent 200k and got 800k worth of house. </p>
<p>A year on, each of those 200k houses is worth 300k (ignoring things like interest and repayments for simplicity). My debt is still 600k, but those houses are worth 1.2m now. I sell 2 houses for 300k each and pay off all the debt.</p>
<p>Now I own 600k worth of house and I only spent 200k to get there. So with no leverage, I gained 50% of my initial spend. With leverage I gained 200%. </p>
<p>That’s basically what Netflix does. They spend a ton on making shows like the Witcher, with the expectation that their 200m spend will bring them significantly more than they’d have gotten from that 200k if they did nothing.</p>
<p>So while yes, they operate on debt, they’re actually in a decent position.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Every company has debt and carries debt, why pay cash for something when you don't have to? The full $10bn in debt won't come due all at once so Netflix will either just pay it off in pieces as it becomes due, or they will refinance it and just issue replacement debt at a better rate. I looked at their reporting at there is no singular debt greater than $2bn. The $10bn you see is divided into 12 different debts and won't come due in totality until 2029.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are no Earth-based telescopes that come close to having the necessary resolution to identify the Apollo equipment.</p>
<p>However, there are a number of other ways in which we can observe the things our kind left on the Moon. One such way is through the Lunar Laser Ranging experiment. Multiple Apollo missions, including Apollo 11, left a &quot;retroreflector&quot; on the Moon. A retroreflector is somewhat similar to a mirror, except that it always reflects the incoming light back in the exact direction it came from, which a mirror doesn't do.</p>
<p>From Earth, we can point a laser at the spots where these retroreflectors were placed and then measure the reflection. The time it takes between sending the laser pulse and receiving the reflection back is a measure for the distance between the Earth and the Moon at that time. </p>
<p>Another piece of evidence is direct observation of the Apollo equipment, but not from an Earth-based telescope. Various projects have sent out lunar orbiters to study the Moon from its orbit, including high resolution photography.</p>
<p>NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has snapped some pictures of the Apollo 11 landing site: <a href="https://moon.nasa.gov/resources/128/lro-explores-the-apollo-11-landing-site/" target="_blank">https://moon.nasa.gov/resources/128/lro-explores-the-apollo-11-landing-site/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>Technically speaking</em>, yes, but the aperture of the telescope would have to be <strong>very, very big</strong>.</p>
<p>Let's start by ignoring atmospheric distortion of light, light pollution, bad weather, and what not. Everyone know physics is really about spherical cows in a vacuum.</p>
<p>In order to determine the resolution of a telescope you use the Rayleigh criterion, which says that two point sources of light can be resolved from each other if the angular distance θ between exceeds a certain number. If not, the blur together. The criterion can be expressed as</p>
<p>sin θ = k*λ / D</p>
<p>where λ is the wavelength of the light, D is the diameter of the aperture, and k = 1.2197. You can rearrange this as</p>
<p>D = k*λ / sin θ</p>
<p>Now, the Apollo 11 Lunar Module is 9.4 meters at its widest point (landing gear). The average distance from the Earth to the Moon is somewhere around 385 000 km or 3.85 * 10^(8) meters. Visible light has a wavelength of 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red), but let's use 400 nm as that will give us the smallest possible aperture for our giant telescope.</p>
<p>Substituting the numbers gives</p>
<p>D = 1.2197 * 4 * 10^(-7) m / (9.4 m / 3.85 * 10^(8) m) <strong>= 19.98 m</strong></p>
<p>This might not seem like a huge number but the largest optical telescope at the moment, at least according to Wikipedia, has an aperture of 11.8 m. Also, keep in mind that we made some pretty out there simplifications and assumptions and that this number is the <em>smallest possible</em> aperture for <em>barely</em> being able to distinguish to <em>violet</em> lights at <em>opposite ends of the landing gear</em>.</p>
<p>If we do the same calculations, but instead look at red light (700 nm) at opposite ends of the actual module (4.2 m), the aperture would have to be <strong>78.26 m</strong>. Keep in mind that this number is the bare minimum if you want to be able to just barely distinguish two red lights from one another, and it won't give you a clear image of anything. Wanna be able to distinguish one red line from another on a one by two meters American flag? Your telescope needs to have a diameter of almost <strong>two kilometers</strong>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The answer was, at that time, with the given pixel size of cameras being what they were circa 2008 let's say, that you would need a Reflecting telescope about 1320 feet wide to get the US flag (5'x3') to show up as a single pixel in a photo. </p>
<p>That would mean that same telescope/camera would probably be able to get the landing gear which is 31'(diagonally?) in a 5x5 pixel square.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As living things (that is, single or multicellular organisms) go about their day, the chemical processes inside of them produce hydrogen peroxide as a waste product. </p>
<p>Hydrogen peroxide damages the delicate molecular machinery inside cells, so, natural selection led to the evolution of something called <em>catalase</em>. </p>
<p>Catalase is an <em>enzyme</em>—the very first ever to be discovered. As an enzyme, catalase helps make certain chemical reactions occur. Specifically, catalase’s job is to detoxify the hydrogen peroxide that cells make. It does this by splitting hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. </p>
<p>Because the chemical production of hydrogen peroxide as a waste product occurs in basically all living things, basically all living things have catalase inside them. So, when hydrogen peroxide bubbles, that’s telling you that it has come in contact with the insides of living things (be they you, a potato, bacteria, or anything else), and the catalase in those living things is doing its job. </p>
<p>I actually used this once to save my neighbor’s life, in 2013 or 2014 or thereabouts. She had accidentally drunken a bottle of hydrogen peroxide, rather than water. She came over to our house asking for help, and I—remembering an experiment we did with catalase in my AP Biology class, chopped up some raw potato we had sitting in the kitchen, and got her to eat the pieces. She soon started burping as the catalase inside the potato chunks got to work detoxifying the hydrogen peroxide she’s swallowed. </p>
<p>I can honestly say I heard the Elder Scrolls games’ “skill level increase” that day, as my Alchemy skill went up several points for having saved my neighbor’s life. :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modern digital networks (including the Internet) divide data into <em>packets</em>.  Each packet's size is usually between 40 and 1500 bytes.</p>
<p>A typical Internet download goes through many different routers (10 or more).</p>
<p>A router can &quot;drop&quot; packets it's unable to send.</p>
<p>Dropping can be due to hardware limits.  For example, a typical router might have 30 ports, each capable of sending 1000 MB of data per second.  If 100 MB worth of data come in on each of the first 29 ports, and all of it is supposed to be sent out on the 30th port, you're trying to put 3000 MB per second of data into a pipe that can only handle 1000 MB per second.  The router would drop 2000 MB per second worth of packets at random.</p>
<p>Dropping can also be programmed for software-based reasons as well as hardware limits.  For example, if a customer's only paid their ISP for a plan that offers 100 MB per second, the ISP router might be programmed to drop packets above that limit, even though the port hardware the customer's connected to is physically capable of handling 1000 MB.</p>
<p>Downloads tune their speed based on dropped packets.  When a download starts, a small number of packets (3 or so) are sent.  If they all arrive, packets are sent faster and faster, until packets start being dropped.  Then the packet send rate will be held steady, at just below the level that causes packets to be dropped, but every few seconds it will start to increase again (in case the maximum rate has changed over time).</p>
<p>That's why connections start slowly.</p>
<p>You may ask how the computer you're downloading <em>from</em> know which packets arrived?  The answer is that your computer actually sends that information back &quot;upstream&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is because of something called &quot;Window size&quot; and how &quot;Packets&quot; (pieces of file) use it.</p>
<p>ELI5: You <em>(Your PC)</em> and your friend timmy <em>(Other PC)</em> are trying to share blocks <em>(Packets)</em> because you want to build a castle <em>(Full file)</em> with timmy's blocks (and you have none).</p>
<p>You and timmy are new friends so he isn't sure how strong you are or how many blocks you can carry in one load <em>(Window size)</em>, so he starts out small, just a block or two as a safe guess <em>(Starting Window size)</em></p>
<p>Every time you let timmy know you successfully carried the amount of blocks timmy handed you back to your house, he figures you are strong enough to carry 1 or 2 extra in the next load so you can get all the needed blocks in your house faster. <em>(Increasing window size)</em></p>
<p>But oops, you drop some blocks <em>(Dropped packets)</em> on a later load and let timmy know. So timmy reduces the block amount to what your last safe trip was <em>(Safe Window size).</em></p>
<p>This process continues until you have the full amount of blocks at your house.</p>
<p>ELI15(?): This is how TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) Window size works, The source PC sends a burst of info (window) and waits to hear an &quot;Okay, got it&quot; back. Because this protocol values data integrity over speed, its starts with a small burst that is almost guaranteed to make it. With every &quot;Okay, got it&quot; the source pc hears, it increases the size of the next burst so data travels  faster. If no &quot;Okay, got it&quot; is heard, it decreases burst size (and thus speed) to what was the last safe amount.</p>
<p>UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is the reverse, it'd be like if timmy just chucked blocks at your houses window. He doesnt know if blocks make it and he doesnt care, timmy wants speed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

However, to an ignorant fool like me, depressurization sounds like a good thing. It seems to me if there is less pressure then there would be a less forceful eruption. But it seems like I'm wrong and I would like to learn why.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think about what happens when you have a bottle of carbonated water that has been shaken, and you try to open it gently. When the bottle is sealed, the contents is under pressure, and thus stable.</p>
<p>Now you slightly unscrew the cap so that the over pressure can start to equalize. Some of the carbon dioxide dissolved in the liquid will start to escape and form gas bubbles when the pressure drops. Since a gas is much less dense than a liquid, these will quickly rise to the top and escape out through the opening in the cap. However, if the amount of gas that escapes is large enough, the temporary increase in volume will force the liquid all the way up to the cap and, if you're not fast enough in your reactions to screw it back in place, will cause the water to spray out. If you're fast enough, the liquid settles back down, and you can repeat the process until the pressure is equalized to the outside.</p>
<p>In both cases the end result is a completely un-pressurized container of water. But in the first case, you will get sprayed by some of it due to the violent manner of depressurization.</p>
<p>Now imagine the water is molten rock and shit, and the bottle is as large as a mountain, and someone just unscrewed the cap slightly.....</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: Clarified the conversion from dissolved carbon dioxide to gas a bit, to make it a bit more accurate and less hand-wavy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a question of time-scales - you are correct, long-term, macro-view pressure release on a volcanic system is the natural conclusion. However what they are concerned about here is that the ground fissures are evident of a large amount of magma below the surface (yet extremely shallow compared to it's origin) which poses an imminent explosive risk to the surrounding populace.</p>
<p>Also, pressure isn't always the reason for explosive eruptions, the geochemical makeup of the magma and its resultant hydrodynamic properties coupled with the cone structure play a huge part of how the pressure is released from a system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depressurizing doesn't equal depressurizing. You have to distinguish between letting pressure out in a controlled fashion and letting pressure out at an increasingly high rate. And when talking volcanoes, there's no such thing as 'controlled':</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>As u/TaazDingo noted, you can imagine a magma chamber like a shaken soda or champagne bottle. When the cork is popped, the gas can escape and rapidly incites more gas to free itself in the process - you get a runaway reaction that carries a lot of champagne, or in a volcano's case, magma, with it!</p>
<p>Now, when you do it with a bottle, you may notice that the overflowing foam took a LOT, like 1/3rd or half the contents of the bottle with it. This will look similar for the magma chamber, which is now still filled with magma but at <em>much</em> lower remaining pressure...and that pressure can't hold up the roof of the magma chamber (with all the rock and volcanic mountain on top of it) anymore, causing it to cave in. This is exactly how your typical <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caldera" target="_blank">caldera</a> is formed, and a caldera collapse is an extremely violent and destructive event where effectively the rest of the magma is 'forced out', creating more ash and other tephra, pyroclastic flows, quakes, tsunamis if close to a body of water and reshaping the volcano's surface and sub-surface features in general and cataclysmic fashion!</p>
<p>Taal specifically already had caldera forming events before - the largest of which created the big 20km-wide hole Taal Lake is formed in! The lake poses additional danger: water aids in creating stream explosions when it comes into contact with magma in large enough volumes in confined spaces (underground), through fissures and cracks. This in particular can cause the volcano to 'blow off the cork' and start the rapidly depressurizing chain of events either directly or indirectly!</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>TL:DR</strong> Exponentially increasing depressurization can end in the whole volcano collapsing in on itself. That would be bad news to everyone in ~15-25km radius*!</p>
<p>*Edit: I should probably add that the ash and tephra pose a threat to people beyond that kind of radius, but the affected area is largely depending on winds and the actual size of the caldera event. Big VEI events can affect the global climate even, and those tend to be caldera events (1883 Krakatau, 1815 Tambora and 1257 Samalas are examples of large VEI Indonesian eruptions (VEI 6-7) that were felt even on the other side of the globe in Europe).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't think about a volcano like it's a balloon that you've poked a little hole in and it's gradually lowering in pressure.  It's more like the cap on a water pipe connected to some serious pressure way down the line and the pressure inside the hose is now enough that it's boring its own way out.  That means there's enough pressure to just blow the cap off entirely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>So SD Cards are small and cheap, but slow and not robust. Hard disks are cheap, moderately speedy, and robust. SSDs are robust, relatively expensive and very fast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hard drives or HDDs are magnetic storage methods that are a few decades old. They are reliable and you can store a lot of data on them. Their size is due to the mechanical components in them and partially due to standardisation. For example, you can find laptop hard drives that are very small. No need to make them smaller as they are quite slow and the machines that use them are servers or desktop computers.</p>
<p>Solid state drives SSDs have no moving parts and they store data in small memory chips. Their size is the same as a laptop hard drive and this is due to standardisation as well. If you open one of these up, you'll see it's mostly empty space with a tiny board a few chips in them. There is no need to make them smaller as most devices have bays where these need to fit. Standards again.</p>
<p>M2 drives are the next gen of SSDs. They are faster than SSDs and as robust, but they are smaller than an SSD. They don't have any casing which saves a lot of space and the new standard allows for a smaller form factor. So thanks to technology, the industry has agreed to make drives a bit smaller for the next gen of SSDs.</p>
<p>MicroSD cards are tiny yes, but this is because the devices that require them are fairly small as well like your mobile phone. Some of the hardware required to make them work is also on your device so that saves space. They are also limited in terms of input/output. Going smaller than this is probably not practical as they are delicate enough to crack or get lost.</p>
<p>In short, storage gets smaller as technology advances but some of the form factors you see are due to industry standards. While I'm sure they could make an SSD the size of your fingernail, it all depends on what devices can support. It usually takes a few years for different manufacturers to agree/adopt new form factors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>For more distant objects you can either estimate based on how fast the object is moving away from us(redshift), or you can calculate based on how how much light reaches us vs how much light an object of that type is supposed to make(standard candle).</p>

The older the light, the more its waves will be expanded (and its frequencies redshifted) by its journey through the expanding universe.  So astronomers can look at a galaxy's spectrum, find the emission and absorption peaks of different elements, see how much they've shifted, and then apply Hubble's Law to that shift to figure out how far away that galaxy is.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to the methods mentioned:</p>
<p>They also use a certain type of stars called Cepheids. These are stars that pulsate perdiodically. Lucky for us, the period of the star and its absolute brightness are linearly connected. So by measuring the light we can get the period, from which we can derive the absolute brightness (that is the brightness of the star when it would be at 10 parsec away from us.) As we know how light diminishes with distance, we can calculate the distance if we know the measured and the absolute brightness.</p>
<p>This follows the following formula:</p>
<p>Measured brightness-absoluye brightness=5*log(d)-5</p>
<p>A next method is using a nearby supernova/ the supernova of the star. Of type Ia to be exact. Because supernovae of that type always emit practically the same amount of light, we again know the absolute brightness. As these things are WAY brighter than regular stars, we can use them across greater distances. (You can look up the ranges of all of the mentioned methods in this thread, I can't recall them correctly)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
