<p>Imagine you are walking to the bus stop. Your current position has a value of 1, the bus stop has a value of 0, and the distance between the two can be represented by a decimal. Before you reach the bus stop you must first reach half way to the bus stop (0.5), and then you must reach half way between that point and the bus stop (0.25), and then you must reach half way between that point and the bus stop (0.125) and so on and so on, I think you get the picture. If you must first pass an infinite number of places before reaching the bus stop, mathematically how do you actually reach it? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you continue this process infinitely, simple math would suggest that you will never reach the bus stop, but we know that we can reach it in a real world example. Is this because as numbers get very small they must approach a finite value? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why can't you go through these infinitely many &quot;halves&quot; in a finite amount of time? </p>
<p>Let's say, for simplicity, that you're running to the bus stop at a constant speed, and you stop when you suddenly hit the sign, or something. So, you're running from position 1 to position 0 (note, I reversed this), say the units are meters. If you're running at, say, 1m/s, then the time it takes for you to go the first half, from 1 to 1/2, will be 1/2 a second. The time it takes for you to go the second chunk, from 1/2 to 1/4 is 1/4 of a second. The time it takes to get from 1/4 to 1/8 is 1/8 of a second. This pattern continues. The time it takes you to get from the chunk 1/2^(n) to 1/2^(n+1) is 1/2^(n+1) of a second.</p>
<p>What, then, is the total time of the trip? You would have to sum up all the times together. The times for each chunk are 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, etc seconds each, so the total time will be</p>
<ul>
<li>1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 +...</li>
</ul>
<p>where the sum goes on infinitely. This is a very classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series" target="_blank">Geometric Series</a>, and adds up to a finite value. That finite value, in this case, is 1. So after 1 second, you will have gone through all of these infinitely many halfway points and gotten to the end (which makes sense, because you're going 1 m/s for 1 meter). So, even though there are infinitely many halves to go through, it takes a finite amount of time to get through them all.</p>
<p>This situation is also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes" target="_blank">Zeno's Paradox</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You might not know it, but you have stumbled onto one of the fundamental building blocks of calculus.  The idea of a &quot;limit&quot;.</p>
<p>You are right that, as time passes on, the distance gets closer and closer to 0, but never actually reaches it, so we would say that the &quot;limit&quot; is equal to 0.</p>
<p>Here is another example of a limit to think of.  Say you have a sibling who is 3 years older than you, how many more <em>times</em> older than you are they?</p>
<p>When you are 1, they are 4, and so they are 4/1 = 4 times older than you.</p>
<p>When you are 2, they are 5, and so they are 5/2 = 2.5 times older than you.</p>
<p>When you are 3, they are 6, and so they are 6/3 = 2 times older than you.</p>
<p>Let's jump ahead.</p>
<p>When you are 20, they are 23, and so they are 23/20 = 1.15 times older than you.</p>
<p>When you are 50, they are 53, and so they are 53/50 = 1.06 times older than you.</p>
<p>No matter how old you are, they will be 3 years older, and so this fraction will always be bigger than 1, but it will be getting closer and closer and closer to 1, so we say that &quot;limit&quot; is equal to 1.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_number" target="_blank">Infinitesimals are indeed valid!</a>!</p>
<p>Keep a few things in mind though:</p>
<p>An infinitely small number is not necessarily the smallest number. If we say some number x is infinitesimal, x/2 is another infinitesimal, and so is x/3, and so one. You could also have a number be infinitesimally small compared to an infinitesimal, and so on. Hyperreal numbers have this branching hierarchy all the way down, and up into infinite values as well.</p>
<p>Another thing is that numbers, from the conventional views of most mathematicians and scientists, have no real world meaning in and if themselves. Some people believe numbers exist out there, such as mathematical Platonists. But most view math very differently. Maths some would say is a language, a way of talking about things that happens to have rigor built in. Some say maths is more of just an extended and particular sort of logic, we are drawing conclusions from axioms after all, but maths has special assumptions logic does not. Some also argue maths is like a story or a game, where we are defining different rules and playing by them to see what happens. And you can have entirely different rules to found maths, so there isn't one superior game so to speak. Mathematical truth is not contingent on physical reality in most conceptions, nor visa versa.</p>
<p>So, there are hyperreals which contain infinitesimals, but no really interesting and consistent systems that extend the integers or the reals contain a &quot;smallest number&quot; (to my knowledge). Also it's maths so none of it has an intrinsic physical meaning according to most.</p>
<p>Make of that what you will.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Given any number (other than 0), you can always find a number closer to 0 (given a suitable definition of &quot;closer&quot; and &quot;number&quot; - but let's not go too deep into mathematical theory). The most obvious example being that if you give me the number <em>n</em>, I give you back <em>n/2</em>, which is closer to 0 (in the sense that <em>|n - 0| &gt; |n/2 - 0|</em>). So in the same way that numbers can always get bigger, numbers can always get smaller.</p>
<p>Mathematically, there are ways of defining infinitesimals and dealing with them, just as there are ways of dealing with infinities. Generally mathematicians don't like being told they can't do something - instead they just find a new way of defining things to make it work. So in this sense, infinitesimals do exist.</p>
<p>To answer your problem; yes, you'd have to go through an infinite number of gaps. But you're going through an infinite number of <em>infinitely small</em> gaps. Meaning that if you're going at a constant speed, you'll go through the infinitely small ones infinitely quickly.</p>
<p>So what happens when you combine an infinity and an infinitesimal?</p>
<p>You get what's sometimes called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeterminate_form" target="_blank">indeterminate form</a> - a thing whereby you can't work out what you get without more information. And this is where we introduce the concept of limits of functions. This whole area of limits, infinitesimals and so on is the basis for the calculus of variations - one of the main branches of standard maths.</p>
<p>In this case, it turns out that your infinite number of infinitesimals works out in the way we'd expect. i.e. 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... = 1</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>there's a landing page that automatically redirects you to the page you see.  so when you click back your browser is momentarily at the landing page again and gets forwarded back to the same page.</p>
<p>sometimes you can counteract that by clicking back a few times rapidly (then you go &quot;backwards&quot; from the landing page to Google before it's able to redirect you again)</p>
<p>to counter this some websites redirect you several times before you see a page, which makes it much harder to get back to where you were just using the back button.  finding where you were in your browser history and clicking that will still work fine though</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Web developer here.  There are a few ways this can be done. </p>
<hr />
<p>You may notice sometimes that there is a <code>#</code> symbol somewhere in the URL (web page address at the top of your web browser).  In this context, it's known as an anchor.  It's native functionality is to jump to a certain spot on a page.  You may see this used on tables of contents, where the index at the top has links that cause the scroll position where the corresponding contents begin.</p>
<p>Super meta example of this: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_contents" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_contents</a> (desktop viewing required) </p>
<p>Notice when you click on a link in the index, it jumps a spot lower down and URL contains <code>#something</code> at the end.  Also take note that the scrollbar has moved and it has not loaded a new page.  When you click the [back] button in your browser, it will return you to the table of contents. </p>
<p>Browsers consider anchor links to be their own entry in the history record.  So, when you go [back], it returns you to the previous state  It will continue recording any number of anchor links clicked or entered consecutively as another state. </p>
<p>Nasty websites can use this behavior to seemingly trap you into staying on their website by programmatically manipulating anchors; basically, simulating clicks on numerous anchors consecutively so that the browser &quot;thinks&quot; its going back through the history of anchors you clicked. </p>
<hr />
<p>There are other ways this can be done.  Javascript is the programming language that implements dynamic functionality on a web page.  There are built-in methods for manipulating and capturing the history state that are very useful for dynamic pages, but can be used to trap users a black hole of back-clicks. </p>
<p>There are a number of other ways this could be done with Javascript, like capturing keyboard inputs and rerouting their behavior, opening modal elements (things that block everything else until they are dismissed) that recursively reopen themselves when dismissed, or overflowing execution (making a browser do too much at once and causing it to freeze).</p>
<hr />
<p>tl;dr programming good.  mean programmers be mean.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m a therapist in a neuro clinic. It depends on the involvement of their spinal cord injury or whatever condition has left them paralyzed. You can still have partial motor innervation or none at all depending the kind of injury/pathology. Tetra and paraplegic people have difficulties with regulation of body temperature for number of reasons but generally speaking they don’t sweat or have goosebumps. </p>
<p>Most people still have some sort of autonomic warnings of when there “paralyzed” involved body is in trouble from an injury, infection, or a danger perceived scenario, its called autonomic dysreflexia. They develop a large change in blood pressure, feel sick, can develop uncontrolled muscle spasms. </p>
<p>Edit: Grammarz and specifying I’m a physical therapist assistant, I help modify and execute plan of cares to rehabilitate spinal cord injuries, traumatic brain injuries, and other populations like orthopedics and amputees!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been paralyzed from the chest down for 20 years. I was camping the other night and it was very warm and humid. I had blankets on my lower body and a fan blowing on my face/arms, and fell asleep, I woke up not feeling cold, but shivering terribly like I was cold (or had a fever). I took the blankets off and turned the fan off and equalized and was fine. If it rains and gets my pants wet, my face and upper body get really flushed and hot, presumably as my body warms up my wet legs.
But in the winter, my legs can get icy cold and I wont have any idea or indication, really, other than feeling uncomfortable/unsettled...then if I hit a certain point (presumably when my core temperature drops below a certain level), I feel terribly cold and it takes forever to get/feel warm (forever=an hour or more). Ive gotten better at equalizing, and depend 100% on my gerbing electric heated socks, which i recharge and reuse every single day once the temperature drops below 50°</p>
<p>As for why i get flush from rain but not really cold... it seems to have to do with wetness/humidity/evaporation. Due to the nature of my spinal cord injury, I don't really sweat. A little in my armpits and a lot on my chest, but not on my head at all. Its bizarre and sucks. But again, if i'm in a humid environment, and especially when i'm wearing a hat, it seems to activate the sweating on my head.</p>
<p>In the summer my legs get very hot; my body cant seem to cool them. Though if i put them up (i.e. Lay down) their temperature quickly evens out. (In the summer, hot legs equalize in like 15 minutes when i lay down, whereas in the winter, cold legs take over an hour to equalize)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

But it probably wasn't just the carcinogenic agents that directly led to cancer.

They can't store enough oxygen for long term running. Indeed, most diesel subs only use the diesel engines when at the surface or at periscope depth, pulling air down to run the engine to power the craft and to charge batteries, and when submerged they run solely on battery power.</p>
<p>But nuclear subs can stay submerged for as long as they can keep the crew fed (and sane). They can generate water by desalination, oxygen by electrolysis of water, and the CO₂ is removed by scrubbers that are regenerated using heat - all driven by the power output of the reactor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Diesel subs need to come up every few days for air, since their engines burn oxygen.</p>
<p>Another reason to surface is for communications; you can't send radio signals when deep underwater, and penetrating radio using VLF (very low frequencies) still has a maximum depth of about 60 feet. without coming up to the surface you would't be able to receive orders or information.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I was serving in the 80s when there was no commercial Internet, and entertainment was limited to books, video tapes, and magazines.  I can imagine that this lack of communication would create considerable stress for today’s crews.</p>
<p>I discount the whole fresh air argument I keep seeing pop up on this post.  The air onboard a sub can be maintained breathable for an indefinite period of time.  Think about the ISS.  It isn’t like they can dip that thing into the atmosphere every now and then.  As long as you have a source of O2 (electrolysis on a sub, shipments of LOX to the ISS), can scrub out the CO2. CO, and H2, and otherwise filter noxious fumes, you don’t need fresh air</p>
<p>Another consideration is that the US coast has a number of ‘submerged-free’ zones, particularly at major ports, where nothing should operate submerged.  If there is anything submerged in such zones, it’s assumed to be hostile.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Depending on the mission they really should at least stick the snorkel mast up and change out the atmosphere. The HVAC system is very good but it just circulates farts over time. It's amazing the difference ventilating fresh air is after weeks of not doing so. </p>
<p>We make our own fresh water and oxygen but can't make our own food. After about day 10 or so the fresh fruit and veggies are gone so it's all canned and frozen stuff. Day 45ish and you're down to all canned mostly. Day 55 it's rough. Beanies and weenies every day almost</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ignoring air resistance and assuming the earth is a homogenous sphere,</p>
<p>The force F acting on the ball while within the earth is described by:</p>
<p><strong>F</strong> = -GMm/R^(3)<strong>r</strong> where r is the distance from the centre of the earth to the ball. </p>
<p>For those that have studied springs, this equation is of the form:</p>
<p><strong>F</strong> = -k<strong>r</strong> where k = GMm/R^(3)</p>
<p>Or equivalently:</p>
<p><strong>a</strong> = -ω^(2)<strong>r</strong> where ω^2 = k/m = GM/R^3</p>
<p>ω is the angular frequency of such a system, and is also given by ω = 2π/T where T is the period of oscillation. </p>
<p>Given those equations, we can calculate T to be:</p>
<p>T = 2π(R^(3)/GM)^(1/2) ~= 84 minutes. </p>
<p>That's the time it takes to fall right through the earth and come back to its starting position. Coincidentally, that's also the time it takes to make a full orbit at the surface of the earth (it's not exactly a coincidence, since simple harmonic motion along one axis is simply circular motion projected onto that axis).</p>
<p>Since there is no air resistance, the ball will fall right through to the other side, reverse direction, then fall back to its starting point indefinitely in simple harmonic motion. </p>
<p>If there is air resistance, the amplitude of this oscillation will decay exponentially and eventually the ball will come to a rest at the centre of the earth. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surprise answer: if there is air in the pipe, the ball will not make it to the center of the Earth because at some point (probably in the mantle) it will float on the increasingly dense air in the pipe! The air will not just provide resistance; it will provide buoyancy as well.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>First, our assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The air in the pipe is open to the free atmosphere and is therefore at 1 bar at sea level, and follows the ideal gas law at the depths that we're looking at.</li>
<li>The pipe is strong enough to withstand the crushing pressures of the deep Earth (which will be higher than the air pressure, at least in the depths we're looking at).</li>
<li>The air in the pipe is somewhere between atmospheric temperature and the temperature of the rock right next to it. Let's be generous and say that the air is at the temperature of the rock. Most importantly, the air can't be way, way hotter than the surrounding rock.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just like ordinary holes in the ground like mines or caves, air pressure will increase exponentially the farther down you go according to p = 101 kPa * e^(z/H), where z is the depth and H is the &quot;scale height&quot; of the atmosphere. H is proportional to absolute temperature (H = R_air*T/g); in the atmosphere H is around 8 km, but in the mantle T might be around 2500 K, so H would be around 73 km. <em>(R_air is the gas constant for air that shows up in the ideal gas law, about 287 J/(kg*K).)</em> Let's be generous and assume H = 73 km everywhere. g, the gravitational acceleration, varies with depth within the Earth, but we're looking at relatively shallow depths (around 10%) so let's assume g is constant.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So, p = 101 kPa * e\^(z/70 km), and from the ideal gas law, <em>density</em> <em>= p/(R_air*T)</em> = 101 kPa/(R_air * 2500 K) * e^(z/70 km)= 0.14 kg/m^(3) * e^(z/70 km). This means that the air becomes denser than a baseball (\~650 kg/m^(3)) around 600 km depth, and denser than a bowling ball (\~1300 kg/m^(3)) around 650 km depth (for reference, the outer core is at about 2900 km and the center of the Earth is at \~6370 km) (which quite shallow in the mantle). At this depth, the ball will be of neutral buoyancy; it will sink a little beyond that depth due to its momentum but then rebound to its equilibrium position, just like a piece of wood tossed into a pond.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you somehow managed to keep the air temperature at a normal surface temperature (say, 17 deg C), the air would be way denser all the way down the pipe and the ball would start floating between 50-60 km depth.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If we really want to dig into this question (pun absolutely intended) more than other answers, we need to start thinking about how and why this pipe exists. The pressure on the pipe would be extreme, not to mention it would have to survive the heat of Earth's core. If the pipe conducts heat, the air in the tunnel would get extremely warm and flow outwards while at the same time cold air would try to get in. Would we get a wind blowing in a single direction (say from north to south) or would wind fly in two &quot;lanes&quot;? Probably depends on the size of the tunnel, but I'm not too familiar with the physics here.</p>
<p>Another question I have is, depending on the width of the pipe, a large amount of air would go into the tunnel, reducing the amount of air in the atmosphere. Would this have a noticeable effect if for example the pipe was 1 m in diameter?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Really, core operating system components, like drivers and kernels specifically are really hard to update without a reboot. Many systems, especially all in one type things (like a PS4) are configured to just always reboot after an update in case such a thing was updated. It makes it so the developer doesn't need to figure out what exactly needs to be restarted, and if it can be restarted. It also minimized testing because they can test the final configuration, after power off, and don't need to verify it works without a reboot.</p>
<p>As for why core drivers are difficult to update, basically a driver needs to keep track of the state of it's associated hardware and respond to it in a timely manner. For example a keyboard has a caps lock, when caps lock is on you expect the letters to work different than when it's off. The keyboard might not actually have a feature to tell the computer if it's on or off, just if you pressed it or not. It's up to the driver to figure it out. Now reloading a running program is possible, but you need to know where in the code it is so you can stop it and start the new program in the same spot. Ideally the memory locations will be the same between old and new, and you can just transfer the memory. In real life, people program in high level languages which auto-allocate that stuff, so everything is practically scrambled. Also, the update might have deleted the spot the old code was at so you might not be able to transfer the running code. And further there is a chance that if it's a driver it never supported the new feature (for example number lock), so adding the number lock will result in an unknown state. Things get even more complicated when you talk about other things using the driver (think about a network card adding a feature while some other program is using it, how does the old program learn about the new feature?).</p>
<p>My example was simple, real drivers are implementing things that take hundreds of pages to describe. The only sure way to do it is write a program that converts between old and new memory, with is about 1000 times more work than it's worth. It's way easier to just say reboot which will pull the reset line on all hardware and set everything to a known state.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not the electronics as such.  It's the software (programs) inside them.  When you turn on the PS4, it loads various programs into its memory, in order to turn a bunch of chips into a working gaming system.  By far the simplest way to update those programs is for the machine to download the new version, store it in place of the old version, and so next time the machine starts up it will load the new version rather than the old one.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In an update you are installing new files in place of old files that are potentially intended to be used in the process(What makes the computer actually do things) that is continuously running. If these files are open and in use, whether through references or as the actual code running, then you cannot replace those files without stopping the process as you cannot read and write at the same time (this ensures data integrity). </p>
<p>Thus the reboot is needed to switch from running the old files in the process to running the new files in the process. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In extreme winds the surface of the water turns to a froth layer a couple of metres thick, &quot;too thin to swim in and too thick to breathe&quot; according to my old oceanography lecturer.  Sea mammals can't breathe would drown.  They may be able to get to land and head inshore. </p>
<p>Things get really bad where the water meets the land.  Here an enormous amount of wave energy gets dissipated destroying all sorts of stuff.  Many thing die.</p>
<p>Sea birds can't cope with this very well.  Old Navy sailor friend told me that you know when you are in a really bad storm when an albatross lands on the deck. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on if it is sessile (attached) or mobile, and a dozen other factors. In Florida Bay, we tend to see the water literally get sucked out between the Florida Keys if the storm passes to the west. This exposes everything on the bottom and, if it’s long enough, itlll die. </p>
<p>We saw massive sponge die offs due to this [ETA: after Irma]. Hurricanes also move a ton of sentiment at times, which can scour the bottom life, or bury it, or just remain suspended and “choke out” corals and sponges and sea grasses by denying their ability to photosynthesize or suspension feed efficiently. </p>
<p>There were many reports of small fish kills due to surge pushing them up on land, again these were mostly the little critters that hide near the bottom nearshore (catfish, pin fish, sea horses, etc), not so much larger snapper or tuna or things like that. Lots of conch, sea stars, urchins, etc were washed ashore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, depression is associated with low levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin in certain parts of the brain. Having a balance of each is essential to “normal” functioning. Antidepressants such as SSRIs handle the serotonin, MAOIs prevent the breakdown of dopamine, and tricyclic antidepressants help balance both serotonin and norepinephrine.</p>
<p>Think of dopamine as the brain’s motivation and reward-seeking neurotransmitter. We need it to put effort into life goals and to also feel rewarded from achieving goals and positive feedback from the environment. Too little dopamine=little/no motivation and pleasure seeking.</p>
<p>Norepinephrine can be loosely thought of as adrenaline. We need it for attention, awareness, and responding. Similar to those with ADHD, people with depression may also have low levels of norepinephrine, and experience similar problems with attention and concentration. “Pseudodementia,” for example, refers to the attention and memory impairments caused by depression that would otherwise seem like dementia.</p>
<p>Serotonin does a lot of different things, but in terms of depression, serotonin is responsible for balancing mood, appetite, sex drive, sociability, sleep, etc. Depressed people with low serotonin levels usually have problems with eating too much/little, sleeping too much/little, not wanting to even get out of bed most days.</p>
<p>In terms of brain structure changes, depression can cause our hippocampus to wither and shrink. This part of our brain is vital for learning and converting short term memory to long term memory. Fortunately, we are able to “exercise” our hippocampus’ back to health (i.e. solving puzzles, spatial awareness activities). This is a big part of why depression includes a lot of problems with thinking speed, concentrating, and recalling memories.</p>
<p>I apologize for no sources. I’m currently an unlicensed psychologist working towards licensure and this is my first ELI5 response.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It appears that there is a lack of neurogenesis -- new neurons being born.  That's stimulated by increased serotonin.  This explains why it takes days for these drugs to work, instead of the hours that it takes most other drugs to work: it takes a while for the new cells to be born and find their way / grow axons in the hippocampus.  It may be that people with fewer neural stem cells or more muck in their brains that prevents axons from growing to the right place are more prone to depression.  </p>
<p>What increases neurogenesis in that brain region besides SSRIs?  Exercise. (At least in rodents) </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a grossly simplified example: imagine your brain is just a neuron that fires if you’re awake and another neuron connected to that one that prompts you to get out of bed. Dopamine/serotonin are the substances that carry the message from your “awake” neuron to your “get up” neuron. The “awake” neuron shoots dopamine/serotonin at the “get up” neuron and then takes the dopamine/serotonin back again afterwards.</p>
<p>Depression is caused by these neurons not having enough dopamine/serotonin or reabsorbing it too quickly to carry the signal from your “awake” neuron to your “get up” neuron meaning you stay in bed all day even though you’re awake (remember this is just a rough simplification). The most common type of antidepressant is called a “selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor” or SSRI. It basically stops your “awake” neuron from stealing back it’s serotonin before it’s finished sending it’s signal, making you more likely to get up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way the brain works is by sending chemical messengers called neurotransmitters between each brain cell or neuron. One of those messengers is called serotonin, and regulates several things in your body like mood, sleep, and appetite. </p>
<p>Depression happens when the brain isn't getting enough serotonin. The most common antidepressants are SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) which essentially stop serotonin from being reabsorbed by the brain, therefore allowing there to be more of it working.</p>
<p>Of course it's more complicated than that, but that is the general science behind it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
